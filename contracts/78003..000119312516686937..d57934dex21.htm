Agreement are defined in Exhibit A.

RECITALS

 

A. Parent has agreed to cause Purchaser to commence a cash tender offer (as it
may be amended from time to time as permitted under this Agreement, the "
_Offer_ ") to acquire all of the outstanding shares of common stock, $0.01 par
value per share, of the Company (the " _Shares_ ") for $81.50 per share (such
amount, or any higher amount per share paid pursuant to the Offer, and as may
be adjusted in accordance with Section 1.1(g), being the " _Offer Price_ "),
net to the seller in cash, without interest, upon the terms and subject to the
conditions of this Agreement.

B. As soon as practicable following the consummation of the Offer, Purchaser
will be merged with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ "), with the Company

subsidiary of Parent (the " _Surviving Corporation_ "), on the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, whereby (i) each
issued and outstanding Share as of the Effective Time (other than Excluded

Offer Price, in cash, without interest, and (ii) the Company shall become a
wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent as a result of the Merger.

the Merger, are fair to, and in the best interest of, the Company and its
stockholders, (ii) declared it advisable to enter into this Agreement, (iii)

Board Recommendation_ "), in each case, on the terms and subject to the
conditions of this Agreement.

D. The board of directors of each of Parent and Purchaser have approved this
Agreement and declared it advisable for Parent and Purchaser, respectively, to

1\. AGREEMENT

 

The Parties to this Agreement, intending to be legally bound, agree as
follows:

 



   SECTION 1. | THE OFFER 
---|--- 

1.1 The Offer.

 

(a) Commencement of the Offer. Provided that this Agreement shall not have
been terminated in accordance with Section 8, as promptly as practicable
after the date of this Agreement but in no event more than seven (7) business
days after the date of this Agreement, Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause
Purchaser to) commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange
Act) the Offer to purchase all of the outstanding Shares at a price per Share
equal to the Offer Price, net to the seller in cash, without interest.

 

(b) Terms and Conditions of the Offer. The obligations of Purchaser to, and of
Parent to cause Purchaser to, accept for payment, and pay for, any Shares
tendered pursuant to the Offer are subject only to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, including the prior satisfaction of the Minimum Condition, the
Termination Condition, and the other conditions set forth in Annex I
(collectively, the " _Offer Conditions_ "). The Offer shall be made by means
of an offer to purchase (the " _Offer to Purchase_ ") that contains the terms
set forth in this Agreement, the Minimum Condition, the Termination Condition
and the other Offer Conditions. Purchaser expressly reserves the right to (i)
increase the Offer Price, (ii) waive any Offer Condition and (iii) make any
other changes in the terms and conditions of the Offer not inconsistent with
the terms of this Agreement; _provided, however,_ that notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, without the prior
written consent of the Company, Parent and Purchaser shall not (A) decrease
the Offer Price, (B) change the form of consideration payable in the Offer,
(C) decrease the maximum number of Shares sought to be purchased in the Offer,
(D) impose conditions or requirements to the Offer in addition to the
Offer Conditions, (E) amend, change or waive the Minimum Condition,
Termination Condition or conditions "(d)" and "(f)" set forth in Annex I, (F)
except as provided in Sections 1.1(c) or 1.1(d), terminate the Offer
or accelerate, extend or otherwise change the Expiration Date, (G) provide
any "subsequent offering period" (or any extension thereof) within the meaning
of Rule 14d-11 promulgated under the Exchange Act or (H) otherwise modify or
amend any of the other terms of the Offer in a manner that adversely affects,
or reasonably could be expected to adversely affect, any holder of Shares.

 

(c) Expiration and Extension of the Offer. The Offer shall initially be
scheduled to expire at one minute after 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, on the date
that is twenty (20) business days (calculated as set forth in Rule 14d-1(g)(3)
promulgated under the Exchange Act) following the Offer Commencement Date
(unless otherwise agreed to in writing by Parent and the Company) (the "
_Initial Expiration Date,_ " and such date or such subsequent date to which
the Initial Expiration Date of the Offer is extended in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement, the " _Expiration Date_ "). Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained in this Agreement, but subject to the Parties
respective termination rights under Section 8: (i) Purchaser shall, and Parent
shall cause Purchaser to, extend the Offer from time to time for any period
required by any Legal Requirement, any interpretation or position of the SEC,
the  staff thereof or NASDAQ applicable to the Offer; and (ii) if, as of the
then-scheduled Expiration Date, any Offer Condition is not satisfied and has
not been waived by Purchaser or Parent, to the extent waivable by Purchaser
or Parent, Purchaser shall, and Parent shall cause Purchaser to extend the
Offer on one or more occasions for an additional period of up to ten (10)
business days per extension to permit such Offer Condition to be satisfied;
_provided, however,_ that in no event shall Purchaser: (1) be required to
extend the Offer beyond the earlier to occur of (the " _Extension Deadline_ ")
(x) the valid termination of this Agreement in compliance with Section 8 and
(y) the first business day immediately following the End Date; or (2) be
permitted to extend the Offer beyond the Extension Deadline without the prior
written consent of the Company. Purchaser shall not terminate the Offer,
or permit the Offer to expire, prior to the Extension Deadline without the
prior written consent of the Company.

(d) Termination of Offer. In the event that this Agreement is validly
terminated pursuant to Section 8, Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause
Purchaser to) immediately, irrevocably and unconditionally terminate the Offer
and shall not acquire any Shares pursuant to the Offer. If the Offer is
terminated or withdrawn by Purchaser in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, Purchaser shall immediately return, and shall cause any depository
acting on behalf of Purchaser to return, in accordance with applicable Legal
Requirements, all tendered Shares to the registered holders thereof.

(e) Offer Documents. As promptly as practicable on the date of commencement
of the Offer (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act), Parent
and Purchaser shall (i) file with the SEC a tender offer statement on Schedule
TO with respect to the Offer (together with all amendments and supplements
thereto and including exhibits thereto, the " _Schedule TO_ ") that will
contain or incorporate by reference the Offer to Purchase and form of the
related letter of transmittal and (ii) cause the Offer to Purchase and
related documents to be disseminated to holders of Shares. Parent and
Purchaser agree that they shall cause the Schedule TO and all exhibits,
amendments or supplements thereto (which together constitute the "
_Offer Documents_ ") filed by either Parent or Purchaser with the SEC (x) to
comply in all material respects with the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder and other applicable Legal Requirements and (y) to not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that no covenant is made by Parent
or Purchaser with respect to information supplied by or on behalf of the
Company for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Offer Documents.
Each of Parent, Purchaser and the Company agrees to promptly correct any
information provided by it for use in the Offer Documents if and to the extent
that such information shall have become false or misleading in any material
respect, and Parent further agrees to take all steps necessary to cause the
Offer Documents as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and to be
disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case, as and to the extent required
by applicable federal securities laws. The Company shall promptly furnish or
otherwise make available to Parent and Purchaser or Parents legal counsel
all information concerning the Company and the Companys stockholders that may
be required in connection with any action contemplated by this Section 1.1(e).
The Company and its counsel shall be given reasonable opportunity to review
and comment on the Offer Documents (including any response to any comments
(including oral comments) of the SEC or its staff with respect thereto) prior
to the filing thereof with the SEC, and Parent and Purchaser shall give
reasonable  and good faith consideration to any such comments made by the Company or its
counsel. Parent and Purchaser agree to provide the Company and its counsel
with any comments Parent, Purchaser or their counsel may receive from the SEC
or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents promptly after receipt of
those comments (including oral comments). Each of Parent and Purchaser shall
respond promptly to any comments (including oral comments) of the SEC or its
staff with respect to the Offer Documents or the Offer.

(f) Funds. Without limiting the generality of Section 9.11, Parent shall
deposit, or shall cause to be deposited with the Paying Agent, concurrently
with or promptly following the Offer Acceptance Time, all of the funds
necessary to purchase all Shares that Purchaser becomes obligated to purchase
pursuant to the Offer, and shall cause Purchaser to perform, on a timely
basis, all of Purchasers obligations under this Agreement. Parent and
Purchaser shall, and each of Parent and Purchaser shall ensure that all
of their respective Affiliates shall, tender any Shares held by them into the
Offer.

(g) Adjustments. If, between the date of this Agreement and the Offer
Acceptance Time, the outstanding Shares are changed into a different number or
class of shares by reason of any stock split, division or subdivision of
shares, stock dividend, reverse stock split, consolidation of shares,
reclassification, recapitalization or other similar transaction, then the
Offer Price shall be appropriately adjusted.

(h) Acceptance. Subject only to the satisfaction or, to the extent waivable
by Purchaser or Parent, waiver by Purchaser or Parent of each of the Offer
Conditions, Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to) (i)
promptly after (and in any event no later than the first business day after)
the Expiration Date accept for payment all Shares tendered (and not validly
withdrawn) pursuant to the Offer (the time of such acceptance, the " _Offer
Acceptance Time_ ") and (ii) promptly after (and in any event no later than
the third business day after) the Expiration Date pay for such Shares.

 

1.2 Company Actions.

 

(a) Schedule 14D-9. As promptly as practicable on the day that the Offer is
commenced, following the filing of the Schedule TO, the Company shall file
with the SEC and disseminate to holders of Shares, in each case, as and to the
extent required by applicable federal securities laws, a Tender Offer
Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 (together with any
exhibits, amendments or supplements thereto, the " _Schedule 14D-9_ ") that,
subject to Section 6.1(b), shall reflect the Company Board Recommendation. The
Company agrees that it shall cause the Schedule 14D-9 (i) to comply in all
material respects with the Exchange Act and other applicable Legal
Requirements and (ii) to not contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading; _provided_ , _however_ , that no
covenant is made by the Company with respect to information supplied by or on
behalf of Parent or Purchaser for inclusion or incorporation by reference in
the Schedule 14D-9. Each of Parent, Purchaser and the Company agrees to
respond promptly to any comments of the SEC or its staff and to promptly
correct any information provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and
to the extent that such information shall have become false or misleading in
any material respect, and the Company  further agrees to take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9 as so
corrected to be filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to holders of
Shares, in each case, as and to the extent required by applicable federal
securities laws, including by setting the Stockholder List Date as the record
date for the purpose of receiving the notice required by Section 262(d) of the
DGCL. Parent and its counsel shall be given reasonable opportunity to review
and comment on the Schedule 14D-9 and any amendment thereto (including any
response to any comments (including oral comments) of the SEC or its staff
with respect thereto) prior to the filing thereof with the SEC and
the Company shall give reasonable and good faith consideration to any such
comments made by Parent or its counsel. The Company agrees to provide Parent
and its counsel with any comments (including oral comments) the Company or its
counsel may receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule
14D-9 promptly after receipt of those comments (including oral comments). The
Company shall respond promptly to any comments of the SEC or its staff with
respect to the Schedule 14D-9.

(b) Stockholder Lists. From time to time as requested by Purchaser or its
agents, the Company shall promptly furnish Purchaser with a list of its
stockholders, mailing labels and any available listing or computer file
containing the names and addresses of all record holders of Shares and lists
of securities positions of Shares held in stock depositories, in each case,
accurate and complete as of the most recent practicable date, and shall
provide to Purchaser additional information (including updated lists of
stockholders, mailing labels and lists of securities positions) and other
assistance as Purchaser may reasonably request in connection with the Offer
(the date of the list used to determine the Persons to whom the Offer
Documents and Schedule 14D-9 are first disseminated, the " _Stockholder
List Date_ "). Parent and Purchaser and their agents shall hold in confidence
the information contained in any such labels, listings and files, shall use
such information only in connection with the Offer and the Merger and, if
this Agreement shall be terminated, shall, upon request by the Company,
deliver, and shall use their reasonable efforts to cause their agents to
deliver, to the Company (or destroy) all copies and any extracts or summaries
from such information then in their possession or control, and, if requested
by the Company, promptly certify to the Company in writing that all such
material has been returned or destroyed.

organizational documents of the Surviving Corporation and each of the other
Acquired Corporations shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect
to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of individuals

bylaws and other charter and organizational documents of the Surviving
Corporation and each of the other Acquired  Corporations, as amended through the Effective Time, which provisions shall
not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would
adversely affect the rights thereunder of any such individuals.

2.5 Conversion of Shares.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further
action on the part of Parent, Purchaser, the Company or any stockholder of
the Company:

(i) any Shares held immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Company (or
held in the Companys treasury) shall be cancelled and retired and shall
cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor;

 

(ii) any Shares held immediately prior to the Effective Time by Parent,
Purchaser or any other direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent
shall be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration
shall be delivered in exchange therefor;

 

(iii) except as provided in clauses "(i)" and "(ii)" above and subject to
Section 2.5(b), each Share then outstanding (other than any Dissenting
Shares), together with the associated Stock Purchase Rights, if any, issued
pursuant to the Company Rights Plan, shall be converted into the right to
receive the Offer Price, net to the seller in cash, without interest (the "
_Merger Consideration_ "), subject to any withholding of Taxes in accordance
with Section 2.6(e); and

 

(iv) each share of the common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of Purchaser
then outstanding shall be converted into one share of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation.

(b) If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the
outstanding Shares are changed into a different number or class of shares by
reason of any stock split, division or subdivision of shares, stock dividend,
reverse stock split, consolidation of shares, reclassification,
recapitalization or other similar transaction, then the Merger Consideration
shall be appropriately adjusted.

2.6 Surrender of Certificates; Stock Transfer Books.

(a) Prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, Parent shall designate a bank or trust
company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as agent (the "
_Depository Agent_ ") for the holders of Shares to receive the funds to which
holders of such shares shall become entitled pursuant to Section 1.1(b) and to
act as agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ") for the holders of Shares to receive
the funds to which holders of such shares shall become entitled pursuant to
Section 2.5. Concurrently with or promptly following the Offer Acceptance
Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with the
Depository Agent cash sufficient to make payment of the cash consideration
payable pursuant to Section 1.1(b) and with the Paying Agent cash sufficient
to make payment of the cash consideration payable pursuant to Section 2.5
(together, the " _Payment Fund_ "). The Payment Fund shall not be used for any
other purpose. The Payment Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent as
directed by the Surviving Corporation; _provided_  that such investments
shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America in  commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors
Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively, in certificates
of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial
banks with capital exceeding $1 billion, or in money market funds having a
rating in the highest investment category granted by a recognized credit
rating agency at the time of acquisition or a combination of the foregoing
and, in any such case, no such instrument shall have a maturity exceeding
three (3) months.

 

(b) Promptly after the Effective Time (but in no event later than five (5)
business days thereafter), the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be mailed
to each Person who was, at the Effective Time, a holder of record of the
Shares entitled to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.5 a
form of letter of transmittal (which shall be in reasonable and customary
form and shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the certificates evidencing such shares (the " _Certificates_ ")
shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates (or effective
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to the Paying Agent) and instructions for
use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
pursuant to such letter of transmittal. Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of
Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry
Shares, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly
executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents
as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor the Merger Consideration for each Share formerly evidenced by such
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, and such Certificates and Book-Entry
Shares shall then be cancelled. No interest shall accrue or be paid on the
Merger Consideration payable upon the surrender of any Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares for the benefit of the holder thereof. If the payment of
any Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in
whose name the surrendered Certificates formerly evidencing the Shares is
registered on the stock transfer books of the Company, it shall be a condition
of payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be endorsed properly or
otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such
payment shall have paid all transfer and other similar Taxes required by
reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the
registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or shall have established to
the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Taxes either have been
paid or are not applicable. Payment of the applicable Merger Consideration
with respect to Book-Entry Shares shall only be made to the Person in whose
name such Book-Entry Shares are registered.

 

(c) At any time following twelve (12) months after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to
deliver to it any funds which had been made available to the Paying Agent and
not disbursed to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares (including all
interest and other income received by the Paying Agent in respect of all
funds made available to it), and, thereafter, such holders shall be entitled
to look to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat
and other similar Legal Requirements) only as general creditors thereof with
respect to the Merger Consideration that may be payable upon due surrender of
the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares held by them. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, neither the Surviving Corporation nor the Paying Agent shall be
liable to any holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for the Merger
Consideration delivered in respect of such share to a public official pursuant
to any abandoned property, escheat or other similar Legal Requirements. Any
amounts remaining unclaimed by such holders at such time at  which such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any
Governmental Body shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable Legal
Requirements, the property of the Surviving Corporation or its designee, free
and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

(d) Prior to the open of business on the day of the Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of the Company with respect to the Shares shall be closed and
thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares on
the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of
the Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to
have any rights with respect to such Shares except as otherwise provided
herein or by applicable Legal Requirements.

(e) Each of the Company, Parent, Purchaser and Surviving Corporation shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold (or cause the Paying Agent to deduct and
withhold) from any amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as
it is required by any Legal Requirement to deduct and withhold with respect to
Taxes. Each such payor shall take all action that may be necessary to ensure
that any such amounts so withheld are promptly and properly remitted to the
appropriate Governmental Body. To the extent that amounts are so deducted and
withheld and timely remitted to the appropriate Governmental Body (including
amounts deducted and withheld with respect to amounts paid in accordance with
Section 2.8(f)), such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction
and withholding was made.

(f) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder of the Shares formerly
represented by that Certificate, or by a representative of that holder,
claiming that Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
the Surviving Corporation, the posting by that holder of a bond, in such
reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that
may be made against it with respect to such Certificate (which shall not
exceed the Merger Consideration payable with respect to such Certificate),
the Paying Agent will pay (less any amounts entitled to be deducted or
withheld pursuant to Section 2.6(e)), in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate, the applicable Merger Consideration to be paid in
respect of the Shares formerly represented by such Certificate, as
contemplated by this Section 2.

2.7 Dissenters Rights. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, and held
by holders who are entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL
and have properly exercised and perfected their respective demands for
appraisal of such Shares in the time and manner provided in Section 262 of the
DGCL and, as of the Effective Time, have neither effectively withdrawn nor
lost their rights to such appraisal and payment under the DGCL (the "
_Dissenting Shares_ "), shall not be converted into the right to receive
Merger Consideration, but shall, by virtue of the Merger, be entitled to only
such consideration as shall be determined pursuant to Section 262 of the
DGCL; _provided_ that if any such holder shall have failed to perfect or shall
have effectively withdrawn or lost such holders right to appraisal and
payment under the DGCL, such holders Shares shall be deemed to have been
converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration (less any amounts entitled to be deducted or withheld pursuant
to Section 2.6(e)), and such shares shall not be deemed to be
Dissenting Shares. The Company shall give Parent  prompt notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of
Shares. The Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent,
make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such
demands. The Company shall provide each of the holders of Shares with the
notice required by Section 262 of the DGCL with the notice contemplated
thereby as part of the Schedule 14D-9.

 

2.8 Treatment of Company Options, Company SARs, Company RSUs, Company PSUs,
and Company Restricted Shares.

 

(a) Each Company Option that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall accelerate and become fully vested and exercisable

the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further action on
the part of the holders thereof, Parent, Purchaser or the Company,
each Company Option that is then outstanding and unexercised shall be
cancelled and converted into the right to receive cash in an amount equal to
the product of (i) the total number of Shares subject to such fully vested
Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, multiplied by (ii)
the excess, if any, of (x) the Merger Consideration over (y) the exercise
price payable per Share under such Company Option, which amount shall be paid
in accordance with Section 2.8(f).

(b) Each Company SAR that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall accelerate and become fully vested and exercisable
effective immediately prior to, and contingent upon, the Effective Time. As of
the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further action on
the part of the holders thereof, Parent, Purchaser or the Company, each
Company SAR that is then outstanding and unexercised shall be cancelled and
converted into the right to receive cash in an amount equal to the product of
(i) the total number of Shares subject to such fully vested Company SAR
immediately prior to the Effective Time, multiplied by (ii) the excess, if
any, of (x) the Merger Consideration over (y) the base price per Share covered
by such Company SAR, which amount shall be paid in accordance with Section
2.8(f).

(c) Each Company RSU that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall accelerate and become fully vested effective immediately
prior to, and contingent upon, the Effective Time. In lieu of any issuance of
Shares in settlement of such vested Company RSU, as of the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any further action on the part of the
holders thereof, Parent, Purchaser or the Company, each Company RSU that is
outstanding shall be cancelled and converted into the right to receive cash in
an amount equal to the product of (i) the total number of Shares issuable in
settlement of such fully vested Company RSU immediately prior to the Effective
Time, multiplied by (ii) the Merger Consideration, which amount shall be paid
in accordance with Section 2.8(f).

 

(d) Each Company PSU that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall accelerate and become fully vested with respect to the
number of Shares based on deemed satisfaction of all applicable performance
goals at the maximum levels effective immediately prior to, and contingent
upon, the Effective Time. In lieu of any issuance of Shares in settlement
of such vested Company PSU, as of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any further action on the part of the holders thereof, Parent,
Purchaser or  the Company, each Company PSU that is outstanding shall be cancelled and
converted into the right to receive cash in an amount equal to the product of
(i) the total number of Shares issuable in settlement of such fully vested
Company PSU immediately prior to the Effective Time, multiplied by (ii) the
Merger Consideration, which amount shall be paid in accordance with Section
2.8(f).

 

(e) Each Company Restricted Share that is outstanding and unvested as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, as of the Effective Time, be
cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to
the Merger Consideration, which amount shall be paid in accordance with
Section 2.8(f).

 

(f) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (but no later
than the earlier of (x) five (5) days after the Effective Time and (y) the
second payroll date after the Effective Time), the Surviving Corporation shall
pay the amounts provided for in Sections 2.8(a)-(e), net of any applicable
withholding Taxes, payable with respect to Company Options, Company
SARs, Company RSUs, Company PSUs and Company Restricted Shares through, to
the extent applicable, the Surviving Corporations payroll to the holders of
Company Options, Company SARs, Company RSUs, Company PSUs and Company
Restricted Shares;  _provided_ , _however_ , that to the extent that any such
Company RSU or Company PSU constitutes nonqualified deferred compensation
subject to Section 409A of the Code, such cash payment shall be paid in
accordance with the applicable awards terms and at the earliest time
permitted under the terms of such award that will not result in the
application of a tax or penalty under Section 409A of the Code.

 

(g) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions (including
obtaining any necessary determinations and/or resolutions of the Company
Board or a committee thereof) that may be necessary to effectuate the
provisions of this Section 2.8 and terminate all rights under any Company
Equity Plan effective as of, and contingent upon, the Effective Time.

 

2.9 Further Action. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further
action is reasonably determined by Parent to be necessary or desirable to
carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation
with full right, title and possession of and to all rights and property of
Purchaser and the Company, the officers and directors of the
Surviving Corporation and Parent shall be fully authorized (in the name of
Purchaser, in the name of the Company and otherwise) to take such action.

Company, directly or indirectly, beneficially and of record, free and clear of
all Encumbrances and transfer restrictions, except for such Encumbrances and

(a) Since January 1, 2015, the Company has filed or furnished on a timely
basis all reports, schedules, forms, statements and other documents
(including exhibits and all other information incorporated therein) required
to be filed or furnished by the Company with the SEC (as supplemented,
modified or amended since the time of filing, the " _Company SEC Documents_
"). As of their respective dates, the Company SEC Documents complied in all
material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange
Act or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as the case may be, and the rules
and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder applicable to those Company
SEC Documents and, except to the extent that information contained in a
Company SEC Document has been revised, amended, modified or superseded (prior
to the date of this Agreement) by a later filed Company SEC Document, none of
the Company SEC Documents when filed or furnished contained any untrue
statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

(b) The consolidated financial statements (including any related notes and
schedules) contained or incorporated by reference in the Company SEC
Documents: (i) complied as to form in all material respects with the published
rules and regulations of the SEC applicable thereto; (ii) were prepared in
accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles ("
_GAAP_ ") applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods covered (except
as may be indicated in the notes to such financial statements or as permitted
by Regulation S-X, or, in the case of unaudited financial statements, as
permitted by Form 10-Q, Form 8-K or any successor form under the Exchange
Act); and (iii) fairly present, in all material respects, the financial
position of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of the respective
dates thereof and the results of operations and cash flows of the Company and
its consolidated Subsidiaries for the periods covered thereby (subject, in
the case of the unaudited financial statements, to normal and recurring year-
end adjustments that are not, individually or in the aggregate, material). No
financial statements of any Person other than the Company are required by
GAAP to be included in the consolidated financial statements of the Company.

(c) The Company maintains, and at all times since January 1, 2015 has
maintained, a system of internal controls over financial reporting (as defined
in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) which is designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with GAAP, and includes those policies and procedures that: (i)
pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately
and fairly reflect the  transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP and that receipts
and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use or disposition of the assets of the Company that could have a
material effect on the financial statements. The Companys management has
completed an assessment of the effectiveness of the Companys system of
internal controls over financial reporting in compliance with the requirements
of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the fiscal year ended December
31, 2015, and, except as set forth in the Company SEC Documents filed prior to
the date of this Agreement, that assessment concluded that those controls
were effective. To the knowledge of the Company, except as set forth in the
Company SEC Documents filed prior to the date of this Agreement, since January
1, 2015, neither the Company nor the Companys independent registered
accountant has identified or been made aware of: (1) any significant
deficiency or material weakness in the design or operation of internal control
over financial reporting utilized by the Company which is reasonably likely
to adversely affect the Companys ability to record, process, summarize and
report financial information; or (2) any fraud, whether or not material, that
involves the management or other employees of the Acquired Corporations who
have a significant role in the Companys internal control over financial
reporting.

(d) The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures as defined in
and required by Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act that are reasonably
designed to ensure that all information required to be disclosed in the
Companys reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in the rules and forms of the SEC and that all such information is accumulated
and communicated to the Companys management as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure and to enable each of the principal
executive officer of the Company and the principal financial officer of the
Company to make the certifications required under the Exchange Act with
respect to such reports.

(e) Neither the Company nor any Acquired Corporation is a party to or has any
obligation or other commitment to become a party to "off-balance sheet
arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K under the Exchange
Act) where the purpose or intended effect of such Contract is to avoid
disclosure of any material transaction involving, or material liabilities of,
the Company or any Acquired Corporation in the Company SEC Documents.

(f) As of the date of this Agreement, there are no outstanding or unresolved
comments in comment letters received from the SEC with respect to the Company
SEC Documents. To the knowledge of the Company, none of the Company SEC
Documents is the subject of ongoing SEC review and there are no inquiries or
investigations by the SEC or any internal investigations pending or
threatened, in each case, regarding any accounting practices of the Company.

 

(g) Each document required to be filed by the Company with the SEC in
connection with the Offer (the " _Company Disclosure Documents_ ") (including
the Schedule 14D-9), and any amendments or supplements thereto, when filed,
distributed or otherwise  disseminated to the Companys stockholders, as applicable, will comply as to
form in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Exchange
Act. The Company Disclosure Documents, at the time of the filing of such
Company Disclosure Documents or any supplement or amendment thereto with the
SEC and at the time such Company Disclosure Documents or any supplements or
amendments thereto are first distributed or otherwise disseminated to the
Companys stockholders, will not contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the
statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading.

(h) The information with respect to the Company that the Company furnishes to
Parent or Purchaser in writing specifically for use in the Schedule TO and
the Offer Documents, at the time of the filing of the Schedule TO and at the
time of any distribution or dissemination of the Offer Documents, will not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

 

(i) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company makes no representation with
respect to statements made or incorporated by reference therein based on
information supplied by or on behalf of Parent or Purchaser for inclusion or

Proposal, (B) engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions
or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any other Person any non-public
information in connection with or for the purpose of knowingly encouraging or
facilitating, an Acquisition Proposal or any  proposal or offer that could reasonably be expected to lead to an
Acquisition Proposal or (C) enter into any letter of intent, acquisition
agreement, agreement in principle or similar agreement with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal or any proposal or offer that could reasonably be
expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall, on the date
hereof, terminate access by any third party to any data room (virtual or
actual) containing any of the Companys confidential information. Within three
(3) business days from the date hereof, the Company shall request the return
or destruction of all confidential, non-public information provided to
third parties prior to the date hereof that have, since January 1, 2015
entered into confidentiality agreements relating to a possible Acquisition
Proposal with any of the Acquired Corporations.

 

(c) If at any time on or after the date of this Agreement and prior to the
Offer Acceptance Time any Acquired Corporation or any of their
Representatives receive an unsolicited _bona fide_ written Acquisition
Proposal from any Person or group of Persons, which Acquisition Proposal was
made or renewed on or after the date of this Agreement and did not result from
any breach of this Section 5.3, (i) the Company and its Representatives may
contact such Person or group of Persons to clarify the terms and conditions
thereof and (ii) if the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such
Acquisition Proposal constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to a
Superior Offer, then the Company and its Representatives may (x) furnish,
pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, information (including
non-public information) with respect to the Acquired Corporations to the
Person or group of Persons who has made such Acquisition Proposal; _provided_
that the Company shall as promptly as practicable (and no later than within
48 hours) provide to Parent any non-public information concerning the Acquired
Corporations that is provided to any Person given such access which was not
previously provided to Parent or its Representatives and (y) engage in
or otherwise participate in discussions or negotiations with the Person or
group of Persons making such Acquisition Proposal.

(d) Following the date of this Agreement, the Company shall (i) promptly (and
in any event within 48 hours after knowledge of receipt by an executive
officer or director of the Company) notify Parent if any inquiries, proposals
or offers with respect to an Acquisition Proposal are received by any
Acquired Corporation, (ii) with respect to an Acquisition Proposal provide to
Parent, the identity of the Person or Group making such Acquisition Proposal
and a copy of the Acquisition Proposal or, if not in writing, a summary of
the material terms and conditions of any Acquisition Proposal, (iii) keep
Parent reasonably informed of any material developments, discussions or
negotiations regarding any Acquisition Proposal on a prompt basis and
(iv) upon the request of Parent, reasonably inform Parent of the status of
such Acquisition Proposal.

(e) Nothing in this Section 5.3 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall prohibit
the Company from (i) taking and disclosing to the stockholders of the Company
a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of
Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act, (ii) making any disclosure
to the stockholders of the Company that is required by applicable Legal
Requirements or (iii) making any "stop, look and listen" communication
pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act, provided,
however, that this Section 5.3(e) shall not be deemed to permit the Company
Board to make a Company Adverse Change Recommendation except to the extent
permitted by Section 6.1(b). ---|--- 

6.1 Company Board Recommendation. 

(a) The Company represents that the Company Board, at a meeting duly called
and held, has made the Company Board Recommendation. Subject to Section
6.1(b), the Company hereby consents to the inclusion of a description of the
Company Board Recommendation in the Offer Documents. Subject to Section
6.1(b), during the Pre-Closing Period, neither the Company Board nor any
committee thereof shall (i) (A) withdraw (or modify in a manner adverse to
Parent or Purchaser), or publicly propose to withdraw (or modify in a manner
adverse to Parent or Purchaser), the Company Board Recommendation or (B)
approve, recommend or declare advisable, or publicly propose to approve,
recommend or declare advisable, any Acquisition Proposal (any action described
in this clause (i) being referred to as a " _Company Adverse
Change Recommendation_ ") or (ii) approve, recommend or declare advisable, or
propose to approve, recommend or declare advisable, or allow the Company to
execute or enter into any Contract with respect to any Acquisition Proposal
(other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement).

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, at
any time prior to the Offer Acceptance Time:

(i) if the Company has received a _bona fide_ written Acquisition Proposal
from any Person that has not been withdrawn and after consultation with
outside legal counsel, the Company Board shall have determined, in good faith,
that such Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Offer, (x) the Company Board may
make a Company Adverse Change Recommendation, or (y) the Company may
terminate this Agreement to enter into a Specified Agreement with respect to
such Superior Offer, in each case, if and only if: (A) the Company Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with the Companys outside legal
counsel that the failure to do so would reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Company Board to the Companys
stockholders under applicable Legal Requirements; (B) the Company shall have
given Parent prior written notice of its intention to consider making a
Company Adverse Change Recommendation and terminating this Agreement pursuant
to Section 8.1(e) at least three (3) business days prior to making any
such Company Adverse Change Recommendation or termination (a " _Determination
Notice_ ") (which notice shall not constitute a Company Adverse Change
Recommendation or termination); and (C) (1) the Company shall have
provided to Parent the material terms and conditions of the Acquisition
Proposal in accordance with Section 5.3(d), (2) the Company shall have given
Parent the three (3) business days after the Determination Notice to propose
revisions to the terms of this Agreement or make another proposal so that
such Acquisition Proposal would cease to constitute a Superior Offer and (3)
after giving effect to the proposals made by Parent, if any, after
consultation with outside legal counsel, the Company Board shall have
determined, in good faith, that such Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Offer
and that the failure to make the Company Adverse Change Recommendation or
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(e) would reasonably be
expected to be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Company Board to
the  Companys stockholders under applicable Legal Requirements. Issuance of any
"stop, look and listen" communication by or on behalf of the Company pursuant
to Rule 14d-9(f) in compliance with Section 5.3(e) shall not be considered a
Company Adverse Change Recommendation and shall not require the giving of a
Determination Notice or compliance with the procedures set forth in this
Section 6.1. For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of this Section
6.1(b)(i) shall also apply to any material amendment to any Acquisition
Proposal and require a new Determination Notice, except that the references to
three (3) business days shall be deemed to be two (2) business days; and

(ii) other than in connection with an Acquisition Proposal, the Company Board
may make a Company Adverse Change Recommendation in response to a Change in
Circumstance, if and only if: (A) the Company Board determines in good faith,
after consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel, that the failure
to do so would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the fiduciary
duties of the Company Board to the Companys stockholders under applicable
Legal Requirements; (B) the Company shall have given Parent a Determination
Notice at least three (3) business days prior to making any such Company
Adverse Change Recommendation; and (C) (1) the Company shall have specified
the Change in Circumstance in reasonable detail, (2) the Company shall have
given Parent the three (3) business days after the Determination Notice to
propose revisions to the terms of this Agreement or make another proposal so
that such Change in Circumstance would no longer necessitate a Company Adverse
Change Recommendation, and (3) after giving effect to the proposals made by
Parent, if any, after consultation with outside legal counsel, the Company
Board shall have determined, in good faith, that the failure to make the
Company Adverse Change Recommendation in response to such Change in
Circumstance would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the
fiduciary duties of the Company Board to the Companys stockholders under
applicable Legal Requirements. For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of
this Section 6.1(b)(ii) shall also apply to any material change to the facts
and circumstances relating to such Change in Circumstance and require a new
Determination Notice, except that the references to three (3) business days
shall be deemed to be two (2) business days. 

6.2 Filings, Consents and Approvals.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of
the Parties shall use its respective reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions, to file, or cause to be filed, all documents
and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other
Parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable under
applicable Antitrust Laws to consummate and make effective the Transactions
as soon as reasonably practicable, and in any event prior to the End Date,
including (i) the obtaining of all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers,
consents, clearances, decisions, declarations, approvals and, expirations or
terminations of waiting periods from Governmental Bodies and the making of all
necessary registrations and filings and the taking of all steps as may be
necessary to obtain any such consent, decision, declaration, approval,
clearance or waiver, or expiration or termination of a waiting period by or
from, or to avoid an action or proceeding by, any Governmental Body in
connection with any Antitrust Law; (ii) the obtaining of all
necessary consents, authorizations, approvals or waivers from third parties;
and (iii) the execution and delivery of any additional instruments necessary
to consummate the Transactions. (b) By way of illustration and not limitation, the Parties agree to promptly
take, and cause their controlled Affiliates to take, all actions and steps
required by any Governmental Body as a condition to granting any consent,
permit, authorization, waiver, clearance and approvals, and to cause the
timely expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period and to
resolve objections, if any, as the FTC, the DOJ, or other Governmental Bodies
of any other jurisdiction for which consents, permits, authorizations,
waivers, clearances, approvals and expirations or terminations of waiting
periods are sought with respect to the Transactions prior to the End Date, so
as to obtain such consents, permits, authorizations, waivers, clearances,
approvals or termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act or other
Antitrust Laws, and to avoid the commencement of a lawsuit by the FTC, the
DOJ or other Governmental Bodies under Antitrust Laws, and to avoid the entry
of, or to effect the dissolution of, any injunction, temporary restraining
order or other order in any suit or proceeding which would otherwise have the
effect of preventing the Closing or materially delaying the Offer Acceptance
Time or the Closing or delaying the Offer Acceptance Time beyond the End Date,
including (x) negotiating, committing to and effecting, by consent decree,
hold separate order or otherwise, the sale, lease, license, divestiture or
disposition of any assets, rights, product lines, or businesses of Parent,
Purchaser, the Company, or any of their respective Subsidiaries or
Affiliates, and (y) otherwise taking or committing to take any actions with
respect to the businesses, product lines or assets of Parent, Purchaser, the
Company, or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates; _provided_
that the Company and the Acquired Corporations shall only be required to take
or commit to take any such action, or agree to any such condition or
restriction, if such action, commitment, agreement, condition or restriction
is binding on the Company and the Acquired Corporations only in the event the
Closing occurs. The Parties shall defend through litigation on the merits any
claim asserted in court by any party under Antitrust Laws in order to avoid
entry of, or to have vacated or terminated, any decree, order or judgment
(whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) that could restrain, delay, or
prevent the Closing by the End Date; _provided_ that such litigation in no way
limits the obligation of Purchaser and Parent to take all actions and steps
to eliminate each and every impediment identified herein.

(c) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the
Parties shall (and shall cause their respective Affiliates, if applicable,
to): (i) promptly, but in no event later than September 7, 2016 unless the
Parties otherwise agree, make an appropriate filing of all Notification and
Report forms as required by the HSR Act with respect to the Transactions; and
(ii) cooperate with each other in determining whether, and promptly preparing
and making, any other filings or notifications or other consents are required
to be made with, or obtained from, any other Governmental Bodies in
connection with the Transactions.

(d) Without limiting the generality of anything contained in this Section
6.2, during the Pre-Closing Period, each Party hereto shall use its reasonable
best efforts to (i) cooperate in all respects and consult with each other in
connection with any filing or submission in connection with any investigation
or other inquiry, including allowing the other Party to have a reasonable
opportunity to review in advance and comment on drafts of filings and
submissions; (ii) give the other Parties prompt notice of the making or
commencement of any request, inquiry, investigation, action or Legal
Proceeding brought by a Governmental Body or brought by a third party before
any Governmental Body, in each case, with respect to the Transactions, (iii)
keep the other Parties informed as to the status of any such request,  inquiry, investigation, action or Legal Proceeding, (iv) promptly inform the
other Parties of any communication to or from the FTC, DOJ or any other
Governmental Body in connection with any such request, inquiry,
investigation, action or Legal Proceeding, (v) promptly furnish to the other
Party, subject to an appropriate confidentiality agreement to limit disclosure
to outside counsel and consultants retained by such counsel, with copies of
documents provided to or received from any Governmental Body in connection
with any such request, inquiry, investigation, action or Legal Proceeding
(other than Item "4(c)" and "4(d)" documents as those terms are used under
the HSR Act), (vi) consult in advance and cooperate with the other Parties and
consider in good faith the views of the other Parties in connection with any
communication, analysis, appearance, presentation, memorandum,
brief, argument, opinion or proposal to be made or submitted in connection
with any such request, inquiry, investigation, action or Legal Proceeding, and
(vii) except as may be prohibited by any Governmental Body or by any Legal
Requirement, in connection with any such request, inquiry, investigation,
action or Legal Proceeding in respect of the Transactions, each Party hereto
shall provide advance notice of and permit authorized Representatives of the
other Party to be present at each meeting or teleconference relating to such
request, inquiry, investigation, action or Legal Proceeding and to have access
to and be consulted in advance in connection with any argument, opinion or
proposal to be made or submitted to any Governmental Body in connection with
such request, inquiry, investigation, action or Legal Proceeding. Each Party
shall supply as promptly as practicable such information, documentation, other
material or testimony that may be reasonably requested by any Governmental
Body, including by complying at the earliest reasonably practicable date with
any reasonable request for additional information, documents or other
materials received by any Party or any of their respective Subsidiaries from
any Governmental Body in connection with such applications or filings for the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Purchaser shall pay all filing
fees under the HSR Act and for any filings required under foreign Antitrust
Laws. Neither Party shall commit to or agree with any Governmental Body to
stay, toll or extend any applicable waiting period under the HSR Act, or
withdraw any notification filed under the HSR Act, or other applicable
Antitrust Laws, without prior written consent of the other.

(e) Without the prior written approval of the Company, Parent and Purchaser
shall not effect or agree to any business combination (whether structured as
a merger, business combination, tender offer, exchange offer or similar
transaction) or the acquisition of any assets, licenses, rights, product
lines, operations or businesses of any person that would reasonably be
expected to prevent or materially delay consummation of the Transactions.

6.3 ESPP. Prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, the Company shall take all
actions necessary or required under the ESPP and Legal Requirements to,
contingent on the Effective Time, (i) ensure that, except for the six
(6)-month offering period under the ESPP that commenced on April 1, 2016, no
offering period or purchase period shall be authorized or commenced on or
after the date of this Agreement, (ii) ensure that participants in the ESPP
may not increase their rate of payroll deductions and (iii) if the
Closing shall occur prior to the end of the offering period in existence
under the ESPP on the date of this Agreement, cause the rights of participants
in the ESPP with respect to any such offering period (and purchase period
thereunder) then underway under the ESPP to be determined by treating the
last business day prior to the Offer Acceptance Time as the last day of such
offering period and purchase period and by making such other pro-rata
adjustments as may be necessary to reflect the shortened   offering period and purchase period but otherwise treating such shortened
offering period and purchase period as a fully effective and completed
offering period and purchase period for all purposes under the ESPP, with any
Shares purchased under the ESPP cancelled at the Effective Time and converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section
2.5(a)(iii) and, as promptly as reasonably practicable following the purchase
of Shares in accordance with this Section 6.3, cause the funds, if any, that
remain in a participants account after such purchase to be returned to the
participant. The Company shall terminate the ESPP and all rights thereunder
in their entirety effective as of the Offer Acceptance Time, contingent upon
the occurrence of the Effective Time. Prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, the
Company shall take all actions (including, if appropriate, amending the
terms of the ESPP) that are necessary to give effect to the transactions
contemplated by this Section 6.3.

6.4 Employee Benefits. From and after the Effective Time, the Company shall,
and Parent shall cause the Company to, honor all Employee Plans in accordance
with their terms as in effect immediately before the Effective Time or as
subsequently amended as permitted pursuant to the terms of such Employee
Plans and shall assume any Company Employee Agreements that require or
contemplate assumption by their terms by an acquirer or successor. For a
period of one (1) year following the Effective Time, Parent shall provide, or
cause to be provided, to those employees of the Acquired Corporations who are
employed by any Acquired Corporation as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time and who continue to be actively employed by the Surviving Corporation
(or any Affiliate thereof) during such one (1)-year period (the " _Continuing
Employees_ ") base salary and base wages, short-term cash incentive
compensation opportunities (without duplication of the bonus amounts paid as
contemplated by Section 6.4(e)), commission opportunities, severance payments
and severance benefits, each in an amount no less favorable than that in
effect immediately prior to the execution of this Agreement, other benefits
(other than equity compensation) that are substantially comparable in the
aggregate to the benefits provided to such Continuing Employees immediately
prior to the execution of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that during
the period set forth in this Section 6.4 Continuing Employees shall be
eligible to participate in Parents equity plan on a basis consistent with
similarly situated employees of the Parent and its Subsidiaries. Without
limiting the foregoing:

 

(a) Each Continuing Employee shall be given service credit for all purposes,
including for eligibility to participate, benefit levels (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, levels of benefits under Parents vacation policy) and
eligibility for vesting under Parent employee benefit plans and arrangements
with respect to his or her length of service with the Company (and
its Subsidiaries and predecessors) prior to the Closing Date, _provided_ that
the foregoing shall not result in the duplication of benefits. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the service of each Continuing Employee shall not be recognized
for (i) any entitlement to benefit accruals under any defined benefit pension
plan or post-retirement benefit plan; (ii) the level of non-elective employer
contributions under any 401(k) plan of Parent or (iii) eligibility to
participate in, or the level of benefits under any, Parent retiree medical
program in which any Continuing Employee participates after the Effective
Time.

 

(b) With respect to any accrued but unused personal, sick or vacation time to
which any Continuing Employee is entitled pursuant to the personal, sick or
vacation policies applicable to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to
the Effective Time, Parent shall,  or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to and instruct its Affiliates to,
as applicable (and without duplication of benefits), assume the liability for
such accrued personal, sick or vacation time and allow such Continuing
Employee to use such accrued personal, sick or vacation time in accordance
with the practice and policies of the Company, as they may be amended from
time to time.

 

(c) Parent agrees that each Continuing Employee shall be eligible to continue
to participate in the Surviving Corporations health and welfare benefit
plans (to the same extent that such Continuing Employee was eligible to
participate under the applicable Acquired Corporations health and welfare
benefit plans immediately prior to the Effective Time); _provided, however,_
that (i) nothing in this Section 6.4 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall
limit the right of Parent or the Surviving Corporation to amend or terminate
any Surviving Corporation health or welfare benefit plan at any time and (ii)
if Parent or the Surviving Corporation terminates a Surviving Corporation
health or welfare benefit plan, then each Continuing Employee shall be
eligible to participate in Parents health and welfare benefit plans to the
extent that coverage under such plans is replacing comparable coverage under
an Employee Plan in which such Continuing Employee participated immediately
before the Effective Time in accordance with, and subject to the terms of,
such plans. To the extent that service is relevant for eligibility, vesting
or allowances (including paid time off) under any health or welfare benefit
plan of Parent and/or the Surviving Corporation, then Parent shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to (i) waive all limitations as to pre-
existing conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to
participation and coverage requirements applicable to the Continuing
Employees, to the extent that such conditions, exclusions and waiting periods
would not apply under a similar employee benefit plan in which such employees
participated prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) ensure that such health or
welfare benefit plan shall, for purposes of eligibility, vesting, deductibles,
co-payments and out-of-pocket maximums and allowances (including paid time
off), credit Continuing Employees for service and amounts paid prior to the
Effective Time with the Company to the same extent that such service and
amounts paid were recognized prior to the Effective Time under the
corresponding health or welfare benefit plan of the Company, except, in each
case, as would result in a duplication of benefits. Nothing in this Section
6.4 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall be construed to create a right in
any employee to employment with Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any other
Affiliate of the Surviving Corporation and the employment of each Continuing
Employee shall be "at will" employment.

 

(d) Parent hereby acknowledges that a "change of control" (or similar phrase)
within the meaning of the Employee Plans will occur at or prior to the
Effective Time, as applicable, in accordance with the terms of the respective
plan.

(e) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Company may pay to each
employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries actively employed as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time and then participating in any Employee
Plan that is an annual bonus plan (an " _Annual Bonus Plan_ "), a bonus equal
to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the Company employees full-year
bonus entitlement under all such Annual Bonus Plans for the Companys calendar
year in which the Effective Time will occur, based on the greater of (A)
deemed performance at "target" levels and (B) actual performance through the
latest practicable date prior to the Effective Time, extrapolated through the
end of such fiscal year, and (ii) a  fraction the numerator of which equals the number of days that have elapsed
during such fiscal year through the Effective Time and the denominator of
which equals 365; _provided_ that any employee who is paid a bonus in
accordance with this Section 6.4(e) shall not thereafter be entitled to any
amount for such fiscal year under any annual bonus plan of the Surviving
Corporation or Parent to the extent it relates to service or performance
occurring prior to the Effective Time. If the Effective Time occurs during
2017, then, in addition to making the payments pursuant to the preceding
sentence in respect of the 2017 calendar year, the Company may pay to each
employee of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries actively employed on
December 31, 2016, a full bonus under the applicable Annual Bonus Plan in
respect of the Companys 2016 calendar year based on actual performance during
such year, such payment to be made at the earlier of (x) immediately prior to
the Effective Time and (y) in the ordinary course of business consistent with
past practice.

 

(f) The provisions of this Section 6.4 are solely for the benefit of the
Parties to this Agreement, and no provision of this Section 6.4 is intended
to, or shall, constitute the establishment or adoption of or an amendment to
any employee benefit plan for purposes of ERISA or otherwise and no current or
former employee or any other individual associated therewith shall
be regarded for any purpose as a third party beneficiary of the Agreement or
have the right to enforce the provisions hereof.

6.5 Indemnification of Officers and Directors.

(a) All rights to indemnification by the Company or any other
Acquired Corporation now existing in favor of those Persons who are directors
and officers of the Company or any other Acquired Corporation as of the date
of this Agreement (the " _Indemnified Persons_ ") for their acts and
omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time, as provided in the
certificate of incorporation, bylaws and other charter and organizational
documents of the applicable Acquired Corporation (as in effect as of the date
of this Agreement) and as provided in any indemnification agreements between
the Acquired Corporation and said Indemnified Persons in the forms made
available by the Company to Parent or Parents Representatives prior to the
date of this Agreement, shall survive the Merger and shall be observed by the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to the fullest extent available
under Delaware law for a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, and
any claim made requesting indemnification pursuant to such indemnification
rights within such six (6) year period shall continue to be subject to this
Section 6.5(a) and the indemnification rights provided under this Section
6.5(a) until disposition of such claim.

 

(b) From the Effective Time until the sixth (6th) anniversary of the date on
which the Effective Time occurs, Parent and the Surviving Corporation
(together with their successors and assigns, the " _Indemnifying Parties_ ")
shall, to the extent described in clause (a) above: (i) indemnify and hold
harmless each Indemnified Person in his or her capacity as an officer or
director of an Acquired Corporation against all losses, claims, damages,
liabilities, fees, expenses, judgments or fines incurred by such Indemnified
Person as an officer or director of an Acquired Corporation in connection with
any pending or threatened Legal Proceeding based on or arising out of, in
whole or in part, the fact that such Indemnified Person is or was a director
or officer of an Acquired Corporation at or prior to the Effective Time and
pertaining to any and all matters pending, existing or occurring at or prior
to the Effective Time, whether  asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, including any
such matter arising under any claim with respect to the transactions
contemplated herein and (ii) advance reasonable and documented out-of-pocket
costs and expenses (including reasonable and documented attorneys fees)
incurred by the Indemnified Persons in connection with matters for which such
Indemnified Persons are eligible to be indemnified pursuant to this Section
6.5(b) after receipt by Parent of a written request for such advance, subject
to the execution by such Indemnified Persons of appropriate undertakings in
favor of the Indemnifying Parties to repay such advanced costs and expenses if
it is ultimately determined in a final and non-appealable judgment of a court
of competent jurisdiction that such Indemnified Person is not entitled to be
indemnified under this Section 6.5(b).

 

(c) From the Effective Time until the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation shall maintain, and shall cause the other
Acquired Corporations to maintain, in effect, the existing policy of
directors and officers liability insurance maintained by the Acquired
Corporations as of the date of this Agreement (an accurate and complete
copy of which has been made available by the Company to Parent or Parents
Representatives prior to the date of this Agreement) for the benefit of the
Indemnified Persons who are currently covered by such existing policy with
respect to their acts and omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time in
their capacities as directors and officers of the Acquired Corporations (as
applicable), on terms with respect to coverage, deductibles and amounts no
less favorable than the existing policy, or at or prior to the Effective Time
Parent or the Company may (through a nationally recognized insurance broker
approved by Parent (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned)) purchase a six (6)-year "tail" policy for the existing policy
effective as of the Effective Time and if such "tail policy" has been
obtained, it shall be deemed to satisfy all obligations to obtain and/or
maintain insurance pursuant to this Section 6.5(c); _provided, however,_ that
in no event shall the Surviving Corporation be required to expend an amount in
excess of 300% of the annual premium currently payable by the Acquired
Corporations with respect to such current policy, it being understood that if
the annual premiums payable for such insurance coverage exceeds such amount,
Parent shall be obligated to cause the Surviving Corporation to obtain a
policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost equal to such amount.

 

(d) In the event Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
Entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such
case, Parent shall ensure that the successors and assigns of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, or at Parents option, Parent,
shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.5.

 

(e) The provisions of this Section 6.5 shall survive the acceptance of Shares
for payment pursuant to the Offer and the consummation of the Merger and are
(i) intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of
the Indemnified Persons and their successors, assigns and heirs and (ii) in
addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification
or contribution that any such Person may have by contract or otherwise. Unless
required by applicable Legal Requirement, this Section 6.5 may not be amended,
altered or repealed after the Offer Acceptance Time in such a manner as to
adversely affect the rights of any Indemnified Person or any of their
successors, assigns or heirs without the prior written consent of the affected
Indemnified Person. 6.6 Securityholder Litigation. Prior to the earlier of the Effective Time
or the termination of this Agreement, the Company shall control the defense
of any litigation brought by stockholders of the Company against the Company
and/or its directors relating to the Transactions or a breach of this
Agreement or any other agreements contemplated hereby; _provided, however_ ,
that the Company shall give Parent the right to review and comment on all
material filings or responses to be made by the Company in connection with any
such litigation, and the right to consult on the settlement, release, waiver
or compromise of any such litigation, and the Company shall in good faith take
such comments into account, and no such settlement, release, waiver or
compromise relating to the Transactions shall be agreed to without Parents
prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed). The Company shall promptly notify Parent of any such
litigation and shall keep Parent informed on a current basis with respect to
the status thereof.

6.7 Additional Agreements. Without limitation or contravention of the
provisions of Sections 5.3, 6.1 and 6.2, and subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, Parent, Purchaser and the Company shall use
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary
to consummate the Offer and the Merger and make effective the other
Transactions. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, subject to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, each Party to this Agreement shall (i)
make all filings (if any) and give all notices (if any) required to be made
and given by such Party in connection with the Offer and the Merger and the
other Transactions; (ii) use reasonable best efforts to obtain each Consent
(if any) required to be obtained pursuant to any applicable Legal Requirement
or Material Contract by such Party in connection with the Transactions; and
(iii) use reasonable best efforts to lift any restraint, injunction or other
legal bar to the Offer or the Merger brought by any third Person against
such Party. The Company shall promptly deliver to Parent a copy of each such
filing made, each such notice given and each such Consent obtained by the
Company during the Pre-Closing Period.

 

6.8 Disclosure. The initial press release relating to this Agreement shall be
a joint press release issued by the Company and Parent and thereafter Parent
and the Company shall consult with each other before issuing any further press
release(s) or otherwise making any public statement or making any announcement
to Company Associates (to the extent not previously issued or made in
accordance with this Agreement) with respect to the Offer, the Merger, this
Agreement or any of the other Transactions and shall not issue any such press
release, public statement or announcement to Company Associates without the
other Partys written consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed. Notwithstanding the foregoing: (a) each Party may, without such
consultation or consent, make any public statement in response to questions
from the press, analysts, investors or those attending industry conferences,
make internal announcements to employees and make disclosures in publicly
available conference calls and in the Company SEC Documents, so long as such
statements are consistent with previous press releases, public disclosures or
public statements made jointly by the parties (or individually, if approved by
the other Party), (b) a Party may, without the prior consent of the other
Party hereto but subject to giving advance notice to the other Party, issue
any such press release or make any such public announcement or statement as
may be required  by Legal Requirement; and (c) the Parties need not consult each other in
connection with such portion of any press release, public statement or filing
to be issued or made pursuant to Section 5.3(e) or with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal, Company Adverse Change Recommendation or Change in
Circumstance.

6.9 Takeover Laws. If any Takeover Law may become, or may purport to be,
applicable to the Transactions, each of Parent, Purchaser and the Company and
the members of their respective boards of directors shall use their respective
reasonable best efforts to grant such approvals and take such actions as are
necessary so that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be
consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms and conditions
contemplated hereby and otherwise act to lawfully eliminate the effect of any
Takeover Law on any of the Transactions.

6.10 Section 16 Matters. The Company, and the Company Board, shall, to the
extent necessary, take appropriate action, prior to or as of the Offer
Acceptance Time, to approve, for purposes of Section 16(b) of the Exchange
Act, the disposition and cancellation or deemed disposition and cancellation
of Shares, and Company Stock Awards in the Transactions by applicable
individuals and to cause such dispositions and/or cancellations to be exempt
under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

Committee of the Company Board, at a meeting duly called and held, shall
approve, as an "employment compensation, severance or other employee benefit
arrangement" within the meaning of Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act,
each agreement, arrangement or understanding between an Acquired Corporation
or any of its Affiliates and any of the officers, directors or employees of
the Acquired Corporation that are effective as of the date of this Agreement,
are contemplated by this Agreement, or are entered into after the date
of this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time pursuant to which
compensation is paid to such officer, director or employee and shall take all
other action reasonably necessary to satisfy the requirements of the non-
exclusive safe harbor set forth in Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act.

jurisdiction and remain in effect any temporary restraining order, preliminary
or permanent injunction or other order preventing the consummation of the
Merger, nor shall there be any Legal Requirement or order promulgated,
entered, enforced, enacted, issued or deemed applicable to the Merger by any
Governmental Body which prohibits, or makes illegal the consummation of the
Merger; _provided, however,_  that no Party shall be permitted to invoke this

Agreement to have any such order lifted.

 

7.2 Consummation of Offer. Purchaser (or Parent on Purchasers behalf) shall
have accepted for payment and paid for all of the Shares validly tendered
pursuant to the Offer and not validly withdrawn. ---|--- 

8.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated prior to the Effective
Time:

(a) by mutual written consent of Parent and the Company at any time prior to
the Offer Acceptance Time; 

(b) by either Parent or the Company, at any time prior to the Offer Acceptance
Time, if the Offer Acceptance Time shall not have occurred on or prior to
midnight, Eastern Time, on December 31, 2016 (the " _End Date_ "); _provided,
however_ , that in the case of this Section 8.1(b), (x) if on the End Date all
of the conditions set forth in Annex I, other than condition "(d)" set forth
in Annex I and those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at
the Expiration Date, shall have been satisfied or waived by Parent or
Purchaser, to the extent waivable by Parent or Purchaser (other than the
delivery of the certificate referenced in condition "(e)" set forth in Annex
I, which certificate only need to be capable of being delivered), then the End
Date shall automatically be extended one (1) time (but no more than one time)
by a period of ninety (90) calendar days (and all references to the End Date
herein and in Annex I shall be as so extended); and (y) the right to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(b) shall not be available to any

shall have issued a decree or ruling, or shall have taken any other action,
having the effect of permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise
prohibiting the acceptance for payment of Shares pursuant to the Offer or the
Merger or making consummation of the Offer or the Merger illegal, which order,
decree, ruling or other action shall be final and nonappealable; _provided_
that the Party seeking to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section
8.1(c) shall have used its reasonable best efforts to remove such order or
other action; _provided, further_ _,_ that a Party shall not be permitted to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(c) if the issuance of
such final and nonappealable order, decree, ruling or other action is
attributable to the material breach by such Party of any covenant or
obligation of such Party set forth in this Agreement;

 

(d) by Parent at any time prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, if: (i) the
Company Board shall have failed to include the Company Board Recommendation
in the Schedule 14D-9 when mailed, or shall have effected a Company Adverse
Change Recommendation; or (ii) in the case of a tender offer or exchange offer
subject to Regulation 14D under the Exchange Act, other than the Offer, the

on Schedule 14D-9, rejection of such tender offer or exchange offer within ten
(10) business days of the commencement of such tender offer or exchange offer; (e) by the Company, at any time prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, in
compliance with Section 6.1(b), in order to accept a Superior Offer and enter
into a binding written definitive acquisition agreement providing for the
consummation of a transaction which the Company Board shall have determined,
in good faith, constitutes a Superior Offer (a " _Specified Agreement_ "),
subject to the prior or concurrent payment of the Termination Fee as provided
in Section 8.3(b);

 

(f) by Parent at any time prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, if a breach of
any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement or failure to

or "(c)" of Annex I would not be satisfied and cannot be cured by the Company
by the End Date, or if capable of being cured in such time frame, shall not
have commenced to have been cured within thirty (30) days of the date Parent
gives the Company notice of such breach or failure to perform;
_provided, however,_ that, Parent shall not have the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(f) if either Parent or Purchaser is
then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
obligation hereunder, which breach has not been cured;

(g) by the Company at any time prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, if a breach
of any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement or failure to
perform any covenant or obligation in this Agreement on the part of Parent or
Purchaser shall have occurred, in each case, if such breach or failure has had
or would reasonably be expected to prevent Parent or Purchaser from
consummating the Transactions and such breach or failure cannot be satisfied
and cannot be cured by Parent or Purchaser, as applicable, by the End Date, or
if capable of being cured in such time frame, shall not have commenced to
have been cured within thirty (30) days of the date the Company gives Parent
notice of such breach or failure to perform; _provided, however,_ that, the
Company shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this Section 8.1(g) if the Company is then in material breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or obligation hereunder, which breach has
not been cured; or

 

(h) by the Company (i) if Purchaser shall have failed to commence (within the
meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) the Offer within five (5)
business days of the period specified in Section 1.1(a) and has not yet
commenced the Offer, (ii) if Purchaser shall have failed to accept for payment
all Shares validly tendered (and not validly withdrawn) pursuant to the
Offer within the period specified in Section 1.1(h) or (iii) if Purchaser
shall have failed to purchase all Shares validly tendered (and not validly
withdrawn) as of the expiration of the Offer (as may be extended) within the
period specified in Section 1.1(h).

8.2 Effect of Termination. In the event of the termination of this Agreement
as provided in Section 8.1, written notice thereof shall be given to the
other Party or Parties, specifying the provision hereof pursuant to which such
termination is made, and this Agreement shall be of no further force or effect
and there shall be no liability on the part of Parent, Purchaser or the
Company or their respective directors, officers and Affiliates following any
such termination; _provided, however,_ that (a) the final sentence of Section
1.2(b), the final sentence of Section 5.1, this Section 8.2, Section 8.3 and
Section 9 shall survive the termination of this Agreement and shall remain in
full force and effect, (b) the Confidentiality Agreement shall survive the
termination of this Agreement and shall remain in full force and effect in  accordance with its terms; and (c) the termination of this Agreement shall
not relieve any Party from any liability for fraud or willful and material
breach of this Agreement prior to the date of termination. Nothing shall
limit or prevent any Party from exercising any rights or remedies it may have
under Section 9.5(b) in lieu of terminating this Agreement pursuant to Section
8.1.

 

8.3 Expenses; Termination Fee.

 

(a) Except as set forth in this Section 8.3, all fees and expenses incurred in
connection with this Agreement and the Transactions shall be paid by the
Party incurring such expenses, whether or not the Offer and Merger are
consummated.

(b) In the event that: 

(i) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(e);

 

(ii) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(d); or

 

(iii) (x) this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant to
Section 8.1(b) (but in the case of a termination by the Company, only if at
such time Parent would not be prohibited from terminating this Agreement
pursuant to Section 8.1(b)), (y) any Person shall have publicly disclosed a
_bona fide_ Acquisition Proposal after the date hereof and prior to such
termination (unless publicly withdrawn prior to such termination) and (z)
within nine (9) months of such termination the Company shall have entered into
a definitive agreement with respect to an Acquisition Proposal or
consummated an Acquisition Proposal (provided that for purposes of this
clause (z) the references to "20%" in the definition of " _Acquisition
Proposal_ " shall be deemed to be references to "50%");

 

then, in any such event under clause "(i)", "(ii)" or "(iii)" of this Section
8.3(b), the Company shall pay to Parent or its designee the Termination Fee
by wire transfer of same day funds (x) in the case of Section 8.3(b)(i), on
that date that the Specified Agreement is executed (or if the Specified
Agreement is executed on a day that is not a business day, the next business
day), (y) in the case of Section 8.3(b)(ii), within three (3) business days
after such termination or (z) in the case of Section 8.3(b)(iii), prior to the
entry into a definitive material agreement in respect of or consummation
of the Acquisition Proposal, as applicable, referred to in subclause (iii)(z)
above; it being understood that in no event shall the Company be required to
pay the Termination Fee on more than one occasion. As used herein, "
_Termination Fee_ " shall mean a cash amount equal to $510,000,000. Payment
of the Termination Fee pursuant to this Section 8.3(b) shall be deemed to be
liquidated damages for any and all losses or damages suffered or incurred by
Parent, Purchaser, any of their respective Affiliates or any other Person in
connection with this Agreement (and the termination hereof), the Transactions
(and the abandonment thereof) or any matter forming the basis for such
termination, and none of Parent, Purchaser, any of their respective
Affiliates (collectively, " _Parent Related Parties_ ") or any other Person
shall be entitled to bring or maintain any claim, action or proceeding against
the Company or any of its Affiliates arising out of or in connection with
this Agreement, any of the Transactions or any matters forming the basis for
such termination; provided, that payment of the Termination Fee will not be
liquidated damages in the case of fraud or a willful and intentional breach
of this Agreement. (c) Other than in the case of fraud or willful and intentional breach of this
Agreement, Parents right to receive payment from the Company of the
Termination Fee pursuant to Section 8.3(b) and any payments pursuant to
Section 8.3(d) shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Parent Related
Parties against the Company and any of their respective former, current or
future officers, directors, partners, stockholders, optionholders, managers,
members or Affiliates (collectively, " _Company Related Parties_ ") for any
loss suffered as a result of the failure of the Offer or the Merger to be
consummated or for a breach or failure to perform hereunder or otherwise, and
upon payment of such amount(s), none of the Company Related Parties shall have
any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this
Agreement or the Transactions.

(d) The Parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this Section 8.3
are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
that, without these agreements, the Parties would not enter into this
Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails to timely pay any amount due
pursuant to this Section 8.3, and, in order to obtain the payment, Parent
commences a Legal Proceeding which results in a judgment against the Company,
the Company shall pay Parent its reasonable and documented costs and expenses
(including reasonable and documented attorneys fees) in connection with such
suit, together with interest on such amount at the prime rate as published in
the Wall Street Journal in effect on the date such payment was required to be
made through the date such payment was actually received.

 



   SECTION 9. | MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS 
---|--- 

9.1 Amendment. Prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, subject to Section 6.5(e),
this Agreement may be amended with the approval of the respective Boards of
Directors of the Company and Parent at any time. This Agreement may not be
amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the
parties hereto.

9.2 Waiver. No failure on the part of any Party to exercise any power,
right, privilege or remedy under this Agreement, and no delay on the part of
any Party in exercising any power, right, privilege or remedy under this
Agreement, shall operate as a waiver of such power, right, privilege or
remedy; and no single or partial exercise of any such power, right, privilege
or remedy shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or of any other
power, right, privilege or remedy. No Party shall be deemed to have waived any
claim arising out of this Agreement, or any power, right, privilege or remedy
under this Agreement, unless the waiver of such claim, power, right, privilege
or remedy is expressly set forth in a written instrument duly executed and
delivered on behalf of such Party; and any such waiver shall not be
applicable or have any effect except in the specific instance in which it is
given. At any time prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, Parent and Purchaser,
on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, may (a) extend the time
for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other, (b)
waive any breach of the representations and warranties of the other contained
herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto or (c) waive compliance by
the other with any of the agreements or covenants contained herein. Any such
extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed by the party or parties to be  bound thereby, but such extension or waiver or failure to insist on strict
compliance with an obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not
operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other
failure.

9.3 No Survival of Representations and Warranties. None of the
representations and warranties contained in this Agreement, the Company
Disclosure Schedule or in any certificate or schedule or other document
delivered by any Person pursuant to this Agreement shall survive the Merger.

9.4 Entire Agreement; Counterparts. This Agreement and the other agreements
and schedules referred to herein constitute the entire agreement and
supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral,
among or between any of the Parties, with respect to the subject matter hereof
and thereof; _provided, however,_ that the Confidentiality Agreement shall
not be superseded and shall remain in full force and effect; _provided,
further, that,_ if the Effective Time occurs, the Confidentiality Agreement
shall automatically terminate and be of no further force and effect. This
Agreement may be executed in several counterparts, each of which shall be
deemed an original and all of which shall constitute one and the same
instrument. The exchange of a fully executed Agreement (in counterparts
or otherwise) by PDF shall be sufficient to bind the Parties to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement.

9.5 Applicable Legal Requirements; Jurisdiction; Specific Performance;
Remedies.

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with,
the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the laws that might otherwise
govern under applicable principles of conflicts of laws thereof. Subject to
Section 9.5(c), in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to
this Agreement or any of the Transactions, each of the Parties (i) irrevocably
and unconditionally consents and submits to the exclusive jurisdiction and
venue of the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware and any state appellate
court therefrom or, if (but only if) such court declines jurisdiction, the
United States District Court sitting in New Castle County in the State of
Delaware, (it being agreed that the consents to jurisdiction and venue set
forth in this Section 9.5(a) shall not constitute general consents to service
of process in the State of Delaware and shall have no effect for any purpose
except as provided in this paragraph and shall not be deemed to confer rights
on any Person other than the Parties); (ii) irrevocably consents to service
of process by first class certified mail, return receipt requested, postage
prepaid, to the address at which such Party is to receive notice in accordance
with Section 9.8; and (iii) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat
such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such
court.

(b) The Parties agree that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding
shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the
judgment or in any other manner provided by applicable Legal Requirements;
_provided, however,_ that nothing in the foregoing shall restrict any Partys
rights to seek any post-judgment relief regarding, or any appeal from, such
final trial court judgment.

 

(c) The Parties agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even
if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that
the Parties do  not perform their obligations under the provisions of this Agreement in
accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions.
Subject to the following sentence, the Parties acknowledge and agree that (i)
the Parties (on behalf of themselves or any third party beneficiary to this
Agreement) shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions, specific
performance, or other equitable relief, to prevent breaches of this Agreement
and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in the courts
described in Section 9.5(a) without proof of damages or otherwise, this being
in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled under
this Agreement or at law or in equity and (ii) the right of specific
performance is an integral part of the Transactions and without that right,
neither the Company nor Parent would have entered into this Agreement. The
right to specific enforcement hereunder shall include the right of the
Company, on behalf of itself and any third party beneficiaries to this
Agreement, to cause Parent and Purchaser to cause the Offer, the Merger and
the other Transactions to be consummated on the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement. Each of the Parties agrees that it
will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other
equitable relief on the basis that the other Parties (on behalf of themselves
or any third party beneficiary to this Agreement) have an adequate remedy at
law or an award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any
reason at law or equity. The Parties acknowledge and agree that any Party
seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement
and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in
accordance with this Section 9.5(b) shall not be required to provide any bond
or other security in connection with any such order or injunction.

(d) EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL
BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING BETWEEN THE PARTIES (WHETHER BASED ON
CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE), INCLUDING ANY COUNTERCLAIM, ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THE
ACTIONS OF ANY PARTY HERETO IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE
AND ENFORCEMENT THEREOF. EACH PARTY (A) MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (B)
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY,
AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS CONTAINED IN THIS SECTION 9.5.

9.6 Assignability. This Agreement shall be binding upon, and shall be
enforceable by and inure solely to the benefit of, the Parties and their
respective successors and permitted assigns; _provided, however,_ that neither
this Agreement nor any of the rights hereunder may be assigned by a Party
without the prior written consent of the other Parties, and any attempted
assignment of this Agreement or any of such rights without such consent shall
be void and of no effect; _provided, further, however,_ that Parent or
Purchaser may assign this Agreement to any of their Affiliates ( _provided_
that such assignment shall not impede or delay the consummation of the
Transactions or otherwise impede the rights of the stockholders of the Company
under this Agreement); _provided_ that no such assignment or pledge permitted
pursuant to this Section 9.6 shall relieve Parent of its obligations
hereunder.

9.7 No Third Party Beneficiaries. Nothing in this Agreement, express or
implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any Person (other than the
Parties) any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by
reason of this Agreement, except for: (i) if the Offer  Acceptance Time occurs (A) the right of the Companys stockholders to
receive the Offer Price in accordance with the terms of the Offer Documents or
Merger Consideration in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, as
applicable and (B) the right of the holders of Company Stock Awards to receive
the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.8; (ii) provided, the Company
shall have used reasonable best efforts to obtain specific performance
pursuant to Section 9.5(c) and all such requests have been judicially denied
with no further right of appeal, the rights of holders of Shares to pursue
claims for damages and other relief, including equitable relief, for Parent
or Purchasers intentional breach of this Agreement or fraud; (iii) the
provisions set forth in Section 6.5 of this Agreement and (iv) the limitations
on liability of the Company Related Parties set forth in Section 8.3(c); 
_provided_ ; that the rights granted pursuant to clause (ii) above shall only
be enforceable on behalf of such holders of Shares by the Company in its sole
and absolute discretion.

 

9.8 Transfer Taxes. Except as otherwise provided in Section 2.6(b), all
transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other similar
Taxes and fees imposed with respect to the transfer of Shares pursuant to the
Offer or the Merger shall be borne by the Company, Parent or Purchaser and
expressly shall not be a liability of holders of Shares.

 

9.9 Notices. Any notice or other communication required or permitted to be
delivered to any Party under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be
deemed properly delivered, given and received (a) upon receipt when delivered
by hand, (b) two (2) business days after being sent by registered mail or by
courier or express delivery service, (c) if sent by email transmission prior

illegal or incapable of being enforced by any Legal Requirement or public
policy, as determined by a final judgment of a court of competent
