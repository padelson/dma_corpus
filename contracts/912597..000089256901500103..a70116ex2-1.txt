        WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of the Company and the Buyer have
determined that it is in the best interests of their respective companies and

accordingly have agreed to effect the Merger (as defined in Section 1.1)
provided for herein upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
herein;

        WHEREAS, the Company is currently in the process of liquidating its

        WHEREAS, The Prudential Real Estate Companies Fund I, L.P., an affiliate

        NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing, and of the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, the
parties hereto hereby agree as follows:

                                    ARTICLE 1

                                   THE MERGER

        1.1 The Merger. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,

of Merger in accordance with the DLLCA, or at such later time which the parties
hereto shall have agreed upon and designated in the Articles of Merger and
Certificate of Merger in accordance with the MGCL and the DLLCA as the effective
time of the Merger (the "Effective Time").

                                    ARTICLE 4

                                  COMPANY STOCK

        4.1 Conversion of Company Stock.

        (a) At the Effective Time, each share of common stock, par value $.01
per share, of the Company (the "Company Common Stock"), issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than (i) Company Common Stock
held by Buyer or any Company Subsidiary or Affiliate of Buyer and (ii) Company
Common Stock held in the Company's treasury (collectively, the "Excluded
Shares")) shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of
the holder thereof, be converted into the right to receive, upon surrender of
the certificate formerly representing such share (a "Certificate") in accordance
with Section 4.2, a cash payment equal to the quotient that results when (x) the
Cash Consideration (as defined below) as adjusted pursuant to Section 4.3 (as so
adjusted, the "Purchase Price"), is divided by (y) the sum of the total number
of shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time, other than the Excluded Shares, plus the number of Converted
Option Shares (as hereinafter defined) (such quotient being the "Merger
Consideration"). For the purposes of this Section 4.1(a), the following terms
have the meanings set forth below:

            (i) "Cash Consideration" shall mean the sum of (i) Seventy-Eight
Million Two Hundred Eighty Thousand Five Hundred Eighty-Six Dollars
($78,280,586), (ii) the Equity Differential, (iii) the Deposit Differential and
(iv) less the Development Budget Adjustment.

            (ii) "Equity Differential" shall mean the amount by which the
Company's capitalized costs with respect to the Company Development Properties
(as defined herein) and any properties under development by the Company that are
acquired between the date hereof and the Effective Time, less any construction
loan indebtedness and accrued retentions payable (in each case as determined in
accordance with GAAP on the accrual basis of accounting and in accordance with
the Company's past practices), calculated as of the Closing Date (the "Net
Equity"), varies from Thirty Four Million Six Hundred Seventy-Three Thousand and
Five Dollars ($34,673,005) (the "Equity Target"). Exhibit 4.1(a)(ii) sets forth
a sample calculation of Net Equity as of January 31, 2001 for reference purposes
only. Net Equity shall be determined in a manner consistent with such Exhibit
4.1(a)(ii). If the Net Equity as so calculated exceeds the Equity Target, then
the Equity Differential shall be a positive number. If the Net Equity as so
calculated is less than the Equity Target, then the Equity Differential shall be
a negative number.

            (iii) "Deposit Differential" shall mean the amount by which the
Company's deposits and capitalized pre-development costs with respect to the
properties under contract for purchase by the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time (in each case as determined in accordance with GAAP on the
accrual basis of accounting and in accordance with the Company's past
practices), calculated as of the Closing Date (the "Net Deposits"), varies from
One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) (the "Deposit Target"). Exhibit 4.1(a)(iii)
sets forth a sample calculation of


                                       3

<PAGE>   10

Net Deposits as of January 31, 2001 for reference purposes only. Net Deposits
shall be determined in a manner consistent with such Exhibit 4.1(a)(iii). In
calculating Net Deposits, the maximum aggregate amount of nonrefundable deposits
and capitalized pre-development costs to be included in such calculation shall
be Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000). If the Net Deposits as so
calculated exceeds the Deposit Target, then the Deposit Differential shall be a
positive number. If the Net Deposits as so calculated is less than the Deposit
Target, then the Deposit Differential shall be a negative number.

            (iv) "Development Budget Adjustment" shall be determined as follows:
no earlier than two (2) business days prior to the Closing Date, the Company
shall provide the Buyer with its budget, prepared in good faith, for the
aggregate development costs of the Company Development Properties (the "Closing
Budget"). If the aggregate development costs reflected on such Closing Budget
exceeds, by greater than five percent (5%), the aggregate development costs
reflected on the development budgets attached hereto as Exhibit 4.1(a)(v) (the
"Development Budgets"), then the amount of such excess over such five percent
(5%) shall be the Development Budget Adjustment. If the aggregate development
costs reflected on such Closing Budget does not exceed, by greater than five
percent (5%), the aggregate development costs reflected on the budget delivered

Deposit Differential. The Buyer and its representatives shall have the right to
review and examine all supporting documentation used by the Company in the
determination of the Equity Differential and the Deposit Differential. If the
Company and the Buyer shall not have agreed to either or both of the Equity
Differential and/or the Deposit Differential prior to the Closing Date, then any
such disputed amounts (the "Disputed Amounts") shall be deemed to be zero as of
the Closing Date, and within thirty (30) days after the Closing Date, Ernst &
Young LLP will prepare and present to the Liquidating Trust and the Surviving
Entity a calculation of the Disputed Amounts as of two (2) business days prior
to the Closing Date. Such calculations shall be binding upon the parties to this
Agreement. The fees and disbursements of Ernst & Young LLP incurred in the
preparation of such calculations shall be paid equally by the Liquidating Trust
and the Surviving Entity.

            (b) As a result of the Merger and without any action on the part of
the holder thereof, all shares of Company Common Stock shall cease to be
outstanding and shall be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and
each holder of a Certificate representing any shares of Company Common Stock
shall thereafter cease to have any rights with respect to such shares of Company
Common Stock, except the right to receive, without interest, the Merger
Consideration in accordance with this Article 4 hereto upon the surrender of
such Certificate.

            (c) Each Excluded Share shall, by virtue of the Merger, cease to be
outstanding and shall be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist without

on Section 4.1(d) of the Company Disclosure Letter (as hereinafter defined) that

                      -------
                         A

            Where X = the number of shares of Company Common Stock for which the
                      optionholder will be entitled to receive the Merger
                      Consideration (collectively for all optionholders, the
                      "Converted Option Shares").

                  Y = the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to
                      such Company Stock Option.

                  A = the Merger Consideration.

                  B = the per share exercise price of such Company Stock Option.

amendments to the terms of the Company Stock Option Plan or any award granted
thereunder that are necessary to give effect to the transactions contemplated by
Section 4.1(d) and shall take all necessary steps so that all outstanding

until any necessary consents are obtained.

        4.2 Calculation of Net Working Capital.

        (a) As used herein, "Net Working Capital" means, as of the Closing Date,

contemplated transfer of assets to the Liquidating Trust and without giving
effect to the Closing of the Merger or the payment of the Merger Consideration

(a) the current assets of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries on such date
are greater than (b) the current liabilities. Exhibit 4.2 attached hereto sets
forth a current listing of the Company's categories or accounts of assets and
liabilities and indicates which of such accounts are to be used, and the manner
in which such accounts are to be treated, for the determination of Net Working
Capital. In furtherance of the foregoing, for purposes of the determination of
Net Working Capital, the parties agree as follows:

(A)      current liabilities shall not include:

                (i) Long-Term Indebtedness (as defined in Article 10 hereof)

         included for purposes of determination of the Equity Differential or
         the Deposit Differential; and

                (iii) payables to Affiliates of the Company or any Company
         Subsidiary;

(B)      current liabilities will include any unpaid costs and expenses of the
         Company related to (i) the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
         (ii) the formation of the Liquidating Trust and (iii) the prior sales

         7.8(b), the Buyer shall pay $86,000 towards such policies and such
         amount will therefore not be considered a liability of the Company; the
         Litigation Deductible (whether or not incurred by the Company, and
         which amount may be adjusted pursuant to the provisions of Section
         7.18(c)); financing fees and other third party consent fees and
         penalties, financial advisory fees and fees of the Company's auditors
         other than those set forth in Sections 4.1(a) and 4.2(c) hereof; the
         Company's legal fees and expenses, environmental, engineering and other
         due diligence fees and expenses incurred by the Company in connection
         with the transactions, the costs of preparing the Proxy Statement and
         soliciting proxy votes, and other fees and expenses incurred by the
         Company and normally paid by the acquired entity in transactions of
         this type;

(C)      current assets will not include:

                (i) any current asset that, under Section 4.1(a), is included
         for purposes of determination of the Equity Differential or the Deposit
         Differential; and

                (ii) receivables from Affiliates of the Company or any Company
         Subsidiary.

            (b) Within two (2) business days prior to the Closing Date, the
Company will deliver to Buyer an estimate, prepared in good faith, of the Net
Working Capital the Company estimates for the Closing Date. The Company shall,
and shall cause the Liquidating Trust to, use their respective commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the Net Working Capital to equal at least One
Million Dollars ($1,000,000) at the Effective Time.

            (c) Within thirty (30) days after the Closing Date, Ernst & Young
LLP will prepare and present to the Liquidating Trust and the Surviving Entity a
calculation of the Net Working Capital (the "Working Capital Calculation"). The
Working Capital Calculation shall be binding upon the parties to this Agreement.

         4.3 Post-Closing Adjustments.

         (a) If the Net Working Capital as set forth in the Working Capital
Calculation is less than One Million Dollars ($1,000,000), then within five (5)
days after the final determination of the Working Capital Calculation, the
Liquidating Trust shall pay to Buyer an amount equal to such difference in cash
in immediately available funds by wire transfer to a bank account designated in
writing by Buyer prior to the due date thereof.

         (b) If, pursuant to Section 4.1(a), there exist any Disputed Amounts at
Closing, then, within five (5) days after the final determination of such
Disputed Amounts,

                (i) if the Disputed Amounts would have, if determined prior to
         Closing, resulted in a decrease to Cash Consideration, then the
         Liquidating Trust shall pay to Buyer an amount equal to the net of the
         final determination of such Disputed Amounts in immediately available
         funds by wire transfer to a bank account designated in writing by Buyer
         prior to the due date thereof; and

                (ii) if the Disputed Amounts would have, if determined prior to
         Closing, resulted in an increase to Cash Consideration, the Surviving
         Entity shall pay to the Liquidating Trust an amount equal to the net of
         the final determination of such Disputed Amounts in immediately
         available funds by wire transfer to a bank account designated in
         writing by the Liquidating Trust prior to the due date thereof.

         4.4 Surrender of Certificates Representing Company Common Stock.

         (a) As of the Effective Time, Buyer shall deposit, or shall cause to be
deposited, with a paying agent selected by Buyer and reasonably satisfactory to
the Company (the "Paying Agent"), for the benefit of the holders of shares of
Company Common Stock, in accordance with this Article 4, cash representing the
Purchase Price to be allocated pursuant to Section 4.1 and paid pursuant to this
Section 4.4 in cancellation of outstanding shares of Company Common Stock.

         (b) Promptly after the Effective Time, Buyer shall cause the Paying
Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate or Certificates (i) a
letter of transmittal which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and
risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates to the Paying Agent, and shall be in such form and have such other
provisions as Buyer may reasonably specify and (ii) instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger
Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying
Agent together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed and completed in
accordance with the instructions thereto, the holder of such Certificate shall
be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a check representing the Merger
Consideration and unpaid dividends and distributions, if any, which such holder
has the right to receive in respect of the Certificate surrendered pursuant to
the provisions of this Article 4, after giving effect to any required
withholding tax, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be
cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on the Merger Consideration and
unpaid dividends and distributions, if any, payable to holders of Certificates.
In the event of a transfer


                                       7


<PAGE>   14

of ownership of Company Common Stock which is not registered in the transfer
records of the Company, the Merger Consideration may be issued to such a
transferee if the Certificate representing shares of such Company Common Stock
is presented to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents required to
evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock
transfer taxes have been paid.

         (c) At and after the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the
stock transfer books of the Company of the shares of Company Common Stock which
were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Entity, they shall
be cancelled and exchanged for cash in the amount of the Merger Consideration
and unpaid dividends and distributions deliverable in respect thereof pursuant
to this Agreement in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Article 4.

         (d) Any portion of the Merger Consideration held by the Paying Agent
and the proceeds of any investments thereof that remains unclaimed by the former
shareholders of the Company one year after the Effective Time shall be delivered
to the Surviving Entity. Any former shareholders of the Company who have not
theretofore complied with this Article 4 shall thereafter look only to the
Surviving Entity for payment of the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect
of each share of Company Common Stock such shareholder holds as determined
pursuant to this Agreement, in each case, without any interest thereon.

         (e) None of Buyer, the Company, the Paying Agent or any other person
shall be liable to any former holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any
amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar laws.

         (f) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the
Surviving Entity, the posting by such person of a bond in such reasonable amount
as the Surviving Entity may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be
made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent or the
Surviving Entity will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to
this Agreement.

         (g) The Surviving Entity or the Paying Agent shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration and any other amounts
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of a Certificate, if
any, such amount that the Surviving Entity or the Paying Agent determine they
are required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law. To the
extent that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving Entity or the Paying Agent,
such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the holder of the Certificate in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving Entity or the Paying Agent.

         4.5 No Effect on Outstanding Membership Interests in Surviving Entity.
At the Effective Time, each of the then outstanding membership interests in the
Surviving Entity will by unaffected by the Merger and remain as outstanding
membership interests, continuing to be held by the holders thereof.

qualified to do business as a foreign corporation and is in good standing under
the laws of any other state of the United States in which the character of the
properties owned or leased by it therein or in which the transaction of its
business makes such qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so
qualified would not have a material adverse effect on the business, assets,
results of operations or condition (financial or otherwise) of the Company (a
"Company Material Adverse Effect"). The Company has all requisite corporate
power and authority to own, operate, lease and encumber its properties and carry
on its business as now conducted.

         (b) The Company is in compliance, in all material respects, with the
order of any court, Governmental Entity, or any Applicable Law to which the
Company or any of its properties or assets is subject. The Company has obtained
all material licenses, permits and other authorizations and has taken all
actions required by Applicable Law in connection with its business as now

the Company's articles of incorporation and bylaws have been previously
delivered or made available to Buyer.

         5.2 Authorization, Validity and Effect of Agreements; Dissenter's
Rights.

         (a) The Company has the requisite corporate power and authority to
enter into the transactions contemplated hereby and to execute and deliver this
Agreement. Subject only to the approval of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby (including the Merger) by the affirmative vote of holders of
a majority of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (such vote, the
"Company Shareholder Approval"), the consummation by the Company of the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement has been duly
authorized by all requisite corporate action on the part of the Company
(including approval by the Company's Board of Directors (the "Board") of (i)
such transactions, (ii) the holding of a meeting of shareholders with respect to

Shareholder Approval is the only vote required of holders of the Company's
capital stock in connection with the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby. This Agreement constitutes the valid and legally binding
obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with
its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium or other
similar laws relating to creditors' rights and general principles of equity.

<PAGE>   16

         (b) So long as the Company's Common Stock is listed for trading on the
New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE"), no dissenters' or appraisal rights shall
be available with respect to the Merger or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

         (c) The Liquidating Trust Agreement is a valid and binding agreement,
and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Entity may enforce the terms of the

preferred stock, par value $.01 per share (the "Company Preferred Stock"). As of
the date hereof, there were 26,082,506 shares of Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding and no shares of Company Preferred Stock issued and outstanding. As
of the date hereof, there were outstanding options to purchase an aggregate of
35,000 shares of Company Common Stock, all of which were issued under the
Company Stock Option Plan and all of which shall be cancelled or exercised no
later than the Effective Time. There are no other plans for the issuance of
options to purchase Company Common Stock. The Company has no outstanding bonds,
debentures, notes or other obligations (the "Voting Debt") the holders of which
have the right to vote (or which are convertible into or exercisable for
securities having the right to vote) with the shareholders of the Company on any
matter. Except for the Company Stock Options and except as set forth in Section
5.3 of the Company Disclosure Letter, there are no issued and outstanding or
reserved for issuance options, warrants, calls, rights (including preemptive
rights), commitments or agreements to which the Company or any Company

Subsidiary to issue, deliver, sell, purchase, redeem or acquire, or cause to be
issued, delivered, sold, purchased, redeemed or acquired, additional shares of
capital stock, Voting Debt or other voting securities of the Company or of any
Company Subsidiary, or obligating the Company or any Company Subsidiary to
grant, extend or enter into any such option, warrant, call, right, commitment or
agreement. All such issued and outstanding shares of the Company Common Stock
are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid, nonassessable and free of
preemptive rights. No current or past holder of any shares of the Company's
capital stock has perfected dissenter's rights under the MGCL that have not been
finally resolved in connection with any previous transaction consummated by the
Company. The Company is not a party to any voting agreement with respect to the
Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock or any agreement under which a
party may require that the Company or the Surviving Entity upon completion of
the Merger register any securities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended
(the "Securities Act"). After the Effective Time, the Surviving Entity will have
no obligation to issue, transfer or sell any shares of capital stock or other
equity interest of the Company or the Surviving Entity pursuant to any Company
Benefit Plan (as defined in Section 5.13). Except as set forth in Section 5.3 of
the Company Disclosure Letter, all dividends or distributions on securities of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary that have been declared or authorized
prior to the date of this Agreement have been paid in full.

         5.4 Subsidiaries.

         (a) As used in this Agreement, "Company Subsidiary" or "Company
Subsidiaries" means any corporation, partnership, limited liability company,
joint venture or other legal entity that the Company controls by acting as
general partner of managing member or of which the Company (either directly or

the voting stock, value of or other equity interests (voting or non-voting) of
such corporation, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, or
other entity. All Company Subsidiaries are set forth in Section 5.4(a) of the
Company Disclosure Letter, including the name of each such entity, to the

         (b) Each Company Subsidiary that is a corporation is duly incorporated,
validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of its jurisdiction of
incorporation and has the requisite corporate power and authority to own, lease

trust is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of
its jurisdiction of organization and has the requisite power and authority to
own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its business as now being

and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its business
or the ownership, operation or leasing of its properties or the management of
properties for others makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except
where the failure to be so qualified would not have a Company Material Adverse
Effect. Section 5.4(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a list of
each jurisdiction in which each Company Subsidiary is qualified or licensed to
do business and each assumed name under which each such Company Subsidiary
conducts business in any jurisdiction. All outstanding shares of capital stock
of each Company Subsidiary that is a corporation have been duly authorized, are

rights, are owned by the Company and/or another Company Subsidiary, except as

free and clear of all pledges, claims, liens, charges, encumbrances and security
interests of any kind or nature whatsoever (collectively, "Liens"). Except as
disclosed in Section 5.4(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter, all equity
interests in each Company Subsidiary that is a partnership, limited liability
company, trust or other entity have been duly authorized and are validly issued
and are owned by the Company and/or another Company Subsidiary, free and clear
of all Liens. The Company has heretofore made available to Buyer complete and
correct copies of the articles of incorporation and bylaws or other
organizational documents of each of the Company Subsidiaries, each as amended to
date.

         5.5 No Violation.

         (a) Except as set forth on Section 5.5(a) of the Company Disclosure
Letter, neither the execution and delivery by the Company of this Agreement nor

accelerate vesting under, the Company Stock Option Plan, or any grant or award
made thereunder or (iii) violate, or conflict with, or result in a breach of any
provision of, or constitute a default (or an event which, with notice or lapse
of time or both, would constitute a default) under, or result in the payment of
a consent fee or penalty or in the termination or in a right of termination or
cancellation of, or accelerate the maturity date of the performance required by,
or result in the creation of any lien, security interest, charge or encumbrance
upon any of the properties of the Company under, or result in being declared
void, voidable or without further binding effect, any of the terms, conditions
or provisions of any Commitment.

         (b) Except as set forth in Section 5.5(b) of the Company Disclosure
Letter, no consent, approval, order or authorization of, or registration,
declaration or filing with or notice to, or permit from any Governmental Entity,
is required by or with respect to the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries
in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company
or each of the applicable Company Subsidiaries or the consummation by the
Company or the applicable Company Subsidiaries of the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby, except for: (i) the filing with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the "SEC") of (A) a proxy statement in preliminary and definitive
form relating to the meeting of the Company's shareholders held in connection
with the Merger (the "Proxy Statement") and (B) such reports under Section 13(a)
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"); (ii)
the filing of the Articles of Merger with, and the acceptance for record of the
Articles of Merger by the SDAT; and (iii) the filing of the Certificate of
Merger under the DLLCA and the MGCL.

         5.6 SEC Documents. The Company has delivered or made available to Buyer
each registration statement, report, proxy statement or information statement
and all exhibits thereto prepared by it or relating to its properties (including
registration statements covering mortgage pass-through certificates) filed with
the SEC since January 1, 1999, (collectively, the "Company Reports"). The
Company Reports, which were filed, in all material respects, with the SEC in a
timely manner, constitute all forms, reports and documents required to be filed
by the Company under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder (the "Securities Laws"). As of their
respective dates, the Company Reports (i) complied as to form in all material
respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Laws and (ii) did
not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements made
therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. Each of the consolidated balance sheets of the Company included in
or incorporated by reference into the Company Reports (including the related
notes and schedules) fairly presents the consolidated financial position of the
Company as of its date and each of the consolidated statements of income,
retained earnings and cash flows of the Company included in or incorporated by
reference into the Company Reports (including any related notes and schedules)
fairly presents the results of operations, retained earnings or cash flows, as
the case may be, of the Company for the periods set forth therein (subject, in
the case of unaudited statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments which

written notice of any pending or threatened material investigation or review of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary by any Governmental Entity, and, to the
Company's knowledge, no such material investigation or review has been
threatened by any Governmental Entity.

         5.8 Absence of Certain Changes; Undisclosed Liabilities.

         (a) Except as disclosed in the Company Reports filed with the SEC prior
to the date hereof, as contemplated by this Agreement or as disclosed in Section
5.8(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter, since September 30, 2000, the Company
has conducted its business only in the ordinary course and there has not been
(i) any Company Material Adverse Effect, (ii) any declaration, setting aside or
payment of any dividend or other distribution with respect to the Company

Commitments otherwise disclosed herein or in the Disclosure Letter, (iv) any
change in the Company's capital structure, (v) any material amendment of any

         (b) Except as set forth in the Company Disclosure Letter, there are no
liabilities of the Company (whether absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise)
other than: (i) any liability reflected on the financial statements included in
the Company Reports; (ii) immaterial liabilities (not in excess of $25,000 in
the aggregate) not required to be reflected on the financial statements included
in the Company Reports; or (iii) liabilities incurred in contemplation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the continuing
liquidation of the Company's assets and the formation of the Liquidating Trust
or incurred in the ordinary course of business since the date of the periods
reflected in the financial statements included in the Company Reports, which
liabilities will either be paid by the Company prior to the Effective Time, be
assumed by the Liquidating Trust or be reflected in the Working Capital
Calculation to be prepared and presented pursuant to Section 4.2(c).

         5.9 Taxes. (a) Except as set forth on Section 5.9(a) of the Company
Disclosure Letter, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries (i) have timely
filed all federal Tax Returns, state and local income and franchise Tax Returns
and all other material Tax Returns required to be filed by them, or requests for
extensions have been timely filed and any such request has been


                                       13

<PAGE>   20

granted and has not expired. All such Tax Returns are true, correct and complete
in all material respects. The Company and the Company Subsidiaries have timely
paid all Taxes that are due and payable. The most recent audited financial
statements contained in the Company Reports reflect an adequate reserve for all
material Taxes payable by the Company for all taxable periods and portions
thereof through the date of such financial statements. The Company and each
Company Subsidiary has established (and until the Closing Date shall continue to
establish and maintain) on its books and records reserves that are adequate for
the payment of all Taxes that have accrued but that are not yet due and payable.
The Tax Returns of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries have not been
examined or audited by any Taxing Authority except for such examinations or
audits that, individually or in the aggregate, are not material. The Company and
each of the Company Subsidiaries has disclosed to the Internal Revenue Service
("IRS") all positions taken on its Tax Returns which could give rise to a
substantial understatement of tax under Section 6662 of the Code. The Company
has not executed or filed with the IRS or any other Taxing Authority any
agreement now in effect extending the period for assessment or collection of any
Taxes. The Company is not a party to any pending audit, action or proceeding by
any Governmental Entity for assessment or collection of Taxes, no claim for
assessment or collection of Taxes has been asserted against the Company or any
of the Company Subsidiaries and, to the knowledge of the Company, there are no
pending or proposed inquiries being made by any Tax Authority with respect to
material Taxes or any material Tax Return, including claims by any Tax Authority
in a jurisdiction where the Company or any Company Subsidiary do not file Tax
Returns but in which any of them may be subject to taxation. True, correct and
complete copies of all income or franchise Tax Returns filed by the Company and
all communications relating thereto have been delivered to Buyer or made
available to representatives of Buyer. As used in this Agreement, "Tax" or
"Taxes" shall include all federal, state, local and foreign income, property,
sales, use, occupancy, transfer, recording, withholding, franchise, employment,
excise and other taxes, tariffs or governmental charges of any nature
whatsoever, together with penalties, interest or additions to Tax with respect
thereto. As used in this Agreement, "Tax Return" or "Tax Returns" shall include
all original and amended returns and reports (including elections, claims,
declarations, disclosures, schedules, estimates, computations and information
returns) required to be supplied to a Tax Authority in any jurisdiction. For
purposes of this Agreement, "Tax Authority" shall mean the IRS and any other
domestic or foreign bureau, department, entity, agency or other Governmental
Entity responsible for the administration of any Tax.

         (b) The Company (i) has elected to be taxed as a real estate investment
trust (a "REIT") within the meaning of the Code commencing with its first
taxable year, which ended December 31, 1994, (ii) has been subject to taxation
as a REIT within the meaning of Section 856 of the Code and has satisfied all
requirements to qualify as a REIT for all taxable years commencing with its
taxable year ended December 31, 1994 through its taxable year ended December 31,
1999, (iii) has operated since December 31, 1999 and will operate through the
Closing Date (up to and including the Merger) in such a manner so as to qualify
as a REIT for its taxable year ending as a result of the Merger and (iv) has not
taken or omitted to take any action that could reasonably be expected to result
in a loss of its status as a REIT, and no challenge to the Company's status as a
REIT by any Tax Authority is pending or, to the Company's knowledge, threatened.


                                       14

<PAGE>   21

         (c) Each Company Subsidiary that is a partnership or limited liability
company or files Tax Returns as a partnership for federal income tax purposes
has since its acquisition by the Company been classified for federal income tax
purposes as a partnership or disregarded entity and not as an association
taxable as a corporation or a publicly traded partnership within the meaning of
Section 7704(b) of the Code.

         (d) The Board adopted a plan of liquidation on September 14, 2000,
which was approved by the shareholders of the Company on November 9, 2000, and
the Company has made distributions to its shareholders of a portion of the
proceeds of sales of assets occurring following the adoption of such plan of
liquidation.

         (e) Since December 31, 1999, the Company has incurred no liability for
any material Taxes under Sections 857(b), 860(c) or 4981 of the Code, or IRS
Notice 88-19 or Treasury Regulation Section 1.337(d)-5T, including, without
limitation, any material Tax arising from a prohibited transaction described in
Section 857(b)(6) of the Code, and neither the Company nor the Company
Subsidiaries has incurred any material liability for Taxes other than in the
ordinary course of business and other than transfer and similar Taxes arising
from sales of property. No event has occurred, and no condition or circumstance
exists, which could reasonably be expected to result in any Tax described in the
preceding sentence being imposed on the Company or any Company Subsidiary. The
sale of the Company's assets pursuant to the Merger and the transfer of assets
to the Liquidating Trust will not cause the Company to fail to qualify as a REIT
under Section 856(c)(2) or (3) of the Code for the taxable year ending as a
result of the Merger.

         (f) All material Taxes that the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries was required to withhold, including material Taxes required to have
been withheld in connection with amounts owing to any employee, independent
contractor, creditor, shareholder or other third party and sales, gross receipts
and use Taxes, have been withheld and paid over to the proper Governmental
Entities to the extent required.

         (g) There are no Tax liens on the assets of the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries except for statutory liens for Taxes not yet due.

         (h) Except as set forth in Section 5.9(h) of the Company Disclosure
Letter, neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries have made any
payments, are obligated to make any payments, or are parties to an agreement
that could obligate them to make any payments that will not be deductible under
Section 280G of the Code.

         (i) The Company is a "United States Person" within the meaning of
Section 1445(f)(3) of the Code.

         (j) Other than withholding Taxes incurred in the ordinary course of
business that have been properly withheld but are not yet required to be
deposited with the Tax Authority, the Company does not have any material
liability for the Taxes of any person other than the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries, and the Company Subsidiaries do not have any material liability
for the Taxes of any person other than the Company and the Company Subsidiaries,
(A) under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of
state, local or foreign law), (B) as a transferee or successor, (C) by contract
or (D) otherwise. Neither


                                       15

<PAGE>   22

the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries is a party to, nor has any
liability under (including liability with respect to any predecessor entity),
any indemnification, allocation or sharing agreement with respect to Taxes.

         (k) Neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries holds any
asset that is subject to a consent filed pursuant to Section 341(f) of the Code
and the regulations thereunder.

         (l) Neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries has failed
to distribute realized net capital gains designated as capital gain dividends
pursuant to Section 857(b)(3) of the Code on or prior to the last day of the
Company's taxable year to which such designation relates.

         (m) To the knowledge of the Company, the Company is a
"domestically-controlled REIT" within the meaning of Section 897(h)(4)(B) of the
Code.

         5.10 Books and Records.

penalty under Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502(i) of ERISA. Each Company
Benefit Plan has been maintained and administered in all material respects in
compliance with its terms and with ERISA and the Code to the extent applicable
thereto. To the knowledge of the Company, there are no pending or anticipated
claims against or otherwise involving any of the Company Benefit Plans and no
suit, action or


                                       21

<PAGE>   28

other litigation (excluding claims for benefits incurred in the ordinary course
of Company Benefit Plan activities) has been brought against or with respect to
any such Company Benefit Plan, except for any of the foregoing which would not
have a Company Material Adverse Effect. All material contributions required to
be made as of the date hereof to the Company Benefit Plans have been timely made
or provided for. Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has contributed to,
or been required to contribute to, any "multiemployer plan" (as defined in
Sections 3(37) and 4001(a)(3) of ERISA). The Company does not maintain or
contribute to any plan, program, policy or arrangement which provides or has any
liability to provide life insurance, medical or other employee welfare benefits
or supplemental pension benefits to any employee or former employee upon his
retirement or termination of employment, except as required under Section 4890B
of the Code, and the Company has never represented, promised or contracted
(whether in oral or written form) to any employee or former employee that such
benefits would be provided. Except as set forth in Section 5.15 of the Company
Disclosure Letter, (i) no Company Benefit Plan is or has been covered by Title
IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code, (ii) the execution of, and performance
of the transactions contemplated in, this Agreement will not (either alone or
upon the occurrence of any additional subsequent events) constitute an event
under any benefit plan, program, policy, arrangement or agreement or any trust
or loan that will or may result in any payment (whether of severance pay or
otherwise), acceleration, forgiveness of indebtedness, vesting, distribution,
increase in benefits or obligations to fund benefits with respect to any
employee, director or consultant of the Company, or otherwise result in the
payment of any "excess parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G of
the Code with respect to a current or former employee of the Company, (iii) no
stock or other security issued by the Company is part of the assets of any
Company Benefit Plan, and (iv) there are no severance agreements, noncompetition
agreements or employment agreements between the Company and any employee of the
Company. There are no Company Benefit Plans which do not have a termination date
(within the meaning of ERISA Section 4041(a)(2)) prior to the date hereof and
which are or ever have been subject to Title IV of ERISA, and there is no and
will not be any material liability to the Company or any of its ERISA Affiliates
arising in connection with the maintenance or termination of any Company Benefit
Plan with a termination date prior to the date hereof. For purposes of the
Section 5.15 "ERISA Affiliate" shall mean each entity, whether or not
incorporated, under common control with the Company pursuant to Code Section
414(b), (c), (m), or (o).

         5.16 Labor Matters. The Company is not a party to, or bound by, any
collective bargaining agreement, contract or other agreement or understanding
with a labor union or labor union organization. There is no unfair labor
practice or labor arbitration proceeding pending or, to the knowledge of the
Company, threatened against the Company relating to its business. To the
knowledge of the Company, there are no organizational efforts with respect to
the formation of a collective bargaining unit presently being made or threatened
involving employees of the Company.

         5.17 No Brokers. The Company has not entered into any contract,
arrangement or understanding with any person or firm which may result in the
obligation of the Company or Buyer to pay any finder's fees, brokerage or
agent's commissions or other like payments in connection with the negotiations
leading to this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby, except that the Company has retained Morgan Stanley Dean Witter ("MSDW")
as its financial advisor, pursuant to an engagement letter dated March 28,


                                       22

<PAGE>   29

2000, a true and correct copy of which has been delivered to Buyer prior to the
date hereof. Other than the foregoing arrangement, the Company is not aware of
any claim for payment of any finder's fees, brokerage or agent's commissions or
other like payments in connection with the negotiations leading to this
Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

         5.18 Opinion of Financial Advisor. The Company has received the opinion
of MSDW to the effect that, as of the date hereof, the Merger Consideration to
be received by the holders of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Merger is
fair to such holders from a financial point of view.

into by the Company which may result in total payments or liability in excess of
$100,000 on an annual basis, other than the Loan Documents, Leases, Maintenance
Contracts, Construction Contracts, and tenant reimbursements and leases entered
into in the ordinary course. True and correct copies of the foregoing have been
previously delivered or made available to Buyer and are listed on the Company
Disclosure Letter or included in the Company Reports. Each of the contracts and
Commitments described in the preceding sentence is in full force and effect; the
Company is not in default respecting any payment obligations under such

Company is a party are set forth on the Company Disclosure Letter and the
Company is not in default with respect to any obligations, which individually or
in the aggregate are material, thereunder.

         (b) Except as set forth in Section 5.19(b) of the Company Disclosure
Letter, there is no confidentiality agreement, non-competition agreement or
other contract or agreement that contains covenants that restrict the Company's
ability to conduct its business in any location in a manner that is material to
the business of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries.

         (c) Except as set forth in Section 5.19(c) of the Company Disclosure

<PAGE>   30

or subsequent events) (i) constitute an event under any Company Benefit Plan,
policy, practice, agreement or other arrangement or any trust or loan (the
"Employee Arrangements") that will or may result in any payment (whether of
severance pay or otherwise), acceleration, forgiveness of indebtedness, vesting,
distribution, increase in benefits or obligation to fund benefits with respect
to any employee, director or consultant of the Company or (ii) result in the
triggering or imposition of any restrictions or limitations on the right of the
Company or the Surviving Entity to amend or terminate any Employee Arrangement
and receive the full amount of any excess assets remaining or resulting from
such amendment or termination, subject to applicable taxes. Except as set forth
in Section 5.21 of the Company Disclosure Letter, no payment or benefit which
will be required to be made pursuant to the terms of any agreement, commitment
or Company Benefit Plan, as a result of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, to any officer, director or employee of the Company, will be
characterized as an "excess parachute payment" within the meaning of Section
280G(b)(l) of the Code.

         5.22 State Takeover Statutes. Assuming that presently or at any time
within two years prior to the date hereof (i) Buyer is not and has not been an
"interested shareholder" of the Company, and (ii) Buyer has not been an
"affiliate of an interested shareholder" of the Company, all within the meaning
of Section 3-601 of the MGCL, the Company has taken all action necessary to
exempt the transactions contemplated by this Agreement from the operation of any
applicable "fair price," "moratorium," "control share acquisition" or any other
applicable anti-takeover statute or similar statute enacted under the state or
federal laws of the United States or similar statute or regulation.

         5.23 Rights Plan. The Merger will not trigger a "Distribution Date"

plan or mechanism adopted by the Company that has the effect or purpose of
discouraging an acquisition of all or any portion of the Company, whether by
means of a merger, tender offer, acquisition of assets or stock, or otherwise,
the "Rights Plan"). In the event the Merger would trigger or activate any
provision of such Rights Plan, the Company shall take all actions necessary
(including action by its Board of Directors) to permit the Buyer to complete the
Merger without triggering any such "Distribution Date."

Letter, the Company has not during the three years preceding the date of this
Agreement been a party to any proceeding, lawsuit or litigation, in any such

adverse to the Company, that involved or may involve a claim of infringement by
any person of any Intellectual Property Right. To the knowledge of the Company,
no such proceeding, lawsuit or litigation has been threatened.

         (c) Except as set forth in Section 5.25 of the Company Disclosure

                     REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF BUYER

         Except as set forth in the disclosure letter delivered at or prior to
the execution hereof to the Company, which shall refer to the relevant Sections
of this Agreement (the "Buyer Disclosure Letter"), Buyer represents and warrants
to the Company as follows:

         6.1 Existence; Good Standing; Authority; Compliance With Law. Buyer is
a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the
laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation. Buyer is duly licensed or qualified
to do business as a foreign corporation and is in good standing under the laws
of any other state of the United States in which the character of the properties
owned or leased by it therein or in which the transaction of its business makes
such qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified would
not have a material adverse effect on the business, assets, results of
operations or condition (financial or otherwise) of Buyer taken as a whole (a
"Buyer Material Adverse Effect"). Buyer has all requisite power and authority to
own, operate, lease and encumber its properties and carry on its business as it
is now being conducted. Buyer does not have, and at the Closing will not have,
any Subsidiaries. Buyer is not in violation of any order of any Governmental
Entity, or any Applicable Law, to which Buyer or any of its properties or assets
is subject, where such violation would have a Buyer Material Adverse Effect. To
the knowledge of Buyer, Buyer has obtained all licenses, permits and other
authorizations and has taken all actions required by Applicable Law in
connection with its business as now conducted, where the failure to obtain any
such item or to take any such action would have a Buyer Material Adverse Effect.
True and correct copies of Buyer's articles of incorporation, bylaws,
certificate of formation, limited liability company agreement, and other
organization documents have been previously delivered or made available to the
Company.


                                       25

<PAGE>   32

         6.2 Authorization, Validity and Effect of Agreements. Buyer has the
requisite power and authority to enter into the transactions contemplated hereby
and to execute and deliver this Agreement. The consummation by Buyer of this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby has been duly authorized by
all requisite action on the part of Buyer. This Agreement constitutes the valid
and legally binding obligations of Buyer, enforceable against Buyer in
accordance with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
moratorium or other similar laws relating to creditors' rights and general
principles of equity.

         6.3 No Violation. Except as set forth in Section 6.3 of the Buyer
Disclosure Letter, neither the execution and delivery by Buyer of this Agreement
nor the consummation by Buyer of the transactions contemplated hereby in
accordance with the terms hereof, will (i) conflict with or result in a breach
of any provisions of the articles of incorporation or bylaws of Buyer, (ii)
violate, or conflict with, or result in a breach of any provision of, or
constitute a default (or an event which, with notice or lapse of time or both,
would constitute a default) under any order, writ, injunction, decree, law,
statute, rule or regulation applicable to Buyer or any of its properties or
assets, or (iii) require any consent, approval or authorization of, or
declaration, filing or registration with, any Governmental Entity, other than
the Regulatory Filings or such other filings which, if not obtained or made,
would not prevent or delay in any material respect the consummation of any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or otherwise prevent Buyer from
performing its obligations under this Agreement in any material respect.

         6.4 Litigation. There are (i) no orders, injunctions or decrees of any
court, arbitrator or Governmental Entity to which Buyer or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of its properties or assets are bound
and (ii) no actions, suits or proceedings pending against Buyer or any of its
Subsidiaries or, to the knowledge of Buyer, threatened in writing against Buyer
or any of its Subsidiaries at law or in equity, or before or by any federal or
state commission, board, bureau, agency or instrumentality, all if adversely
determined, that in the case of clauses (i) or (ii) above would have a material
adverse effect on the ability of Buyer to perform its obligations under this
Agreement or would delay or prevent the consummation of the transaction
contemplated by this Agreement.

         6.5 No Brokers. Except as set forth in Section 6.3 of the Buyer
Disclosure Letter, Buyer has not entered into any contract, arrangement or
understanding with any person or firm which may result in the obligation of the
Company or Buyer to pay any finder's fees, brokerage or agent's commissions or
other like payments in connection with the negotiations leading to this
Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. Other
than the foregoing arrangements, Buyer is not aware of any claim for payment of
any finder's fees, brokerage or agent's commissions or other like payments in
connection with the negotiations leading to this Agreement or the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby.

         6.6 Financing. Subject to the satisfaction of the conditions specified
in the Commitment Letter, Buyer has, or has available to it, all funds necessary
to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

                                    COVENANTS

         7.1 Solicitation; Negotiations.

         (a) Subject to Section 7.1(b), unless and until this Agreement shall
have been terminated in accordance with its terms, the Company agrees and
covenants that, except as contemplated by this Agreement (including without
limitation, the contemplated transfers to the Liquidating Trust), neither the
Company nor any of its respective Company Subsidiaries or Affiliates, shall, and
each of them shall direct and cause their respective officers, directors and
employees, and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause their agents
and representatives (including, without limitation, any investment banker,
attorney or accountant retained by it or any of the Company Subsidiaries), not
to, directly or indirectly, initiate, solicit or encourage any inquiries or the
making or implementation of any proposal or offer with respect to (i) any
merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination or similar
transaction involving the Company (or any of the Company Subsidiaries); (ii) any
sale, lease, exchange, mortgage, pledge, transfer or other disposition of 30% or
more of the assets of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole
(measured after the contemplated transfers to the Liquidating Trust), in a
single transaction or series of related transactions, or (iii) any tender offer
or exchange offer for 30% or more of the outstanding equity securities of the
Company (any such proposal or offer being hereinafter referred to as an
"Acquisition Proposal") or engage in any negotiations with, or provide any
non-public information or data to, or have any discussions with, any person
relating to, an Acquisition Proposal, or otherwise facilitate any effort or
attempt to make or implement an Acquisition Proposal. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, nothing contained in this Section 7.1(a) shall prohibit the Company
from engaging in the actions permitted by Section 7.2(b) hereof.

         (b) The Company shall notify Buyer in writing (as promptly as
practicable but in any event within 48 hours of its receipt of any Acquisition
Proposal) and keep Buyer promptly informed of all developments relating to
Acquisition Proposals (including the identity of the parties, the price and
other terms thereof) which it or any of the Company Subsidiaries or any officer,
director, employee, agent, investment banker, financial advisor, attorney,
accountant, broker, finder or other representative of the Company may receive
relating to any of such matters and shall, subject to attorney-client privilege
with regard to communications between the Company and its counsel, provide Buyer
with all written copies of all communication exchanged in connection with any
such Acquisition Proposal.

         (c) Notwithstanding anything set forth in this Agreement to the
contrary, the Board of the Company may, to the extent required by its fiduciary
obligations as determined by such Board in good faith after consultation with
outside counsel, furnish information to or enter into discussions or
negotiations with any person that makes an unsolicited bona fide Acquisition
Proposal, if the Board of the Company determines in good faith that the
Acquisition Proposal is reasonably likely to result in a transaction more
favorable to the Company's shareholders from a financial point of view than the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (any such Acquisition Proposal being
referred to herein as a "Superior Proposal"). If the Board of the Company is
prepared to accept the Superior Proposal, then the Company shall give Buyer 72


                                       27

<PAGE>   34

hours notice that the Board of the Company is prepared to accept the Superior
Proposal, provided that the Company may not definitively accept a Superior
Proposal unless the Company concurrently therewith terminates this Agreement
pursuant to Section 9.3 and, promptly after such termination, makes the payments
required by Section 9.6.

         7.2 Conduct of Business.

         Company;

                (iv) shall promptly deliver to Buyer true and correct copies of

         other similar transaction, (B) grant, confer or award any option,
         warrant, conversion right or other right not existing on the date
         hereof to acquire any shares of its capital stock, (C) materially

<PAGE>   38

         (b) Neither the Company nor Buyer shall supply information for
inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement that will, at the
date mailed to the Company shareholders or at the Effective Time, contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required
to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. If at any
time prior to the Effective Time any event with respect to the Company or the
Company Subsidiaries, or with respect to other information supplied by the
Company for inclusion in the Proxy Statement, shall occur which is required to
be described in an amendment of, or a supplement to, the Proxy Statement, the
Company shall so describe such event, and shall promptly file such amendment or
supplement (if required to be filed) with the SEC. The Company shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Proxy Statement or other
information supplied by the Company for inclusion or incorporation by reference
therein, to comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable
provisions of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
thereunder.

         (c) The Company shall take all actions necessary in accordance with
Maryland law, its articles of incorporation and bylaws to duly call, give notice
of, convene and hold a meeting of its shareholders as promptly as practicable to
consider and vote upon the adoption and approval of this Agreement and the

the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Company may adjourn or postpone
(i) the Meeting to the extent necessary to ensure that any necessary supplement
or amendment to the Proxy Statement is provided to the Company's shareholders in
advance of a vote on the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (ii) the
time for which the Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy
Statement), if there are insufficient shares represented, either in person or by
proxy, to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Meeting;
provided that the Company may not adjourn or postpone the Meeting under this
clause (ii) for longer than 30 days without the consent of Buyer, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld.

         (d) The Company will promptly inform Buyer of the results of the
Meeting and the satisfaction or non-satisfaction of the condition set forth in

"commercially reasonable efforts" to obtain consents, approvals, waivers or
exemptions shall not include any obligation by a party without the consent of
such party to agree to an adverse modification of the terms of any agreement,
arrangement, instrument or understanding, to prepay existing or incur additional
obligations to any other party, to incur liabilities or to make payments for
such matters. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further action is

representatives, reasonable access during normal business hours during the

Commitments, personnel and records and, during such period, the Company shall,
and shall each cause of the Company Subsidiaries to, furnish promptly to Buyer
(i) a copy of each report, schedule, registration statement and other document
filed by it during such period pursuant to the requirements of Federal or state
securities Laws and (ii) to the extent allowable under Applicable Law, all other
information concerning its business, properties and personnel as Buyer may

         (b) The cost of obtaining the policies and or binding commitments will

         (c) On the Insurance Date, the Company may, in its discretion, notify
Buyer in writing that the Company has determined that premiums to be charged for
such policies are not, taken as a whole, commercially reasonable. If the Company
delivers such notice, the Buyer may terminate this Agreement at any time after
the expiration of ten (10) business days after the delivery of such notice;
provided that the parties, during such ten (10) business day period, shall use
their good faith efforts to negotiate in order to make such premiums
commercially reasonable. At the end of such ten (10) business day period, Buyer
shall notify the Company in writing of its decision to either (i) terminate this
Agreement, (ii) pay any premium amounts in excess of commercially reasonable
premiums or (iii) adjust the proposed insurance parameters set forth in Section

supply Buyer with written documentation prepared by the proposed insurance
companies, which terms shall specify in reasonable detail the proposed limits on

and other terms including the deductible, coverage limits and premium costs.
Within a five (5) business day period after the delivery of such notice and such
written documentation, Buyer shall notify the Company in writing whether or not
it agrees that the Proposed Policies will satisfy the parameters set forth in
Section 7.18(a). If the Buyer fails to deliver such notice it shall be deemed to
have accepted such Proposed Policies. If the Buyer notifies the Company in
writing that the Proposed Policies do not satisfy the parameters set forth in
Section 7.18(a), the parties, during the period ending ten (10) business days
after the delivery of Buyer's notice, shall use their good faith efforts to
negotiate in order to make such Proposed Policies reasonably acceptable to
Buyer. At the end of such ten (10) business day period, Buyer shall notify the
Company in writing of its decision to, in its discretion, either (i) terminate
this Agreement or (ii) accept the terms of the Proposed Policies. The Proposed
Policies, in the form as may be accepted by Buyer under the terms of this
Section 7.18(d) shall be defined herein as the "Accepted Policies."

         (e) The Buyer may terminate this Agreement if the Accepted Policies are
not in place on the date otherwise scheduled for the Closing of the Merger under
this Agreement, or if the Company fails to deliver, on the Insurance Date, the
notice and other information described in Section 7.18(d).

         (a) If this Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to Sections 9.2(b),
9.3(a), 9.4(c) or 9.4(d), then the Company will pay Buyer (provided the Company
was not entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.3(b) or
9.3(c) at the time of such termination, in which case no such fee will be
payable) a termination fee equal to $2,000,000 plus reimbursement of
out-of-pocket fees, costs and expenses of the Buyer incurred in connection with
this Agreement in the amount of $750,000 (regardless of the actual amount of
such expenses).


                                       41

<PAGE>   48

         (b) If this Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to Section 7.18,
9.4(a) or 9.4(b), then the Company will pay Buyer (provided the Company was not
entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.3(b) or 9.3(c) at the
time of such termination, in which case no such fee will be payable)
reimbursement of expenses in the amount of $750,000 (regardless of the actual
amount of such expenses). In addition, if within 12 months of any termination
hereof that results in such reimbursement of expenses in the amount of $750,000
being paid, the Company consummates an Acquisition Proposal transaction with a
third party, then the Company will pay Buyer an additional termination fee of
$2,000,000.

         (c) If this Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to Section 9.3(b) or
9.3(c), then Buyer will pay the Company (provided that Buyer was not entitled to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.4 or Section 7.18 hereof at the
time of such termination, in which case no such fee will be payable)
reimbursement of expenses in the amount of $750,000 (regardless of the actual
amount of such expenses).

         (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement (other
than in the case of a willful breach), each of Buyer and the Company expressly
acknowledges and agrees that, with respect to any circumstances where a fee or
reimbursement expenses are payable in accordance with Section 9.6(a), Section
9.6(b) or Section 9.6(c), as the case may be, the payment of a fee or
reimbursement expenses shall constitute liquidated damages with respect to any
claim for damages or any other claim which Buyer or the Company, as the case may
be, would otherwise be entitled to assert against the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries or Buyer, as the case may be, or any of their respective
assets, or against any of their respective directors, officers, employees,
partners, managers, members, affiliates or stockholders, with respect to this
Agreement and shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedy available to Buyer
or the Company, as the case may be. The parties hereto expressly acknowledge and
agree that, in light of the difficulty of accurately determining actual damages
with respect to the foregoing upon any termination of this Agreement in
circumstances where a fee or reimbursement expenses are payable in accordance
with Section 9.6(a), Section 9.6(b) or Section 9.6(c), as the case may be, the
right to payment under any of such subsections of Section 9.6: (i) constitutes a
reasonable estimate of the damages that will be suffered by reason of any such
proposed or actual termination of this Agreement pursuant to said section, and
(ii) shall be in full and complete satisfaction of any and all damages arising
as a result of the foregoing (other than in the case of a willful breach).
Except for nonpayment of the amounts set forth in Section 9.6(a), Section 9.6(b)
or Section 9.6(c), as the case may be, each of Buyer and the Company hereby
agrees that, upon any termination of this Agreement in circumstances where a fee
or reimbursement expenses are payable in accordance with Section 9.6(a), Section
9.6(b) or Section 9.6(c), as the case may be, in no event (other than in the
case of willful breach), shall Buyer or the Company, as the case may be, (A)
seek to obtain any recovery or judgment against the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries or Buyer, as the case may be, or any of their respective
assets, or against any of their respective directors, officers, employees,
partners, managers, members, affiliates or stockholders, or (B) be entitled to
seek or obtain any other damages of any kind, including, without limitation,
consequential, indirect or punitive damages.

         (e) In the event of termination of this Agreement and the abandonment
of the Merger pursuant to this Article 9, all obligations of the parties hereto

9 and Section 7.7 and except for the provisions of Sections 10.3, 10.4, 10.5,
10.6, 10.8, 10.9, 10.12, 10.13 and 10.14, and except to the extent that such

obligations or other acts of the other parties hereto, (b) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties made to such party contained
herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive compliance

herein. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or
waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on
behalf of such party.

instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall not survive the Merger,
provided, however, that the agreements contained in Article 4, the last sentence
of Section 7.5, Section 7.6, Section 7.7, and this Article 10 shall survive the
Merger.

         10.5 Amendment. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto, by
action taken by their respective Boards of Directors, at any time before or
after the obtaining of the Company Shareholder Approval and prior to the filing
of the Articles of Merger with the SDAT of Maryland and the filing of the
Certificate of Merger with the Delaware Secretary of State in accordance with
the DLLCA; provided, however, that after such Company Shareholder Approval is
obtained, no amendment shall be made which requires the further approval of
shareholders without obtaining such further approval. This Agreement may not be
amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the
parties hereto.

         10.6 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed
in accordance with the laws of the State of Maryland without regard to its rules
of conflict of laws, except that the validity of the Merger shall be governed by
the MGCL and the DLLCA. Each of the Company and Buyer hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally consents to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts
of the State of Maryland and of the United States of America located in the
State of Maryland (the "Maryland Courts") for any litigation arising out of or
relating to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (and agrees
not to commence any litigation relating thereto except in such courts), waives
any objection to the laying of venue of any such litigation in the Maryland
Courts and agrees not to plead or claim in any Maryland Court that such
litigation brought therein has been brought in an inconvenient forum.

         10.7 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed by the parties hereto
in separate counterparts, each of which when so executed and delivered shall be
an original, but all such counterparts shall together constitute one and the
same instrument. Each counterpart may consist of a number of copies hereof each
signed by less than all, but together signed by all of the parties hereto.

         10.8 Headings. Headings of the Articles and Sections of this Agreement
are for the convenience of the parties only, and shall be given no substantive
or interpretive effect whatsoever.

         (a) In this Agreement, unless the context otherwise requires, words
describing the singular number shall include the plural and vice versa, and
words denoting any gender shall include all genders and words denoting natural
persons shall include corporations and partnerships and vice versa.

         (b) Any item or matter disclosed in a particular Schedule of the
Company Disclosure Letter or the Buyer Disclosure Letter, as the case may be,
shall be deemed disclosed in all other Schedules of such Disclosure Letter.

         10.10 Extension; Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the
parties may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or
other acts of the other party, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations
or warranties of the other party contained in this Agreement or in any document
delivered pursuant to this Agreement or (c) subject to the proviso of Section
10.5, waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions of the other
party contained in this Agreement. Any agreement on the part of a party to any
such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of such party. The failure of any party to this
Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall
not constitute a waiver of those rights.

         10.11 Incorporation. The Company Disclosure Letter and the Buyer
Disclosure Letter and all Exhibits attached hereto and thereto and referred to
herein and therein are hereby incorporated herein and made a part hereof for all
purposes as if fully set forth herein.

         10.12 Severability. Any term or provision of this Agreement which is
invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction, be
ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without
rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this
Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of any of the terms or
provisions of this Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If any provision of this
Agreement is so broad as to be unenforceable, the provision shall be interpreted
to be only so broad as is enforceable.

         10.13 Enforcement of Agreement. The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this
Agreement was not performed in accordance with its specific terms or was
otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled
to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any Maryland court, this
being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in
equity.
