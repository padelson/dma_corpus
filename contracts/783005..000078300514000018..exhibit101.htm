within sixty (60) days following the LMA Commencement Date, or such earlier or
later date as shall be mutually agreed to by Seller and Buyer, an itemized
list (the "Adjustment List") of all sums that are an increase or decrease to
the Purchase Price, with a brief explanation thereof. Such list shall show the
net amount of the increase or decrease to the Purchase Price (the "Adjustment
Amount"). If the Adjustment Amount is a decrease to the Purchase Price, Seller
shall pay such amount to Buyer; if the Adjustment Amount is an increase to the
Purchase Price, Buyer shall pay such amount to Seller. Except as provided
otherwise in Section 2.4(f), payment of the Adjustment Amount shall be made at
the First Closing.

(f) Not later than ten (10) business days following the delivery of the
Adjustment List, Seller may furnish Buyer with written notification of any
dispute concerning any items shown thereon or omitted therefrom together with
a detailed explanation in support of Seller's position in respect thereof.
Buyer and Seller shall consult to resolve any such dispute for a period of ten
(10) business days following the notification thereof. In the event of any
such dispute, that portion of the Adjustment Amount that is not in dispute
shall be paid to the party entitled to receive the same on the day for payment
provided in Section 2.4(e). If such ten (10) business day consultation period
expires and the dispute has not been resolved, the matter shall be referred to
an independent public accounting firm mutually agreed upon by Seller and Buyer
(the "Accountants"), which shall resolve the dispute and shall render its
decision (together with a brief explanation of the basis therefore) to Buyer
and Seller not later than twenty (20) business days following submission of
the dispute to it; provided, however, if Buyer and Seller are unable to
mutually agree upon an independent public accounting firm, then Buyer and
Seller shall each choose an independent public accounting firm and those firms
shall appoint a third independent public accounting firm to act as the
Accountants. The disputed portion of the Adjustment Amount (the "Disputed
Amount") shall be paid by the party required to pay the same within five (5)
business days after the delivery of a copy of such decision to Seller and
Buyer. The fees and expenses of the Accountants shall be shared equally by
Seller and Buyer.

(g) The Adjustment List (to the extent not disputed within the specified
period by Seller), any mutually agreed written settlement of any such dispute
concerning the Adjustment List and any determination of the Disputed Amount by
the Accountants shall be final, conclusive and binding on the parties hereto
absent manifest error.

Section 2.6. Non-Assumption of Liabilities. Buyer does not and shall not
assume or become obligated to pay any debt, obligation or Liability of any
kind or nature of Seller or the Stations, whether or not incurred or accrued

consideration within the meaning of and for the purposes of Section 1060 of

acquired by Buyer hereunder, as applicable, in the manner required by Section

Buyer shall deliver to Seller a proposed allocation prepared in accordance
with the foregoing, which allocation shall be based on the results of an
appraisal of the Purchased Assets conducted, at Buyer's sole expense, by
BIA/Kelsey. Thereafter, to the extent that Seller disagrees with Buyer's
proposed allocation, Buyer and Seller shall negotiate in good faith regarding
the allocation of the Purchase Price in accordance with the requirements of
Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder.
If the parties reach agreement with respect to such allocation, then each
party agrees to complete and timely file IRS Form 8594 (or any successor
form), to file all income Tax Returns in accordance with such allocation, and
to take no action inconsistent with such allocation. If the parties are unable
to reach agreement with respect to such allocation, then the parties shall
have no further obligation under this Section 2.8 and each party shall make
its own determination of such allocation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer
and Seller agree to allocate Two Million Dollars ($2,000,000) of the Purchase
Price to the Owned Real Property.

Section 2.10. Access of Seller. After Closing, Seller and its authorized
agents, officers and representatives, upon prior written request, shall have
access to the appropriate records of Buyer to conduct such examination and
investigation as Seller deems necessary to assure compliance with this Article
2, and to permit Seller to comply with its Tax reporting compliance
requirements, provided that such examination and investigation shall be during
the Stations' normal business hours, shall not unreasonably interfere with the
Stations' operations and activities and shall not constitute Seller's

guidelines.

Section 2.11. Accounts Receivable.

provided, however, that Buyer shall be under no obligation to commence or not
to commence litigation or legal action to effect collection. Any payment

* * *





that is obligated with respect to any Accounts Receivable shall be deposited

(each such payment, a "Specified Payment" and, collectively, the "Specified
Payments"). Any payments that are made directly to Seller during the
Collection Period relating to the Accounts Receivable shall be retained by
Seller. Buyer and its Affiliates shall not discount, adjust or otherwise
compromise any Accounts Receivable and Buyer shall promptly refer any disputed
Accounts Receivable to Seller.

(b) Each Specified Payment received by Seller pursuant to Section 2.10(a) that
is not specifically designated in writing as payment of a particular invoice
or invoices shall be presumptively applied by Seller to the Accounts
Receivable for such customer outstanding for the longest amount of time, and
the portion of each such Specified Payment, if any, that is attributable to
accounts receivable that are not Accounts Receivable (each such portion a
"Remitted Payment" and, collectively, the "Remitted Payments") shall be
remitted by Seller to Buyer; provided, however, that if, after the LMA
Commencement Date, Seller or Buyer received or receives a written notice of
dispute from a customer with respect to an Account Receivable that has not
been resolved, Seller shall apply any payments from such customer to such
customer's oldest, non-disputed accounts receivable, whether or not an
Accounts Receivable.

(c) Following the expiration of the Collection Period, neither Buyer nor
Seller shall have any further obligations under this Section 2.10, except that
Buyer shall immediately pay over to Seller any amounts subsequently paid to it
with respect to any Accounts Receivable. Following the Collection Period,
Seller may pursue collections of all the Accounts Receivable, and Buyer shall
deliver to Seller all files, records, notes and any other materials relating
to the Accounts Receivable and shall otherwise cooperate with Seller for the
purpose of collecting any outstanding Accounts Receivable.

(d) If Seller or Buyer fails to timely remit any amounts collected pursuant to
this Section 2.11, such amount shall bear simple interest at the prime rate
(as reported by The Wall Street Journal or, if not reported thereby, by
another authoritative source) as in effect from time to time from the date any
such amount was due until the date of actual payment.

and, at Buyer's discretion, included in a prospectus or other document
distributed to prospective investors, as required by laws and regulations
applicable to Buyer's parent as a publicly traded company or any other

and the Audit, access to its accountants and auditors, and any consents
required by Buyer and Buyer's auditors to complete the Audit and for the Audit
to be filed with any applicable governmental or regulatory authority,
including the SEC. The Audit will be conducted, at Buyer's election, by Grant
Thornton LLP or Ernst and Young LLP at Buyer's expense, but Seller's costs

GOVERNMENTAL APPROVALS AND CONTROL OF STATIONS

Section 3.1. FCC Consent.

(a) It is specifically understood and agreed by Buyer and Seller that the
First Closing shall be in all respects subject to, and conditioned upon, the
receipt of prior FCC Consent. Buyer and Seller shall prepare and file with the
FCC as soon as practicable but in no event later than ten (10) Business Days
after the execution of this Agreement, all requisite applications and other
necessary instruments and documents to request the FCC Consent. After the
aforesaid applications, instruments and documents have been filed with the
FCC, Buyer and Seller shall prosecute such applications with all reasonable
diligence and take all steps reasonably necessary to obtain the requisite FCC
Consent. No party hereto shall take any action that such party knows or should
know would adversely affect obtaining the FCC Consent, or adversely affect the
FCC Consent becoming a Final Order. Seller shall promptly enter into customary
tolling, assignment, escrow, and assumption or similar arrangements if
necessary and requested by the FCC to resolve any complaints with the FCC
relating to any of the FCC Licenses. If the First Closing shall not have
occurred for any reason within the original effective period of the FCC
Consent and neither party shall have terminated this Agreement under Article
XI, Buyer and Seller shall jointly request an extension of the effective
period of the FCC Consent. No extension of the FCC Consent shall limit the
right of either party to exercise its termination rights under Article XI.
Buyer and Seller shall each pay one-half (1/2) of all FCC filing fees relating
to the transactions contemplated hereby irrespective of whether the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement are consummated.

(b) The FCC Licenses expire on the dates set forth on Schedule 4.15. Seller
has timely filed the FCC renewal applications with respect to the Stations and
will diligently prosecute such applications. The parties acknowledge that
under current FCC policy, either the FCC will not grant an assignment
application while a renewal application is pending, or the FCC will grant an
assignment application with a renewal condition. If the applications
requesting the FCC Consent are granted subject to a renewal condition, then
the term FCC Consent shall mean the FCC's consent to the assignment of the FCC
Licenses from Seller to Buyer and satisfaction of such renewal condition by
Seller.

(c) If the First Closing occurs prior to the FCC Consent becoming a Final
Order, and prior to becoming a Final Order the FCC Consent is reversed or
otherwise set aside, and there is a final order of the FCC (or court of
competent jurisdiction) requiring the assignment of the FCC Licenses to Seller
or to another party, then the purchase and sale of the Purchased Assets shall
be rescinded. In such event, Buyer shall convey to Seller or such other party,
as applicable, the Purchased Assets, and Seller shall repay to Buyer the
Purchase Price and reassume the Assumed Liabilities. Any such rescission shall
be consummated on a mutually agreeable date within thirty (30) days of such
final order (or, if earlier, within the time required by such order). In
connection therewith, Buyer and Seller shall each execute such documents
(including execution by Buyer of instruments of conveyance of the Purchased
Assets and execution by Seller of instruments of assumption of the Assumed
Liabilities) and make such payments (including repayment by Seller to Buyer of
the Purchase Price) as are necessary to give effect to such rescission.

Section 3.2. HSR Filing. On the earlier of February 13, 2014 and the date

respect to the transactions contemplated hereby (including a request for early
termination of the waiting period thereunder), and shall thereafter promptly
respond to all requests received from such agencies for additional information
or documentation and otherwise use their reasonable best efforts to obtain the
HSR Clearance as soon as possible. Expiration or termination of any applicable
waiting period under the HSR Act is referred to herein as the "HSR Clearance".
Any filing fees payable under the HSR Act relating to the transactions
contemplated hereby and any costs of experts jointly engaged by Buyer and
Seller to assist in obtaining the HSR Clearance shall be borne one-half (1/2)
by each the Buyer and Seller.

Section 3.3. Control Prior to First Closing. Between the date hereof and the
First Closing Date, Buyer shall not directly or indirectly control, supervise
or direct, or attempt to control, supervise or direct, the operation of the
Stations. Such operation, including complete control and supervision of all
programs, employees and policies, shall be the sole responsibility of Seller.
Neither title nor right to possession of the Purchased Assets shall pass to
Buyer until the First Closing, but Buyer shall, however, be entitled to
reasonable inspection of the Stations and the Purchased Assets (upon
reasonable prior notice) during normal business hours with the purpose that an
uninterrupted and efficient transfer of the assets and business of the
Stations may be accomplished. After the First Closing, Seller shall have no
right to control the Stations, and Seller shall have no reversionary rights in
the Stations. Nothing in this Section 3.3 shall prohibit Emmis from exercising
its rights and performing its obligations under the LMA.

Section 3.4. Other Governmental Approvals. Promptly following the execution of
this Agreement, Buyer and Seller shall proceed to prepare and file with the
appropriate Governmental Authorities any other requests for approvals or
waivers, if any, that are required from other Governmental Authorities in
connection with the First Closing, and shall diligently and expeditiously
prosecute, and shall cooperate fully with each other in the prosecution of,
such requests for approvals or waivers and all proceedings necessary to secure
such approvals and

waivers. Buyer and Seller shall each pay one-half (1/2) of all fees required
to be paid in connection with the approvals and waivers under this Section 3.4

Section 6.12. Title Commitments; Surveys. Seller shall deliver to Buyer, at
Seller's cost, within sixty (60) days of the date of this Agreement, title
commitments for owner's and lender's title insurance policies on the Owned
Real Property and on Real Property that is leased pursuant to a Real Property
Lease, a standard form of (a) commitment for owner's and lender's title
insurance policies on the Owned Real Property and commitments for lessee's and
lender's title insurance policies for all Real Property that is leased
pursuant to a Real Property Lease (collectively, the "Title Commitments") and
(b) an ALTA survey on each parcel of Owned Real Property sufficient to cause
the issuer of the Title Commitment to delete any survey exception on the title
policy issued pursuant thereto (the "Surveys"). The Title Commitments will
evidence a commitment to issue an ALTA title insurance policy insuring good,
marketable and indefeasible fee simple (or leasehold, if applicable) title to
each parcel of the Real Property contemplated above for such amount as Buyer
directs. The costs of any such title insurance shall be paid by Buyer. If the
Title Commitments reveal any Lien on the title other than Assumed Liabilities
or Permitted Liens, Buyer shall notify Seller in writing of such objectionable
matter as soon as Buyer becomes aware that such matter is not an Assumed
Liability or Permitted Lien, and Seller agrees to use its commercially
reasonable efforts to remove such objectionable matter to conform to the terms
of this Agreement.

a third party against the Indemnified Party which the Indemnifying Party

the right to employ counsel acceptable to the Indemnified Party to defend any
such Claim asserted against the Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party shall
have the right to participate in the defense of any such Claim at its own

ATL 19620111v4

* * *

entitled to recover all amounts in excess of the Deductible, and the maximum
aggregate Liability of the Buyer or Seller shall not exceed Thirteen Million
One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($13,100,000) (the "Cap"). The limitations set
forth in this Section 10.4(a) shall not apply (iii) in the case of Claims
arising from or relating to any breach or inaccuracy in the following
representations and warranties: Sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.5, 5.1 and 5.2 (the

* * *





indemnify contained in Article X and the obligations to Guaranty contained in

agreements in Articles XI and XII (other than Section 12.22) shall survive the

subject to clauses (e) below, the representations and warranties made in
Articles IV and V of this Agreement or made pursuant hereto shall survive the
First Closing until the Second Closing, and (e) the Fundamental Reps shall
survive the First Closing indefinitely.

Section 10.6. Remedies; Mitigation.

(a) Except as otherwise provided in Sections 2.4 and 12.2 of this Agreement,
the indemnification provisions of this Article X are the sole and exclusive
post-First Closing remedy of Buyer and Seller for a breach or nonperformance
of any representations, warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in subsection (a) above, nothing
herein shall prevent any of the parties to this Agreement from bringing an
action against one or more of the parties to this Agreement: (i) alleging that
one or more parties engaged in fraud or intentional misrepresentation in
connection with the transaction; or (ii) to enforce any of the covenants of
any of the other parties to this Agreement.

(a) Each of the parties agrees to take all commercially reasonable steps to
mitigate its respective Claims and to cause its respective Buyer Indemnified

this Article X.

Section 10.7. Effect of Insurance. If an Indemnitee receives an
indemnification payment from an Indemnifying Party pursuant to this Article X
with respect to a particular Claim and subsequently receives an insurance
recovery (net any retroactive premium adjustment resulting from such Claim and
any other related increase in the cost of insurance, and the cost of receiving
or collecting such insurance recovery) or a recovery from any other third
party, with respect to that same Claim, then the Indemnified Party shall
promptly refund to that Indemnifying Party the appropriate amount of such
indemnification payment such that the Indemnified Party does not retain, by
means of such indemnification payment and such net insurance recovery, an
amount exceeding the Indemnified Parties' actual loss. Upon making any payment
to an Indemnified Party in respect of any Claims, the Indemnifying Party
shall, to the extent of such payment, be subrogated to all rights of the
Indemnified Party (and its Affiliates) against any third party in respect of
the Claims to which such payment relates. Such Indemnified Party (and its
Affiliates) and Indemnifying Party shall execute upon request all instruments
reasonably necessary to evidence or further perfect such subrogation rights.
Buyer and Seller shall use reasonable best efforts to mitigate any Losses,
whether by asserting claims against a third party or by otherwise qualifying
for a benefit that would reduce or eliminate an indemnified matter; provided,
that no party shall be required to use such efforts if they would be
demonstrably detrimental in any material respect to such party.

ARTICLE XI 
FURTHER AGREEMENTS

Section 11.1. Event of Loss. Upon the occurrence of an Event of Loss or Events
of Loss prior to Closing, Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
repair, replace and restore the damaged, destroyed or lost property (the
"Damaged Asset") to its former condition prior to the First Closing. If Seller
is unable to repair, replace or restore the Damaged Assets for which the cost
to repair is less than $500,000 (the "Threshold Cost") prior to the First
Closing Date, then, provided that the Stations are operating at full
authorized power and are in normal working order consistent with the operation
as of the date hereof, the parties will proceed to Closing and Seller shall
either, at Buyer's option, reimburse Buyer for all reasonable out-of-pocket
costs incurred by Buyer in repairing or replacing the Damaged Assets or shall
assign to Buyer all of Seller's rights under any insurance and all proceeds of
insurance covering the Damaged Assets (excluding business interruption
insurance for periods prior to the First Closing Date) and shall deliver to
Buyer all proceeds of insurance theretofore received by Seller. In the event
that the insurance proceeds are insufficient to complete the repairs,
restoration or replacement, an appropriate reduction in the Purchase Price
shall be made at the First Closing. If Seller is unable to repair or replace
prior to the First Closing Date a Damaged Asset for which the cost to repair
is more than the Threshold Cost or if as a result of the Damaged Asset, the
Stations are not operating at full authorized power and in normal working
order consistent with operation as of the date hereof, then Seller or Buyer
may delay the First Closing for up to sixty (60) days in order to allow Seller
to complete such repairs. If Seller has not completed such repairs by the
First Closing, or if so elected, by Buyer or Seller by the end of the 60-day
period, then, at Buyer's option, (a) Buyer may terminate this Agreement, or
(b) the parties will proceed to Closing and Seller shall either, at Buyer's
option, reimburse Buyer for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred by
Buyer in repairing or replacing the Damaged Assets, or assign to Buyer all
proceeds of insurance covering the property involved and shall deliver to
Buyer all proceeds of insurance theretofore received by Seller. In the event
that the insurance proceeds are insufficient to complete the repairs,
restoration or replacement, an appropriate reduction in the Purchase Price
shall be made at the First Closing. The Schedules shall be deemed modified to
reflect any Damaged Asset for which Seller makes or is obligated to make a
payment or which is replaced by Seller pursuant to this Section 11.1.
Notwithstanding anything in this Section 11.1 to the contrary, if an Event of
Loss is caused by or results from Buyer's actions or omissions under the LMA,
Seller shall have no obligation to make any repairs to the Damaged Assets and
Buyer shall have no right to terminate this Agreement on account of such Event
of Loss.

Section 11.2. Station Employees.

(a) On or prior to the LMA Commencement Date, Buyer shall offer employment to
each Station Employee, other than James Wiener and Lourdes Melendez (the "LMA
Employees"), to whom Buyer shall offer employment as of the First Closing
Date. Any Station Employee who thereby becomes employed by Buyer shall
constitute a Transferred Employee and the "Employment Commencement Date" as
referred to herein shall mean the LMA Commencement Date or the First Closing
Date, as applicable. Buyer shall employ at-will those Transferred Employees
who are not Union Employees (the "Non-Union Transferred



\- 47 -

ATL 19620111v4

* * *





Employees") and who do not have employment agreements with Seller initially at
a monetary compensation (consisting of base salary, commission rate and normal
bonus opportunity) at least as favorable as those provided by Seller
immediately prior to the Employment Commencement Date. The initial terms and
conditions of employment for those Non-Union Transferred Employees who have
employment agreements with Seller shall be as set forth in such employment
agreements. Buyer agrees so long as such Non-Union Transferred Employees
remain employed by Buyer, Buyer shall provide each Non-Union Transferred
Employee with employee benefits, including severance benefits, that are not
less favorable to the employee benefits provided to similarly situated
employees of Buyer; provided, however, that any Non-Union Transferred Employee
whose employment is terminated by Buyer less than six months following the LMA
Commencement Date shall be paid severance in the amount set forth in Schedule
11.2 provided payment of such severance shall be conditioned upon Buyer's
receipt of a release in favor of Buyer and Seller in a form provided by Buyer.
To the extent permitted by Law and notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, Buyer shall give Transferred Employees up to four years of prior
service credit with Buyer for purposes of eligibility waiting periods and
vesting and benefit accrual (other than benefit accrual under a defined
benefit pension plan) under the employee benefit plans or arrangements or
severance practices maintained by the Buyer or its Affiliates in which such
Transferred Employees participate for such Transferred Employees' service with
the Seller or its Affiliates or predecessors. Seller agrees to fully cooperate
with the Buyer in connection with its offer to hire any Station Employees and
will not take any action, directly or indirectly, to prevent any Station
Employee from becoming employed by Buyer from and after the Employment
Commencement Date. Seller agrees that for a period of twelve (12) months
following the Employment Commencement Date, Seller shall not solicit or induce
any Station Employee to remain in, or any Transferred Employee to return to,
the employ of Seller or any of its Affiliates or otherwise attempt to retain
or obtain the services of any such employee. In lieu of hiring any Station
Employee, Buyer may direct Seller in writing to terminate such employee's
employment with Seller and pay severance to such employee in accordance with
Schedule 11.2 provided payment of such severance shall be conditioned upon
Buyer's receipt of a release in favor of Buyer and Seller in a form acceptable
to Buyer, and such direction constitutes Buyer's agreement to (i) promptly
reimburse Seller for such severance amount, and (ii) indemnify Seller in
accordance with Section 10.2(b) for any Claims against Seller in connection
with Seller's termination of such Station Employee.

(b) If and to the extent Seller has entered into or is bound by any Bargaining
Agreements, Buyer and Seller shall cooperate fully in the assignment and
assumption of such Bargaining Agreements and in any negotiations with respect
thereto such that, as of the Employment Commencement Date, Buyer shall have
(whether through such an assumption, negotiations or otherwise) the same
rights and obligations with respect to the Union Employees who are Transferred
Employees as Seller had immediately before such date.

(a) Buyer shall cause a tax-qualified defined contribution plan established or
designated by Buyer (a "Buyer's 401(k) Plan") to accept rollover contributions
from the Non-Union Transferred Employees of any account balances distributed
to them by the existing tax-qualified defined contribution plan established or
designated by Seller ("Seller's 401(k) Plan"). Buyer shall allow any such Non-
Union Transferred Employees' outstanding plan loan to be rolled



\- 48 -

ATL 19620111v4

* * *





into Buyer's 401(k) Plan. The distribution and rollover described herein shall
comply with applicable Law, and each party shall make all filings and take any
actions required of such party by applicable Law in connection therewith.
Buyer's 401(k) Plan shall credit Non-Union Transferred Employees with service
credit for eligibility and vesting purposes for service recognized for the
equivalent purposes under Seller's 401(k) Plan.

(b) Seller shall retain responsibility for and continue to pay all medical,
life insurance, disability and other welfare plan expenses and benefits for
each Transferred Employee with respect to claims incurred under the terms of
the Station Employee Plans by such Station Employees or their covered
dependents prior to the Employment Commencement Date. Expenses and benefits
with respect to claims incurred by Transferred Employees or their covered
dependents on or after the Employment Commencement Date shall be the
responsibility of Buyer, subject to the terms and conditions of Buyer's
welfare plans. With respect to any welfare benefit plans maintained by Buyer
for the benefit of Transferred Employees on and after the Employment
Commencement Date, to the extent permitted by law, Buyer shall (qqqq) cause
there to be waived any eligibility requirements or pre-existing condition
limitations to the same extent generally waived by Buyer with respect to its
employees and (rrrr) give effect, in determining any deductible and maximum
out-of-pocket limitations, amounts paid by such Transferred Employees for the
plan year in which the Employment Commencement Date occurs with respect to
similar plans maintained by Seller.

(c) Buyer will assume all liabilities for unpaid, accrued vacation of each
Transferred Employee as of the Employment Commencement Date, giving credit
under Buyer's vacation policy for service with Seller (which permitted a
limited number of Seller's employees to rollover not more than 10 vacation
days from calendar year 2013, and then only in limited circumstances), and
shall permit Transferred Employees to use their vacation entitlement accrued
as of the Employment Commencement Date throughout Buyer's fiscal year ended
February 28, 2015. Service of up to four years with Seller, together with
service following the Employment Commencement Date with Buyer, shall be taken
into account in determining Transferred Employees' vacation entitlement under
Buyer's vacation policy after the Employment Commencement Date.

(d) Buyer shall grant credit for all unused sick leave accrued by Transferred
Employees who are Union Employees in accordance with the applicable Bargaining
Agreement. Transferred Employees who are not Union Employees will be subject
to Buyer's sick leave policy.

Section 11.3. No Further Rights. Nothing in this Article X express or implied,
is intended to confer on any Person other than the parties hereto or their
respective successors and assigns any rights, remedies, obligations or
liabilities under or by reason of this Article X.

Section 11.4. Payroll Matters.

(a) Seller and Buyer shall follow the "standard procedures" for preparing and
filing Internal Revenue Service Forms W-2 (Wage and Tax Statements), as
described in Revenue Procedure 2004-53 for Transferred Employees. Under this
procedure, (i) Seller shall provide



\- 49 -

ATL 19620111v4

* * *





all required Forms W-2 to (x) all Transferred Employees reflecting wages paid
and taxes withheld by Seller prior to the Employment Commencement Date, and
(y) all other employees and former employees of Seller who are not Transferred
Employees reflecting all wages paid and taxes withheld by Seller, and (ii)
Buyer (or one of its Affiliates) shall provide all required Forms W-2 to all
Transferred Employees reflecting all wages paid and taxes withheld by Buyer
(or one of its Affiliates) on and after the Employment Commencement Date.

(b) Seller and Buyer shall adopt the "alternative procedure" of Revenue
Procedure 2004-53 for purposes of filing Internal Revenue Service Forms W-4
(Employee's Withholding Allowance Certificate) and W-5 (Earned Income Credit
Advance Payment Certificate). Under this procedure, Seller shall provide to
Buyer all Internal Revenue Service Forms W-4 and W-5 on file with respect to
each Transferred Employee and any written notices received from the Internal
Revenue Service under Reg. § 31.3402(f)(2)-1(g)(5) of the Code, and Buyer will
honor these forms until such time, if any, that such Transferred Employee
submits a revised form.

(c) With respect to garnishments, tax levies, child support orders, and wage
assignments in effect with Seller on the Employment Commencement Date for
Transferred Employees and with respect to which Seller has notified Buyer in
writing, Buyer shall honor such payroll deduction authorizations with respect
to Transferred Employees and will continue to make payroll deductions and
payments to the authorized payee, as specified by a court or order which was
filed with Seller on or before the Employment Commencement Date, to the extent
such payroll deductions and payments are in compliance with applicable Law,
and Seller will continue to make such payroll deductions and payments to
authorized payees as required by Law with respect to all other employees of
the Business who are not Transferred Employees. Seller shall, as soon as
practicable after the Employment Commencement Date, provide Buyer with such
information in the possession of Seller as may be reasonably requested by
Buyer and necessary for Buyer to make the payroll deductions and payments to
the authorized payee as required by this Section 10.4.

Section 11.5. WARN Act. Buyer shall not take any action on or after the
Employment Commencement Date that would cause any termination of employment of
any employees by Seller that occurs before the Employment Commencement Date to
constitute a "plant closing" or "mass layoff" under the Worker Adjustment and
Retraining Act of 1988, as amended (the "WARN Act") or any similar state or
local Law, or to create any liability to Seller for any employment
terminations under applicable Law. Assumed Liabilities assumed by Buyer
pursuant to Section 2.03 shall include all Liabilities with respect to any
amounts (including any severance, fines or penalties) payable under or
pursuant to the WARN Act or any similar state or local Law with respect to any
Station Employees who do not become Transferred Employees as result of Buyer's
failure to extend offers of employment or continued employment as required by
Section 11.2 or in connection with events that occur from and after the
Employment Commencement Date, and Buyer shall reimburse Seller for any such
amounts or any Liabilities thereof incurred by Seller.

Section 11.6. Bulk Transfer. Buyer and Seller hereby waive compliance with the
Bulk Transfer provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code and all similar Laws.
Except for the



\- 50 -

ATL 19620111v4

* * *





Assumed Liabilities, Seller shall promptly pay and discharge when and as due
all liabilities and obligations arising out of or relating to Seller's
ownership and operation of the Station prior to Closing and its sale of the
Station to Buyer. Except for the Assumed Liabilities, Seller hereby agrees to
indemnify, defend and hold Buyer harmless from and against any and all
liabilities, losses, costs, damages or causes of action (including, without
limitation, reasonable attorney fees and other legal costs and expenses)
arising out of or relating to claims asserted against Buyer pursuant to the
Bulk Transfer provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code of the state in which
the Station is located or any similar Law.

ARTICLE XII

TERMINATION; MISCELLANEOUS

Section 12.1. Termination. This Agreement may be terminated and the
transactions contemplated hereby may be abandoned at any time prior to the
First Closing Date, as follows:

(a) by mutual written agreement of Seller and Buyer; or

(b) by Buyer or Seller if the First Closing shall not have occurred on or
before the twelve month anniversary of the date hereof (the "Outside Date")
for any reason other than delay, nonperformance or breach by the party seeking
such termination; or

(c) by Buyer, if Buyer is not then in material breach of this Agreement and
Seller is then in material breach of this Agreement, and such breach remains
uncured on the first to occur of (i) sixty (60) days after receipt of written
notice thereof from Buyer, provided, that if Seller is diligently pursuing
such a cure, such sixty (60) day period may be extended for up to an
additional sixty (60) days, but not later than the Outside Date, and (ii) the
First Closing Date; or

(d) by Seller, if Seller is not then in material breach of this Agreement and
Buyer is then in material breach of this Agreement, and such breach remains
uncured on the first to occur of (i) sixty (60) days after receipt of written
notice thereof from Seller; provided, that if Buyer is diligently pursuing
such a cure, such sixty (60) day period may be extended for up to an
additional sixty (60) days, but not later than the Outside Date, and (ii) the
First Closing Date.

Section 12.2. Rights on Termination; Waiver.

(a) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 12.1(a), or 12.1(b),
or 12.1(c), or 12.1(d), all further obligations of the parties under or
pursuant to this Agreement shall immediately terminate without further
liability of any party to the other.

(b) If Seller is in material default in the performance of its obligations
under this Agreement or has breached in any material respect its
representations and warranties hereunder, or if this Agreement is terminated
by Buyer pursuant to Section 12.1(e), then Buyer shall be entitled to pursue
all legal and equitable remedies against Seller for such default or breach
including specific performance (Seller hereby acknowledging that the Purchased
Assets are unique and that Buyer has no adequate remedy at law if Seller
breaches this Agreement). Nothing in this Section 12.2(b) shall prevent Buyer
from pursuing specific performance against Seller.



\- 51 -

ATL 19620111v4

* * *





Section 12.3. Specific Performance. The parties agree that irreparable damage
for which monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate
remedy, would occur in the event that the parties hereto do not perform the
provisions of this Agreement (including failing to take such actions as are
required of it hereunder to consummate this Agreement) in accordance with its
specified terms or otherwise breach its representations, warranties covenants
or agreements hereunder. The parties acknowledge and agree that the parties
shall be entitled to an injunction, specific performance and other equitable
relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the
terms and provisions hereof, this being in addition to any other remedy to
which the parties are entitled at law or in equity. Each of the parties agrees
that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance
and other equitable relief on the basis that the other parties have an
adequate remedy at law or an award of specific performance is not an
appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity. Any party seeking an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall not be required
to provide any bond or other security in connection with any such order or
injunction.

Section 12.4. Liquidated Damages. If Seller terminates this Agreement pursuant
to Section 12.1(d), Seller's sole remedy (unless Seller has alternatively
elected the remedy of specific performance pursuant to Section 12.3) for such
material breach and termination shall be the right to claim and be paid an
amount equal to ten percent (10%) of the Purchase Price as liquidated damages.
The parties agree that the liquidated damages provided in this Section is
intended to limit the monetary and other claims that Seller may have against
Buyer in the circumstances described herein. The parties acknowledge and agree
that the liquidated damages provided in this Section bear a reasonable
relationship to the anticipated harm which would be caused by Buyer's breach
of the Agreement. The parties further acknowledge and agree that the amount of
actual loss caused by Buyer's breach of this Agreement is incapable and
difficult of precise estimation and that Seller would not have a convenient
and adequate alternative to liquidated damages hereunder. The provisions of
this Section 12.4 shall in no way limit Seller's right to elect alternatively
specific performance of this Agreement pursuant to Section 12.3 or otherwise.

Section 12.5. Further Assurances. From time to time after the First Closing
Date, upon the reasonable request of Buyer, Seller shall execute and deliver
or cause to be executed and delivered such further instruments of conveyance,
assignment and transfer and take such further action as Buyer may reasonably
request in order more effectively to sell, assign, convey, transfer, reduce to
possession and record title to Buyer to any of the Purchased Assets. Seller
agrees to cooperate with Buyer in all reasonable respects to assure to Buyer
the continued title to and possession of the Purchased Assets in the condition
and manner contemplated by this Agreement; provided, however, that Buyer shall
not be required to spend additional sums of money. Without limiting the
specific obligations of any party hereto under any agreement or covenant
hereunder, each party hereto shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take
all actions and do all things necessary in order to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including, without limitation,
satisfaction, but not waiver, of the closing conditions set forth in Article
VII, Article VIII or Article IX.

(a) If and to the extent any information required to be furnished in any
section of the Schedules is contained in the Agreement or in any section of
the Schedules, such information shall be deemed to be included in all sections
of the Schedules to the extent that the relevance of any such information to
any other section of the Schedules is readily apparent from the text of such
disclosure.

(b) Seller has disclosed the information contained in the Schedules solely for
purposes of the Agreement, and no information contained therein shall be
deemed to be an admission by any party thereto to any third party of any
matter whatsoever, including of any violation of Law or breach of any

Section 12.7. Entire Agreement; Amendment; and Waivers. This Agreement and the

supersede all prior and contemporaneous agreements, understandings,
negotiations and discussions of the parties, whether oral or written, and
there are no warranties, representations or other agreements between the
parties in connection with the subject matter hereof, except as specifically
set forth herein. No amendment, supplement, modification, waiver or
termination of this Agreement shall be binding unless executed in writing by
the party to be bound thereby. No waiver of any of the provisions of this
Agreement shall be deemed or shall constitute a waiver of any other provision
of this Agreement, whether or not similar, unless otherwise expressly
provided.

Section 12.8. Expenses. Except as otherwise specifically provided herein,
whether or not the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are
consummated, each of the parties shall pay the fees and expenses of its
respective counsel, accountants and other experts incident to the negotiation,
drafting and execution of this Agreement and consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby.

Section 12.9. Benefit; Assignment. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of and shall be enforceable by Buyer and Seller and their
respective proper successors and permitted assigns. This Agreement (and any
rights, obligations or liabilities hereunder) may not be assigned or delegated
in whole or in part by any party without the prior written consent of the
other party; provided, however, that Buyer may, without such consent, assign
in whole or in part its rights, obligations or liabilities under this
Agreement to an Affiliate of Buyer, provided that (iii) any such assignment
does not delay or impede grant of the FCC Consent or the First Closing or
Second Closing, as applicable, (iv) any such assignee delivers to Seller a
written assumption of this Agreement, (v) Buyer shall remain liable for all of
its obligations hereunder, and (vi) Buyer shall be solely responsible for any
third party consents necessary in connection therewith (none of which are a
condition to the First Closing); and provided, further, that Buyer may,
without such consent, collaterally assign its rights hereunder to its lenders.
Any such assignee of Buyer shall fully assume the obligations of Buyer
hereunder and Buyer shall remain liable for its obligations hereunder. Any
attempted assignment or transfer in violation of this Section shall be null
and void.

to the requirements of applicable law, all non-public information regarding
Seller and its Affiliates and their business and properties that is disclosed
in connection with the negotiation, preparation or performance of this

Buyer's representatives and lenders for the purpose of consummating the
transaction contemplated by this Agreement.
