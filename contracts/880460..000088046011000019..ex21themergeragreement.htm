2.7 Conversion of Securities.

(a) Merger Consideration. At the Effective Time, subject to Section 2.7(b) and
the other provisions of this Agreement, each share of the common stock of
Company, $.01 par value (the "Company Common Stock") issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time

* * *

(excluding any Excluded Shares and any Appraisal Shares) shall, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be
converted into and shall thereafter represent the right to receive the
following consideration (the "Merger Consideration"):

(i) Each share of Company Common Stock (excluding any Excluded Shares) with
respect to which an election to receive a combination of stock and cash has
been effectively made and not revoked or lost pursuant to Section 2.7(c)
(each, a "Mixed Consideration Election Share") and each Non-Election Share, as
defined in Section 2.7(c), shall be converted into the right to receive the
combination (such combination, the "Per Share Mixed Consideration") of (x)
$4.00 in cash or such lesser amount of cash based on the adjustments in
Section 2.7(b) (the "Per Share Mixed Election Cash Amount") and (y) the number
of shares of Parent Common Stock (together with any cash in lieu of fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock to be paid pursuant to Section 2.9(e)) equal to
Mixed Election Stock Exchange Ratio.

(ii) If the Available Stock Election Amount equals or exceeds the Stock
Election Amount, then each share of Company Common Stock (including any
Company Restricted Stock, but excluding any Excluded Shares) with respect to
which an election to receive stock consideration is properly made and not
revoked or lost pursuant to Section 2.7(c) (each, a "Stock Election Share")
shall be converted into the right to receive a number of shares of Parent
Common Stock (together with any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock to be paid pursuant to Section 2.9(e) (the "Per Share Stock
Election Consideration")), equal to the Exchange Ratio. If the Stock Election
Amount exceeds the Available Stock Election Amount (such excess being herein
referred to as the "Excess Shares"), then each Stock Election Share shall be
converted into the right to receive (1) a number of validly issued, fully paid
and non-assessable shares of Parent Common Stock equal to (w) the Available
Stock Election Amount divided by (x) the number of Stock Election Shares,
rounding to the nearest ten-thousandth of a share, and (2) an amount of cash
(without interest) equal to (y) the product of the Excess Shares and the
Parent Share Value, divided by (z) the number of Stock Election Shares.

(b) Election and Consideration Adjustments. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, the following adjustments to elections and form of
Merger Consideration shall occur if applicable, provided that in each case,
the sum of (x) the Per Share Mixed Election Cash Amount and (y) the product of
the Mixed Election Stock Exchange Ratio and the Parent Share Value shall at
all times equal (z) the Per Share Cash Consideration.

(i) The parties agree that as of the Effective Time, the amount of cash and
cash equivalents held by Company shall be at least $15,000,000, calculated in
accordance with the principles set forth on Section 2.7(b)(i) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule (the "Target") and subject to the adjustment set forth in
Section 5.11, if applicable. To the extent that the Company has less than the
Target

* * *

as of the Effective Time, the Maximum Cash Consideration shall be adjusted
downward, on a dollar-for-dollar basis, equal to the difference between the
Target and the actual cash and cash equivalent amount on hand at the Effective
Time (the "Difference"), and the Maximum Stock Consideration shall be
increased by a number of shares of Parent Stock equal to (y) the Difference
divided by (z) the Parent Share Value. The Per Share Mixed Election Cash
Amount shall be decreased by an amount equal to (A) the Difference divided by
(B) the sum of the Mixed Consideration Election Shares and the Non-Election
Shares, and the Mixed Election Stock Exchange Ratio shall be increased by an
amount equal to (C) the Difference divided by the Parent Share Value divided
by (D) the sum of the Mixed Consideration Election Shares and Non-Election
Shares; and

(ii) The parties further agree that the Maximum Cash Consideration shall be
reduced by the Per Share Cash Consideration for each Appraisal Share that has
exercised and not withdrawn such exercise at or prior to the Effective Time.
The Per Share Mixed Election Cash Amount shall be decreased by an amount equal
to (y) the Per Share Cash Consideration multiplied by the number of Appraisal
Shares (such product, the "Appraisal Cash Adjustment") divided by (z) the sum
of the Mixed Consideration Election Shares and the Non-Election Shares, and
the Mixed Election Stock Exchange Ratio shall be increased by an amount equal
to (A) the Appraisal Cash Adjustment divided by the Parent Share Value divided
by (B) the sum of the Mixed Consideration Election Shares and Non-Election
Shares. Such adjustment to the Maximum Cash Consideration shall not be
impacted by any subsequent appraisal proceedings, including any failure to
perfect, withdrawal, forfeiture or loss of appraisal rights, for the Appraisal
Shares after the Effective Time, and all Appraisal Shares shall continue to be
treated in accordance with Section 2.12 of this Agreement; and

(iii) Notwithstanding anything set forth above, if and to the minimum extent
necessary to accomplish the Tax-Free Reorganization, the Per Share Mixed
Election Cash Amount shall be decreased, and the Mixed Election Stock Exchange
Ratio shall be correspondingly increased.

(iv) At the Closing, the Company shall deliver to Parent a certificate as to
the cash and cash equivalents held by the Company on the Closing Date
calculated in accordance with Section 2.7(b)(i) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule and certified as true and correct by its Chief Executive Offer or
Chief Financial Officer (the "Target Closing Certificate"). At the Closing,
upon delivery of the Target Closing Certificate, Parent and Company shall
jointly calculate the adjustments set forth in Sections 2.7(b)(i) and (ii).
Such adjustments shall be reflected in the instructions to be provided by
Parent to the Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 2.9.

(c) Election Procedures.

(i) An election form and other appropriate and customary transmittal

* * *

materials (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to any certificate (a "Certificate") theretofore representing
shares of Company Common Stock or non-certificated shares represented by book
entry ("Book Entry Shares") shall pass, only upon proper delivery of such
Certificates or Book Entry Shares, respectively, to the Exchange Agent), in
such form as Parent shall specify and as shall be reasonably acceptable to the
Company (the "Election Form"), shall be mailed together or contemporaneously
with the Joint Proxy Statement (the "Mailing Date") to each holder of record
of shares of Company Common Stock as of the close of business on the record
date for notice of the Company Shareholders Meeting (the "Election Form Record
Date").

(ii) Each Election Form shall permit the holder (or the beneficial owner
through appropriate and customary documentation and instructions), other than
any holder of any Excluded Shares or any Appraisal Shares, to specify (A) the
number of shares of such holder's Company Common Stock with respect to which
such holder elects to receive the Per Share Mixed Consideration, (B) the
number of shares of such holder's Company Common Stock with respect to which
such holder elects to receive the Per Share Stock Election Consideration, or
(C) that such holder makes no election with respect to such holder's Company
Common Stock ("Non-Election Shares"). Any Company Common Stock with respect to
which the Exchange Agent has not received an effective, properly completed
Election Form on or before 5:00 p.m., New York time, on the 30th day following
the Mailing Date (or such other time and date as the Company and Parent shall
agree) (the "Election Deadline") (other than any shares of Company Common
Stock that constitute Appraisal Shares as of such time) shall also be deemed
to be Non-Election Shares.

(iii) Parent shall make available one or more Election Forms as may reasonably
be requested from time to time by all Persons who become holders (or
beneficial owners) of Company Common Stock between the Election Form Record
Date and the close of business on the Business Day prior to the Election
Deadline, and the Company shall provide to the Exchange Agent all information
reasonably necessary for it to perform as specified herein.

(iv) Any election shall have been properly made only if the Exchange Agent
shall have received a properly completed Election Form by the Election
Deadline. If an Election Form purports to make an election for a certificated
Share of Company Common Stock or Book Entry Shares, then an Election Form
shall be deemed properly completed only (A) if accompanied by one or more
Certificates (or customary affidavits and, if required by Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such
reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate) and/or (B) upon receipt of an "agent's message" by the Exchange
Agent or such other evidence of transfer of Book Entry Shares to the Exchange
Agent as the Exchange Agent may reasonably

* * *

request, collectively representing all shares of Company Common Stock covered
by such Election Form, together with duly executed transmittal materials
included in the Election Form. Any Election Form may be revoked or changed by
the Person submitting such Election Form by written notice received by the
Exchange Agent prior to the Election Deadline. In the event an Election Form
is revoked prior to the Election Deadline, the shares of Company Common Stock
represented by such Election Form shall become Non-Election Shares and Parent
shall cause the Certificates representing such shares of Company Common Stock
or Book Entry Shares to be promptly returned without charge to the Person
submitting the Election Form upon written request to that effect from the
holder who submitted the Election Form, except to the extent (if any) a
subsequent election is properly made with respect to any or all of such shares
of Company Common Stock. Subject to the terms of this Agreement and of the
Election Form, Parent shall have sole discretion, which it may delegate in
whole or in part to the Exchange Agent, to determine whether any election,
revocation or change has been properly or timely made and to disregard
immaterial defects in the Election Forms, and any good faith reasonable
decisions of Parent (or the Exchange Agent, if so empowered) regarding such
matters shall be binding and conclusive. None of Parent, Merger Sub or the
Exchange Agent shall be under any obligation to notify any Person of any
defect in an Election Form. Elections will be deemed to be revoked if this
Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms.

(d) Cancellation of Shares. Shares of Company Common Stock, when converted in
accordance with Section 2.7(a), shall cease to be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and cease to exist, and each holder of a Certificate
or Book Entry Share shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto,
except the right to receive in respect of each share of Company Common Stock
previously represented thereby (i) the consideration set forth in Section
2.7(a), (ii) any dividends or other distributions in accordance with Section
2.9(c), and (iii) any cash to be paid in lieu of any fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock in accordance with Section 2.9(e), in each case without
interest, and in each case to be issued or paid in consideration therefor upon
the surrender of such Certificate or Book Entry Share in accordance with
Section 2.9.

(e) Treasury Stock; Excluded Shares. All shares of Company Common Stock held
by Company as treasury shares or by Parent or Merger Sub or by any wholly-
owned Subsidiary of Parent, Merger Sub or Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall automatically be canceled and cease to exist as of the
Effective Time and no consideration shall be delivered or deliverable therefor
(all such shares, the "Excluded Shares").

(f) Merger Sub Stock. Each outstanding share of the capital stock of Merger
Sub shall be converted into an outstanding share of Surviving Corporation
owned by Parent.

2.8 Company Stock Options and Company Warrants.

(a) Company Stock Options. At the Effective Time, each Company Stock Option
will cease to represent an option to purchase Company Common Stock and will be
converted automatically into an option to purchase a number of shares of
Parent Common Stock (each, a

* * *

"New Parent Stock Option") equal to the product (rounded down to the nearest
whole share) of (A) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to
such Company Stock Option and (B) the Exchange Ratio, at an exercise price per
share (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to (1) the exercise price
of such Company Stock Option divided by (2) the Exchange Ratio. At the
Effective Time, the vesting schedule of each Company Stock Option converted
into a New Parent Stock Option shall be accelerated by one year. Unless
otherwise provided for under the terms of any existing executive employment
agreements to which a holder of Company Stock Options or New Parent Stock
Options shall be a party, the New Parent Stock Options shall immediately vest
upon termination of the holder's employment by Surviving Corporation within
one year of the Effective Time other than for Cause or by the holder without
Good Reason and be exercisable for ninety days post-termination. Except as set
forth above, each New Parent Stock Option shall otherwise continue to be
governed by the same terms and conditions as were applicable to the Company
Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(b) Company Warrants. At the Effective Time,

(i) each outstanding and unexercised Gopman Warrant will cease to represent a
warrant to purchase Company Common Stock and will be converted automatically
into a warrant to purchase a number of shares of Parent Common Stock (each, a
"Parent Warrant") equal to the product (rounded down to the nearest whole
share) of (x) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such
Gopman Warrant and (y) the Exchange Ratio, at an exercise price per share
(rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to (1) the exercise price of such
Gopman Warrant divided by (2) the Exchange Ratio; and

(ii) each outstanding and unexercised Licensor Warrant will cease to represent
a warrant to purchase Company Common Stock and will be converted automatically
into a fully-vested Parent Warrant to purchase a number of shares of Parent
Common Stock equal to the product (rounded down to the nearest whole share) of
(x) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Licensor
Warrant and (y) the Exchange Ratio, at an exercise price per share equal to
$8.00 (the "Licensor Warrant Consideration").

Subject to the Licensor Warrant Amendment, except as set forth above, each
Parent Warrant shall otherwise continue to be governed by the same terms and
conditions as were applicable to the Company Warrant immediately prior to the
Effective Time.

(c) Registration. With respect to the shares underlying the Company Stock
Options, Parent shall take commercially reasonable steps to become a
"successor issuer" on any existing registration statement filed by the Company
with respect thereto or to file a registration statement on Form S-8 to
register such shares as promptly following the Effective Time as possible in
compliance with applicable terms and requirements related thereto.

2.9 Exchange of Company Common Stock.

(a) Exchange Agent. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or
shall cause

* * *

to be deposited, with the Company's transfer agent or a bank or trust company
designated by Parent (the "Exchange Agent"), for the benefit of the holders of
shares of Company Common Stock, for exchange in accordance with this ARTICLE
2, through the Exchange Agent, sufficient cash and Parent Common Stock to make
pursuant to this ARTICLE 2 all deliveries of cash and Parent Common Stock as
required by this ARTICLE 2, including the Merger Consideration. Parent agrees
to make available to the Exchange Agent, from time to time as needed, cash
sufficient to pay any dividends and other distributions pursuant to Section
2.9(c) and to make payments in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section
2.9(e). Any cash and Parent Common Stock deposited with the Exchange Agent
(including as payment for any dividends or other distributions in accordance
with Section 2.9(c) and fractional shares in accordance with Section 2.9(e))
shall hereinafter be referred to as the "Exchange Fund". The Exchange Agent
shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions, deliver the Merger Consideration
contemplated to be paid for shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to this
Agreement out of the Exchange Fund. The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash
included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent, provided that no such
investment or losses thereon shall affect the amount of Merger Consideration
payable to the holders of shares of Company Common Stock or payments due to
holders of Company Stock Options. Any interest and other income resulting from
such investments shall be paid to Parent. Except as contemplated by this
Agreement, the Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose.

(b) Exchange Procedures. As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time,
Parent shall instruct the Exchange Agent to mail to each record holder, as of
the Effective Time, of an outstanding Certificate or Book Entry Share that
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented shares of Company Common
Stock (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the shares of Company Common Stock
shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the corresponding Certificates to the
Exchange Agent or receipt by the Exchange Agent of an "agent's message" with
respect to Book Entry Shares, and shall be in customary form as directed by
Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company) and (ii) instructions for use
in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or Book Entry Shares in
exchange for the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the shares of
Company Common Stock represented thereby. Promptly after the Effective Time,
upon surrender of Certificates or Book Entry Shares for cancellation to the
Exchange Agent together with such letters of transmittal, properly completed
and duly executed, and such other documents as may be required pursuant to
such instructions, the holders of such Certificates or Book Entry Shares and
the holders of Certificates or Book Entry Shares who previously surrendered
Certificates or Book Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent with properly
completed and duly executed Election Forms shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor, upon completion of the calculations required by Section
2.7, (A) shares of Parent Common Stock representing, in the aggregate, the
whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock that such holder has the right
to receive pursuant to Section 2.7 (after taking into account all shares of
Company Common Stock then held by such holder) and (B) a check in the amount
equal to the aggregate amount of cash that such holder has the right to
receive pursuant to Section 2.7, dividends and other distributions pursuant to
Section 2.9(c) and cash payable in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.9(e). No interest shall be paid or accrued
on any Merger Consideration. In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares
of Company Common Stock which is not registered in the transfer records of the
Company, the Merger Consideration payable in respect of such shares of Company
Common Stock may be paid to a transferee if the

* * *

Certificate representing such shares of Company Common Stock is presented to
the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and
effect such transfer and the Person requesting such exchange shall pay to the
Exchange Agent in advance any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of
the delivery of the Merger Consideration in any name other than that of the
registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or shall establish to the
satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Taxes have been paid or are not
payable.

(c) Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Company Common Stock. No
dividends or other distributions declared or made with respect to Parent
Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the
holder of any unsurrendered Certificate or Book Entry Share with respect to
the Parent Common Stock that such holder would be entitled to receive upon
surrender of such Certificate or Book Entry Share and no cash payment in lieu
of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be paid to any such holder
until such holder shall surrender such Certificate or Book Entry Share in
accordance with this Section 2.9. Subject to applicable Law, following
surrender of any such Certificate or Book Entry Share, there shall be paid to
such holder of Parent Common Stock issuable in exchange therefor, without
interest, (i) promptly after the time of such surrender, the amount of any
cash due pursuant to Section 2.7 and cash payable in lieu of fractional shares
of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section
2.9(e) and the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date
after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such holder's whole
shares of Parent Common Stock, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the
amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time but prior to such surrender and a payment date subsequent to
such surrender payable with respect to such holder's whole shares of Parent
Common Stock.

(d) Further Rights in Company Common Shares. The Merger Consideration issued
upon conversion of a share of Company Common Stock in accordance with the
terms hereof (including any cash paid pursuant to Section 2.9(c) or Section
2.9(e)) shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to such share of Company Common Stock.

(e) Fractional Shares. No certificates or scrip or Parent Common Stock
representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock or book entry credit of
the same shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates or
Book Entry Shares, no dividend or other distribution, stock split or interest
shall relate to any such fractional share and such fractional share shall not
entitle the owner thereof to vote or to have any rights as a holder of any
Parent Common Stock. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement,
each holder of shares of Company Common Stock exchanged in the Merger who
would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent
Common Stock (after taking into account all Certificates and Book Entry Shares
delivered by such holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without
interest) in an amount, rounded to the nearest whole cent, equal to the
product of (i) the Parent Share Value and (ii) the fraction of a share of
Parent Common Stock that such holder would otherwise be entitled to receive
pursuant to Section 2.7 hereof.

(f) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock after one hundred
eighty (180) days

* * *

following the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent upon demand and,
from and after such delivery to Parent, any former holders of Company Common
Stock (other than Appraisal Shares) who have not theretofore complied with
this ARTICLE 2 shall thereafter look only to Parent for the Merger
Consideration payable in respect of such shares of Company Common Stock. Any
amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of shares of Company Common Stock
immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or
become the property of any Governmental Entity shall, to the extent permitted
by applicable Law, thereupon become the property of Parent free and clear of
any Liens, claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

(g) No Liability. Neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable
to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any shares of Parent
Common Stock (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) or cash from
the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official or Governmental Entity in the
reasonable belief that such delivery was required pursuant to any abandoned
property, escheat or similar law.

(h) Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed in form and substance
acceptable to Parent and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of
a bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against
any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the
Exchange Agent shall pay in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the shares of
Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate.

(i) Withholding. Each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Exchange
Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Company Common
Stock or Company Stock Options such amounts as Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or the Exchange Agent is required to deduct and withhold under the
Code or any provision of state, local, or foreign Tax law, with respect to the
making of such payment. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent,
the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts shall
be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
holder of Company Common Stock or Company Stock Options in respect of whom
such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, the Surviving Corporation
or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be.

(j) Book Entry. All shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in the Merger
shall be issued in book entry form, without physical certificates.

2.10 Certain Adjustments. If, after the date of this Agreement and at or prior
to the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock or
Company Common Stock are changed into a different number of shares or type of
securities by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, split-up,
stock split, subdivision, combination or exchange of shares, or any dividend
payable in stock or other securities is declared thereon or rights issued in
respect thereof with a record date within such period, or any similar event
occurs (any such action, an "Adjustment Event"), the Merger Consideration will
be adjusted accordingly to provide to the holders of Company Common Stock,
Company Warrants and Company Stock Options the same economic effect as
contemplated by this Agreement prior to such Adjustment Event.

* * *

2.11 Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Company Stock. At the
close of business on the date on which the Effective Time occurs, the stock
transfer books of Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no
further registration of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock on the
records of Company, except for the cancellation of such shares in connection
with the Merger. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of
Certificates that evidenced ownership of shares of Company Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any
rights with respect to such shares, except as otherwise provided for herein or
by applicable Law. If, after the Effective Time, bona fide Certificates are
presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled
and exchanged as provided in this ARTICLE 2.

2.12 Appraisal Rights. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time as to which the holder of such shares shall have
(i) not voted in favor of the Merger nor consented thereto in writing, (ii)
properly complied with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL ("Section
262") as to appraisal rights and (iii) not effectively withdrawn or lost such
holder's rights to appraisal (each, an "Appraisal Share"), if any, shall not
be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration payable
pursuant to Section 2.7, but instead at the Effective Time shall become the
right to payment, solely from the Surviving Corporation, of the fair value of
such shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262. At the Effective
Time, all Appraisal Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and cease to exist. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
if any such holder (A) fails to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or
lose the right to appraisal under Section 262, (B) fails to establish his
entitlement to appraisal rights as provided in the DGCL, or (C) fails to take
any action the consequence of which is that such holder is not entitled to
payment for his shares under the DGCL or a court of competent jurisdiction
shall determine that such holder is not entitled to the relief provided by
Section 262, then the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such
holder's Appraisal Shares under Section 262 shall be forfeited and cease and
if such forfeiture shall occur following the Election Deadline, each of such
holder's Appraisal Shares shall be deemed to have been converted at the
Effective Time into, and shall have become, the right to receive, without
interest thereon, the Merger Consideration, as Non-Election Shares, pursuant
to Section 2.7. The Company shall deliver prompt notice to Parent of any
demands for appraisal of any shares of Company Common Stock and provide Parent
with the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to demands for appraisal under the DGCL. Prior to the Effective Time,
the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent,
voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle,
any such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing.

certifications, schedules, registration statements, and definitive proxy
statements (including exhibits and other information incorporated therein)
required to be filed by it with the SEC since January 1, 2010 (the "Parent SEC
Documents"). Each Parent SEC Document, at the time filed (or if amended or
superseded by a filing or amendment prior to the date of this Agreement, then
at the time of such filing and in the case of registration statements and
proxy statements, on the dates of effectiveness and dates of mailing,
respectively), (i) complied as to form in all material respects with the

(except, in the case of the unaudited statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of

as noted

* * *

therein (subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to the absence of notes
and normal year-end adjustments).

(c) Except for matters reflected or reserved against in the consolidated,
unaudited balance sheet of Parent as of October 29, 2011 (the "Parent Balance
Sheet Date"), neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liabilities
or obligations (whether absolute, accrued, contingent, fixed or otherwise, or
whether due or to become due) of any nature that would be required by GAAP to

Subsidiaries (including the notes thereto), except liabilities or obligations
that (i) were incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice since the Parent Balance Sheet Date, (ii) were incurred in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (iii) individually or
in the aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a

off-balance sheet partnership or any similar contract or arrangement
(including any relating to any transaction or relationship between or among
Parent and any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated
Affiliate, including any structured finance, special purpose or limited
purpose entity or person, on the other hand, or any "off-balance sheet
arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K under the Exchange
Act)), where the result, purpose or effect of such contract or arrangement is
to avoid disclosure of any material transaction involving, or material
liabilities of, Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, in Parent's financial
statements or the Parent SEC Documents.

3.6 Acquisition Advances and Related Persons Investment.

(a) Parent has entered into an Amendment No. 1 to Credit Agreement and
Consent, dated as of December 23, 2011 (the "Financing Letter") with certain
Lenders (as defined below) and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as
Administrative Agent, Collateral Agent and Swingline Lender (the
"Administrative Agent"), under that certain Credit Agreement dated January 7,
2011 among Parent, as the Lead Borrower, the other Borrowers named therein,
the Guarantors named therein, the Administrative Agent, the Lenders party
thereto (collectively, the "Lenders"), Bank of America, N.A., as Syndication
Agent, and Regions Bank and RBS Business Capital, a division of RBS Asset
Finance, Inc., a subsidiary of RBS Citizens, N.A., as Co-Documentation Agents
(as amended, the "Parent Credit Agreement"), pursuant to which Financing
Letter the Lenders have, among other matters, committed to permit Parent to
borrow under the Parent Credit Agreement up to the amount specified in the
Financing Letter to fund a portion of the amounts payable hereunder to Company
Shareholders and the costs and expenses of the Merger and the Transactions
upon and subject to the terms and conditions in the Financing Letter (the
"Acquisition Advances"). Parent has provided Company with true, complete and
correct copies of the Financing Letter and the Parent Credit Agreement. As of
the date of this Agreement, (i) the Financing Letter and the Parent Credit
Agreement are in full force and effect, are valid, binding and enforceable
obligations of Parent and its Subsidiaries that are parties thereto, and to
the Knowledge of Parent, the other parties thereto, and have not been
withdrawn or terminated or otherwise amended or modified in any respect
relating to the Acquisition Advances without the prior written consent of
Company, and no such amendment or modification is contemplated by Parent or,
to Parent's Knowledge, any other party thereto, and (ii) Parent is not in
breach of any of the terms or conditions

* * *

set forth therein and no event has occurred which, with or without notice,
lapse of time or both, could reasonably be expected to constitute a breach or
failure to satisfy a condition precedent set forth in the Financing Letter or
the Parent Credit Agreement that would prevent Parent from obtaining the
Acquisition Advances as of the Closing. Parent has paid any and all commitment
fees or other fees in connection with the Financing Letter that are payable on
or prior to the date of this Agreement.

(b) Parent has received a binding written commitment (the "Related Persons
Investment Commitment") of one or more of Glenn, Stephen or Arlene Nussdorf,
members of their families, trusts or other estate planning vehicles for such
persons or their families (the "Related Persons") (including all exhibits,
schedules and amendments thereto in effect as of the date of this Agreement)
to make a $30 million investment in Parent in subordinated indebtedness of
Parent (the "Related Person Investment"). The Related Persons have committed
to provide the Related Person Investment upon and subject to the terms and
conditions of the Related Persons Investment Commitment. Parent has provided
Company with true, complete and correct copies of the Related Persons
Investment Commitment. As of the date of this Agreement, (i) the Related
Persons Investment Commitment is in full force and effect, is a valid, binding
and enforceable obligation of Parent, and to the Knowledge of Parent, the
other parties thereto, and has not been withdrawn or terminated or otherwise
amended or modified in any respect without the prior written consent of
Company, and no such amendment or modification is contemplated by Parent or,
to Parent's Knowledge, any other party thereto, and (ii) Parent is not in
breach of any of the terms set forth therein and no event has occurred which,
with or without notice, lapse of time or both, could reasonably be expected to
constitute a breach of the Related Persons Investment Commitment.

(c) As of the date of this Agreement, Parent has no Knowledge that it will be
unable to satisfy the conditions of the making of the Acquisition Advances to
be satisfied by it set forth in the Financing Letter and the Parent Credit
Agreement on the Closing Date. Assuming the funding of the Acquisition
Advances in accordance with the Financing Letter and the Parent Credit
Agreement and the Related Persons Investment in accordance with the Related
Persons Investment Commitment, the proceeds from such Acquisition Advances and
Related Persons Investment constitute all of the financing required for the
consummation of the Transactions, and are sufficient for the satisfaction of
all of Parent's obligations under this Agreement, including the payment of the
cash portion of the Merger Consideration, any other amounts required to be
paid in connection with the consummation of the Transactions and all related
fees and expenses (including any contemplated by the Financing Letter). There
are no conditions precedent, other than as expressly set forth in the
Financing Letter and the Parent Credit Agreement, to the Lenders' obligation
to fund the Acquisition Advances required for the consummation of the
Transactions. There are no conditions precedent, other than as set forth in
the Related Person Investment Commitment, to the Related Persons obligation to
make the Related Persons Investment. As of the date of this Agreement, other
than the Financing Letter, the Parent Credit Agreement, the Loan Documents (as
defined in the Credit Agreement) and the Related Person Investment Commitment,
there are no side letters or other agreements, arrangements or understandings
(written or oral) relating to the Acquisition Advances or Related Persons
Investment to which Parent is a party.

becomes effective under the Securities Act, or (c) the documents and financial
statements of Parent incorporated by reference in the Joint Proxy Statement,

fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they
are made, not misleading, except that no representation or warranty is made by
Parent or Merger Sub with respect to information supplied by the Company for
inclusion in the Joint Proxy Statement or the Registration Statement. The
Joint Proxy Statement and Registration Statement will, when filed by Parent in
final form with the SEC, comply as to form in all material respects with the
applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the rules and regulations

execution of this Agreement (the "No-Shop Period Start Date"), the Company and
its Subsidiaries and their respective Affiliates, officers, directors, agents
and representatives ("Representatives") shall have the right, directly or
indirectly, (i) to initiate, solicit and/or encourage the submission of one or
more Acquisition Proposals from one or more Persons, including by furnishing
to any Person and/or its Affiliates, officers, directors, agents or
Representatives any non-public information relating to the Company and/or its
Subsidiaries or by affording to any Person and/or its Affiliates, officers,

assets, books, records or other non-public information, or to the personnel,
of the Company and/or its Subsidiaries (each, a "Solicited Person") (all
pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement and provided that the
Company shall promptly make available to the Parent any material non-public
information concerning the Company and/or its Subsidiaries that is

* * *

provided to any Person given such access which was not previously made
available to the Parent or its officers, directors or Representatives), (ii)
to continue, enter into, participate in and/or engage in any discussions or
negotiations with one or more Persons and/or their Affiliates, officers,
directors, agents or Representatives with respect to one or more Acquisition
Proposals or any other proposals that could lead to an Acquisition Proposal,
and (iii) to the extent not otherwise prohibited by this Agreement, to
otherwise cooperate with, assist or take any action to facilitate any
Acquisition Proposals or any other proposals that could lead to any
Acquisition Proposals.

(b) Except as permitted by Sections 5.3(c) and (e) below, the Company shall,
shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, and shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause each of its Representatives to, (i) beginning on the No-Shop
Period Start Date, cease and cause to be terminated any discussions or
negotiations with any Person (other than Excluded Parties, as defined below)
that would otherwise be prohibited by this Section 5.3(b) and (ii) from the
No-Shop Period Start Date until the earlier of the Effective Time or
termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, (A) not solicit or
take other action to facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal
that constitutes or may reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition
Proposal, (B) not participate in any way in any discussions or negotiations
relating thereto or in furtherance thereof or accept any Acquisition Proposal,
except to notify such person as to the existence of the provisions of this

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Company, its Subsidiaries and its
Representatives may take and continue to take any of the actions described in

any Solicited Person that, prior to the No-Shop Period Start Date, has made a
bona fide Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board and the Independent
Committee determine in good faith (after consultation with Company\'s outside
financial and legal advisors) constitutes or would reasonably be expected to
result in a Superior Proposal (each such Solicited Person, an "Excluded
Party"). Notwithstanding anything contained in this Section 5.3(b) to the
contrary, any Excluded Party shall cease to be an Excluded Party for all
purposes under this Agreement immediately at such time as the Acquisition
Proposal made by such party is withdrawn, is terminated or expires, or the
Company Board and the Independent Committee determine in good faith (after
consultation with Company\'s outside financial and legal advisors) that such
Acquisition Proposal ceases to constitute, or ceases to be reasonably likely
to lead to, a Superior Proposal. Company hereby represents that as of the date
of this Agreement neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries is engaged in
discussions or negotiations with any Person other than Parent with respect to
any Acquisition Proposal.

(c) Notwithstanding Section 5.3(b), the Company Board and the Independent

faith by the Company Board and Independent Committee, may (i) furnish
information (including, without limitation, confidential information)
concerning Company to a third Person who makes an unsolicited request for such
information for the purpose of making an Acquisition Proposal, and (ii) engage
in discussions or negotiations with a third Person who submits in writing an
interest in making an Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board and
Independent Committee determine in good faith (after consultation with
Company\'s outside financial and legal advisors) constitutes or would
reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal.

* * *

(d) Except as provided by Section 5.3(e), at any time after the execution of
this Agreement, the Company Board shall not (i) resolve to withdraw, modify or
qualify and/or withdraw, modify or qualify the Company Recommendation in a
manner adverse to the Parent and/or Merger Sub (a "Change of Recommendation"),
or (ii) cause or permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into
any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle,
acquisition agreement, merger agreement, option agreement, joint venture
agreement, partnership agreement or other similar agreement (an "Alternative
Acquisition Agreement") relating to any Acquisition Proposal (other than any
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement).

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, at
any time prior to the receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval, (i) the
Company Board may make a Change of Recommendation or enter into an Alternative
Acquisition Agreement, as applicable, if the Company Board with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal has determined in good faith, after consultation with its
financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that (A) there is a reasonable
probability that the failure to do so would cause the Company Board to violate
its fiduciary duties to the Company Shareholders under applicable Law and (B)
such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal or (ii) if an event,
fact, circumstance, development or occurrence that affects, or would
reasonably be expected to affect, the business, assets, operations or results
of operations of the Company or its Subsidiaries and that has not occurred or
is unknown to the Company Board as of the date of this Agreement (an
"Intervening Event") occurs or becomes known to the Company Board, the Company
Board may effect a Change of Recommendation; provided that the Company Board
has determined in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors
and outside legal counsel, that there is a reasonable probability that the
failure to do so would cause the Company Board to violate its fiduciary duties
to the Company Shareholders under applicable Law, provided that (W) Company
shall have provided prior written notice to Parent at least three (3) days in
advance (the "Notice Period") of its intention to take such action and
provided the reasons for the Change of Recommendation described in either (i)
or (ii) and, if related to a Superior Proposal, the material terms and
conditions of any such Superior Proposal (including the identity of the person
making the Superior Proposal and the ultimate beneficial owner or owners and
controlling persons thereof, to the extent such information is reasonably
available to Company), (X) in the case of a Superior Proposal, prior to
effecting such Change of Recommendation, or, approving or recommending such
Superior Proposal or terminating this Agreement to enter into an Alternative
Acquisition Agreement, Company shall, and shall cause its Representatives to,
during the Notice Period, negotiate with Parent and its Representatives in
good faith (to the extent that Parent desires to negotiate) to enable Parent
to propose in writing a binding offer to effect revisions to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, the Financing Letter, the Related Person
Investment Commitment, the Letter Amendment and the Licensor Warrant
Amendment, as would alleviate the need for a Change of Recommendation, or such
approval, recommendation or termination, (Y) in the case of a Superior
Proposal, the Company Board shall have considered in good faith any changes to
this Agreement, the Financing Letter, the Related Person Investment
Commitment, the Letter Amendment or the Licensor Warrant Amendment offered in
writing by Parent and shall have determined that the Superior Proposal would
continue to constitute a Superior Proposal if such changes were to be given
effect and (Z) in the case of a Superior Proposal, prior to effecting such
Change of Recommendation or entering into an Alternative Acquisition
Agreement, Company shall have terminated this Agreement and paid to Parent any
Termination Fee payable with respect to such termination in

* * *

accordance with the terms hereof. Any material amendment to the material terms
of such Superior Proposal shall require a new notice and Notice Period, and
Company shall be required to comply again with the requirements of these
subclauses (W) through (Z).

(f) Company agrees that it will keep the Parent reasonably informed regarding
the matters contemplated by this Section 5.3 (including any Acquisition
Proposals). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (i) Company
agrees that it will promptly (and, in any event, within forty-eight (48)
hours) notify Parent if any proposals or offers with respect to an Acquisition
Proposal are received by Company or its Representatives indicating, in
connection with such notice, the identity of the Person or group of Persons
making such offer or proposal, the material terms and conditions of any
proposals or offers (including, if applicable, copies of any written requests,
proposals or offers, including proposed agreements) and thereafter shall keep
Parent reasonably informed, on a prompt basis, of the status and terms of any
such proposals or offers (including any amendments thereto) and the status of
any such discussions or negotiations, including any change in Company's
intentions as previously notified and (ii) following the No-Shop Period Start
Date, Company agrees that it will promptly (and, in any event, within forty-
eight (48) hours) notify the Parent if any non-public information is requested
from, or any discussions or negotiations are sought to be initiated or
continued with, Company or any of its Representatives indicating, in
connection with such notice, the identity of the person or group of Persons
and the status of any such discussions or negotiations, including any change
in Company's intentions as previously notified, in each case pursuant to an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement.

(g) Other than with respect to the Financing Letter, the Letter Amendment, the
Licensor Warrant Amendment or the Related Person Investment Commitment or as
contemplated by this Agreement, neither Parent nor Merger Sub, nor any of
their respective Affiliates, shall make or enter into any formal or informal
arrangements or understandings (whether or not binding) with any Person, or
have any discussions or other communications with any other person, in any
such case with respect to any Acquisition Proposal involving Company.

(h) Nothing in this Section 5.3 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall prohibit
Company, Company Board or any committee thereof from (i) taking and disclosing
to Company Shareholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9
or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act, (ii)
complying with its disclosure obligations under applicable Law, it being
understood that neither any "stop, look and listen" letter or similar
communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange
Act, nor any accurate disclosure of factual information to the Company
Shareholders that is required to be made to such stockholders under applicable
Law or in satisfaction of the Company Board's fiduciary duties or applicable
Law, shall be deemed a modification of the Company Board's approval or
recommendation of the Merger and this Agreement.

(i) For purposes of this Agreement:

(i) An "Acquisition Proposal" shall mean any proposal or offer, including any
proposal or offer from or to the Company Shareholders, made by any Person or
"group" (as defined under Rule 13(d) of the Exchange Act) other than Parent,
whether in a single transaction or series of related transactions, and

* * *

whether directly or indirectly, for (i) a merger, reorganization, share
exchange, consolidation, business combination, joint venture, partnership,
recapitalization, dissolution, liquidation or similar transaction involving
Company and/or any Subsidiary or Subsidiaries of the Company whose business or
businesses constitute twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the assets,
revenues or earnings of Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (ii)
an acquisition of assets of Company and/or its Subsidiaries equal to twenty-
five percent (25%) or more of the consolidated assets of Company and its
Subsidiaries or to which twenty-five percent (25%) or more of Company's
revenues or earnings on a consolidated basis are attributable (iii) an
acquisition of 25% or more of the outstanding Company Common Stock, or (iv) a
tender offer or exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in any

that all references to "25%" in the definition of "Acquisition Proposal" shall

counsel and after taking into account all legal, financial (including the
financing terms thereof), regulatory, timing and other aspects of the
proposal, as well as any modification to this Agreement and/or the Related
Person Investment that the Parent and Merger Sub propose to make in accordance
with Section 5.3(e)(ii)), (A) is on terms that are more favorable to the

a reasonable period of time.

(iii) "Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement" shall mean a confidentiality that
contains confidentiality provisions that are not materially less favorable in

to restrict a person from communicating an Acquisition Proposal to the Company
Board or any duly constituted and authorized committee thereof).

5.4 Acquisition Advances and Related Persons Investment Arrangements.

(a) Parent will use its best efforts to obtain the Acquisition Advances on the
terms and conditions described in the Financing Letter, including using its
best efforts (i) to satisfy (or obtain the waiver of) all conditions on a
timely basis to obtaining the Acquisition Advances applicable to Parent set
forth in such definitive agreements and the Parent Credit Agreement that are
within its control, (ii) to comply in all material respects with its
obligations under the Financing Letter and the Parent Credit Agreement
relating to the Acquisition Advances (or obtain the waiver thereof) and (iii)
to enforce its rights under the Financing Letter and the Parent Credit
Agreement relating to the Acquisition Advances. Parent shall give Company
prompt notice upon becoming

* * *

aware of any material breach of the Financing Letter by a party to the
Financing Letter or any termination of the Financing Letter or any breach or
default under the Parent Credit Agreement that would reasonably be expected to
prevent Parent from obtaining the Acquisition Advances. Parent shall keep
Company informed promptly and in reasonable detail of the status of its
efforts to arrange the Acquisition Advances and provide to Company copies of
the definitive documents related to the Acquisition Advances and shall not
permit any amendment or modification to be made to, or any waiver of any
material provision or remedy under, the Financing Letter if such amendment,
modification or waiver (A) reduces the aggregate amount of Acquisition
Advances, (B) adversely amends or expands the conditions to the drawdown of
the Acquisition Advances in any respect that could make the conditions less
likely to be satisfied by the Outside Date, (C) can reasonably be expected to
delay the Closing or the date on which the Acquisition Advances would be
obtained or (D) is otherwise adverse to the interests of Company in any other
respect except with the prior written consent of Company (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned). In the event that all
conditions in the Financing Letter and the Parent Credit Agreement to the
Acquisition Advances have been satisfied or, upon funding, will be satisfied,
Parent shall use its best efforts to cause the Lenders to fund on the Closing
Date the Acquisition Advances required to consummate the Transactions.

(b) Parent will use its best efforts to obtain the Related Persons Investment
on the terms and conditions described in the Related Persons Investment
Commitment, including using its best efforts (i) to comply in all material
respects with its obligations under the Related Persons Investment Commitment
(or obtain the waiver thereof) and (ii) to enforce its rights under the
Related Persons Investment Commitment. Parent shall give Company prompt notice
upon becoming aware of any material breach of the Related Persons Investment
Commitment by a party to the Related Persons Investment Commitment or any
termination of the Related Persons Investment Commitment. Parent shall keep
Company informed promptly and in reasonable detail of the status of its
efforts to arrange the Related Persons Investment and provide to Company
copies of the definitive documents related to the Related Persons Investment
and shall not permit any amendment or modification to be made to, or any
waiver of any material provision or remedy under, the Related Persons
Investment Commitment if such amendment, modification or waiver (A) reduces
the aggregate amount of the Related Persons Investment, (B) can reasonably be
expected to delay the Closing or the date on which Related Persons Investment
would be made or (C) is otherwise adverse to the interests of Company in any
other respect except with the prior written consent of Company (which shall
not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned). Parent shall use its
best efforts to cause the Related Persons to fund the Related Persons
Investment prior to or on the Closing Date to consummate the Transactions.

(c) In the event that Parent becomes aware of any event or circumstance that
makes procurement of any portion of the Acquisition Advances or the Related
Persons Investment (collectively, the "Financing") unlikely to occur in the
manner or from the sources contemplated, Parent shall immediately notify
Company, and Parent shall use its best efforts to arrange any such portion
(other than amounts that are replaced by Parent's cash on hand) from
alternative sources (such portion from alternate sources, the "Alternate
Financing") on terms and conditions, taken as a whole, no less favorable to
Parent.

(d) Prior to the Closing, Company shall provide, and shall use its best
efforts to cause

* * *

its officers and employees to provide, on a timely basis, all reasonable
cooperation requested by Parent and that is customary in connection with the
arrangement of the Financing or any Alternate Financing to be incurred in
connection with the Transactions (provided that such requested cooperation
does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of the Company),
including using its commercially reasonable efforts to (i) facilitate the
provision of Company guarantees and pledges of collateral (effective as of the
Closing), (ii) provide financial and other pertinent information regarding
Company as may be reasonably requested in writing by Parent in order to
consummate the Financing, (iii) provide information with respect to the
properties and assets of Company as may be reasonably requested by Parent,
(iv) participate in a reasonable number of informational meetings and road
show meetings in connection with the Financing and (v) assist Parent and its
financing sources in the preparation of all agreements (including review of
schedules for completeness), offering documents, an offering memorandum and
other marketing materials for the Financing or any such Alternate Financing,
it being understood and agreed that information and documents provided by
Company may be delivered to agents and lenders under the Financing Letter and
their Representatives (subject to customary arrangements for confidentiality

Agreement and to provide for the issuance of 300,000 shares of Parent Common

upon by Company and Parent. Each of the Company and the Parent shall also file
a Current Report on Form 8-K reporting the entering into of this Agreement and

shall, without the prior consent of the other party (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld or delayed), issue or cause the publication of any
press release or other public announcement with respect to this Agreement or
the Transactions, except for any such press release or public announcement as
may be required by Law, by Nasdaq rules, or by applicable fiduciary duties as
determined in the good faith judgment of the party proposing to make such

relating to the exchange of information, Company and Parent shall, and shall
cause each of their Subsidiaries to, afford to the officers, employees and
other Representatives of the other, during the period prior to the Effective

records, and to its officers, employees and other Representatives during
normal business hours and, during such period, Company and Parent shall, and
shall cause their Subsidiaries to, make available to the other all other
information concerning its business, properties and personnel as Parent or
Company may reasonably request. Each party shall conduct any such activities
in such a manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the business and
operations of the other, and neither party shall be obligated to provide such
access or information if it determines, in its reasonable judgment, that doing
so would violate applicable Law or an obligation of confidentiality owing to a
third party, waive protection of an attorney-client privilege, or expose it to
risk of liability for disclosure. The information provided will be used solely
in connection with the Transactions and shall be subject to the
Confidentiality Agreement.

5.8 Notification of Certain Matters. Company shall give prompt notice to
Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to Company, of (i) any notice or
other communication received by such party from any Governmental Entity in
connection with the Transactions or from any Person alleging that the consent

* * *

and (ii) any actions, suits, claims, investigations or proceedings commenced
or, to such party's Knowledge, threatened against, relating to or involving or
otherwise affecting such party or any of its Subsidiaries which relate to the
Transactions.

5.9 Director and Officer Indemnification.

(a) From and after the Effective Time and for a period of six (6) years
thereafter, each of Parent and Surviving Corporation shall (i) indemnify and
hold harmless each individual who at the Effective Time is, or any time prior
to the Effective Time was, a director, officer or employee of Company or any
of its Subsidiaries (the "Indemnitees") in respect of all claims, liabilities,
losses, damages, judgments, fines, penalties costs and expenses (including
legal expenses) in connection with any claim, suit, action, proceeding or
investigation, whenever asserted, based on or arising out the fact that
Indemnitee was an officer, director or employee of Company or any Subsidiary
or acts or omissions by Indemnitee in such capacity or taken at the request of
Company or any Subsidiary, at or any time prior to the Effective Time
(including any claim, suit, action, proceeding or investigation relating to
the Transactions), to the fullest extent permitted by Law and (ii) assume all
obligations of Company and Subsidiaries to Indemnitees in respect of
indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time as provided in Company Charter
Documents and the organizational documents of Company Subsidiaries. Without
limiting the foregoing, Parent, from and after the Effective Time, shall cause
the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, and
upon the effective date of the Second Merger, the certificate of formation and
limited liability company agreement of Merger Sub I, and its Subsidiaries to
contain provisions no less favorable to the Indemnitees with respect to
limitation of liabilities of directors, officers and managers and
indemnification than are set forth as of the date of this Agreement in the
Company Charter Documents, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or
otherwise modified in a manner that would adversely affect the rights
thereunder of the Indemnitees. In addition, Parent, from and after the
Effective Time, shall and shall cause Surviving Corporation to, advance any
expenses (including legal expenses) of any Indemnitee under this Section 5.9
as incurred to the fullest extent permitted by Law, provided that the
Indemnitee to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay
advances if it shall be determined that such Indemnitee is not entitled to be
indemnified pursuant to this Section 5.9.

(b) The Surviving Corporation shall, for six years after the Effective Time,
maintain in effect the current directors' and officers' liability insurance
policies maintained by the Company (provided that the Surviving Corporation
may substitute therefor policies of at least the same coverage and amounts
containing terms and conditions which are no less advantageous to such
officers and directors so long as substitution does not result in gaps or
lapses in coverage) with respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective
Time; provided, however, that in no event shall the Surviving Corporation be
required to expend pursuant to this Section 5.9(b) more than an amount per
year equal to 200% of current annual premiums paid by the Company for such
insurance and, in the event the cost of such coverage shall exceed that
amount, the Surviving Corporation shall purchase as much coverage as possible
for such amount. The provisions of this Section 5.9 shall be deemed to have
been satisfied if prepaid "tail" policies with the same terms, conditions and
coverage as indicated above have been obtained by the Surviving Corporation
for purposes of this

* * *

Section 5.9 from carriers with the same or better rating as the carrier of
such insurances as of the date of this Agreement.

(c) The provisions of this Section 5.9 are intended for the benefit of, and
shall be enforceable by, each Indemnitee, his or her heirs and his or her
representatives and is in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other
rights to indemnification or contribution that any Indemnitee may have under
Company Charter Documents, by contract or otherwise. In the event the
Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates
with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii)
transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person,
then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the
successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation or the purchaser of its
assets and properties shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section
5.9. This Section 5.9 shall survive the Effective Time.

5.10 Meetings with Business Partners. Following the date hereof, Company shall
permit Parent and its Representatives accompanied by Company and its
Representatives to meet with the material licensors, suppliers, distributors
and customers of the Company and its Subsidiaries set forth on Section 5.10 of
the Company Disclosure Schedule to discuss the continued relationship of such
Persons with Parent and its Subsidiaries following the Closing Date. Such
meetings will be held at such times as shall be reasonably acceptable to both
Company and Parent and the subject and agenda of such meetings shall be
reasonably acceptable to Company. Promptly following the date hereof, Parent
and Company shall mutually agree upon a joint written announcement to such
Persons regarding the Transactions.

5.11 Payment of Parent Payable to Company. Company and Parent have agreed as
to the maximum balance of Parent payables due and owing to Company as of the
end of each calendar month as set forth on Exhibit A attached hereto. The
balance of Parent payables due and owing to Company as of any calendar month
end shall be jointly determined by Company and Parent within one week after
such month-end consistent with past practices. Following such joint
determination of the Parent payables month end balance, if such balance shall
have exceed the applicable maximum balance, Parent shall make a payment to
Company equal to such excess within two (2) Business Days after such
determination. If with respect to the most recent calendar month ending at
least two weeks prior to the Closing Date, Parent fails to make such payment
of an excess amount by the date, the Target shall be reduced by the amount of
such unpaid amount.

5.12 Required Filings.

(a) Parent shall use its best efforts to file and obtain approval and
effectiveness of any required listing applications with Nasdaq with respect to
the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the Merger and any
federal or state forms, notices or other documents relating to the issuance of
such securities required to be filed under applicable state or federal
securities laws.

(b) Not later than ten (10) Business Days after the date hereof and pursuant
to the applicable requirements of the HSR Act and the rules and regulations
thereunder, Parent and Company shall cause to be filed with the Federal Trade
Commission ("FTC") and the Antitrust

* * *

Division of the Department of Justice ("DOJ") all requisite documents and
notifications in connection with the Transactions. Parent and Company shall
diligently and expeditiously take steps necessary to comply with the HSR Act;
provided that nothing in this Agreement shall require Parent, Company or their
Subsidiaries to take or agree to take any action with respect to its business
or operations unless the effectiveness of such agreement is conditioned upon
the Closing. Each party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) keep
the other party informed in all material respects and on a reasonably timely
basis of any material communication received by such party from, or given by
such party to, the FTC or the DOJ and (ii) to the extent permitted by the FTC
or the DOJ, give the other party the opportunity to attend and participate in
and consult with the other party in advance regarding any meeting with the FTC
or DOJ regarding the filings and any inquiries related to the Transactions.

5.13 Tax-Free Reorganization.

(a) Unless any condition to the Second Merger as set forth in Section 5.15 is
not satisfied, each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Merger, taken together with the
Second Merger, to qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Code.

(b) Unless otherwise required pursuant to a "determination" within the meaning
of Section 1313(a) of the Code, provided the Second Merger occurs, each of
Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall report the Merger, taken together
with the Second Merger, as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Code.

(c) The parties hereto shall cooperate and use their commercially reasonable
efforts to deliver to Parent's and the Company's tax counsel and tax advisors
a certificate containing representations reasonably requested by such counsel
and/or advisors in connection with the rendering of any tax opinions to be
issued by such counsel and/or advisors with respect to the treatment of the
Merger and the Second Merger as a reorganization within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Code. Parent's and the Company's tax counsel and tax advisors
shall be entitled to rely upon such representations in rendering any such
opinions.

5.14 Section 16 Matters. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board shall
take all such steps as may be necessary or appropriate to cause the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any dispositions of
Company Common Stock (including derivative securities with respect to Company
Common Stock) resulting from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
by each individual who is or will be subject to the reporting requirements of
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company, to be exempt
under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

5.15 Second Merger. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective
Time, and in any event within one year after the Effective Time, unless
otherwise provided below in this Section 5.15, Parent shall cause the Second
Merger to be effected by, among other things, adopting and causing the
Surviving Corporation to adopt an agreement and plan of merger and
reorganization pursuant to which the Surviving Corporation shall be merged
with and into Merger Sub I, with Merger Sub I being the entity surviving the
Second Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent.

* * *

There shall be no conditions to the Second Merger, other than (a) the
consummation of the Merger, (b) the absence of any legal prohibition on
completing the Second Merger, (c) there not being an Inadequate Continuity of
Interest and (d) the receipt by Parent and Company of a written opinion of
Edwards Wildman Palmer LLP, counsel to Parent, and Squire, Sanders and Dempsey
(US) LLP, counsel to the Company, respectively, in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to Parent and Company, respectively, to the effect
that the Mergers, taken together, will constitute a "reorganization" within
the meaning of Section 368 of the Code, and neither of such opinions shall
have been withdrawn. Such opinions may rely on representations as such counsel
reasonably deems appropriate and on typical assumptions. If any of the
foregoing conditions is not satisfied, the Second Merger shall not occur and
the provisions of this Agreement pertaining to the Mergers qualifying as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368 of the Code shall not
apply.

5.16 Employee Matters.

(a) Following the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to provide to employees of the Company and its Company Subsidiaries employed
immediately prior to the Effective Time (and their dependents) (the "Company
Employees") and former employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries
terminated prior to the Effective Time, the compensation and benefits required
by applicable Law or pursuant to vested benefits under any Company Benefit
Plan; provided, however, that nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the
Parent or the Surviving Corporation from terminating the employment of any
Company Employee.

(b) For a period of at least twelve (12) months following the Effective Time,
unless the Company Employees have been enrolled in or entitled to benefits
under a comparable Buyer Plan and entitled to the benefits thereunder provided
to similarly situated employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries, Parent shall,
and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, honor, in accordance with their
respective terms (as in effect on the date of this Agreement), each Company
Benefit Plan including with respect to any payments, benefits or rights
arising as a result of the Transactions, without any amendment or
modification, other than any amendment or modification required to comply with
applicable Law. After such twelve (12) month period, Parent shall, and shall
cause the Surviving Corporation, to enroll the Company Employees in and
receive benefits under the Buyer Plans to the same extent as similarly
situated employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries. Parent acknowledges and
agrees that the consummation of the Offer will constitute a "Change in
Control", "Change of Control" or "Terminating Event" (as applicable) under the
Company Benefit Plans.

(c) With respect to any "employee benefit plan", as defined in Section 3(3) of
ERISA, maintained by Parent or any of Parent's Subsidiaries (including any
vacation, paid time off and severance plans) in which Company Employees
participate on or after the Effective Time ("Buyer Plans"), for all purposes,
including determining eligibility to participate, level of benefits, benefit
accruals (other than for purposes of benefit accrual under any defined benefit
plan) and vesting (other than for purposes of any equity-based compensation),
each Company Employee's service with the Company or a Company Subsidiary (as
well as service with any predecessor employer of the Company or the Company
Subsidiary to the extent service with such predecessor employer is recognized
by the Company or the Company Subsidiary) shall be treated as service with
Parent or any of Parent's Subsidiaries; provided that the foregoing shall not
apply to the extent its application

* * *

would result in a duplication of benefits with respect to the same period of
service. In the event Parent, the Surviving Corporation, or any of Parent's
Subsidiaries terminates any or all of the Company Benefit Plans during the
twelve (12) month period commencing on the Effective Time, each Company
Employee shall participate in a Buyer Plan substantially comparable to the
terminated Company Benefit Plan.

(d) Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to waive, or cause to be
waived, any pre-existing condition limitation, exclusions, actively-at-work
requirements and waiting periods under any welfare benefit plan maintained by
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (other than the Company Benefit Plans) in
which the Company Employees (and their eligible dependents) will be eligible
to participate from and after the Effective Time. Parent shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to recognize, or cause to be recognized, the
dollar amount of all expenses incurred by each Company Employee (and his or
her eligible dependents) during the calendar year in which the Effective Time
occurs for purposes of satisfying such year's deductible and co-payment
limitations under the relevant welfare benefit plans in which they will be
eligible to participate from and after the Effective Time.

(e) For the twelve (12) month period following the Effective Time, Company
Employees shall be eligible to receive severance benefits pursuant to the
Company Severance Plan from Parent, the Surviving Corporation, or the
applicable Parent Subsidiary.

(f) The provisions of this Section 5.16 are for the sole benefit of the
parties to this Agreement and nothing herein, expressed or implied, is
intended or shall be construed to confer upon or give to any Person
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, any Company Employee), other than the
parties hereto and their respective permitted successors and assigns, any
legal or equitable or other rights or remedies under or by reason of any
provision of this Agreement. No provision in this Agreement shall modify or
amend any Company Benefit Plan or Buyer Plan unless this Agreement explicitly
states that the provision "amends" such Company Benefit Plan or Buyer Plan.
This shall not prevent the parties entitled to enforce this Agreement from
enforcing any provision in this Agreement, but no other party shall be
entitled to enforce any provision in this Agreement on the grounds that it is
an amendment to such Company Benefit Plan or Buyer Plan. If a party not
entitled to enforce this Agreement brings a lawsuit or other action to enforce
any provision in this Agreement as an amendment to such Company Benefit Plan
or Buyer Plan and that provision is construed to be such an amendment despite
not being explicitly designated as one in this Agreement, that provision shall
lapse retroactively as of its inception, thereby precluding it from having any
amendatory effect.

5.17 Company Transaction Costs and Expenses. Exhibit B sets forth an itemized
list, prepared in good faith, of Company's expenses incurred through the date
hereof, and the total amount of additional expenses that Company estimates, as
of the date hereof, to be incurred by it in connection with the Transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including, without limitation, the fees and
expenses of Company's financial advisors and outside counsel and accountants,
which the Company shall use commercially reasonably efforts to update if, to
the Company's Knowledge, additional expenses will be incurred or, to the
Company's Knowledge, there were omitted expenses that should have appeared on
Exhibit B.

* * *

5.18 Parent Vote. Immediately following the execution of this Agreement,
Parent shall execute and deliver, in its capacity as sole shareholder of
Merger Sub, a written consent adopting this Agreement.

5.19 Credit Facility Termination. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall obtain pay-off information for the Company Credit Facility so that,
simultaneously with Closing, Parent and the Company shall terminate the
Company Credit Facility and obtain the release of any and all Liens arising
thereunder.
