"Buyer"), Whopper Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned
subsidiary of the Buyer (the "Transitory Subsidiary"), and Click Holding
Corp., a Delaware corporation (the "Company").

WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of the Buyer and the Company deem it
advisable and in the best interests of each corporation and their respective
stockholders that the Buyer acquire the Company;

WHEREAS, the acquisition of the Company shall be effected through a merger
(the "Merger") of the Transitory Subsidiary with and into the Company in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Delaware General
Corporation Law (the "DGCL"), as a result of which the Company shall become a
wholly owned subsidiary of the Buyer;

WHEREAS, immediately following the execution and delivery of this Agreement
by the parties hereto and as a material inducement to the Buyer and the
Transitory Subsidiary to enter into this Agreement, the Company shall obtain
and shall deliver to the Buyer a true, correct and complete copy of an Action
by Written Consent evidencing the adoption and approval of the Merger, this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (and, as such, adoption of
the Company Voting Proposal), in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A
(the "Stockholder Written Consent"), signed by certain stockholders
constituting the Requisite Company Stockholder Vote (as defined below); and

WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of the Buyer, the Transitory
Subsidiary and the Company deem it advisable and in the best interests of
their respective stockholders to consummate the Merger on the terms and
conditions set forth in this Agreement.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the
respective representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth

as is required by, and executed by the Company in accordance with, the
relevant provisions of the DGCL and shall make all other filings or recordings
required under the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective upon the filing and
acceptance of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware or at such later time as is established by the Buyer and the

Company (the "Closing Date"), which shall be no later than the second Business
Day after satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VII
(other than delivery of items to be delivered at the Closing and other than
satisfaction of those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at
the Closing, it being understood that the occurrence of the Closing
shall remain subject to the delivery of such items and the satisfaction or
waiver of such conditions at the Closing), at the offices of Wilson, Sonsini,

New York, New York are permitted or required by law, executive order or
governmental decree to remain closed.

1.3. _Effects of the Merger_. At the Effective Time, the separate existence

sometimes referred to herein as the "Surviving Corporation"). The Merger
shall have the effects set forth in Section 259 of the DGCL.

1.4.  _Certificate of Incorporation_. At the Effective Time, the certificate
of incorporation of the Company (as amended), as in effect immediately prior

as set forth in Exhibit B attached hereto and, as so amended and restated,
shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter amended in accordance with the DGCL and as provided in such
certificate of incorporation. 

1.5. _By-laws_. At the Effective Time, the By-laws of the Transitory
Subsidiary, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall
become the By-laws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as
provided by applicable law, the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation and such By-laws.

1.6. _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation_.

(a) The directors of the Transitory Subsidiary immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the initial directors of the Surviving Corporation,
each to hold office in accordance with the Certificate of Incorporation and

be the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in

ARTICLE II

Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of the

2 (a) _Capital Stock of the Transitory Subsidiary_. Each share of the common
stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Transitory Subsidiary issued and

and become one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, $0.01 par
value per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

(b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Buyer-Owned Stock_. All shares of
common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of the Company ("Company Common
Stock") that are owned by the Company as treasury stock and any shares of

other wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Buyer immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and no stock of the Buyer or
other consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

(c) _Merger Consideration for Company Common Stock_. Subject to Section 2.2,
each share of Company Common Stock (other than (i) shares to be cancelled in
accordance with Section 2.1(b) and (ii) Dissenting Shares (as defined in
Section 2.4(a) below) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be automatically converted into the right to receive the
Per Share Amount. As of the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Common
Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and
shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate representing any such
shares of Company Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive the Per Share Amount pursuant to this
Section 2.1(c) upon the surrender of such certificate in accordance
with Section 2.2, without interest.

(d) _Definitions_. For all purposes of this Agreement, the following terms
shall have the following respective meanings:

equal to the interest on the Equity Value compounded daily at an annual rate
of 10% from (and including) the twelve-month anniversary of the date hereof to
(but excluding) the date that is the earlier of (I) the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with Section 8.1 or (II) the Effective Time, _minus_

Company and its Subsidiaries as of immediately prior to the Effective Time,
including any penalties or premiums that would be associated with the full

whether or not then vested or exercisable, _plus_ (C) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock relating to all Company SARs (other than Excluded Company
SARs) outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or
not then vested or exercisable.

(xi) "Merger Consideration" shall mean the aggregate Per Share Amount payable
to holders of Company Common Stock pursuant to this Article II.

(xii) "Per Share Amount" shall mean an amount of cash equal to the quotient
obtained by dividing (x) the Calculation Amount by (y) the Fully Diluted Share

behalf of the Company in connection with the Merger, including all legal,  



 

4  accounting, financial advisory, consulting and all other fees and expenses
of third parties incurred by or on behalf of the Company in connection with

Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (including, but not limited
to, any payments made or anticipated to be made by the Company as a brokerage
or finders fee, agents commission or any similar charge in connection with
the Merger) and shall be based on the Payments Spreadsheet to be delivered to
the Buyer pursuant to Section 6.13 of this Agreement.

2.2. _Exchange of Certificates_. The procedures for exchanging certificates
representing shares of Company Common Stock for the applicable portion of the
Merger Consideration pursuant to the Merger are as follows:

(a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Buyer shall deposit
with U.S. Bank, National Association or another bank or trust company mutually
acceptable to the Buyer and the Company (the "Exchange Agent"), for the
benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and for payment through the Exchange
Agent in accordance with this Section 2.2, cash in an amount sufficient to
make payment of the portions of the Merger Consideration payable pursuant
to Section 2.1(c) in exchange for all of the outstanding shares of Company
Common Stock (the "Exchange Fund").

(b)  _Exchange Procedures_.

(i) At least two (2) Business Days prior to the Effective Time, the Buyer
shall cause the Exchange Agent to make available at the Companys offices to
each holder of record of Company Common Stock (A) a letter of transmittal (a
"Letter of Transmittal") in the form attached hereto as Exhibit C and (B)
instructions for receiving the Merger Consideration payable with respect
thereto. Any such holder who delivers a duly executed Letter of Transmittal
and certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (each, a "Certificate") to the
Exchange Agent at the Closing shall receive, in exchange therefor at the
Closing, the Merger Consideration that such holder has the right to receive
pursuant to the provisions of this Article II and the Certificate so
surrendered shall be immediately cancelled. All amounts delivered to such
holders of Company Common Stock shall be payable by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated by such holder in the
Letter of Transmittal or, if an account is not designated by in the Letter of
Transmittal, by check.

(ii) At or promptly after the Effective Time (and in any event within two (2)
Business Days thereafter), the Buyer shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to
each holder of record of Company Common Stock who did not deliver a duly
executed Letter of Transmittal and Certificate to the Exchange Agent at the
Closing (A) a Letter of Transmittal and (B) instructions for receiving the
Merger Consideration payable with respect thereto. Upon surrender of a duly
executed Letter of Transmittal and Certificate to the Exchange Agent, such
holder shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the applicable
portion of the Merger Consideration that such holder has the right to receive
pursuant to the provisions of this Article II, and the Certificate so
surrendered shall  



 

5  immediately be cancelled. All amounts delivered to such holders of Company
Common Stock shall be payable by wire transfer of immediately available
funds within two (2) Business Days after delivery of the duly executed Letter
of Transmittal and Certificate to an account designated by such holder in the
Letter of Transmittal or, if an account is not designated by in the Letter of
Transmittal, by check.

(iii) In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock which is
not registered in the transfer records of the Company, the applicable portion
of the Merger Consideration may be paid to a person other than the person in
whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate
is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to
evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock
transfer taxes have been paid.

(iv) Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.2, each Certificate
shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the
right to receive upon such surrender the applicable portion of the Merger
Consideration as contemplated by this Section 2.2.

(c) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which
remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock for one year
after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Buyer upon demand, and any
holder of Company Common Stock who has not previously complied with
this Section 2.2 shall look only to the Buyer (subject to abandoned property,
escheat and similar laws) for payment of its claim for the applicable portion
of the Merger Consideration, without interest.

(d) _No Liability_. To the extent permitted by applicable law, none of the
Buyer, the Transitory Subsidiary, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or
the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any holder of shares of Company Common
Stock delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar law.

(e) _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Buyer and the Surviving Corporation
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Common
Stock such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to
the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the "Code"), or any other applicable state, local or foreign Tax law. To the
extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld by the Surviving Corporation
or the Buyer, as the case may be, such deducted and withheld amounts (i)
shall be remitted by the Buyer or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may
be, to the applicable Governmental Entity and (ii) shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares
of Company Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding
was made by the Surviving Corporation or the Buyer, as the case may be.

(f) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall
issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the
applicable portion of the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect thereof
pursuant to this Agreement.



 

6 (g) _Stock Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common
Stock_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall
be closed, and there shall be no further registration of transfers of shares
thereafter on the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time,
the holders of Certificates representing shares of Company Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any
rights with respect to such shares, except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement or by applicable law. On or after the Effective Time, any
Certificates presented to the Exchange Agent or the Buyer for any reason shall
be canceled against delivery of the applicable portion of the Merger
Consideration to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to
this Article II.

2.3. _Company Stock Options and Company SARs_.

(a) The Company shall take such action, including providing any notices and
obtaining any consents, as shall be required:

(i) to effectuate the cancellation, as of the Effective Time, of all Company
Stock Options and Company SARs that are vested by their terms at the
Effective Time (including those that are vested by their terms at the
Effective Time as a result of the transactions contemplated hereby) (each
individually a "Vested Company Stock Option" or "Vested Company SAR," as
applicable, and collectively the "Vested Company Stock Options" and "Vested
Company SARs," as applicable) that are outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (without regard to the exercise price thereof); and

(ii) to cause each outstanding Vested Company Stock Option and Vested Company
SAR upon such cancellation to represent as of the Effective Time solely the
right to receive from the Buyer, in accordance with this Section 2.3, a lump
sum cash payment in the amount of the Vested Option and SAR Consideration (as
defined below), if any, with respect to such Vested Company Stock Option or
Vested Company SAR and to no longer represent the right to purchase (or, in
the case of a Vested Company SAR, to receive a cash payment based on the value
of) any Company Common Stock or any other equity security of the Company, the
Buyer, the Surviving Corporation or any other person or any other
consideration.

(b) Each holder of a Vested Company Stock Option or Vested Company SAR shall
receive from the Buyer, in respect and in consideration of each Vested Company
Stock Option and Vested Company SAR so cancelled, on the first Business Day
following the Effective Time, an amount (net of applicable taxes) equal to
the product of (i) the excess, if any, of (A) the Per Share Amount _over_ (B)
the exercise price per share of the Company Common Stock subject to such
Vested Company Stock Option or Vested Company SAR, _multiplied_ by (ii) the
total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to or underlying such
Vested Company Stock Option or Vested Company SAR, without any interest
thereon (the "Vested Option and SAR Consideration"). The Vested Option and
SAR Consideration shall be  



 

7  delivered to the recipient thereof on the first Business Day following the
Effective Time through (x) the Companys payroll system or (y) if such
recipient is not employed by the Company on such date, by check or wire
transmittal, as elected by the recipient. In the event that the per share
exercise price of any Vested Company Stock Option or Vested Company SAR is
equal to or greater than the Per Share Amount, such Vested Company Stock
Option or Vested Company SAR shall be cancelled without consideration therefor
and shall have no further force or effect.

(c) At the Effective Time, each then outstanding Company Stock Option and
Company SAR that is not vested by its terms at the Effective Time
(including any such outstanding unvested Company Stock Option that is
exercisable prior to vesting pursuant to the terms of an option award which
permits such early exercise subject to a related right of repurchase at cost
for termination prior to vesting ("Early Exercise Repurchase Rights"), if any
such Company Stock Option exists at the Effective Time) (individually an
"Unvested Company Stock Option" or "Unvested Company SAR," as applicable,
and collectively the "Unvested Company Stock Options" and "Unvested Company
SARs," as applicable), regardless of the respective exercise price thereof,
will be converted by the Buyer as set forth herein. Each Unvested Company
Stock Option and Unvested Company SAR so converted by Buyer under this
Agreement will continue to have the same terms and conditions set forth in the
applicable Unvested Company Stock Option or Unvested Company SAR (including
any applicable award agreement or other document evidencing such security,
but other than any repurchase rights that are not Early Exercise Repurchase
Rights) immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that (i) each such
Unvested Company Stock Option or Unvested Company SAR will be converted into
a stock option that will become exercisable in accordance with its terms for
that number of whole shares of Buyer Common Stock equal to the product of (A)
the number of shares of Company Common Stock underlying such Unvested Company
Stock Option or Unvested Company SAR immediately prior to the Effective Time
_multiplied_ by (B) the Exchange Ratio (as defined below), rounded down to the
nearest whole number of shares of Buyer Common Stock, and (ii) the per share
exercise price for the shares of Buyer Common Stock underlying such assumed or
converted Unvested Company Stock Option or Unvested Company SAR will be equal
to the quotient determined by dividing the exercise price per share of
Company Common Stock underlying such Unvested Company Stock Option or Unvested
Company SAR immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Exchange Ratio,
rounded up to the nearest whole cent. Each converted Unvested Company Stock
Option and Unvested Company SAR shall be subject to the same vesting schedule
following the Effective Time as to which it was subject prior to the Effective
Time. For the purposes of this Agreement, the term "Exchange Ratio" shall be
equal to the quotient of (1) the Per Share Amount _divided by_ (2) the volume
weighted average of the daily closing prices of Buyer Common Stock over the
ten (10) trading days ending on the Business Day prior to the Effective Time.
The Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted to reflect appropriately the effect of
any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend
or distribution of securities convertible into Buyer Common Stock or Company
Common Stock), reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification or other
like change with respect to Buyer Common Stock or Company Common Stock
occurring during the ten (10) trading days with respect to Buyer Common Stock
ending on the Business Day prior to the Effective Time.



 

8 (d) The Buyer agrees to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission as
soon as reasonably practicable (but in any event within 15 days) after the
Effective Time a registration statement on Form S-8 (or a post-effective
amendment to a registration statement on Form S-8 or other appropriate form)
for the shares of Buyer Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the options to
purchase Buyer Common Stock issued pursuant to this Section 2.3 and shall use
its reasonable best efforts to cause such registration statement to become
effective as soon thereafter as practicable and to maintain such registration
statement in effect until the exercise or expiration of the options to
purchase Buyer Common Stock issued pursuant to this Section 2.3. The Buyer
further agrees (i) to reserve out of its reserved but unissued shares of
Buyer Common Stock a sufficient number of shares of Buyer Common Stock to
provide for the issuance of Buyer Common Stock upon exercise of the options to
purchase Buyer Common Stock issued pursuant to this Section 2.3 and (ii)
to cause, at or prior to the Effective Time, all shares of Buyer Common Stock
issuable upon the exercise of such options to purchase Buyer Common Stock to
be approved for listing on The Nasdaq Global Market.

(e) As soon as reasonably practicable (but no later than 30 days) following
the execution of this Agreement, the Company shall mail to each person who
is a holder of a Company Stock Option or Company SAR a letter describing the
treatment of such security pursuant to this Section 2.3 and, with respect to
Vested Company Stock Options and Vested Company SARs, describing the payment
for, and providing instructions for use in obtaining payment for, such
cancelled security. In addition, as soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, the Buyer shall issue to each person who holds an assumed or
converted Unvested Company Stock Option or Unvested Company SAR a document
evidencing the foregoing assumption and conversion of such security by the
Buyer, which document shall set forth the resulting exercise price and
underlying number of shares of Buyer Common Stock. 

(f) Except as specifically set forth in this Section 2.3, any equity
securities of any class of the Company, and any securities exchangeable into
or exercisable for such equity securities (including options, warrants, calls,
rights, commitments or Contracts obligating the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to issue, exchange, transfer, deliver or sell, or cause to be
issued, exchanged, transferred, delivered or sold, additional shares of
capital stock or other equity interests of the Company) and any security or
rights convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for any such shares or
other equity interests, if any, shall be canceled and extinguished at the
Effective Time. Subject to the review and approval of the Buyer, which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, the Company shall take all
actions necessary to effect the provisions set forth in this Section 2.3(g),
including without limitation any necessary amendments to any Contracts or
other instruments and the delivery of all required notice, as applicable.

2.4. _Dissenting Shares_.

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
shares of Company Common Stock held by a holder who is entitled to demand and
has made a demand for appraisal of such shares of Company Common Stock in
accordance with the DGCL and has not voted in favor of the adoption of the
Merger Agreement (any such shares being referred to as "Dissenting Shares"
until such time as such holder fails to perfect or otherwise  



 

9  loses such holders appraisal rights under the DGCL with respect to such
shares) shall not be converted into or represent the right to receive
the applicable portion of the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section
2.1, but shall be entitled only to such rights as are granted by the DGCL to a
holder of Dissenting Shares.

(b) If any Dissenting Shares shall lose their status as such (through failure
to perfect or otherwise), then, as of the later of the Effective Time or the
date of loss of such status, such shares shall automatically be converted into
and shall represent only the right to receive the applicable portion of the
Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 2.1, without interest thereon,
upon surrender of the Certificates representing such shares.

(c) The Company shall give the Buyer: (i) prompt notice of any written
demand for appraisal received by the Company prior to the Effective Time
pursuant to the DGCL, any withdrawal of any such demand and any other demand,
notice or instrument delivered to the Company prior to the Effective Time
pursuant to the DGCL that relate to such demand; and (ii) the opportunity to
participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any
such demand, notice or instrument. The Company shall not make any payment or
settlement offer prior to the Effective Time with respect to any such demand,
notice or instrument unless the Buyer shall have given its written consent to
such payment or settlement offer.

other equity securities or interests of each Subsidiary of the Company are
duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid, nonassessable and free of

of the Company (the "Subsidiary Charter Documents"), and each such instrument
is in full force and effect, and no other organizational documents are
applicable to or binding upon such Subsidiaries. None of the Subsidiaries is
in violation in any material respect of any of the provisions of its
Subsidiary Charter Documents.

(d) The Company does not control, directly or indirectly, or have any direct
or indirect equity participation or similar interest in any corporation,
partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, trust or other business

accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") consistently applied throughout the

unpaid Taxes of the Company and its Subsidiaries for Tax periods through the
date of the Company Balance Sheet do not exceed the accruals and reserves for
Taxes set forth on the Company Balance Sheet exclusive of any accruals and
reserves for "deferred taxes" or similar items that reflect timing

Revenue Service (the "IRS") or are closed by the applicable statute of
limitations for all taxable years through the taxable year specified

to make any adjustments for any taxable period, or portion thereof, ending
after the Closing Date pursuant to Section 481(a) of the Code or any similar
provision of state, local or foreign law by reason of a change in accounting
method initiated by it or any other relevant party and neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries has any knowledge that the IRS has proposed any such
adjustment or change in accounting method, nor has any application pending
with any  



 

18  Governmental Entity requesting permission for any changes in accounting
methods that relate to the business or assets of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries.

(g) The Company will not be required to include any item of income in, or
exclude any item of deduction from, taxable income for any taxable period, or

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

6.1. _No Solicitation_.

(a) _No Solicitation or Negotiation_. During the Pre-Closing Period, neither

understanding or arrangement relating to any Acquisition Proposal (or resolve
or authorize or propose to agree to do any of the foregoing actions); or 

(iii) approve, recommend or take any position other than to recommend
rejection (including modifying any recommendation of rejection) of, any
Acquisition Proposal.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the
Company may, solely prior to the adoption of the Company Voting Proposal and
only if the Company has not breached in any material respect any provision of
this Agreement, to the extent necessary for the Company Board to comply with
its fiduciary obligations under applicable law, as determined in good faith
by the Company Board after consultation with outside counsel, in response to a
Superior Proposal received by the Company Board after the date of this
Agreement, withhold, withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to the Buyer the
recommendation of the Company Board that the stockholders of the Company vote
in favor of the Merger and the adoption of this Agreement.

(c) _Notices to the Buyer_. The Company shall as promptly as practicable (but
in any event within 24 hours) provide oral and written notice to the Buyer of
receipt by the Company of any Acquisition Proposal, the material terms and
conditions of any such Acquisition Proposal and the identity of the person
making any such Acquisition Proposal, and shall keep the Buyer reasonably
informed (in any event within 24 hours) of any material modifications or
material developments with respect to such Acquisition Proposal, including
without limitation, either copies of all written Acquisition Proposals,
including draft agreements or term sheets, or summaries of the material terms
thereof. The Company agrees that it and its Subsidiaries will not enter into
a confidentiality agreement with any person subsequent to the date of this
Agreement in connection with any potential Acquisition Proposal.

(d) _Cessation of Ongoing Discussions_. The Company shall, and shall direct
its Representatives to, cease immediately all discussions and negotiations
that commenced prior to the date of this Agreement regarding any proposal that
constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition
Proposal and shall request that all confidential information previously
furnished to any such third parties be promptly returned or destroyed.

(e) _Definitions_. For purposes of this Agreement:

(i) "Acquisition Proposal" means (A) any proposal or offer (1) relating to a
merger, reorganization, consolidation, dissolution, sale of substantial  



 

37  assets, tender offer, exchange offer, recapitalization, liquidation,
dissolution, joint venture, share exchange or other business combination
involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (2) for the issuance by the
Company of 10% or more of its equity securities (excluding Company Options
granted to or exercised by employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries in
compliance with Section 5.1 hereof) or (3) to acquire in any manner, directly
or indirectly, 10% or more of the capital stock or assets of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries (on a consolidated basis), in each case other than the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (B) any written inquiry with
respect to, any oral inquiry to which the Company or its representatives have
responded with respect to, or any other oral inquiry that might reasonably be
expected to lead to, any proposal or offer described in the foregoing clause
(A), or (C) any request for nonpublic information in connection with any
proposal, offer or inquiry described in the foregoing clauses (A) or (B), as
applicable.

(ii) "Superior Proposal" means any unsolicited, bona fide written proposal
made by a third party to acquire, directly or indirectly, 100% of the equity
securities or all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, pursuant
to a tender or exchange offer, a merger, a consolidation or a sale of its
assets, which the Company Board determines in its good faith judgment to be
(A) on terms more favorable to the holders of Company Common Stock from a
financial point of view than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(after consultation with its financial advisor), taking into account all
the terms and conditions of such proposal and this Agreement (including any
alteration to the terms of this Agreement agreed to in writing by Buyer), (B)
reasonably capable of being completed on the terms proposed, taking into
account all financial, regulatory, legal and other aspects of such proposal,
and (C) to the extent the Company Board determines in good faith that
financing is material to such proposal, accompanied by one or more financing
commitment letters or without a financing condition.

6.2. _Access to Information_. During the Pre-Closing Period, subject to
applicable law (including Antitrust Laws) and confidentiality restrictions
contained in any Contract, the Company shall (and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to) afford to the Buyers Representatives reasonable access, upon
reasonable notice, during normal business hours and in a manner that does not
unreasonably disrupt or interfere with the Companys or its Subsidiaries
business operations, to all of its properties, books, contracts, commitments,
personnel and records as the Buyer shall reasonably request, and, during such
period, the Company shall (and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to)
furnish promptly to the Buyer all information in the Companys possession
concerning its business, finances, operations, properties, assets
and personnel as the Buyer may reasonably request; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that in the case that such actions are prohibited by applicable law (including
Antitrust Laws), the Buyer and the Company each agree to use commercially
reasonable efforts to establish a process that, through use of steps such as
targeted redactions, provision of information to counsel to review and
summarize for Buyer or use of a "clean room" environment for analysis and
review of information by joint integration teams in coordination with counsel
and the Company, will provide the Buyer with timely access to the fullest
extent possible to the substance of the information described in this Section
6.2 in a manner that allows the Company to comply with applicable law. The
Buyer will  



 

38  hold, and instruct all of its Representatives to hold, any such information
in confidence in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement.

6.3. _Company Stockholder Approval_.

(a) Immediately following the execution of this Agreement, the Company shall
deliver to the Buyer a true, correct and complete copy of the Stockholder
Written Consent, evidencing the adoption and approval by stockholders of the
Company constituting the Requisite Company Stockholder Vote of the Merger,
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (and, as such,
constituting adoption of the Company Voting Proposal).

(b) To the extent required by the DGCL, the Company shall promptly deliver to
any stockholder of the Company who has not approved this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby a notice of the approval of the Merger
and adoption of this Agreement by written consent of the stockholders of the
Company pursuant to the applicable provisions of the DGCL, which notice shall
constitute the notice to the Companys stockholders required by applicable
law that appraisal rights may be available to the Companys stockholders in
accordance with the DGCL.

(c) As soon as practicable following the execution of this Agreement but in
any case prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall (i) use its
commercially reasonable efforts to secure from each person who has a right to
any payments and/or benefits as a result of or in connection with the
transactions contemplated herein that would be deemed to constitute "parachute
payments" (within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code and the regulations
promulgated thereunder) a waiver of such persons rights to some or all of
such payments and/or benefits (the "Waived 280G Benefits") applicable to such
person so that all remaining payments and/or benefits applicable to such
person shall not be deemed to be "parachute payments" that would not be
deductible under Section 280G of the Code and (ii) submit to the stockholders
of the Company for approval by such number of such stockholders as is
required by the terms of Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code any (A) such Waived
280G Benefits and (B) other potential payments and/or benefits that would be
deemed to constitute "parachute payments" under Section 280G of the Code and
that do not constitute a binding obligation of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries as of the date hereof (the "New Benefits"). Prior to seeking such
stockholder approval, the Company shall provide drafts of such stockholder
approval materials to the Buyer and shall provide the Buyer with a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on such materials. Prior to the Effective
Time, the Company shall deliver to the Buyer evidence that a vote of the
Companys stockholders was solicited in accordance with the foregoing
provisions of this Section 6.3(c) and that either (1) the requisite number of
stockholder votes was obtained with respect to the Waived 280G Benefits and
New Benefits that were subject to such vote (the "280G Approval") or (2) that
the 280G Approval was not obtained, and, as a consequence, the Waived 280G
Benefits and the New Benefits subject to such vote shall not be made or
provided.

6.4. _Legal Requirements; Actions_.

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the parties
hereto will, as promptly as reasonably practicable, and in any event
within twenty (20) days of  



 

39  the date hereof, make all necessary filings and notifications and other
submissions and applications with respect to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby under the HSR Act and any foreign Antitrust
Law set forth on Section 7.1 of the Company Disclosure Schedule and any
additional Foreign Antitrust Approvals which the Buyer and the Company agree
upon in accordance with Section 7.1. The parties shall also consult and
cooperate with one another, and consider in good faith the views of one
another, in connection with, and provide to the other parties in advance, any
analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions
and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any party hereto in
connection with proceedings under or relating to any such Antitrust Law.
Without limiting the foregoing, the parties hereto agree to (A) give each
other reasonable advance notice of all meetings with any Governmental Entity

participate in each of such meetings, (C) to the extent practicable,

communications with any Governmental Entity relating to any Antitrust Laws,
(D) if any Governmental Entity initiates a substantive oral communication
regarding any Antitrust Law, promptly notify the other party of the substance
of such communication, (E) provide each other with a reasonable advance
opportunity to review and comment upon all written communications (including
any analyses, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and
proposals) with a Governmental Entity regarding any Antitrust Laws and (F)
provide each other with copies of all written communications to or from any
Governmental Entity relating to any Antitrust Laws. Any such disclosures or
provision of copies by one party to the other may be made on an outside
counsel basis if appropriate. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, the Buyer agrees (and the Company agrees except with respect to
clause (ii) of this sentence), and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries, to
take any and all actions necessary to obtain any consents, clearances or
approvals required under or in connection with the HSR Act, the Sherman Act,
as amended, the Clayton Act, as amended, the Federal Trade Commission Act, as
amended, and any other federal, state or foreign law, regulation or decree
designed to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions for the purpose or effect
of monopolization or restraint of trade (collectively "Antitrust Laws"), and
to enable all waiting periods under any Antitrust Law to expire, and to avoid
or eliminate each and every impediment under any Antitrust Law asserted by any
Governmental Entity, in each case, to cause the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby to occur prior to the Outside Date, including
but not limited to (i) promptly complying with or modifying any requests for
additional information (including any second request) by any Governmental
Entity, (ii) if necessary to obtain clearance by any Governmental Entity
before the Outside Date, offering, negotiating, committing to and effecting,
by consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise, the sale,
divestiture, license or other disposition of any and all of the capital
stock, assets, rights, products or businesses of the Buyer and its
Subsidiaries and the Company and its Subsidiaries and any other restrictions
on the activities of the Buyer and its Subsidiaries and the Company and its
Subsidiaries and (iii) contesting, defending and appealing any threatened or
pending preliminary or permanent injunction or other order, decree or ruling
or statute, rule, regulation or executive order that would adversely affect
the ability of any party hereto to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby and taking any and all other actions to prevent the entry, enactment or
promulgation thereof.

(b) Subject to the terms hereof, and except with regard to the Antitrust Laws
which shall be governed by Section 6.4(a), the Company, the Buyer and the
Transitory Subsidiary shall, and the Company shall cause its Subsidiaries to,
each use their reasonable best efforts to:



 

40 (i) take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do, or cause to be done, and
to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things
necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective the
transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as reasonably practicable;

(ii) obtain from any Governmental Entity or any other third party any
consents, licenses, permits, waivers, approvals, authorizations, or orders
and send any notices, in each case, which are required to be obtained, made or
sent by the Company or the Buyer or any of their Subsidiaries in connection
with the authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ that in
connection therewith none of the Company or its Subsidiaries will be required
to (nor, without the prior written consent of the Buyer, will) make or agree
to make any payment or accept any material conditions or obligations,
including amendments to existing conditions and obligations;

(iii) as promptly as practicable, make all necessary filings and
notifications, and thereafter make any other required submissions and
applications with respect to this Agreement and the Merger required under any
applicable statute, law, rule or regulation; and 

(iv) execute or deliver any additional instruments necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated by, and to fully carry out the purposes of, this
Agreement.

The Company and the Buyer shall cooperate with each other in connection with
the making of all such filings, submissions, applications and requests. The
Company and the Buyer shall each use their reasonable best efforts to furnish
to each other (on an outside counsel basis if appropriate) all information
required for any filing, submission, application or request to be made
pursuant to the rules and regulations of any applicable statute, law, rule or
regulation in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
For the avoidance of doubt, the Buyer and the Company agree that
nothing contained in this Section 6.4(b) shall modify, limit or otherwise
affect their respective rights and responsibilities under Section 6.4(a).

6.5. _Public Disclosure_. Except as required by applicable law (or with
respect to the Buyer, by the rules of The NASDAQ Global Market), neither party
hereto nor their stockholders shall (nor will they permit any of their
respective Representatives to), directly or indirectly, issue any statement or
communication to any third party (other than their agents that are bound by
confidentiality restrictions) regarding the subject matter of this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby, without the consent of the other
parties, and in all events the parties will cooperate in good faith and
consult with each other before issuing any such statement or communication.

6.6. _Director and Officer Indemnification_.



 

41 (a) From the Effective Time through the sixth anniversary of the Closing Date,
each of Buyer and the Surviving Corporation shall, jointly and severally,
indemnify and hold harmless each person who is now, or has been at any time
prior to the date hereof, or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a
director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the "Director
and Officer Indemnified Parties") against all claims, losses, liabilities,
damages, judgments, fines and reasonable fees, costs and expenses, including
attorneys fees and disbursements (collectively, "Costs"), incurred in
connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining
to the fact that the Director and Officer Indemnified Party is or was an
officer or director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any act or
omission in connection therewith, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or
after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted under the DGCL for
officers and directors of Delaware corporations. Each Director and Officer
Indemnified Party will be entitled, subject to applicable law, to advancement
of expenses incurred in the defense of any such claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation from each of the Buyer and the Surviving
Corporation within ten (10) Business Days of receipt by the Buyer or the
Surviving Corporation from the Director and Officer Indemnified Party of a
request therefor;  _provided_ that any person to whom expenses are advanced,
if requested by the Buyer or the Surviving Corporation, must provide an
undertaking, to the extent then required by the DGCL, to repay such advances
if it is ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to
indemnification.

(b) The certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation
shall contain, and Buyer shall cause the certificate of incorporation and
bylaws of the Surviving Corporation to so contain, provisions no less
favorable with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and
exculpation of present and former directors and officers of the Company and
its Subsidiaries than are presently set forth in the Company Charter
Documents, which provisions shall not be amended, modified or repealed for a
period of six years time from the Effective Time in a manner that would
adversely affect the rights thereunder of individuals who, at or prior to the
Effective Time, were officers or directors of the Company.

(c) The Surviving Corporation shall maintain, and the Buyer shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to maintain, at no expense to the beneficiaries, in
effect for six (6) years from the Effective Time an insurance "tail"
policy with respect to the directors, officers and fiduciaries liability
insurance with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time (including the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) in
an amount and scope at least as favorable as the coverage provided to the
Director and Officer Indemnified Parties under the insurance polices
applicable to them as of the date hereof.

(d) In the event that the Buyer or the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in each such case,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the
Buyer or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall succeed to the
obligations set forth in this Section 6.6.



 

42 (e) The provisions of this Section 6.6 are intended to be in addition to the
rights otherwise available to the Director and Officer Indemnified Parties by
law, charter, statute, bylaw or Contract and shall operate for the benefit of,
and shall be enforceable by, each of the Director and Officer Indemnified
Parties, their heirs and their Representatives. The Buyer shall pay all
expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees, that may be incurred by the
persons referred to in this Section 6.6 in connection with their enforcement
of their rights provided in this Section 6.6.

6.7. _Termination of 401(k) Plan_. Effective as of no later than the day
immediately preceding the Closing Date, each of the Company and any ERISA
Affiliate shall terminate any and all Company Employee Plans intended to
include a Code Section 401(k) arrangement (each, a "401(k) Plan") (unless the
Buyer provides written notice to the Company that such 401(k) plans shall not
be terminated). Unless Buyer provides such written notice to the Company, no
later than five Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall
provide the Buyer with evidence that such Company Employee Plan(s) have been
terminated (effective as of no later than the day immediately preceding the
Closing Date) pursuant to resolutions of the Board of Directors of the
Company, or such ERISA Affiliate, as the case may be. The Buyer shall, prior
to the Effective Time, amend its Code Section 401(k) plans (A) to permit the
rollover of accounts from such terminated 401(k) plan and (B) to allow for
immediate entry and participation by employees of the Company and
its Subsidiaries, each amendment to be effective as of the Effective Time.

6.8. _Notification of Certain Matters_. During the Pre-Closing Period, the
Buyer shall give prompt notice to the Company, and the Company shall give
prompt notice to the Buyer upon the Company having Knowledge (as such term is
used in the definition of "Knowledge of the Company" in Section 9.11), of (a)
the occurrence, or failure to occur, of any event, which occurrence or failure
to occur would cause any representation or warranty of such party contained in
this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate such that the condition to closing
in Sections 7.2(a) or 7.3(a), as applicable, would not be met at such time, in
each case at any time from and after the date of this Agreement until the
Effective Time or (b) any material failure of the Buyer and the Transitory
Subsidiary or the Company, as the case may be, or of any officer, director,
employee or agent thereof, to comply with any covenant or agreement to be
complied with by it under this Agreement (it being understood that this
Section 6.8 shall not limit either partys cure right under Sections 8.1(d)
or 8.1(e)). Notwithstanding the above, the delivery of any notice pursuant to
this Section will not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available
hereunder to the party receiving such notice or the conditions to such
partys obligation to consummate the Merger.

6.9. _New Employee Benefits_.

(a) For a period of at least twelve (12) months following the Effective Time,
the Buyer will provide, or will cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to provide, to those individuals who shall have been employees of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time
(the "Continuing Employees") with (i) base salary and cash bonus
opportunities no less favorable than, and (ii) employee benefits (excluding
equity awards) in the aggregate no less favorable than, those provided to such
Continuing Employees  



 

43  by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective
Time. Without limiting the foregoing, with respect to any Continuing
Employee whose employment terminates or is terminated during the twelve month
period following the Effective Time, the Buyer will provide, or will cause the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to provide, severance benefits on
terms no less favorable than those provided under the severance programs
listed on Section 3.15(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule. Nothing in the
foregoing shall be construed to be a guarantee of employment for any
Continuing Employee or to require the Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries
(including the Surviving Corporation) to continue the employment of any
particular Continuing Employee.

(b) The Buyer will, or will cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to, give each Continuing Employee full credit for prior service
with the Company or its Subsidiaries for purposes of (a) eligibility and
vesting under any Buyer Employee Plan and (b) determination of the level of
benefits under any Buyer Employee Plan, (including any policy relating to
severance or vacation) ( _provided_ that such credit does not result in
duplication of benefits). In addition, the Buyer will waive, or cause to be
waived, any limitations on benefits relating to pre-existing conditions under
any Buyer Employee Plan to the same extent such limitations were waived under
the corresponding Company Employee Plans for such Continuing Employees, and
the Buyer will recognize, or cause to be recognized, for purposes of annual
deductible and out-of-pocket limits under the Buyer Employee Plans, deductible
and out-of-pocket expenses paid by such Continuing Employees during the
plan year in which the Effective Time occurs. For purposes of this Agreement,
"Buyer Employee Plan" means, to the extent applicable, any "employee pension
benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA), any "employee welfare
benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA), and any other written or
oral plan, agreement or arrangement providing insurance coverage, severance
benefits, or vacation pay, which are or will be contributed to, sponsored by
or maintained by the Buyer, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective Subsidiaries or ERISA Affiliates.

(c) Nothing in this Section 6.9 is intended to confer upon any current or
former employee, director or consultant any rights or remedies under or by
reason of this Agreement.

6.10. _Resignations_. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain and deliver to the Buyer at the Closing evidence
reasonably satisfactory to the Buyer of the resignation, effective as of the
Effective Time, of all directors of the Company.

6.11.  _Expenses_. On the Closing Date, the Buyer shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to pay all unpaid Third Party Expenses such that there will be no
continuing liability or obligation of the Surviving Corporation with respect
thereto. 

6.12. _FIRPTA Compliance_. On the Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to
Buyer a properly executed statement in a form reasonably acceptable to Buyer
for purposes of satisfying Buyers obligations under Treasury Regulation
Section 1.1445-2(c)(3).

6.13. _Payments Spreadsheet_. The Company shall deliver to the Buyer at least
seven (7) Business Days prior to the Closing Date a spreadsheet (the "Payments
Spreadsheet")  



 

44  in a form reasonably acceptable to the Buyer, which Payments Spreadsheet
shall include: (i) a statement of the Per Share Amount and all
components thereof; (ii) with respect to each holder of Company Common Stock,
(A) such holders address and social security number (or tax identification
number, if applicable), (B) the number of shares of Company Common Stock held
by such holder, (C) the respective certificate number(s) representing such
holders shares and (D) the applicable portion of the Merger Consideration
payable to such holder; (iii) with respect to each holder of a Company Stock
Option or Company SAR, (A) such holders address and social security number
(or tax identification number, if applicable), (B) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock underlying each Company Stock Option or Company SAR held
by such holder, (C) the respective grant date(s) of such Company Stock
Options or Company SARs, (D) the respective exercise price(s) per share of
such Company Stock Options or Company SARs, (E) the Vested Option and SAR
Consideration, if any, payable to such holder and (F) if applicable, an
asterisk indicating any holders of Unvested Company Stock Options or Unvested
Company SARs that are to be converted into options to purchase Buyer Common
Stock pursuant to Section 2.3; (iv) any amounts which are required to be

9.2. _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto at any
time before or after approval of the matters presented in connection with the

Any party to this Agreement may give any notice or other communication
hereunder using any other means (including personal delivery or messenger
service), but no such notice or other communication shall be deemed to have
been duly given unless and until it actually is received by the party for whom
it is intended. Any party to this Agreement may change the address to which
notices and other communications hereunder are to be delivered by giving the
other parties to this Agreement notice in the manner herein set forth.

9.6. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the Company Disclosure
Schedules and Exhibits hereto and the documents and instruments referred to
herein that are to be delivered at the Closing) constitutes the entire
agreement among the parties to this Agreement and supersedes any prior
understandings, agreements or representations by or among the parties hereto,
or any of them, written or oral, with respect to the subject matter hereof; 
_provided_ that the Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in effect in
accordance with its terms.

9.7. _Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement is not intended, and shall
not be deemed, to (i) confer any rights or remedies upon any person other than
the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns, (ii)
create any agreement of employment with any person or (iii) otherwise create
any third-party beneficiary hereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that (A) Sections

and (B) the holders of Company Common Stock and Company Options and Company
SARs are intended to be third-party beneficiaries of Article I, the Final
Payment Obligations and any other provisions hereof incident to the
enforcement thereof and may enforce such provisions of this Agreement as if
they were direct parties hereto.

9.8. _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations under this Agreement may be assigned or delegated, in whole or in
part, by any of the parties hereto without the prior written consent of the
other parties, and any such assignment without such prior written consent
shall be null and void. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement
shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the
parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

9.9. _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid,
illegal or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not
affect the validity, legality or enforceability of the remaining terms and
provisions hereof or the validity, legality or enforceability of the offending
term or provision in any other situation or in any other  



 

51  jurisdiction. If the final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction
declares that any term or provision hereof is invalid, illegal or
unenforceable, then the parties hereto agree that the court making such
determination shall have the power to limit the term or provision, to delete
specific words or phrases or to replace any invalid, illegal or unenforceable
term or provision with a term or provision that is valid, legal and
enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid,
illegal or unenforceable term or provision, and this Agreement shall be
enforceable as so modified. In the event such court does not exercise the
power granted to it in the prior sentence, the parties hereto agree to replace
such invalid, illegal or unenforceable term or provision with a valid, legal
and enforceable term or provision that will achieve, to the extent possible,
the economic, business and other purposes of such invalid, illegal or
unenforceable term.

9.10. _Counterparts and Signature_. This Agreement may be executed in two or
more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but all of which
together shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become
effective when counterparts have been signed by each of the parties hereto
and delivered to the other parties, it being understood that all parties need
not sign the same counterpart. This Agreement may be executed and delivered by
facsimile transmission.

9.11. _Interpretation_. When reference is made in this Agreement to an Article
or a Section, such reference shall be to an Article or Section of this
Agreement, unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents, table of defined
terms and headings contained in this Agreement are for convenience of
reference only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation
of this Agreement. The language used in this Agreement shall be deemed to be
the language chosen by the parties hereto to express their mutual intent, and
no rule of strict construction shall be applied against any party. Whenever
the context may require, any pronouns used in this Agreement shall include
the corresponding masculine, feminine or neuter forms, and the singular form
of nouns and pronouns shall include the plural, and vice versa. Any reference
to any federal, state, local or foreign statute or law shall be deemed also
to refer to all rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, unless the
context requires otherwise. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or
"including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed
by the words "without limitation." No summary of this Agreement prepared by
any party shall affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. For
the purposes of this Agreement, "Knowledge of the Company" means the actual
knowledge of those persons listed on Section 9.11 of the Company Disclosure
Schedule.

9.12. _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the internal laws of the State of Delaware without giving
effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the
State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application
of laws of any jurisdictions other than those of the State of Delaware.

9.13. _Remedies; Specific Performance_. Except as otherwise provided herein,
any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed
cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by
law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy
will not preclude the exercise of any other  



 

52  remedy. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the
event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed
in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is
accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement, this being in addition to any
other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.

9.14. _Submission to Jurisdiction_. Each of the parties to this Agreement (a)
consents to submit itself to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the
Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware in any action or proceeding arising
out of or relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, (b) agrees that all claims in respect of such action or
proceeding may be heard and determined in only in such courts, (c) agrees that
it shall not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion
or other request for leave from any such court, and (d) agrees not to bring
any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any
of the transaction contemplated by this Agreement in any other court. Each of
the parties hereto waives any defense of inconvenient forum to the maintenance
of any action or proceeding so brought and waives any bond, surety or other
security that might be required of any other party with respect thereto. Any
party hereto may make service on another party by sending or delivering a copy
of the process to the party to be served at the address and in the manner
provided for the giving of notices in Section 9.5. Nothing in this Section
9.14, however, shall affect the right of any party to serve legal process in
any other manner permitted by law.

9.15.  _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE BUYER, THE TRANSITORY SUBSIDIARY
AND THE COMPANY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY

OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THE ACTIONS OF THE BUYER, THE TRANSITORY SUBSIDIARY OR
THE COMPANY IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT OF
THIS AGREEMENT.
