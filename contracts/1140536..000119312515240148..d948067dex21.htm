as otherwise provided in Section&nbsp;3 of this Article XIII, the Corporation shall be required to indemnify a person in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person only if the commencement of such proceeding (or part

payment of expenses incurred by a director or officer in advance of the final disposition of the proceeding shall be made only upon receipt of an undertaking by the director or officer to repay all amounts advanced if it should be ultimately
determined that the director or officer is not entitled to be indemnified under this Article XIII or otherwise. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">SECTION 3. <U>Claims</U>.

suit to recover the unpaid amount of such claim. If successful in whole or in part, the claimant shall be entitled to be paid the expense of prosecuting such claim to the fullest extent permitted by law. In any such action the Corporation shall have
the burden of proving that the claimant was not entitled to the requested indemnification or payment of expenses under applicable law. </P>
