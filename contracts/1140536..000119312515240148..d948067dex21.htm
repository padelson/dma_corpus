iii AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 

This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (hereinafter referred to as this "
_Agreement_ "), dated June 29, 2015, is by and among Willis Group Holdings
plc, an Irish public limited company (" _Parent_ "), Citadel Merger Sub, Inc.,
a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_

such terms in _Section 9.5_ or as otherwise defined elsewhere in this
Agreement unless the context clearly provides otherwise. Parent, Merger Sub
and the Company are each sometimes referred to herein as a " _Party_ " and
collectively as the " _Parties_ ".

 

RECITALS

WHEREAS, the Parties wish to effect a business combination through the merger
of Merger Sub with and into the Company, with the Company being the surviving
corporation (the " _Merger_ ");

 

WHEREAS, the Company has required, as a condition to its willingness to enter
into this Agreement, that certain shareholders of Parent simultaneously
herewith enter into a Voting Agreement, dated as of the date hereof (the "
_Voting Agreement_ "), pursuant to which, among other things, such
shareholders agree to support the Transactions, including the Merger, on
the terms and subject to the conditions provided for in the Voting Agreement;

WHEREAS, in connection with the Merger, each outstanding share of Class A
common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the " _Company Common
Stock_ " or " _Company Shares_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be cancelled and each holder of Company Common Stock
shall have the right to receive the Merger Consideration upon the terms and
conditions set forth in this Agreement and in accordance with the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ ") (other than (i)
Company Shares to be cancelled in accordance with _Section 2.1(b)_ and (ii)
any Dissenting Shares);

 

WHEREAS, the Company intends to declare and pay the Pre-Merger Special
Dividend (as defined below) two (2) business days immediately prior to the
Closing Date, payable to holders of record of Company Common Stock as of the
close of business two (2) business days immediately prior to the Closing Date;

 

WHEREAS, the board of directors of the Company (the " _Company Board of
Directors_ ") has determined that this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Merger, the Restructuring Transactions and
the declaration and payment of the Pre-Merger Special Dividend (the "
_Transactions_ ") are advisable and fair to, and in the best interests
of, the Company and its stockholders;

WHEREAS, the Company Board of Directors has unanimously adopted resolutions
approving the Merger, the execution of this Agreement and the consummation of
the Transactions and declaring advisable and recommending that the Companys
stockholders approve and adopt this Agreement (the " _Company Board
Recommendation_ ") pursuant to the DGCL;

WHEREAS, the board of directors of Parent (the " _Parent Board of Directors_
") has unanimously adopted resolutions approving the Merger, the execution of
this Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions and the Parent Board
of Directors has directed that the issuance of Parent Shares in connection
with the Merger, the Parent Name Change (as defined below) and, following the
Merger, a consolidation ( _i.e._ , a reverse stock split under Irish Law) of
the Parent Shares whereby every 2.6490 issued and unissued Parent Shares will
be consolidated into one (1) ordinary share, nominal value  $0.000115 per share (the " _Consolidation_ ") be submitted for consideration
at the Parent Special Meeting and has resolved to recommend that Parents
shareholders vote to approve such issuance, the Parent Name Change and
Consolidation (the " _Parent Board Recommendation_ ");

 

WHEREAS, the board of directors of Merger Sub has approved this Agreement and
determined that this Agreement and the Transactions, including the Merger,
are advisable and fair to, and in the best interests of, Merger Sub and its
sole shareholder;

WHEREAS, the Parties intend that the Merger will constitute a "qualified
stock purchase" of the Company within the meaning of Section 338(d)(3) of the
Code; and

 

WHEREAS, the Parties desire to make certain representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements in connection with the Merger and also prescribe
various conditions to the Merger.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements
contained in this Agreement and for other good and valuable consideration,
the receipt and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, the Parties agree
as follows:

 

ARTICLE I

THE MERGER 

Section 1.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the satisfaction or
waiver of the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with
the DGCL, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the
Company, whereupon the separate existence of Merger Sub will cease, with the
Company surviving the Merger and continuing under the name "Towers Watson and
Co." (the Company, as the surviving corporation in the Merger, sometimes being
referred to herein as the " _Surviving Corporation_ "), such that following
the Merger, the Surviving Corporation will, subject to the Restructuring
Transactions, be a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent. The Merger shall have
the effects provided in this Agreement and as specified in the DGCL.

 

Section 1.2 _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") will take
place at 10:00 a.m., Eastern Time, at the offices of Weil, Gotshal and Manges
LLP, New York, NY 10153, on the third (3rd) business day after the
satisfaction or waiver of the last of the conditions set forth in _Article
VII_ to be satisfied or waived (other than any such conditions that by their
nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or
waiver of such conditions at the Closing), unless another date or place is
agreed to in writing by the Company and Parent. The date on which the Closing
actually takes place is referred to as the " _Closing Date_ ".

Section 1.3 _Effective Time_. On the Closing Date, the Parties shall cause a
certificate of merger with respect to the Merger (the " _Certificate of
Merger_ ") to be duly executed and filed with the DSOS as provided under the
DGCL and make any other filings, recordings or publications required to be
made by the Company or Merger Sub under the DGCL in connection with the
Merger. The Merger shall become effective on the date and time of the filing
of the Certificate of Merger or, if agreed by Parent and the Company in
writing, such later time and date as specified in the Certificate of Merger
(the date and time the Merger becomes effective being the " _Effective Time_
").

 

Section 1.4 _Governing Documents_. At the Effective Time, the certificate of
incorporation and the bylaws of Merger Sub in the form attached hereto as
_Exhibit A_ shall be the articles of incorporation and bylaws, respectively,
of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as provided
therein or by applicable Law.

 



2 Section 1.5 _Officers and Directors of the Surviving Corporation_. From and
after the Effective Time, the persons listed on Section 1.5 of the Company
Disclosure Letter shall be the initial directors of the Surviving Corporation
(unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Company and Parent), and shall hold
office until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, or
their earlier death, incapacitation, retirement, resignation or removal. The
officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time, from and
after the Effective Time, shall be the initial officers of the Surviving
Corporation, and shall hold office until their respective successors are duly
elected and qualified, or their earlier death, incapacitation, retirement,
resignation or removal.

 

ARTICLE II

TREATMENT OF SECURITIES

Section 2.1 _Treatment of Capital Stock_.

 

(a) _Treatment of Company Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the Parties or holders of
any securities of the Company or of Merger Sub, subject to _Section 2.1(d)_
and any applicable withholding Tax, each share of Company Common Stock issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than (i)
Company Shares to be cancelled in accordance with _Section 2.1(b)_ and (ii)
any Dissenting Shares) shall be cancelled and in consideration of which each
holder of Company Common Stock shall have the right to receive 2.6490 (the "
_Exchange Ratio_ ") validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable Parent Shares
(the " _Merger Consideration_ "). For the avoidance of doubt, the Exchange
Ratio and the Merger Consideration do not take into account the effects of
the Consolidation. From and after the Effective Time, all such Company Shares
shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall
cease to exist, and each applicable holder of such Company Shares shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive
the Merger Consideration therefor upon the surrender of such Company Shares in
accordance with _Section 2.2_, including the right to receive, pursuant to 
_Section 2.5_, cash in lieu of fractional Parent Shares, if any, into which
such Company Shares have been converted pursuant to this _Section 2.1(a)_
(the " _Fractional Share Consideration_ "), together with the amounts, if
any, payable pursuant to _Section 2.2(f)_ and the Pre-Merger Special Dividend
(to the extent not previously paid).

 

(b) _Cancellation of Company Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, all Company
Shares owned by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub shall be cancelled and
shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange
therefor.

(c) _Treatment of Merger Sub Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, without
any further action on the part of the Parties or any of their respective
shareholders, all shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, in Merger
Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, and all
rights in respect thereof, shall be cancelled in exchange for the cancellation
of the shares of Merger Sub common stock and the funding of the aggregate
Merger Consideration by Parent, and the Surviving Corporation shall issue an
equivalent number of fully paid shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per
share, all of which shares shall be held by Parent, and which shall constitute
the only outstanding shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation
immediately following the Effective Time.

(d) _Adjustment to Merger Consideration_. The Exchange Ratio and the Merger
Consideration shall be adjusted appropriately to reflect the effect of any
stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including the Consolidation
and any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Company Common
Stock or Parent Shares, as applicable), reorganization, recapitalization,

 



3  reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other like change with
respect to the number of shares of Company Common Stock or Parent Shares
outstanding after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time.

Section 2.2 _Payment for Securities; Surrender of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Exchange Fund_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent or Merger Sub shall
designate a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act
as the exchange agent in connection with the Merger (the " _Exchange Agent_
"). The Exchange Agent shall also act as the agent for the Companys
stockholders for the purpose of receiving and holding their Certificates and
Book-Entry Shares and shall obtain no rights or interests in the shares
represented thereby. At or immediately after the Effective Time, Parent shall
deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent (i) evidence
of Parent Shares issuable pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_ in book-entry form
equal to the aggregate Merger Consideration (excluding any Fractional Share
Consideration), and (ii) cash in immediately available funds in an amount
sufficient to pay any dividends under _Section 2.2(f)_ (such evidence of
book-entry Parent Shares, together with any dividends or other distributions
with respect thereto, the " _Exchange Fund_ "), in each case, for the sole
benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock. In the event the
Exchange Fund shall be insufficient to pay the Fractional Share Consideration
and any dividends under _Section 2.2(f)_, Parent shall promptly deposit
additional funds with the Exchange Agent in an amount which is equal to the
deficiency in the amount required to make such payment. Parent shall cause the
Exchange Agent to make, and the Exchange Agent shall make, delivery of the
Merger Consideration, including payment of the Fractional Share
Consideration, and any amounts payable in respect of dividends or other
distributions on Parent Shares in accordance with _Section 2.2(f)_ out of the
Exchange Fund in accordance with this Agreement. The Exchange Fund shall not
be used for any purpose that is not expressly provided for in this Agreement.
The cash portion of the Exchange Fund shall be invested by the Exchange Agent
as reasonably directed by Parent; _provided, however_ , that any investment
of such cash shall in all events be limited to direct short-term obligations
of, or short-term obligations fully guaranteed as to principal and interest
by, the U.S. government, in commercial paper rated P-1 or A-1 or better by
Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation,
respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or
bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $10 billion
(based on the most recent financial statements of such bank that are then
publicly available), and that no such investment or loss thereon shall affect
the amounts payable to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares entitled
to receive such amounts pursuant to this  _Article II_. Any interest and
other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to the Surviving
Corporation on the earlier of (A) one (1) year after the Effective Time or (B)
the full payment of the Exchange Fund.

 

(b) _Procedures for Surrender_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, but in no event more than three (3) business days following
the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail (and make
available for collection by hand) to each holder of record of a certificate or
certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
outstanding Company Shares (the " _Certificates_ ") or non-certificated
Company Shares represented by book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") and whose
Company Shares were converted pursuant to  _Section 2.1_ into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration (i) a letter of transmittal, which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such
form as Parent and the Company agree prior to the Effective Time and (ii)
instructions for effecting the surrender of the Certificates (or affidavits
of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for payment of the
Merger Consideration into which such Company Shares have been converted
pursuant to _Section 2.1_, including any amount payable in respect
of Fractional Share Consideration in accordance with _Section 2.5_, and any
dividends or other distributions on Parent Shares in accordance with _Section
2.2(f)_. Upon surrender of a Certificate (or an 

 



4  affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Share for cancellation to
the Exchange Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by
Parent, together with such letter of transmittal duly completed and validly
executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents
as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor the Merger Consideration pursuant to the provisions of this _Article
II_, any Fractional Share Consideration that such holder has the right to
receive pursuant to the provisions of _Section 2.5_, and any amounts that
such holder has the right to receive in respect of dividends or other
distributions on Parent Shares in accordance with _Section 2.2(f)_ for each
Company Share formerly represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share,
to be mailed (or made available for collection by hand if so elected by the
surrendering holder) within three (3) business days following the Exchange
Agents receipt of such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or
Book-Entry Share, and the Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof)
or Book-Entry Share so surrendered shall be forthwith cancelled. The Exchange
Agent shall accept such Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof)
or Book-Entry Shares upon compliance with such reasonable terms and
conditions as the Exchange Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange
thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices. If payment of the Merger
Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name
the surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition precedent
of payment that (A) the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed
or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer and (B) the Person
requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other similar Taxes
required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person
other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or shall have
established to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Tax
either has been paid or is not required to be paid. Payment of the Merger
Consideration with respect to Book-Entry Shares shall only be made to the
Person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares are registered. Until surrendered
as contemplated by this _Section 2.2_, each Certificate and Book-Entry Share
shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the
right to receive the Merger Consideration as contemplated by this _Article
II_ , including any amount payable in respect of Fractional Share
Consideration in accordance with _Section 2.5_, and any dividends or other
distributions on Parent Shares in accordance with  _Section 2.2(f)_, without
interest thereon.

(c) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Company Shares_. At
the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed
and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of Company
Shares on the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the
holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Company
Shares except as otherwise provided for herein or by applicable Law. If, after
the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the
Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as
provided in this Agreement.

 

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund; No Liability_. At any time following twelve
(12) months after the Effective Time, Parent shall be entitled to require the
Exchange Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any interest received
with respect thereto) remaining in the Exchange Fund that have not been
disbursed, or for which disbursement is pending subject only to the
Exchange Agents routine administrative procedures, to holders of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, and thereafter such holders shall be
entitled to look only to Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat or
other similar Laws) as general creditors thereof with respect to the Merger
Consideration, including any amount payable in respect of Fractional Share
Consideration in accordance with _Section 2.5_, and any dividends or other
distributions on Parent Shares in accordance with  _Section 2.2(f)_, payable
upon due surrender of their Certificates or Book-Entry Shares and compliance
with the procedures in _Section 2.2(b)_, without any interest thereon.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Surviving Corporation, Parent or
the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any holder of a Certificate or Book-
Entry Share for any Merger Consideration or other amounts delivered to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat
or similar Law.

 



5 (e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent
shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the Merger
Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to _Section 2.1_ hereof,
including any amount payable in respect of Fractional Share Consideration in
accordance with _Section 2.5_, and any dividends or other distributions on
Parent Shares in accordance with  _Section 2.2(f)_.

(f) _Dividends or Distributions with Respect to Parent Shares_. No dividends
or other distributions with respect to Parent Shares with a record date after
the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
Certificate or Book-Entry Share with respect to the Parent Shares issuable
hereunder, and all such dividends and other distributions shall be paid by
Parent to the Exchange Agent and shall be included in the Exchange Fund, in
each case until the surrender of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share (or
affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) in accordance with this Agreement. Subject
to applicable Laws, following surrender of any such Certificate or Book-Entry
Share (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) there shall be paid to the holder
thereof, without interest, (i) the amount of dividends or other distributions
with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to
such Parent Shares to which such holder is entitled pursuant to this Agreement
and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or
other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to
such surrender and with a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable
with respect to such Parent Shares.

 

(g) _Effect of Consolidation_. If the Consolidation has occurred prior to the
time of delivery by the Exchange Agent of the Merger Consideration to any
holders of the Company Shares, the aggregate Merger Consideration to be
delivered by the Exchange Agent to each former holder of Company Common Stock
shall be adjusted appropriately to reflect the effect of the Consolidation. 

Section 2.3 _Treatment of Company Equity Awards_.

 

(a) _Company Stock Options_.

 

(i) As of immediately prior to the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of the holders thereof, each option to
purchase shares of Company Common Stock granted under any Company Equity Plan
(each, a " _Company Stock Option_ "), whether vested or unvested, that is
outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
assumed by Parent and shall be converted into an option (a " _Parent Share
Option_ ") to acquire (A) that number of whole Parent Shares (rounded down to
the nearest whole share) equal to the product obtained by multiplying (1) the
number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time by (2) the Exchange Ratio, (B) at an
exercise price per Parent Share (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal
to the quotient obtained by dividing (1) the exercise price per share of
Company Common Stock of such Company Stock Option by (2) the Exchange Ratio;
_provided, however_ , that each such Company Stock Option which is
an "incentive stock option" (as defined in Section 422 of the Code) shall be
adjusted in accordance with the foregoing in a manner consistent with the
requirements of Section 424 of the Code. The parties intend that the
adjustments in this _Section 2.3(a)(i)_ are in accordance with Treasury
Regulation Section 1.409A-1(B)(5)(v)(D) and will not subject any Company Stock
Option to Section 409A of the Code. Except as otherwise provided in this 
_Section 2.3(a)(i)_, each such Parent Share Option assumed and converted
pursuant to this _Section 2.3(a)(i)_ shall continue to have, and shall be
subject to, the same terms and conditions as applied to the corresponding
Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 



6 (b) _Company RSU Awards_. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of the holders thereof, each outstanding
award of restricted stock units that corresponds to a number of shares of
Company Common Stock (each, a " _Company RSU Award_ ") under any Company
Equity Plan (other than any Company PVRSU Award (as defined in _Section
2.3(c)_ below)) shall be assumed by Parent and shall be converted into a
restricted stock unit award corresponding to Parent Shares (each, a " _Parent
RSU Award_ ") with respect to a number of Parent Shares (rounded down to the
nearest whole share) equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the
applicable number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company
RSU Award immediately prior to the Effective Time by (ii) the Exchange Ratio.
Except as otherwise provided in this _Section 2.3(b)_, each Parent RSU Award
assumed and converted pursuant to this _Section 2.3(b)_ shall continue to
have, and shall be subject to, the same terms and conditions as applied to
the corresponding Company RSU Award immediately prior to the Effective Time.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the
holders thereof, each Company RSU Award granted under any Company Equity Plan
to a Company non-employee director (whether or not vested) shall be deemed to
have vested, the shares of Company Common Stock underlying such award shall
be deemed to have been issued and such award and such shares shall
immediately thereafter be cancelled and converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration in respect of each share of Company Common Stock
underlying such award, and (ii) restricted stock units under a Company RSU
Award that have vested as of the Closing Date but have not yet been settled as
of such date shall be deemed to have settled and shall have the right to
receive Parent Shares in the manner set forth in _Section 2.1_.

(c) _Company PVRSU Awards_. As of immediately prior to the Effective Time,
each Company RSU Award that is subject to performance-based vesting
conditions and is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, a
" _Company PVRSU Award_ ") shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of the holders thereof, be converted into a performance-
based vesting restricted stock unit award corresponding to Parent Shares (each
a " _Parent PVRSU Award_ ") with respect to a number of Parent Shares (rounded
down to the nearest whole share) equal to the product obtained by multiplying
(i) the applicable number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such
Company PVRSU Award immediately prior to the Effective Time by (ii) the
Exchange Ratio. In addition, at the time the Pre-Merger Special Dividend is
paid, each holder of a Company PVRSU Award shall be credited with a notional
dividend in an amount equal to the Pre-Merger Special Dividend for each share
of Company Common Stock corresponding to the Company PVRSU Award that is
converted pursuant to the immediately-preceding sentence, and such notional
dividend shall be paid out to the holder in cash at the time(s) the
corresponding Parent PVRSU Award vests. Except as otherwise provided in this 
_Section 2.3(c)_, each Parent PVRSU Award assumed and converted pursuant to
this _Section 2.3(c)_ shall continue to have, and shall be subject to, the
same terms and conditions as applied to the corresponding Company PVRSU
Award immediately prior to the Effective Time. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
restricted stock units under a Company PVRSU Award that have vested as of the
Closing Date but have not yet been settled as of such date shall be deemed to
have settled and shall have the right to receive Parent Shares in the manner
set forth in _Section 2.1_.

(d) _Company ESPP_. As soon as practicable following the date of this
Agreement, the Company shall take all actions with respect to the Company ESPP
that are necessary to provide that: (i) with respect to the offering period in
effect as of the date hereof (the " _Current Offering Period_ "), no
participant may increase the percentage amount of his or her payroll deduction
election from that in effect on the date hereof for such Current Offering
Period; (ii) subject to the consummation of the Merger, the Company ESPP
shall terminate, effective immediately prior to the Effective Time; (iii)
immediately prior to the Effective Time, cause the exercise of each
outstanding purchase right under the Company ESPP; (iv) following the
purchase of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Current Offering Period, the
Company ESPP shall be suspended and no new offering period shall be commenced
under the Company

 



7  ESPP prior to the Effective Time; and (v) make any pro rata adjustments that
may be necessary to reflect any shortened offering period, but otherwise treat
such shortened offering period as a fully effective and completed offering
period for all purposes under the Company ESPP.

(e) _Company Actions_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall pass
resolutions, provide any notices, obtain any consents, make any amendments to
the Company Equity Plans or Company Equity Awards, and take such other actions
as are necessary to provide for the treatment of the Company Stock Options,
Company RSU Awards and Company PVRSU Awards (collectively, the " _Company
Equity Awards_ ") as contemplated by this _Section 2.3_.

 

(f) _Plans and Awards Assumed by Parent_. At the Effective Time, (i) Parent
shall assume each outstanding Parent Share Option, Parent RSU Award and
Parent PVRSU Award, and (ii) if Parent determines that it desires to do so,
Parent may assume any or all of the Company Equity Plans or merge any such
Company Equity Plan into any equity incentive plan of Parent. If
Parent elects to so assume or merge any Company Equity Plan, then, under such
Company Equity Plan, Parent shall be entitled to grant stock awards, to the
extent permissible under applicable Law, using the share reserves of such
Company Equity Plan as of the Effective Time, except that: (A) stock covered
by such awards shall be Parent Shares; (B) all references in such Company
Equity Plan to a number of shares of Company Common Stock shall be deemed
amended to refer instead to a number of Parent Shares determined by
multiplying the number of referenced shares of Company Common Stock by the
Exchange Ratio, and rounding the resulting number down to the nearest whole
number of Parent Shares; and (C) the board of directors of Parent or a
committee thereof shall succeed to the authority and responsibility of the
board of directors of the Company or any committee thereof with respect to the
administration of such Company Equity Plan.

 

(g) _Parent Actions_. Parent shall take all corporate action necessary to
reserve for issuance a number of authorized but unissued Parent Shares for
delivery upon exercise or settlement of the Parent Share Options, Parent RSU
Awards and Parent PVRSU Awards in accordance with this _Section 2.3_. As soon
as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, if and to the
extent necessary to cause a sufficient number of shares of Parent Shares to
be registered and issuable under Parent Share Options, Parent RSU Awards and
Parent PVRSU Awards, Parent shall file promptly following the Effective Time
(and in no event later than fourteen (14) days after the Effective Time) a
registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor or other appropriate
form) with respect to the Parent Shares subject to such awards and shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such
registration statement or registration statements (and maintain the current
status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for so long as
such awards remain outstanding.

 

Section 2.4 _Withholding_. The Company, Parent, Merger Sub and the Surviving
Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause the Exchange
Agent to deduct and withhold, from the consideration otherwise payable to any
Person pursuant to this Agreement, any amounts that are required to be
withheld or deducted with respect to such consideration under the Code, or
any applicable provisions of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent
that amounts are so withheld and timely remitted to the appropriate
Governmental Entity, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made.

Section 2.5 _Fractional Shares_. No certificate or scrip representing
fractional Parent Shares shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, and such fractional share interests shall
not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a shareholder
of Parent. The Exchange Agent, acting as agent for the holders of shares of
Company Common Stock otherwise entitled to receive a fractional Parent Shares,
will aggregate all fractional Parent Shares that would 

 



8  otherwise have been required to be distributed and cause them to be sold in
the open market for the accounts of such holders. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, each holder of shares of Company Common Stock
converted pursuant to the Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to
receive a fraction of a Parent Share shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash,
without interest, in an amount equal to the proceeds from such sale by the
Exchange Agent, if any, less any brokerage commissions or other fees, from the
sale of such fractional Parent Shares in accordance with such holders
fractional interest in the aggregate number of Parent Shares sold.

 

Section 2.6 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, Company Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time that are held by any holder who has not voted in favor of the
Merger (or consented thereto in writing) and who is entitled to demand and has
properly exercised and perfected his or her demand for appraisal of such
Company Shares pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL (" _Dissenting Shares_ ")
shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, but
holders of such Dissenting Shares shall be entitled to receive
such consideration as shall be determined pursuant to Section 262 of the
DGCL; _provided_ , _however_ , that if any such holder fails to perfect or
withdraws or loses any such right to appraisal under the DGCL, each such
Company Share of such holder shall thereupon be as of the Effective Time
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance
with _Section 2.1_, without interest thereon, upon surrender of a Certificate
or Book-Entry Share in accordance with _Section 2.2_. The Company shall give
Parent (i) prompt notice of any (A) demands for appraisal of any Company
Shares, (B) attempted withdrawals of such demands or (C) other demand, notice
or any other instrument delivered to the Company relating to rights to
appraisal and (ii) the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to any such demand, notice or instrument. The Company
shall not make any payment or settlement offer prior to the Effective Time
with respect to any such demand, notice or instrument unless Parent shall have
given its prior written consent to such payment or settlement offer.

letter delivered by the Company to Parent immediately prior to the execution
of this Agreement (the " _Company Disclosure Letter_ ") (it being agreed that
disclosure of any item in any Section of the Company Disclosure Letter shall
be deemed disclosure with respect to any other Section of this Agreement to
which the relevance of such item is reasonably apparent), the Company
represents and warrants to Parent as set forth below. For purposes of this
_Article III_ , all representations and warranties with respect to any
Company Subsidiaries, which are not Significant Subsidiaries, shall be to the
Companys knowledge.

Section 3.1 _Qualification, Organization, Subsidiaries, etc._

(a) Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is a legal entity duly organized,

to do business and is in good standing as a foreign corporation or other
entity in each jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing or operation of its
assets or properties or conduct of its business requires such qualification,
except

 



9  where the failure to be so organized, validly existing, qualified or, where
relevant, in good standing, or to have such power or authority, would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect. The Company has filed with the SEC, prior to the date
of this Agreement, a complete and accurate copy of the Company Certificate and
the Company Bylaws as amended to the date hereof. The Company Certificate and
the Company Bylaws are in full force and effect and the Company is not in

Liens, other than Company Permitted Liens.

Shares are, and all Company Shares reserved for issuance as noted above shall
be, when issued in accordance with the respective terms thereof, duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable and free of pre-
emptive rights.

 

(b) All issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of, or other equity
interests in, each Significant Subsidiary of the Company are wholly-owned,
directly or indirectly, by the Company free and clear of all Liens, other than
Company Permitted Liens.

(c) Except as set forth in _Section 3.2(a)_ above and _Section 3.2(f)_
below, as of the date hereof: (i) the Company does not have any shares of
capital stock issued or outstanding other than the Company Shares that have
become outstanding after the Company Capitalization Date, but were reserved

Company Subsidiaries is a party obligating the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries to (A) issue, transfer or sell any shares in the capital or

call, exchangeable or convertible securities or other similar right, agreement
or commitment; (C) redeem or otherwise acquire any such shares in its capital
or other equity interests; or (D) provide a material amount of funds to, or
make any material investment (in the form of a loan, capital contribution or
otherwise) in, any Company Subsidiary that is not wholly-owned.

 

(d) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has outstanding bonds,
debentures, notes or other similar obligations, the holders of which have the
right to vote (or which are convertible into or exercisable for securities
having the right to vote) with the stockholders of the Company on any matter.

 



10 (e) There are no voting trusts or other agreements or understandings to which
the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party with respect to the voting
of the capital stock or other equity interest of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary.

 

(f) The Company has made available to Parent a true and complete list, as of
the Company Capitalization Date and on an aggregate basis, of (i) the number
of Company Shares underlying Company Equity Awards and (ii) the exercise
prices of Company Equity Awards, if applicable.

 

Section 3.3 _Corporate Authority Relative to this Agreement; No Violation_.

 

(a) The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority to enter into
this Agreement and, subject (in the case of the Merger) to receipt of the
Company Stockholder Approval, to perform its obligations hereunder and
consummate the Transactions, including the Merger. The execution, delivery and
performance by the Company of this Agreement and the consummation of
the Transactions have been duly and validly authorized by the Company Board
of Directors and (in the case of the Merger, except for (i) receipt of the
Company Stockholder Approval and (ii) the filing of the Certificate of Merger
with the DSOS) no other corporate proceedings on the part of the Company are
necessary to authorize the consummation of the Transactions. On or prior to
the date hereof, the Company Board of Directors has unanimously (x) resolved
that this Agreement and the Transactions, including the Merger and the Pre-
Merger Special Dividend, are fair to and in the best interests of the Company
and the stockholders of the Company, (y) approved and declared advisable this
Agreement and the Transactions, including the Merger and the Pre-Merger
Special Dividend, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein,
in accordance with the requirements of the DGCL, and (z) has adopted a
resolution to make, subject to _Section 5.3_, the Company Board
Recommendation. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and
delivered by the Company and, assuming this Agreement constitutes the valid
and binding agreement of Parent and Merger Sub, constitutes the valid and
binding agreement of the Company, enforceable against the Company in
accordance with its terms, except that (i) such enforcement may be subject to
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, examinership, fraudulent transfer,
reorganization, moratorium or other similar Laws, now or hereafter in effect,
affecting or relating to the enforcement of creditors rights generally and
(ii) equitable remedies of specific performance and injunctive and other forms
of equitable relief may be subject to equitable defenses and to the
discretion of the court before which any proceeding therefor may be brought.

(b) Other than in connection with or in compliance with (i) the provisions of
the DGCL, (ii) the Securities Act, (iii) the Exchange Act, (iv) the HSR Act,
(v) any applicable requirements of the NASDAQ and (vi) the matters set forth
in Section 3.3(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter, no authorization, consent
or approval of, or filing with, any Governmental Entity is necessary, under
applicable Law, for the consummation by the Company of the Transactions,
except for such authorizations, consents, approvals or filings that, if not
obtained or made, would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 

(c) The execution and delivery by the Company of this Agreement do not, and,
except as described in _Section 3.3(b)_, the consummation of the
Transactions and compliance with the provisions hereof will not (i) result in
any violation or breach of, or default or change of control (with or without
notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise to a right of, or
result in, termination, modification, cancellation or acceleration of any
material obligation or to the loss of a material benefit under any Contract,
loan, guarantee of Indebtedness or credit agreement, note, bond, mortgage,
indenture, lease, permit, concession, franchise or right binding upon the
Company or any of the Company

 



11  Subsidiaries or result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the
properties, rights or assets of the Company or any Company Subsidiaries, other
than Company Permitted Liens, (ii) conflict with or result in any violation
of any provision of the Company Governing Documents or any of the
organizational documents of any Company Subsidiary or (iii) conflict with or
violate any Laws applicable to the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries
or any of their respective properties or assets, other than in the case of
clauses (i), (ii) and (iii), any such violation, breach, conflict, default,
termination, modification, cancellation, acceleration, right, loss or Lien
that would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

Section 3.4  _Reports and Financial Statements_.

(a) From July 1, 2012 through the date of this Agreement, the Company has
filed or furnished all forms, documents and reports required to be filed or
furnished prior to the date hereof by it with the SEC (the " _Company SEC
Documents_ "). As of their respective dates, or, if amended, as of the date of
(and giving effect to) the last such amendment, the Company SEC Documents
complied in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act
and the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and the applicable rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder, and none of the Company SEC Documents
contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading.

(b) The consolidated financial statements (including all related notes and
schedules) of the Company included in the Company SEC Documents when filed
complied as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting
requirements and the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect
thereto in effect at the time of such filing and fairly present in
all material respects the consolidated financial position of the Company and
its consolidated Subsidiaries, as at the respective dates thereof, and their
consolidated statements of operations, consolidated statements of
comprehensive income and consolidated statements of cash flows for the
respective periods then ended (subject, in the case of the unaudited
statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments and to any other adjustments
described therein, including the notes thereto) in conformity with United
States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (" _GAAP_ ") (except, in the
case of the unaudited statements, to the extent permitted by the SEC) applied
on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be indicated
therein or in the notes thereto).

Section 3.5 _Internal Controls and Procedures_. The Company has established
and maintains disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over
financial reporting (as such terms are defined in paragraphs (e) and (f),
respectively, of Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act) as required by Rule
13a-15 under the Exchange Act. The Companys disclosure controls and
procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that all material information
required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or
furnishes under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC,
and that all such material information is accumulated and communicated to the
Companys management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure and to make the certifications required pursuant to
Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the " _Sarbanes-Oxley
Act_ "). The Companys internal controls over financial reporting provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of the Companys financial
reporting and the preparation of Company financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with GAAP. Since July 1, 2012, the Companys principal
executive officer and its principal financial officer have disclosed to the
Companys auditors and the audit committee of the Company Board of Directors
(i) all known significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the
design or operation of internal controls over financial reporting that are
reasonably likely to adversely affect in any material respect the Companys
ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information, and
(ii) any known fraud, whether

 



12  or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a
significant role in the Companys internal controls. The Company has made
available to Parent all such disclosures made by management to the Companys
auditors and audit committee from July 1, 2012 to the date hereof.

Section 3.6 _No Undisclosed Liabilities_. Except (a) as disclosed, reflected
or reserved against in the Companys consolidated balance sheet (or the notes
thereto) as of June 30, 2014 included in the Company SEC Documents filed or
furnished on or prior to the date hereof, (b) for liabilities incurred in the
ordinary course of business since June 30, 2014, (c) as expressly permitted or
contemplated by this Agreement and (d) for liabilities which have been
discharged or paid in full in the ordinary course of business, as of the date
hereof, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has any liabilities of
any nature, whether or not accrued, contingent or otherwise, other than those
which, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to
have a Company Material Adverse Effect. For purposes of this _Section 3.6_,
the term "liabilities" shall not include obligations of the Company or any
Company Subsidiaries to perform under or comply with any applicable Law,
action, judgment or Contract, but would include such liabilities and
obligations if there has been a default or failure to perform or comply by the
Company or any Company Subsidiaries with any such liability or obligation if
such default or failure would, with the giving of notice or passage of time or
both, reasonably be expected to result in a monetary obligation or the
imposition of injunctive or other equitable remedies.

 

Section 3.7 _Compliance with Laws; Permits_.

 

(a) The Company and each Company Subsidiary are in compliance with and are not
in default under or in violation of any Laws applicable to the Company, such
Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or assets, except where
such non-compliance, default or violation would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 

(b) The Company and the Company Subsidiaries are in possession of all
franchises, grants, authorizations, licenses, permits, easements, variances,
exceptions, consents, certificates, clearances, approvals, registrations and
orders of any Governmental Entity necessary for the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries to own, lease and operate their properties and assets or to carry
on their businesses as they are now being conducted (the " _Company Permits_
"), except where the failure to have any of the Company Permits would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect. All Company Permits are in full force and effect,
except where the failure to be in full force and effect would not reasonably
be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material
Adverse Effect.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything contained in this _Section 3.7_, no
representation or warranty shall be deemed to be made in this  _Section 3.7_
in respect of the matters referenced in _Section 3.4_, _Section 3.5_ or
_Section 3.13_, or in respect of environmental, Tax, employee benefits or
labor Law matters.

 

Section 3.8 _Environmental Laws and Regulations_. Except for such matters as
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect: (a) the Company and its Subsidiaries are now
and have been since July 1, 2012 in compliance with all, and have not violated
any, applicable Environmental Laws; (b) no property currently or formerly
owned, leased or operated by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (including
soils, groundwater, surface water, buildings or other structures), or any

available to Parent correct and complete copies of, in each case, to the
extent applicable, (i) all plan documents and material amendments thereto; and
(ii) the most recent annual report on Form 5500 and the most recent audited

(c) (i) Except as would not, individually, or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, each of the Company
Benefit Plans has been operated and administered in material compliance with
its terms and applicable Laws; (ii) each Company Benefit Plan intended to be
"qualified" within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code has received a
favorable determination or opinion letter as to its qualification, and to the
knowledge of the Company, there are no existing circumstances or any events
that have occurred that would reasonably be expected to adversely affect the

sponsors at least two of whom are not under common control, within the meaning
of Section 4063 of ERISA; (v) except as would not, individually or in the

Subsidiary.

 



14 (d) Except as set forth in Section 3.9(d) of the Company Disclosure Letter, in
the past six (6) years, neither the Company, any Company Subsidiary nor any
of their respective ERISA Affiliates has or has had an obligation to
contribute to a "defined benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(35) of ERISA (a
" _Company Single Employer Plan_ ") or any other pension plan subject to

not waived) has occurred with respect to any Company Single Employer Plan,
and there has been no determination that any Company Single Employer Plan is,

not limited to the imposition of any lien in favor of the Pension Benefit

full and no condition exists that is likely to cause the Company, any Company

of the Transactions (either alone or in conjunction with any other event)
will (i) result in any payment or benefit becoming due to any current or
former employee, director or consultant of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary under any Company Benefit Plan or otherwise, (ii) increase
any compensation or benefits otherwise payable or to be provided under any
Company Benefit Plan or (iii) result in any acceleration of the time of
payment, funding or vesting of any compensation or benefits, or (iv) result in
the payment of any amount that could, individually or in combination with any
other payment, constitute an "excess parachute payment," as defined in Section
280G(b)(1) of the Code.

 

(f) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, each Company Benefit Plan
has been maintained and operated in documentary and operational compliance
with Section 409A of the Code or an available exemption therefrom. The Company
is not a party to nor does it have any obligation under any Company
Benefit Plan to compensate any person for excise Taxes payable pursuant to
Section 4999 of the Code or for Taxes payable pursuant to Section 409A or 457A

administered in material compliance with its terms and applicable Laws, and if
intended to qualify for special tax treatment, meets all the requirements for
such treatment, (ii) all employer and employee contributions to each Company
Foreign Benefit Plan required by its terms or by applicable Law have been made
or, if applicable, accrued in accordance with generally accepted accounting
practices in the applicable jurisdiction applied to such matters, and (iii)
the fair market value of the assets of each funded Company Foreign Benefit
Plan, the liability of each insurer for any Company Foreign Benefit Plan
funded through insurance or the book reserve established for any Company
Foreign Benefit Plan, together with any accrued contributions, is sufficient
to procure or provide for the accrued benefit obligations, as of the date of
this Agreement, with respect to all current and former participants in such
plan according to the actuarial assumptions and valuations most recently used
to determine employer contributions to such Company Foreign Benefit Plan, and
no transaction contemplated by this Agreement shall cause such assets or
insurance obligations to be less than such benefit obligations.

Directors has taken all action necessary so that no "moratorium," "control
share acquisition," "business combination," "fair price" or other form of
anti-takeover Laws or regulations is applicable to the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Company does not have in
effect any "poison pill" or shareholder rights plan.

Except as disclosed in the Parent SEC Documents filed with the SEC since
January 1, 2013 (including exhibits and other information incorporated by
reference therein) and publicly available at least two calendar days prior to
the date hereof (but excluding any forward looking disclosures set forth in
any "risk factors" section, any disclosures in any "forward looking
statements" section and any other disclosures included therein to the extent
they are predictive or forward-looking in nature) or in the applicable Section
of the disclosure letter delivered by Parent to the Company immediately prior
to the execution of this Agreement (the " _Parent Disclosure Letter_ ") (it
being agreed that disclosure of any item in any Section of the Parent
Disclosure Letter shall be deemed disclosure with respect to any other Section
of this Agreement to which the relevance of such item is reasonably
apparent), Parent, and Merger Sub jointly and severally represent and warrant
to the Company as set forth below. For purposes of this _Article IV_ , all
representations and warranties with respect to any Parent Subsidiaries, which
are not Significant Subsidiaries, shall be to Parents knowledge.

Section 4.1  _Qualification, Organization, Subsidiaries, etc_.

(a) Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Parent Subsidiaries is a legal entity
duly organized, validly existing and, where relevant, in good standing under
the Laws of its respective jurisdiction of organization and has all requisite
corporate or similar power and authority to own, lease and operate its
properties and assets and to carry on its business as presently conducted and
is qualified to do business and is in good standing as a foreign corporation
or other entity in each jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing or operation
of its assets or properties or conduct of its business requires such
qualification, except where the failure to be so organized, validly existing,
qualified or, where relevant, in good standing, or to have such power or
authority, would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Parent has filed with
the SEC, prior to the date of this Agreement, complete and accurate copies of
the Constitution of Parent as amended to the date hereof (the "
_Parent Constitution_ "). The Parent Constitution is in full force and effect
and Parent is not in violation of the Parent Constitution.

 

(b) _Subsidiaries_. All the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of,
or other equity interests in, each Parent Subsidiary have been duly
authorized and validly issued and are fully paid and nonassessable and are
wholly-owned, directly or indirectly, by Parent free and clear of all Liens,
other than Parent Permitted Liens.

 

Section 4.2 _Share Capital_.

 

(a) The authorized share capital of Parent consists of 4,000,000,000 ordinary
shares, $0.000115 nominal value per share (the " _Parent Shares_ "), 40,000

Shares_ ") and 1,000,000,000 preferred shares, $0.000115 nominal

and outstanding. The per share exercise price of each share option under a
Parent Equity Award was not less than the fair market value of a Parent Share
on the applicable grant date. All the outstanding Parent Shares are, and all
Parent Shares reserved for issuance as noted above shall be, when issued in
accordance with the respective terms thereof, duly authorized, validly issued,
fully paid and non-assessable and free of pre-emptive rights. The Parent
Shares to be issued pursuant to the Merger will be duly authorized, validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable.

(b) All issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of, or other
equity interests in, each Significant Subsidiary of Parent are wholly-owned,

_Section 4.2(a)_ above, and (ii) there are no outstanding subscriptions,
options, warrants, puts, calls, exchangeable or convertible securities or

capital stock to which Parent or any of the Parent Subsidiaries is a party
obligating Parent or any of the Parent Subsidiaries to (A) issue, transfer or
sell any shares or other equity interests of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary
or securities convertible into or exchangeable for such shares or equity
interests (in each case other than to Parent or a wholly-owned Subsidiary of
Parent); (B) grant, extend or enter into any such subscription, option,
warrant, put, call, exchangeable or convertible securities or other similar
right, agreement or commitment; (C) redeem or otherwise acquire any such

to, or make any material investment (in the form of a loan, capital
contribution or otherwise) in, any Parent Subsidiary that is not wholly-
owned.

(d) Neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary has outstanding bonds,
debentures, notes or other similar obligations, the holders of which have the
right to vote (or which are convertible into or exercisable for securities
having the right to vote) with the shareholders of Parent on any matter.

 

(e) There are no voting trusts or other agreements or understandings to which
Parent or any Parent Subsidiary is a party with respect to the voting of the
shares or other equity interest of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary.

of the Parent Capitalization Date and on an aggregate basis, of (i) the number
of Parent Shares underlying Parent Equity Awards and (ii) the exercise prices
of Parent Equity Awards, if applicable.

 

Section 4.3 _Corporate Authority Relative to this Agreement; No Violation_.

 

(a) Parent and Merger Sub have all requisite corporate or similar power and
authority to enter into this Agreement and, subject (in the case of the
issuance of Parent Shares in connection with the Merger, the Parent Name
Change and the Consolidation) to receipt of the Parent Shareholder Approvals
and (in the case of the Merger Sub) to the adoption of this Agreement by
Merger Subs sole shareholder (which adoption shall occur immediately after
the execution and delivery of this

 



25  Agreement), to consummate the Transactions, including the Merger. The
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the
Transactions have been duly and validly authorized by the Parent Board of
Directors and (in the case of the issuance of Parent Shares in connection with
the Merger, the Parent Name Change and the Consolidation, except for (i)
receipt of the Parent Shareholder Approvals and the adoption of
this Agreement by Merger Subs sole shareholder and (ii) the filing of the
Certificate of Merger with the DSOS) no other corporate proceedings on the
part of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary are necessary to authorize the
consummation of the Transactions. On or prior to the date hereof, the Parent
Board of Directors has unanimously (x) resolved that this Agreement and the
Transactions, including the issuance of Parent Shares in connection with the
Merger, and the Consolidation are advisable and in the best interests of
Parent and the shareholders of Parent, (y) approved and declared advisable
this Agreement and the Transactions, including the Merger, the Parent Name
Change and the Consolidation on the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth herein, in accordance with the requirements of the Irish law, and (z)
resolved to recommend that the shareholders of Parent vote in favor of the
issuance of Parent Shares in connection with the Merger, the Parent Name
Change and the Consolidation, and to include such recommendations in the Joint
Proxy Statement/Prospectus. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed
and delivered by Parent and Merger Sub and, assuming this Agreement
constitutes the valid and binding agreement of the Company, constitutes the
valid and binding agreement of Parent and Merger Sub, enforceable against
Parent and Merger Sub in accordance with its terms, except that (i) such
enforcement may be subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
examinership, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium or other similar
Laws, now or hereafter in effect, affecting or relating to the enforcement of
creditors rights generally and (ii) equitable remedies of specific
performance and injunctive and other forms of equitable relief may be subject
to equitable defenses and to the discretion of the court before which any
proceeding therefor may be brought.

the DGCL, (ii) the Securities Act, (iii) the Exchange Act, (iv) the HSR Act,
(v) any applicable requirements of the NYSE (vi) the Irish Takeover Rules and
(vii) the matters set forth in Section 4.3(b) of the Parent Disclosure Letter,
no authorization, consent or approval of, or filing with, any Governmental
Entity is necessary, under applicable Law, for the consummation by Parent and
Merger Sub of the Transactions, except for such authorizations, consents,
approvals or filings that, if not obtained or made, would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse
Effect.

(c) The execution and delivery by Parent and Merger Sub of this Agreement do
not, and, except as described in _Section 4.3(b)_, the consummation of the
Transactions and compliance with the provisions hereof will not (i) result in
any violation or breach of, or default or change of control (with or without
notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise to a right of, or result
in, termination, modification, cancellation or acceleration of any material
obligation or to the loss of a material benefit under any Contract, loan,
guarantee of Indebtedness or credit agreement, note, bond, mortgage,
indenture, lease, permit, concession, franchise or right binding upon Parent
or any of Parents Subsidiaries or result in the creation of any Lien upon
any of the properties, rights or assets of Parent or any Parent Subsidiaries,
other than Parent Permitted Liens, (ii) conflict with or result in any
violation of any provision of the Parent Governing Documents or any of
the organizational documents of any Parent Subsidiary or (iii) conflict with
or violate any Laws applicable to Parent or any of Parents Subsidiaries or
any of their respective properties or assets, other than in the case of
clauses (i), (ii) and (iii), any such violation, breach, conflict, default,
termination, modification, cancellation, acceleration, right, loss or Lien
that would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 



26 Section 4.4 _Reports and Financial Statements_.

 

(a) From January 1, 2013 through the date of this Agreement, Parent has filed
or furnished all forms, documents and reports required to be filed or
furnished prior to the date hereof by it with the SEC (the " _Parent SEC
Documents_ "). As of their respective dates, or, if amended, as of the date of
(and giving effect to) the last such amendment, the Parent SEC
Documents complied in all material respects with the requirements of the
Securities Act and the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and the applicable
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, and none of the Parent SEC
Documents contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading.

 

(b) The consolidated financial statements (including all related notes and
schedules) of Parent included in the Parent SEC Documents when filed complied
as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting
requirements and the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect
thereto in effect at the time of such filing and fairly present in all
material respects the consolidated financial position of Parent and its
consolidated Subsidiaries, as at the respective dates thereof, and their
consolidated statements of operations, consolidated statements of
comprehensive (loss) income and consolidated statements of cash flows for the
respective periods then ended (subject, in the case of the unaudited
statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments and to any other adjustments
described therein, including the notes thereto) in conformity with GAAP
(except, in the case of the unaudited statements, to the extent permitted by
the SEC) applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except as
may be indicated therein or in the notes thereto).

 

Section 4.5 _Internal Controls and Procedures_. Parent has established and
maintains disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over
financial reporting (as such terms are defined in paragraphs (e) and (f),
respectively, of Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act) as required by Rule
13a-15 under the Exchange Act. Parents disclosure controls and procedures
are reasonably designed to ensure that all material information required to
be disclosed by Parent in the reports that it files or furnishes under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such
material information is accumulated and communicated to Parents management as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to
make the certifications required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Parents internal controls over financial reporting
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of Parents financial
reporting and the preparation of Parent financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with GAAP. Since January 1, 2013, Parents principal
executive officer and its principal financial officer have disclosed to
Parents auditors and the audit committee of the Parent Board of Directors
(i) all known significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design
or operation of internal controls over financial reporting that are reasonably
likely to adversely affect in any material respect Parents ability
to record, process, summarize and report financial information, and (ii) any
known fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
employees who have a significant role in Parents internal controls. Parent
has made available to the Company all such disclosures made by management to
Parents auditors and audit committee from January 1, 2013 to the date hereof.

 

Section 4.6 _No Undisclosed Liabilities_. Except (a) as disclosed, reflected
or reserved against in Parents consolidated balance sheet (or the notes
thereto) as of December 31, 2014 included in the Parent SEC Documents filed or
furnished on or prior to the date hereof, (b) for liabilities incurred in the
ordinary course of business since December 31, 2014, (c) as expressly
permitted or contemplated by this Agreement and (d) for liabilities which have
been discharged or paid in full in the ordinary course of business, as of the
date hereof, neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary has any liabilities of
any nature, whether or not accrued, contingent or otherwise, other than those
which, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to
have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. For purposes of this  _Section 4.6_,
the term "liabilities" shall not include obligations of Parent or any Parent
Subsidiaries to perform

 



27  under or comply with any applicable Law, action, judgment or Contract, but
would include such liabilities and obligations if there has been a default or
failure to perform or comply by Parent or any Parent Subsidiaries with any
such liability or obligation if such default or failure would, with the giving
of notice or passage of time or both, reasonably be expected to result in a
monetary obligation or the imposition of injunctive or other equitable
remedies.

Section 4.7 _Compliance with Laws; Permits_.

 

(a) Parent and each Parent Subsidiary are in compliance with and are not in
default under or in violation of any Laws, applicable to Parent, such
Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or assets, except where
such non-compliance, default or violation would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 

(b) Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries are in possession of all franchises,
grants, authorizations, licenses, permits, easements, variances, exceptions,
consents, certificates, clearances, approvals, registrations and orders of any
Governmental Entity necessary for Parent and Parents Subsidiaries to own,
lease and operate their properties and assets or to carry on their
businesses as they are now being conducted (the " _Parent Permits_ "), except
where the failure to have any of the Parent Permits would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse
Effect. All Parent Permits are in full force and effect, except where the
failure to be in full force and effect would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything contained in this _Section 4.7_, no
representation or warranty shall be deemed to be made in this  _Section 4.7_
in respect of the matters referenced in _Section 4.4_, _Section 4.5_ or
_Section 4.13_, or in respect of environmental, Tax, employee benefits or
labor Law matters.

 

Section 4.8 _Environmental Laws and Regulations_. Except for such matters as
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Parent Material Adverse Effect: (a) Parent and its Subsidiaries are now and
have been since January 1, 2013 in compliance with all, and have not violated
any, applicable Environmental Laws; (b) no property currently or formerly
owned, leased or operated by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (including
soils, groundwater, surface water, buildings or other structures), or any
other location used by Parent or any of Parents Subsidiary, is contaminated

required to be remediated or removed, that is in violation of any
Environmental Law, or that is reasonably likely to give rise to any
Environmental Liability; (c) since January 1, 2013, neither Parent nor any of

the material Environmental Permits necessary for the conduct and operation of
its business as now being conducted, all such Environmental Permits are valid
and in full force and effect and Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries are in
compliance with such Environmental Permits.

 



28 Section 4.9 _Employee Benefit Plans_.

 

(a) Section 4.9(a) of the Parent Disclosure Letter sets forth a true and
complete list of each material Parent Benefit Plan for current or former
employees, directors or consultants of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary. "
_Parent Benefit Plan_ " means each "employee benefit plan" (as defined in
Section 3(3) of ERISA), whether or not subject to ERISA, and each bonus,
stock, stock option or other equity-based compensation arrangement or plan,
incentive, deferred compensation, retirement or supplemental retirement,
severance, employment, change-in-control, collective bargaining, profit
sharing, pension, vacation, cafeteria, dependent care, medical care, employee
assistance program, education or tuition assistance programs, and each
insurance and other similar fringe or employee benefit plan, program or
arrangement, in each case for the benefit of current or former employees,
directors or consultants (or any dependent or beneficiary thereof) of Parent
or any Parent Subsidiary or with respect to which Parent or any Parent
Subsidiary has or may have any present or future obligation or liability
(whether actual or contingent).

(b) With respect to each material Parent Benefit Plan, Parent has made
available to Parent correct and complete copies of, in each case, to the
extent applicable, (i) all plan documents and material amendments thereto; and
(ii) the most recent annual report on Form 5500 and the most recent audited
financial statement or actuarial valuation report.

(c) (i) Except as would not, individually, or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect, each of the Parent Benefit
Plans has been operated and administered in material compliance with its terms
and applicable Laws; (ii) each Parent Benefit Plan intended to be "qualified"
within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code has received a favorable
determination or opinion letter as to its qualification, and to the knowledge
of Parent, there are no existing circumstances or any events that have
occurred that would reasonably be expected to adversely affect the qualified
status of any such plan; (iii) no Parent Benefit Plan provides benefits,
including death or medical benefits (whether or not insured), with respect to
current or former employees or directors of Parent or its Subsidiaries beyond
their retirement or other termination of service, other than coverage mandated
by COBRA; (iv) Parent nor any ERISA Affiliate has or has had in the past six
(6) years an obligation to contribution to a "multiemployer pension plan" (as
such term is defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA) or a plan that has two or more
contributing sponsors at least two of whom are not under common control,
within the meaning of Section 4063 of ERISA; (v) except as would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect, all contributions or other amounts payable by Parent
or its Subsidiaries pursuant to each Parent Benefit Plan in respect of
current or prior plan years have been timely paid or accrued in accordance
with GAAP or applicable international accounting standards; (vi) to the
knowledge of the Parent, no non-exempt "prohibited transaction" (within the
meaning of Section 4975 of the Code and Section 406 of ERISA) has occurred
with respect to any Parent Benefit Plan that would reasonably be expected to
result in a material liability to the Parent or a Parent Subsidiary; and (vii)
there are no pending, or to the knowledge of Parent, threatened in writing,
claims, actions, investigations or audits (other than routine claims for
benefits) by, on behalf of or against any of the Parent Benefit Plans that
would reasonably be expected to result in a material liability to Parent or a
Parent Subsidiary.

(d) Except as set forth in Section 4.9(d) of the Parent Disclosure Letter, in
the past six (6) years, neither the Parent, any Parent Subsidiary nor any of
their respective ERISA Affiliates has or has had an obligation to contribute
to a "defined benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(35) of ERISA (a " _Parent
Single Employer Plan_ ") or any other pension plan subject to Title IV of
ERISA. No failure to satisfy the minimum funding standards (within the meaning
of Section 302 of ERISA and Section 412 of the Code, whether or not waived)
has occurred with respect to any Parent Single Employer Plan, and there has
been no determination that any Parent Single Employer Plan is, or is expected
to be, in "at risk" status (within the meaning of Section 303 of ERISA). With
respect to each Parent Single Employer Plan, neither Parent, any Parent
Subsidiary nor any of their respective ERISA Affiliates has (i) incurred any

of any Parent Single Employer Plan, including but not limited to the
imposition of any lien in favor of the PBGC or any Parent

intention to terminate any Parent Single Employer Plan, including but not
limited to the imposition of any lien in favor of the PBGC or any Parent
Single Employer Plan, or (iii) incurred any liability under Title IV of ERISA
that has not been satisfied in full and no condition exists that is likely to
cause Parent, any Parent Subsidiary or any of their respective ERISA
Affiliates to incur liability thereunder.

(e) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the
consummation of the Transactions (either alone or in conjunction with any
other event) will (i) result in any payment or benefit becoming due to any
current or former employee, director or consultant of Parent or any Parent
Subsidiary under any Parent Benefit Plan or otherwise, (ii) increase any
compensation or benefits otherwise payable or to be provided under any Parent
Benefit Plan or (iii) result in any acceleration of the time of payment,
funding or vesting of any compensation or benefits, or (iv) result in the

other payment, constitute an "excess parachute payment," as defined in Section
280G(b)(1) of the Code.

 

(f) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect, each Parent Benefit Plan
has been maintained and operated in documentary and operational compliance
with Section 409A of the Code or an available exemption therefrom. Parent is
not a party to nor does it have any obligation under any Parent Benefit Plan
to compensate any person for excise Taxes payable pursuant to Section 4999 of
the Code or for Taxes payable pursuant to Section 409A or 457A of the Code.

 

(g) (i) Each Parent Benefit Plan that is not subject to U.S. law (each, a "
_Parent Foreign Benefit Plan_ ") has been established, maintained and
administered in material compliance with its terms and applicable Laws, and if
intended to qualify for special tax treatment, meets all the requirements for
such treatment, (ii) all employer and employee contributions to each Parent
Foreign Benefit Plan required by its terms or by applicable Law have been made

in a Company Superior Proposal, then in either event the Company may take the
following actions: (x) furnish nonpublic information to the Person making such

(c) The Company shall notify Parent promptly (but in no event later than

Company Competing Proposal, or any initial inquiry or request for nonpublic
information relating to the Company or any Company Subsidiary by any Person
who has made or would reasonably be expected to make any Company Competing
Proposal. Such notice shall be made orally and confirmed in writing, and shall
indicate the identity of the Person making the Company Competing Proposal,
inquiry or request or with whom the Company is engaging in discussions or
negotiations, and the material terms and conditions of any such proposal or
offer and the nature of the information requested pursuant to such inquiry or
request. In addition, the Company shall promptly (but in any event within
twenty-four (24) hours) after the receipt thereof, provide to Parent copies of
any written proposal, offer or draft agreement relating to a Company Competing
Proposal or potential Company Competing Proposal which is received by the
Company from any Person (or from any representatives, advisors or agents of
such Person) making such Company Competing Proposal or with whom discussions

Proposal. The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed of the status and

material terms) of any such Company Competing Proposal or potential Company
Competing Proposal and keep Parent reasonably informed as to the nature of
any information requested of the Company with respect thereto. The Company

any other Person in connection with any Company Competing Proposal that was
not previously provided to Parent. The Company shall not take any action to
exempt any Person from the restrictions on "business combinations" contained
in any applicable Takeover Statute or otherwise cause such restrictions not to

45 (d) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 5.3_ or _Section 5.5_ to
the contrary, at any time prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder
Approval, the Company Board of Directors may make a Company Change of
Recommendation (i) in response to a Company Intervening Event, or (ii)
following receipt of a bona fide, unsolicited, written Company Competing
Proposal, which the Company Board of Directors determines in good faith after
consultation with the Companys outside legal and financial advisors is a
Company Superior Proposal, if and only if, (x) in the case of clause (ii),
such Company Competing Proposal was received after the date hereof and did not
result from a breach of the provisions of this _Section 5.3_ and (y) in the
case of clauses (i) and (ii), the Company Board of Directors has determined
in good faith after consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel that
the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the duties of the
members of the Company Board of Directors under applicable Law and the
Company complies with _Section 5.3(e)_.

(e) Prior to the Company taking any action permitted (i) under _Section
5.3(d)(i)_, the Company shall provide Parent with three (3) business days
prior written notice advising Parent it intends to effect a Company Change of
Recommendation and specifying, in reasonable detail, the reasons therefor
(including the material facts and circumstances related to the applicable
Company Intervening Event), and during such three (3) business day period, the
Company shall consider and negotiate in good faith any proposal by Parent to
amend the terms and conditions of this Agreement in a manner that would
obviate the need to effect a Company Change of Recommendation or (ii) under
_Section 5.3(d)(ii)_, the Company shall provide Parent with three (3)
business days prior written notice (it being understood and agreed that any
material amendment to the amount or form of consideration payable in
connection with the applicable Company Competing Proposal shall require a new
notice and an additional two (2) business day period) advising Parent that
the Company Board of Directors intends to take such action and specifying the
material terms and conditions of the Company Competing Proposal, and during
such three (3) business day period (or subsequent two (2) business day
period), the Company shall consider and negotiate in good faith any proposal
by Parent to amend the terms and conditions of this Agreement such that such
Company Competing Proposal would no longer constitute a Company Superior
Proposal. In the event the Company provides to Parent a notice contemplated by
this _Section 5.3(e)_, then, notwithstanding anything in the Confidentiality
Agreement to the contrary, the term "Representatives" (as defined in the
Confidentiality Agreement) shall thereafter be deemed to include financing
sources of Parent.

 

(f) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the
Company Board of Directors from (i) disclosing to the Companys stockholders
a position contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the
Exchange Act or (ii) making any disclosure to its stockholders if the Company
Board of Directors has reasonably determined in good faith after consultation
with the Companys outside legal counsel that the failure to do so would be
inconsistent with the duties of the members of the Company Board of Directors
under applicable Law; _provided_ that this _Section 5.3(f)_ shall not permit
the Company Board of Directors to make a Company Change of Recommendation
except to the extent permitted by _Section 5.3(d)_ or _Section 5.3(e)_.

 

(g) No Company Change of Recommendation shall relieve the Company from its
obligations to submit the approval and adoption of this Agreement to a vote
of its stockholders at the Company Special Meeting.

(h) References in this _Section 5.3_ to the "Company Board of Directors"
shall mean the Company Board of Directors or, to the extent applicable, a duly
authorized committee thereof.

accordance with _Section 5.4(b)_ or (y) in accordance with _Section
8.1(j)_), or (viii) resolve or agree to do any of the foregoing (any act
described in clauses (v) and (vi) above, a " _Parent Change of Recommendation_
"). Parent shall immediately cease, and cause its directors, officers and
employees to cease, and shall direct and use its reasonable best efforts to
cause its other Representatives to immediately cease, any and all existing
discussions or negotiations with any parties (or provision of any nonpublic
information to any parties) conducted heretofore with respect to any Parent
Competing Proposal or potential Parent Competing Proposal. Parent shall
promptly inform its Representatives of Parents obligations under this
_Section 5.4_. For purposes of this _Section 5.4_, the term "Person" means
any Person or "group," as used in Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act, other
than, with respect to Parent, the Company or any Company Subsidiaries.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Parent
and the Parent Subsidiaries and Parents Representatives may in any event
inform a Person that has made or, to the knowledge of Parent, is considering
making a Parent Competing Proposal of the provisions of this _Section 5.4_.

(b) Notwithstanding the limitations set forth in _Section 5.4(a)_, (X) if
Parent receives, prior to the Parent Shareholder Issuance Approval being
obtained, a bona fide, unsolicited, written Parent Competing Proposal, which
the Parent Board of Directors determines in good faith after consultation
with Parents outside legal and financial advisors (i) constitutes a Parent
Superior Proposal or (ii) would reasonably be expected to result, after the
taking of any of the actions referred to in either of clause (x) or (y)
below, in a Parent Superior Proposal, or (Y) if required by Rule 20.2 of the
Irish Takeover Rules, then, in any such event, Parent may take the following
actions: (x) furnish nonpublic information to the Person making such Parent
Competing Proposal, if, and only if, prior to so furnishing such information,
Parent receives from such Person an executed Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement and (y) engage in discussions or negotiations with such Person with
respect to the Parent Competing Proposal.

(c) Parent shall notify the Company promptly (but in no event later than
twenty-four (24) hours) after receipt of any Parent Competing Proposal, any
initial proposals or inquiries that would reasonably be expected to lead to a
Parent Competing Proposal, or any initial inquiry or request for nonpublic
information relating to Parent or any Parent Subsidiary by any Person who has
made or would reasonably be expected to make any Parent Competing Proposal.
Such notice shall be made orally and confirmed in writing, and shall indicate
the identity of the Person making the Parent Competing Proposal, inquiry or
request or with whom Parent is engaging in discussions or negotiations, and
the material terms and conditions of any such proposal or offer and the nature
of the information requested pursuant to such inquiry or request. In
addition, Parent shall promptly (but in any event within twenty-four (24)
hours)

 



47  after the receipt thereof, provide to the Company copies of any written
proposal, offer or draft agreement relating to a Parent Competing Proposal or
potential Parent Competing Proposal which is received by Parent from any
Person (or from any representatives, advisors or agents of such Person) making
such Parent Competing Proposal or with whom discussions or negotiations would
reasonably be expected to lead to a Parent Competing Proposal. Parent shall
keep the Company reasonably informed of the status and material terms
(including any amendments or proposed amendments to such material terms) of
any such Parent Competing Proposal or potential Parent Competing Proposal and
keep the Company reasonably informed as to the nature of any information
requested of Parent with respect thereto. Parent shall promptly (but in any
event within twenty-four (24) hours) provide to the Company any material
nonpublic information concerning Parent provided to any other Person in
connection with any Parent Competing Proposal that was not previously provided
to the Company. Parent shall not take any action to exempt any Person from the
restrictions on "business combinations" contained in any applicable Takeover
Statute or otherwise cause such restrictions not to apply.

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 5.4_ or _Section 5.5_ to the
contrary, at any time prior to the receipt of the Parent Shareholder Issuance
Approval, the Parent Board of Directors may make a Parent Change of
Recommendation (i) in response to a Parent Intervening Event, or (ii)
following receipt of a bona fide, written Parent Competing Proposal, which the
Parent Board of Directors determines in good faith after consultation with
Parents outside legal and financial advisors is a Parent Superior Proposal,
if and only if, (x) in the case of clause (ii), such Parent Competing Proposal
was received after the date hereof and did not result from a breach of the
provisions of this _Section 5.4_ and (y) in the case of clauses (i) and
(ii), the Parent Board of Directors has determined in good faith after
consultation with Parents outside legal counsel that the failure to take such
action would be inconsistent with the duties of the members of the Parent
Board of Directors under applicable Law and Parent complies with _Section
5.4(e)_.

(e) Prior to Parent taking any action permitted (i) under _Section
5.4(d)(i)_, Parent shall provide the Company with three (3) business days
prior written notice advising the Company it intends to effect a Parent Change
of Recommendation and specifying, in reasonable detail, the reasons therefor
(including the material facts and circumstances related to the applicable
Parent Intervening Event), and during such three (3) business day period,
Parent shall consider and negotiate in good faith any proposal by the Company
to amend the terms and conditions of this Agreement in a manner that would
obviate the need to effect a Parent Change of Recommendation or (ii) under
_Section 5.4(d)(ii)_, Parent shall provide the Company with three (3)
business days prior written notice (it being understood and agreed that any
material amendment to the amount or form of consideration payable in
connection with the applicable Parent Competing Proposal shall require a new
notice and an additional two (2) business day period) advising the Company
that the Parent Board of Directors intends to take such action and specifying
the material terms and conditions of the Parent Competing Proposal, and
during such three (3) business day period (or subsequent two (2) business day
period), Parent shall consider and negotiate in good faith any proposal by the
Company to amend the terms and conditions of this Agreement such that such
Parent Competing Proposal would no longer constitute a Parent Superior
Proposal. In the event Parent provides to the Company a notice contemplated by
this _Section 5.4(e)_, then, notwithstanding anything in the
Confidentiality Agreement to the contrary, the term "Representatives" (as
defined in the Confidentiality Agreement) shall thereafter be deemed to
include financing sources of the Company.

 

(f) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit Parent or the Parent
Board of Directors from (i) disclosing to Parents shareholders a position
contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or
(ii) making any disclosure to its shareholders if the Parent Board of
Directors has reasonably determined in good faith after consultation with
Parents outside legal counsel that the failure to do so would be inconsistent
with the duties of the members of the Parent Board of Directors under
applicable Law; _provided_ that this _Section 5.4(f)_ shall not permit
the Parent Board of Directors to make a Parent Change of Recommendation
except to the extent permitted by _Section 5.4(d)_ or _Section 5.4(e)_.

 



48 (g) No Parent Change of Recommendation shall relieve Parent from its
obligations to submit the issuance of Parent Shares in connection with the
Merger to a vote of its shareholders at the Parent Special Meeting.

(h) References in this _Section 5.4_ to the "Parent Board of Directors"
shall mean the Parent Board of Directors or, to the extent applicable, a duly
authorized committee thereof.

 

Section 5.5 _Preparation of the Form S-4 and the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus; Stockholders  and Shareholders Meetings_.

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this
Agreement, (i) the Company and Parent shall jointly prepare and cause to be
filed with the SEC the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus in preliminary form,
and (ii) Parent shall prepare and cause to be filed with the SEC, the Form S-4
with respect to the Parent Shares issuable in the Merger, which will include
the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus with respect to the Company Special
Meeting and Parent Special Meeting. Each of the Company and Parent shall use
its reasonable best efforts to (A) have the Form S-4 declared effective under
the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such filing, (B) ensure
that the Form S-4 complies in all material respects with the applicable
provisions of the Exchange Act or Securities Act, (C) to include in the Form
S-4 any information as is required to be included by the Irish Takeover Rules
and (D) keep the Form S-4 effective for so long as necessary to complete the
Merger. Each of the Company and Parent shall furnish all information
concerning itself, its affiliates and the holders of its shares to the other
and provide such other assistance as may be reasonably requested in connection
with the preparation, filing and distribution of the Form S-4 and Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus. The Form S-4 and Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus shall
include all information reasonably requested by such other Party to be
included therein. Each of the Company and Parent shall promptly notify the
other upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC or any request from the
SEC for amendments or supplements to the Form S-4 or Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus, and shall, as promptly as practicable after receipt
thereof, provide the other with copies of all correspondence between it and
its Representatives, on one hand, and the SEC, on the other hand, and all
written comments with respect to the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the
Form S-4 received from the SEC and advise the other party of any oral comments
with respect to the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Form S-4 received
from the SEC. Each of the Company and Parent shall use its reasonable best
efforts to respond as promptly as practicable to any comments from the SEC
with respect to the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus, and Parent shall use
its reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as practicable to any
comment from the SEC with respect to the Form S-4. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, prior to filing the Form S-4 (or any amendment or supplement
thereto) or mailing the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus (or any amendment or
supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect
thereto, each of the Company and Parent shall cooperate and provide the other
a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such document or response
in advance (including the proposed final version of such document or
response). Parent shall advise the Company, promptly after it receives notice
thereof, of the time of effectiveness of the Form S-4, the issuance of any
stop order relating thereto or the suspension of the qualification of the
Parent Shares issuable in connection with the Merger for offering or sale in
any jurisdiction, and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to have
any such stop order or suspension lifted, reversed or otherwise terminated.
Parent shall also take any other action required to be taken under the
Securities Act, the Exchange Act, any applicable foreign or state securities
or "blue sky" Laws and the rules and regulations thereunder in connection with
the issuance of Parent Shares in connection with the Merger, and the Company
shall furnish all information concerning the Company and the holders of the
Company Common Stock as may be reasonably requested in connection with any
such actions.

 



49 (b) If, at any time prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval
or the Parent Shareholder Issuance Approval, any information relating to the
Company or Parent, or any of their respective affiliates, should be discovered
by the Company or Parent which, in the reasonable judgment of the Company or
Parent, should be set forth in an amendment of, or a supplement to, any of
the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus, so that any of such
documents would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the Party which
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other Parties, and the
Company and Parent shall cooperate in the prompt filing with the SEC of any
necessary amendment of, or supplement to, the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus
or the Form S-4 and, to the extent required by Law, in disseminating the
information contained in such amendment or supplement to stockholders of the
Company and the shareholders of Parent. Nothing in this _Section 5.5(b)_
shall limit the obligations of any Party under _Section 5.5(a)_. For purposes
of this _Section 5.5_, any information concerning or related to the Company,
its affiliates or the Company Special Meeting will be deemed to have been
provided by the Company, and any information concerning or related to Parent,
its affiliates or the Parent Special Meeting will be deemed to have been
provided by Parent.

 

(c) As promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the
Company shall, in accordance with applicable Law and the Company Governing
Documents, establish a record date for, duly call, give notice of, convene and
hold the Company Special Meeting. The Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be mailed to
the stockholders of the Company entitled to vote at the Company Special
Meeting and to hold the Company Special Meeting as soon as practicable after
the Form S-4 is declared effective under the Securities Act. The Company
shall, through the Company Board of Directors, recommend to its stockholders
that they give the Company Stockholder Approval, include such recommendation
in the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus and solicit and use its reasonable
best efforts to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval, except in each case
to the extent that the Company Board of Directors shall have made a Company
Change of Recommendation as permitted by _Section 5.3_. Notwithstanding the
foregoing provisions of this _Section 5.4(c)_, if, on a date for which the
Company Special Meeting is scheduled, the Company has not received proxies
representing a sufficient number of shares of Company Common Stock to obtain
the Company Stockholder Approval, whether or not a quorum is present, the
Company shall have the right to make one or more successive postponements or
adjournments of the Company Special Meeting; _provided_ that the Company
Special Meeting is not postponed or adjourned to a date that is more than
thirty (30) days after the date for which the Company Special Meeting was
originally scheduled (other than any adjournments or postponements required by
applicable Law, including adjournments or postponements to the extent
reasonably necessary or advisable to ensure that any required supplement or
amendment to the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus is provided or made
available to the Company stockholders or to permit dissemination of
information which is material to stockholders voting at the Company Special
Meeting and to give the Company stockholders sufficient time to evaluate any
such supplement or amendment or other information). Nothing contained in this
Agreement shall be deemed to relieve the Company of its obligations to
submit this Agreement to its stockholders for a vote on the approval and
adoption thereof.

(d) As promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement, Parent
shall, in accordance with applicable Law and the Parent Governing Documents,
establish a record date for, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold the
Parent Special Meeting. Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be mailed to the shareholders of
Parent entitled to vote at the Parent Special Meeting and to hold the Parent
Special Meeting as soon as practicable after the Form S-4 is declared
effective under the Securities Act. Parent shall, through the Parent Board of
Directors, recommend to its shareholders that they give the Parent Shareholder
Approvals, include such recommendations in the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus, and solicit and use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain the Parent Shareholder Approvals, except in each case to the extent
that the Parent Board of

 



50  Directors shall have made a Parent Change of Recommendation as permitted by
_Section 5.4_. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this _Section
5.5(d)_, if, on a date for which the Parent Special Meeting is scheduled,
Parent has not received proxies representing a sufficient number of Parent
Shares to obtain the Parent Shareholder Issuance Approval, whether or not a
quorum is present, Parent shall have the right to make one or more successive
postponements or adjournments of the Parent Special Meeting; _provided_ that
the Parent Special Meeting is not postponed or adjourned to a date that is
more than thirty (30) days after the date for which the Parent Special
Meeting was originally scheduled (other than any adjournments or postponements
required by applicable Law, including adjournments or postponements to the
extent reasonably necessary or advisable to ensure that any required
supplement or amendment to the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus is provided
or made available to the Parent shareholders or to permit dissemination of
information which is material to shareholders voting at the Parent Special
Meeting and to give the Parent shareholders sufficient time to evaluate any
such supplement or amendment or other information). Nothing contained in this
Agreement shall be deemed to relieve Parent of its obligation to submit the
issuance of Parent Shares in connection with the Merger to its shareholders
for a vote on the approval thereof.

(e) The Company and Parent will use their respective reasonable best efforts
to hold the Company Special Meeting and the Parent Special Meeting on the same
date and as soon as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement.

 

Section 5.6 _Consultation as to Certain Tax Matters_.

 

(a) Prior to (a) consummating any transaction that (i) is described in clause
(a), (b), (e), (g), (h), (i), (j) or (k) of  _Section 5.1(ii)_ and (ii) is
not subject to Parents consent right provided in _Section 5.1(ii)_ on the
basis that such transaction involves solely the Company and one or more
Company Subsidiaries or solely Company Subsidiaries, or (b) altering any
intercompany arrangements or agreements or the ownership structure among the
Company and its wholly-owned Subsidiaries or among the Companys wholly-owned
Subsidiaries, in each case, other than in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice, the Company shall consult with Parent
reasonably prior to consummating any such transaction and shall not proceed
with any such action or transaction described in clause (a) or (b) hereof
without Parents consent (not to be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or
delayed) if such action or transaction would, without taking into account any
action or transaction entered into by Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries (including, after the Effective Time, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries), reasonably be expected to have adverse Tax consequences that,
individually or in the aggregate, are material to the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries or, after the Effective Time, to Parent and the Parent
Subsidiaries.

(b) Except as set forth in Section 5.6(b) of the Parent Disclosure
Letter, prior to (a) consummating any transaction that (i) is described in
clause (a), (b), (e), (g), (h), (i), (j) or (k) of _Section 5.2(ii)_ and (ii)
is not subject to the Companys consent right provided in  _Section 5.2(ii)_
on the basis that such transaction involves solely Parent and one or more
Parent Subsidiaries or solely Parent Subsidiaries, or (b) altering any
intercompany arrangements or agreements or the ownership structure among
Parent and its wholly-owned Subsidiaries or among Parents wholly-owned
Subsidiaries, in each case, other than in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice, Parent shall consult with the Company
reasonably prior to consummating any such transaction and shall not proceed
with any such action or transaction described in clause (a) or (b) hereof
without the Companys consent (not to be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or
delayed) if such action or transaction would, without taking into account any
action or transaction entered into by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(including actions or transactions after the Effective Time), reasonably be
expected to have adverse Tax consequences that, individually or in the
aggregate, are material to Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries (including,
after the Effective Time, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries).

 



51 ARTICLE VI

 

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

 

Section 6.1 _Access; Confidentiality; Notice of Certain Events_.

 

(a) From the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time or the date, if
any, on which this Agreement is terminated pursuant to  _Section 8.1_, to
the extent permitted by applicable Law, each of the Company and Parent shall,
and shall cause each of the Company Subsidiaries and the Parent Subsidiaries,
respectively, to afford to the other Party and to the Representatives of such
other Party reasonable access during normal business hours and upon reasonable
advance notice to all of their respective properties, offices, books,
contracts, commitments, personnel and records (in each case, whether
in physical or electronic form) and, during such period, each of the Company
and Parent shall, and shall cause each of the Company Subsidiaries and the
Parent Subsidiaries, respectively, to, furnish reasonably promptly to the
other Party any and all information (financial or otherwise) concerning its
and its Subsidiaries business, properties and personnel as such other Party
may reasonably request. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Company nor
Parent shall be required by this  _Section 6.1_ to provide the other Party
or the Representatives of such other Party with access to or to disclose
information (A) that is subject to the terms of a confidentiality agreement
with a third party entered into prior to the date of this Agreement or
entered into after the date of this Agreement in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice ( _provided, however_ , that the
withholding Party shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain
the required consent of such third party to such access or disclosure), (B)
the disclosure of which would violate any Law or duty ( _provided, however_ ,
that the withholding Party shall use its reasonable best efforts to make
appropriate substitute arrangements to permit reasonable disclosure not in
violation of any Law or duty) or (C) that is subject to any attorney-client,
attorney work product or other legal privilege ( _provided, however_ , that
the withholding Party shall use its reasonable best efforts to allow for such
access or disclosure to the maximum extent that does not result in a loss of
any such attorney-client, attorney work product or other legal privilege);
_provided, however_ , that such access and information shall be disclosed or
granted, as applicable, to external counsel for Parent to the extent
reasonably required for the purpose of complying with applicable Antitrust
Laws subject to prior execution of a common interest or joint defense
agreement in customary form. Each of the Company and Parent will use
commercially reasonable efforts to minimize any disruption to the businesses
of the other Party that may result from the requests for access, data and
information hereunder.

(b) Each of the Company and Parent will hold, and will cause its
Representatives and affiliates to hold, any nonpublic information, including
any information exchanged pursuant to this _Section 6.1_, in confidence to
the extent required by and in accordance with, and will otherwise comply with,
the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.

 

(c) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give
prompt notice to the Company, (i) of any notice or other communication
received by such Party from any Governmental Entity in connection with this
Agreement, the Merger or other Transactions, or from any Person alleging that
the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the Merger
or the other Transactions, if the subject matter of such communication or the
failure of such Party to obtain such consent could be material to the Company,
the Surviving Corporation or Parent, (ii) of any legal proceeding commenced
or, to any Partys knowledge, threatened against, such Party or any of its
Subsidiaries or affiliates or otherwise relating to, involving or affecting
such Party or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates, in each case in
connection with, arising from or otherwise relating to the Merger or any
other Transaction, (iii) in the case of Parent, of any notice or other
communication received by Parent from any Person requisitioning the convening
of a meeting of the holders of Parent Shares, (iv) in the case of the
Company, of any notice or other communication received by the Company from any

 



52  Person calling for a meeting of the holders of Company Shares, and (v) upon
becoming aware of the occurrence or impending occurrence of any event or
circumstance relating to it or any of the Company Subsidiaries or the Parent
Subsidiaries, respectively, which would reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect or a
Parent Material Adverse Effect, as the case may be, or which would reasonably
be expected to prevent or materially delay or impede the consummation of the
Transactions; _provided, however_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant
to this _Section 6.1(c)_ shall not cure any breach of any representation or
warranty requiring disclosure of such matter prior to the date of this
Agreement or otherwise limit or affect the remedies available hereunder to any
Party. The failure to deliver any such notice shall not affect any of
the conditions set forth in _Article VII_ or give rise to any right to
terminate under _Article VIII_.

Section 6.2  _Reasonable Best Efforts_.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each Party will use
its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to
do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under
applicable Laws to consummate the Merger and make effective the Transactions,
including the transactions set forth in  _Schedule 6.2(a)_ hereto (the "
_Restructuring Transactions_ "), as soon as practicable after the date hereof,
including (i) preparing and filing, in consultation with the other Party and
as promptly as practicable and advisable after the date hereof, all
documentation to effect all necessary applications, notices, petitions,
filings, and other documents and to obtain as promptly as practicable all
waiting period expirations or terminations, consents, clearances, waivers,
licenses, orders, registrations, approvals, permits, and authorizations
necessary or advisable to be obtained from any third party and/or any
Governmental Entity in order to consummate the Merger or any of the other
Transactions (including those set forth in Section 6.2(a)(i) of the Company
Disclosure Letter or Section 6.2(a)(i) of the Parent Disclosure Letter) and
(ii) taking all steps as may be necessary to obtain all such waiting period
expirations or terminations, consents, clearances, waivers, licenses,
registrations, permits, authorizations, orders and approvals. In furtherance
and not in limitation of the foregoing, each Party agrees to make an
appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act
with respect to the Transactions as promptly as practicable, and in any event
within ten (10) business days after the execution of this Agreement (unless a
later date is mutually agreed between the Parties). Each Party agrees
to supply, as promptly as practicable and advisable, any additional
information and documentary material that may be requested pursuant to the HSR
Act and to take all other actions necessary to cause the expiration or
termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act as soon as
practicable.

(b) Each of Parent and the Company shall, in connection with the
efforts referenced in _Section 6.2(a)_ to obtain all waiting period
expirations or terminations, consents, clearances, waivers, licenses, orders,
registrations, approvals, permits, and authorizations for the Transactions
under the HSR Act, (i) cooperate in all respects and consult with each other
in connection with any filing or submission and in connection with any
investigation or other inquiry, including any proceeding initiated by a
private party, including by allowing the other Party to have a reasonable
opportunity to review in advance and comment on drafts of filings and
submissions; (ii) promptly inform the other Party of any communication
received by such Party from, or given by such Party to, the
Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (the " _DOJ_ "), the Federal
Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ ") or any other Governmental Entity, by promptly
providing copies to the other Party of any such written communications,
and of any material communication received or given in connection with any
proceeding by a private party, in each case regarding any of the Transactions;
_provided, however_ , that materials may be redacted (A) to remove references
concerning the valuation of Parent, the Company or any of their Subsidiaries,
(B) as necessary to comply with contractual arrangements in effect as of the
date hereof, and (C) as necessary to address reasonable privilege or
confidentiality concerns; and (iii) permit the other Party to review in
advance any communication that it gives to, and consult with each other in
advance of any meeting, substantive

 



53  telephone call or conference with, the DOJ, the FTC or any other
Governmental Entity, or, in connection with any proceeding by a private party,
with any other Person ( _provided, however_ , that materials may be redacted
(A) to remove references concerning the valuation of Parent, the Company or
any of their Subsidiaries, (B) as necessary to comply with contractual
arrangements in effect as of the date hereof, and (C) as necessary to address
reasonable privilege or confidentiality concerns), and to the extent permitted
by the DOJ, the FTC or any other applicable Governmental Entity or other
Person, give the other Party the opportunity to attend and participate in any
in-person meetings with the DOJ, the FTC or any other Governmental Entity or
other Person. In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the
Parties contained in _Section 6.2(a)_ and this _Section 6.2(b)_, each Party
shall use its reasonable best efforts to resolve objections, if any, as may be
asserted with respect to the Transactions under any Antitrust Law including
agreeing to any terms, conditions or modifications (including Parent, the
Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries having to cease operating,
license, sell or otherwise dispose of any assets or businesses (including the
requirement that any such assets or businesses be held separate)) with respect
to obtaining the expiration or termination of any waiting period or any
consents, permits, waivers, approvals, authorizations or orders in connection
with the consummation of the Transactions; _provided, however_ , neither the
Company nor Parent shall be required to take, and neither the Company nor
Parent shall take without prior written consent of the other Party, such
actions under this _Section 6.2(b)_ that would result in, or would be
reasonably likely to result in, either individually or in the aggregate, a
Parent Material Adverse Effect or Company Material Adverse Effect, as
applicable. Nothing in this _Section 6.2(b)_ shall require Parent, the
Company or their respective Subsidiaries to take or agree to take any action
with respect to its business or operations unless the effectiveness of such
agreement or action is conditioned upon the Closing. The Parties shall consult
and cooperate with one another, and consider in good faith the views of one
another, regarding the form and content of any analyses, appearances,
presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals made or
submitted by or on behalf of either Party in connection with proceedings under
or relating to any Antitrust Law prior to their submission.

(c) Each of Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain the expiration or termination of all waiting periods and all consents,
waivers, authorizations and approvals of all Governmental Entities and other
third parties necessary, proper or advisable for the consummation of the
Transactions and to provide any notices to third parties required to be
provided prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ that, without the prior
written consent of the other Party, neither Party shall incur any significant
expense or liability, enter into any significant new commitment or agreement
or agree to any significant modification to any contractual arrangement to
obtain such consents or certificates. Each of Parent and the Company will
reasonably cooperate with the other Party in connection with any debt
financing or refinancing undertaken by the other Party in connection with the
consummation of the Transactions, including the incurrence of (i) indebtedness
to repay or refinance the Companys and Parents credit facilities existing on
the date hereof or (ii) indebtedness permitted to be incurred by the Company
or Parent between the date hereof and the Effective Time under this Agreement.

 

Section 6.3 _Publicity_. So long as this Agreement is in effect, neither the
Company nor Parent, nor any of their respective affiliates, shall issue or
cause the publication of any press release or other public announcement with
respect to the Merger or this Agreement without the prior consent of the other
Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, unless
such Party determines, after consultation with outside counsel, that it is
required by applicable Law or by any listing agreement with or the listing
rules of a national securities exchange or trading market to issue or cause
the publication of any press release or other public announcement with
respect to the Merger or this Agreement, in which event such Party shall
endeavor, on a basis reasonable under the circumstances, to provide a
meaningful opportunity to the other Party to review and comment upon such
press release or other announcement in advance and shall give due
consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested
thereto; _provided, however_ , that the Company shall not be required by this
_Section 6.3_ to provide any such review or comment to Parent in connection
with the receipt and existence of a

 



54  Company Competing Proposal or a Company Change of Recommendation and matters
related thereto; _provided further_ , _however_ , that Parent shall not be
required by this  _Section 6.3_ to provide any such review or comment to the

Proposal or a Parent Change of Recommendation and matters related thereto;
_provided further_ that each Party and their respective affiliates may make

Section 6.4 _Directors  and Officers Insurance and Indemnification_. For not

individuals who at or prior to the Effective Time are past or present
directors, officers or employees of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries
(collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") against any costs or expenses
(including advancing attorneys fees and expenses in advance of the final
disposition of any actual or threatened claim, suit, proceeding
or investigation to each Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted by
Law; provided such Indemnified Party agrees in advance to return any such
funds to which a court of competent jurisdiction has determined in a final,
nonappealable judgment such Indemnified Party is not ultimately entitled),
judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in
settlement in connection with any actual or threatened claim, action,
investigation, suit or proceeding in respect of acts or omissions occurring
or alleged to have occurred at or prior to the Effective Time (including acts
or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement and
the consummation of the Merger or any of the other Transactions), whether
asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, in connection
with such persons serving as an officer, director, employee or other fiduciary
of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or of any Person if such
service was at the request or for the benefit of the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries, to the fullest extent permitted by Law or provided
pursuant to the Company Governing Documents or the organizational documents of
any Company Subsidiary or any indemnification agreements, if any, in
existence on the date of this Agreement. The Parties agree that all rights to
elimination of liability, indemnification and advancement of expenses for acts
or omissions occurring or alleged to have occurred at or prior to the
Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Effective Time, now existing in favor of the Indemnified Parties as provided
in their respective certificate of incorporation or by-laws (or
comparable organizational documents) or in any agreement shall survive the
Merger and shall continue in full force and effect. For six (6) years after
the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be maintained in
effect the provisions in (i) the Company Governing Documents and the
organizational documents of any Company Subsidiary and (ii) any other
agreements of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries with any Indemnified
Party, in each case, regarding elimination of liability, indemnification of
officers, directors and employees and advancement of expenses that are in
existence on the date of this Agreement, and no such provision shall be
amended, modified or repealed in any manner that would adversely affect the
rights or protections thereunder of any such Indemnified Party in respect of
acts or omissions occurring or alleged to have occurred at or prior to the
Effective Time (including acts or omissions occurring in connection with the
approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the Merger or any of the
other Transactions). Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide,
for an aggregate period of not less than six (6) years from the Effective
Time, the Companys current directors and officers an insurance and
indemnification policy that provides coverage for events occurring prior to
the Effective Time (the " _D andO Insurance_") that is no less favorable than
the Companys existing policy or, if insurance coverage that is no less
favorable is unavailable, the best available coverage; _provided, however_ ,
that the Surviving Corporation shall not be required to pay an annual premium
for the DandO Insurance in excess of three hundred percent (300%) of the last
annual premium paid prior to the date of this Agreement (it being understood
that Parent shall nevertheless be obligated to provide as much coverage as may
be obtained for such 300% amount); _provided further_  that the Company may
prior to the Effective Time substitute therefor a single premium tail coverage
with respect to DandO Insurance with an annual cost not in excess

 



55  of three hundred percent (300%) of the last annual premium paid prior to the
date of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if
any Indemnified Party notifies Parent on or prior to the sixth (6th)
anniversary of the Effective Time of a matter in respect of which such Person
may seek indemnification pursuant to this _Section 6.4_, the provisions of
this _Section 6.4_ shall continue in effect with respect to such matter
until the final disposition of all claims, actions, investigations, suits and
proceedings relating thereto. In the event Parent or the Surviving Corporation
or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or
merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall
assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 6.4_. The rights
and obligations under this _Section 6.4_ shall survive consummation of the
Merger and shall not be terminated or amended in a manner that is adverse to
any Indemnified Party without the written consent of such Indemnified Party.

and will be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, his or her heirs and his
or her legal representatives.

reasonable best efforts (a) to take all action necessary so that no Takeover
Statute is or becomes applicable to the Merger or any of the other
Transactions and (b) if any such Takeover Statute is or becomes applicable to
any of the foregoing, to take all action necessary so that the Merger and the
other Transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to eliminate or minimize the
effect of such Takeover Statute on the Merger and the other Transactions.

 

Section 6.6 _Obligations of Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation_. Parent
shall take all action necessary to cause Merger Sub and the Surviving
Corporation to perform their respective obligations under this Agreement and
to consummate the Transactions, including the Merger, upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement.

 

Section 6.7 _Rule 16b-3_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company and Parent
shall, as applicable, take all such steps as may be reasonably necessary or
advisable hereto to cause any dispositions of Company equity securities
(including derivative securities) and acquisitions of Parent equity securities
pursuant to the Transactions contemplated by this Agreement by
each individual who is a director or officer of the Company subject to the
reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to
the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 

Section 6.8 _Security Holder Litigation_. Each Party shall provide the other
Party prompt oral notice of any litigation brought by any stockholder or
shareholder of that Party, as applicable, against such Party, any of its
Subsidiaries and/or any of their respective directors relating to the Merger,
this Agreement or any of the Transactions. Unless (i) in the case of
such litigation with respect to the Company, the Company Board of Directors
has made or is considering making a Company Change of Recommendation or (ii)
in the case of such litigation with respect to Parent, the Parent Board of
Directors has made or is considering making a Parent Change of
Recommendation, each Party shall give the other Party the opportunity to
participate (at such other Partys expense) in the defense or settlement of
any such litigation, and no such settlement shall be agreed to without the
other Partys prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed, except that the other Party shall not be obligated to
consent to any settlement which does not include a full release of such other
Party and its affiliates or which imposes an injunction or other equitable
relief after the Effective Time upon Parent or any of its affiliates. In the
event of, and to the extent of, any conflict or overlap between the provisions
of this  _Section 6.9_ and _Section 5.1_, _Section 5.2_ or _Section 6.2_,
the provisions of this _Section 6.9_ shall control.

under the Exchange Act, _provided_ that such delisting and termination shall
not be effective until after the Effective Time.

concurrently with, and as a condition to, such termination, the Company shall
pay or cause to be paid to Parent the Company Termination Fee.

modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as
closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the Merger is
fulfilled to the extent possible.

hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such action or proceeding in such
courts and (iv) waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, the defense
of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in
such courts. Each of the Parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any
such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other

exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by Law or equity upon such
Party, and the exercise by a Party of any one remedy will not preclude the
exercise of any other remedy.

Transactions and each Party hereby waives any objections to any remedy
referred to in this _Section 9.14_ (including any objection on the basis that
there is an adequate remedy at Law or that an award of such remedy is not an
appropriate remedy for any reason at Law or equity). For the avoidance of
doubt, each Party agrees that there is not an adequate remedy at Law for a
breach of this Agreement by any Party. In the event any Party seeks any remedy
referred to in this _Section 9.14_, such Party shall not be required to
obtain, furnish, post or provide any bond or other security in connection with
or as a condition to obtaining any such remedy.
