" and collectively, the " _Excluded Shares_ ") shall automatically be
cancelled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in
exchange therefor.

 



 

(b) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Each Share (other than Excluded

represent the right to receive, subject to _Sections 2.01(c)_ , _2.02(b)(v)
and 2.02(h)_:

 



 

(i) in the case of a Share with respect to which an election to receive Parent

Election RSU and Stock Election ESPP, a " _Stock Electing Share_ ", and

Parent (the " _Parent Common Stock_ ") equal to the Stock Election Exchange
Ratio (as adjusted pursuant to _Section 2.01(c)_, the " _Stock Election
Consideration_ ");

 



 

(ii) in the case of a Share with respect to which an election to receive cash

the " _Cash Election Consideration_ "); or

 



 

(iii) in the case of a Share with respect to which an election to receive a
mix of Parent Common Stock and cash (a " _Mixed Election_ ") has been properly
made and not revoked pursuant to _Section 2.02_, or with respect to which no
election has been made (each, and as applicable with each Mixed Election RSU
and Mixed Election ESPP a " _Mixed Consideration Share_ " and together with

Shares_ "), a number of Parent Common Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio and
$15.60 in cash, without interest (collectively, the " _Mixed Stock

Agreement, the Stock Election Consideration and the Cash Election
Consideration shall be subject to adjustment pursuant to this _Section
2.01(c)_:

 



 

(i) if the Cash Election Amount exceeds the Available Cash Election Amount,
then (x) all Stock Electing Shares shall be converted to the right to receive
the Stock Election Consideration, (y) all Mixed Consideration Shares shall be
converted into the right to receive the Mixed Election Consideration, and (z)
the following consideration shall be paid in respect of each Cash Electing
Share:

 



 

(A) an amount of cash equal to the quotient of (1) the Available Cash Election
Amount _divided by_ (2) the number of Cash Electing Shares; and

 



 

(B) a number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the quotient of (1) the
difference of the Available Stock Election Amount _less_ the Stock Election
Amount _divided by_ (2) the number of Cash Electing Shares; and

 



 

(ii) if the Available Cash Election Amount exceeds the Cash Election Amount,
then (x) all Cash Electing Shares shall be converted into the right to receive
the Cash Election Consideration, (y) all Mixed Consideration Shares shall be
converted into the right to receive the Mixed Election Consideration, and (z)
the following consideration shall be paid in respect of each Stock Electing
Share:

 



 

(A) an amount of cash equal to the quotient of (1) the difference of the
Available Cash Election Amount less the Cash Election Amount _divided by_ (2)
the number of Stock Electing Shares; and

 



 

(B) a number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the quotient of (1) the
Available Stock Election Amount _divided by_ (2) the number of Stock Electing
Shares.

 



 

For purposes of this Agreement,

 



 

" _Available Cash Election Amount_ " means (i) the product of $15.60
_multiplied by_ the number of total outstanding shares of Company Common Stock
as of the Effective Time (excluding the Excluded Shares, but including the
number of Dissenting Stockholder Shares, Net Option Shares, Participating RSUs
and the shares purchased by the Participating ESPP Holders), _minus_ (ii) the
aggregate amount of cash to be paid in respect of all Mixed Consideration
Shares (assuming that all Dissenting Stockholder Shares and all Net Option
Shares are Mixed Consideration Shares).

 



 

" _Available Stock Election Amount_ " means (i) the product of Exchange Ratio
_multiplied by_ the number of total outstanding shares of Company Common Stock
as of the Effective Time (excluding the Excluded Shares, but including the
number of Dissenting Stockholder Shares, Net Option Shares, Participating RSUs
and the shares purchased by the Participating ESPP Holders) _minus_ (ii) the
aggregate amount of Parent Common Stock to be paid in respect of all Mixed
Consideration Shares (assuming that all Dissenting Stockholder Shares and all
Net Option Shares are Mixed Consideration Shares).

 



     

 

 



 

" _Cash Election Amount_ " means the product of (i) the number of Cash
Electing Shares _multiplied by_ (ii) the Cash Election Consideration (before
giving effect to any adjustment pursuant to _Section 2.01(c)_).

 



 

" _Stock Election Amount_ " means the product of (i) the number of Stock
Electing Shares _multiplied by_ (ii) the Stock Election Consideration (before
giving effect to any adjustment pursuant to _Section 2.01(c)_).

 



 

(d) _Conversion of Merger Sub Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, each share
of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
and become one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of common
stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation and shall
constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving
Corporation.

 



 

(e) _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time which are held by a stockholder who
did not vote in favor of adoption of this Agreement (or consent thereto in
writing) and who (i) is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of
such shares pursuant to and (ii) complies in all respects with, the provisions
of Section 262 of the DGCL (the " _Dissenting Stockholder Shares_ ", and each
stockholder holding Dissenting Stockholder Shares, a " _Dissenting
Stockholder_ ") shall not be converted into or be exchangeable for the right
to receive the Merger Consideration, but instead such Dissenting Stockholder
shall be entitled to receive such consideration as may be determined to be due
to such Dissenting Stockholder pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL (and at the
Effective Time, such Dissenting Stockholder Shares shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and
such Dissenting Stockholder shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the rights set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL), unless and
until such Dissenting Stockholder shall have failed to perfect or shall have
effectively withdrawn or lost rights to appraisal under the DGCL. If any
Dissenting Stockholder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively
withdrawn or lost such right, such Dissenting Stockholders shares of Company
Common Stock shall thereupon be treated as if they had been converted into and
became exchangeable for the right to receive, as of the Effective Time, the
Mixed Election Consideration for each such share of Company Common Stock, in
accordance with _Section 2.01_ (so long as such Dissenting Stockholder shall
comply with the procedures in _Section 2.02_), without any interest thereon
and less any applicable withholding taxes. The Company shall give Parent (i)
prompt notice of any written demands for appraisal of any shares of Company
Common Stock, attempted withdrawals of such demands, notices and any other
instruments received by the Company relating to stockholders rights of
appraisal, in each case, prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) the opportunity
to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for
appraisal under the DGCL. The Company shall not, except with the prior written
consent of Parent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), make any payment with respect to any such demands for appraisal of
any shares or settle or offer to settle any such demands.

 



     

 

 



 

Section 2.02 _Payment for Securities; Surrender of Certificates_.

 



 

(a) _Paying Agent_. Promptly following the date hereof, Parent shall select
and engage a national recognized bank or trust company as paying agent (who is
reasonably acceptable to the Company) (the " _Paying Agent_ "). At or
immediately following the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause
to be deposited, with such Paying Agent, for the benefit of the holders of
Shares, (i) certificates representing the shares of Parent Common Stock to be
issued as Stock Consideration (or appropriate alternative arrangements shall
be made by Parent if uncertificated shares of Parent Common Stock will be
issued) and (ii) a cash amount in immediately available funds equal to the
aggregate Cash Consideration (the " _Exchange Fund_ "). For the avoidance of
doubt, the Exchange Fund deposited with the Paying Agent at or immediately
following the Effective Time shall include the portion of the Cash
Consideration and the shares of Parent Common Stock that would otherwise be
payable to the Dissenting Stockholders in respect of their Dissenting
Stockholder Shares.

 



 

(b) _Procedures for Surrender_.

 



 

(i) _Certificates_. Promptly after the Effective Time (but in no event later
than two Business Days after the Effective Time), Parent shall cause the
Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record (as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time) of a Certificate whose Shares were converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration at the Effective Time pursuant to this
Agreement: (A) a letter of transmittal in customary form, reasonably
acceptable to Parent and the Company (" _Letter of Transmittal_ "), which
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the
Paying Agent, and shall otherwise be in such form and have such other
provisions as Parent may reasonably specify after consultation with the
Company; and (B) instructions for effecting the surrender of the Certificates
in exchange for the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant
to the provisions of this _Article II_ (or affidavit of loss in lieu of such
Certificates as provided in _Section 2.02(g)_). Upon surrender of
Certificates for cancellation (or delivery of an affidavit of loss in lieu of
such Certificates as provided in _Section 2.02(g)_) to the Paying Agent, and
upon delivery of a Letter of Transmittal, duly executed and in proper form
with respect to such Certificates, and such other documents as may reasonably
be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificates shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor (x) the Merger Consideration into
which such shares of Company Common Stock have been converted pursuant to
_Section 2.01_ (subject to the Election with respect to such shares of
Company Common Stock and after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings
as provided in _Section 2.02(f)_) and (y) any cash in lieu of fractional
shares that the holder has the right to receive pursuant to _Section
2.02(b)(v)_ (the " _Fractional Share Consideration_ "). Any surrendered
Certificate shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued
on any amount payable upon due surrender of the Certificates. Until
surrendered as contemplated hereby, each Certificate shall be deemed at any
time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the
Merger Consideration and the Fractional Share Consideration, as applicable, as
contemplated by this Agreement, except for Certificates representing
Dissenting Stockholder Shares, which shall represent the right to receive
payment of the fair value of such Shares in accordance with and to the extent
provided by Section 262 of the DGCL.

 



     

 

 



 

(ii) _Book-Entry Shares_. Any holder of Book-Entry Shares whose Shares were
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration at the Effective
Time pursuant to this Agreement shall not be required to deliver a Certificate
or an executed Letter of Transmittal to the Paying Agent to receive the Merger
Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to this
Agreement. In lieu thereof, each such holder shall, upon receipt by the Paying
Agent of an "agents message" (or such other evidence, if any, of surrender as
the Paying Agent may reasonably request) be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor (x) the Merger Consideration into which such shares of Company Common
Stock have been converted pursuant to _Section 2.01(b)_ (subject to the
Election with respect to such shares of Company Common Stock and after giving
effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in _Section 2.02(f)_) and
(y) the Fractional Share Consideration. No interest will be paid or accrued on
any amount payable upon due surrender of Book-Entry Shares. Until paid or
surrendered as contemplated hereby, each Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at
any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the
Merger Consideration and the Fractional Share Consideration, as applicable, as
contemplated by this Agreement, except for Book-Entry Shares representing
Dissenting Stockholder Shares, which shall be deemed to represent the right to
receive payment in accordance with and to the extent provided by Section 262
of the DGCL.

 



 

(iii) _Transfer of Shares_. If payment of the Merger Consideration or the
Fractional Share Consideration is to be made to a person other than the person
in whose name any surrendered Certificate or a transferred Book-Entry Share is
registered, it shall be a condition precedent of such payment that (i) the
Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in
proper form for transfer or the Book-Entry Share shall have been properly
transferred, and (ii) the person requesting such payment shall have paid any
transfer and other similar Taxes required by reason of the payment of the
Merger Consideration and the Fractional Share Consideration, as applicable, to
a person other than the registered holder of the Certificate or Book-Entry
Share so surrendered and shall have established to the satisfaction of the
that such Taxes either have been paid or are not required to be paid.

 



 

(iv) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares of Parent Common
Stock_. No dividends or other distributions declared or made after the
Effective Time with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock with a record
date after the Effective Time will be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
Certificate or Book-Entry Share with respect to the shares of Parent Common
Stock represented thereby, and no cash payment in lieu of any fractional
shares will be paid to any such holder, until the holder of such Certificate
or Book-Entry Share surrenders such Certificate or Book-Entry Share. Subject
to the effect of escheat, Tax or other applicable laws, following surrender of
any such Certificate or Book-Entry Share, the holder of the Certificate or
Book-Entry Share representing whole shares of Parent Common Stock issued in
exchange therefor will be paid, without interest, (i) promptly, the amount of
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
and theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock
and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other
distributions, with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to
surrender and a payment date occurring after surrender, payable with respect
to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock.

 



     

 

 



 

(v) _No Fractional Shares_. No fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall
be issued in the Merger, but in lieu thereof each former holder of Shares
otherwise entitled to a fractional share of Parent Common Stock (after
aggregating all fractional shares of Parent Common Stock issuable to such
holder) will be entitled to receive, from the Paying Agent in accordance with
the provisions of this _Section 2.02(b)(v)_, a cash payment (rounded to the
nearest whole cent) in lieu of such fractional share of Parent Common Stock in
an amount equal to the product of (i) such fraction, multiplied by (ii) the
volume weighted average trading price of Parent Common Stock on the National
Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations exchange (" _NASDAQ_ ")
for the five (5) consecutive trading days ending on the trading day
immediately preceding the Closing Date.

 



 

(vi) _Election_. Each holder of record of Shares (not including the Excluded
Shares or the Dissenting Stockholder Shares, but including holders of
Participating RSUs and Participating ESPP Holders (each, a " _Holder_ ") shall
have the right, subject to the limitations set forth in this _Article II_, to
submit an Election in accordance with this _Section 2.02(b)(vi)_ on or prior
to the Election Deadline. The Company shall not waive the Election Deadline
unless such Election Deadline is waived with respect to all Holders, the new
election deadline is publicly disclosed by the Company to all Holders on a
date agreed to by Parent, and Parent has otherwise given its prior written
consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) to such
waiver. " _Election Deadline_ " means 5:00 p.m. New York time on the date
which the parties shall agree is as near as practicable to two (2) Business
Days preceding the Closing Date. The parties shall cooperate to issue a press
release reasonably satisfactory to each of them announcing the date of the
Election Deadline not more than fifteen (15) Business Days before, and at
least five (5) Business Days prior to, the Election Deadline.

 



 

(A) Each Holder may specify in a request made in accordance with the
provisions of this _Section 2.02(b)(vi)_ (an " _Election_ ") whether such
Holder desires to make a (i) Mixed Election, (ii) Cash Election, or (iii)
Stock Election, in each case with respect to all the Shares held by such
Holder (including with respect to Participating RSUs and Company ESPP Rights).
For the avoidance of doubt, an Election made by any Holder shall apply to all
the Shares (including with respect to Participating RSUs and Company ESPP
Rights) held by such Holder. If any Holder attempts to apply an Election to
only a portion of such Holders Shares (including with respect to
Participating RSUs and Company ESPP Rights), the portion of such Holders
Shares (including with respect to Participating RSUs and Company ESPP Rights)
with respect to which Holder did not attempt to make an Election shall be
treated as if such Holder made a Mixed Election.

 



 

(B) Parent shall prepare a form of election that is reasonably acceptable to
the Company (the " _Form of Election_"), which shall include the transmittal
materials contemplated by _Section 2.02(b)_ and Parent shall mail, or shall
cause the Paying Agent to mail and deliver, together with the Joint Proxy
Statement, the Form of Election to Holders as of the record date for notice of
the Company Special Meeting not less than twenty (20) Business Days prior to
the anticipated Election Deadline (the period between such mailing and the
Election Deadline, the " _Election_

 



     

 

 



 

 _Period_ "). Parent shall make available one or more Forms of Election as may
reasonably be requested from time to time by all persons who become Holders
during the period following the record date for the Company Special Meeting
and prior to the Election Deadline.

 



 

(C) Any Election shall have been made properly only if the Paying Agent shall
have received, by the Election Deadline, (i) a Form of Election properly
completed and signed and (ii) the properly completed and executed documents
required to be delivered by such Holder pursuant to the other provisions of
this _Section 2.02_. Any Holder (including with respect to Participating RSUs
and the Company ESPP Rights) that does not make a valid Election by the
Election Deadline shall be deemed to have made a Mixed Election.

 



 

(D) Any Holder may, at any time during the Election Period, revoke his or her
or its Election by written notice to the Paying Agent prior to the Election
Deadline, together with a properly completed and signed revised Form of
Election. Any subsequent transfer of such Holders Shares (including with
respect to Participating RSUs and Company ESPP Rights) after such Holder has
made an Election shall automatically revoke such Election (and such subsequent
transferee may make a new Election pursuant to and if permitted by the terms
of this _Section 2.02(b)(vi)_). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, all Elections shall be automatically deemed revoked upon
receipt by the Paying Agent of written notification from the Company or Parent
that this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with _Article VII_. The
Paying Agent shall have reasonable discretion to determine if any Election is
not properly made, changed or revoked with respect to any Shares, including
with respect to Participating RSUs and Company ESPP Rights (none of the
Company, Parent, Merger Sub or the Paying Agent being under any duty to notify
any Holder of any applicable defect). In the event the Paying Agent makes a
reasonable determination that an Election was not properly made (including as
a result of the Paying Agent not receiving an Election by the Election
Deadline), such Election shall be deemed to be ineffective, and the Shares
covered by such Election shall, for purposes hereof, be deemed to be Mixed
Consideration Shares.

 



 

(c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock; Closing of Transfer
Books_. As of the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company
shall be closed, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on
the stock transfer books of the Company of the Shares that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than registrations of transfers
to reflect, with customary settlement procedures, trades effected prior to the
Effective Time. The Merger Consideration paid in accordance with the terms of
this _Article II_ upon surrender of any Shares shall be deemed to have been
paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Shares. From and
after the Effective Time, the holders of Shares outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such
Shares except as otherwise provided for herein or by applicable law. If, after
the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the
Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent for any reason, they shall
be cancelled and, subject to the procedures set forth in _Section 2.02(b)_,
exchanged as provided in this _Article II_, except as otherwise required by
law.

 



      

 

 



 

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund; Abandoned Property_. Any portion of the
Exchange Fund (including any interest or other income received by the Paying
Agent with respect to all of the funds made available to it) that remains
undistributed to the holders of the Shares for one (1) year after the
Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation, upon demand,
and any holders of the Shares who have not theretofore complied with this
_Article II_ shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation as
general creditor thereof (subject to abandoned property, escheat and other
similar laws) for payment of their claim for Merger Consideration.

 



 

(e) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in _Section
2.02(d)_, none of Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, or the Paying
Agent or any of their respective directors, officers, employees and agents
shall be liable to any holder of a Share for Merger Consideration delivered to
a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar law. If any Certificate (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as
provided in _Section 2.02(g)_) shall not have been surrendered prior to the
date on which the Merger Consideration represented by such Certificate would
otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Authority, any
such Merger Consideration shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law,
become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims
or interest of any person previously entitled thereto.

 



 

(f) _Withholding Rights_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
each of Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent, as
applicable, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration
payable pursuant to, or in accordance with, this Agreement to any person such
amounts as Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, or the Paying Agent,
as applicable, are required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making
of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "
_Code_ ") or any other provision of applicable federal, state, local or
foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld by
Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, or the Paying Agent, as the
case may be, such deducted and withheld amounts shall be (i) remitted by
Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, or the Paying Agent, as
applicable, to the applicable Governmental Authority, and (ii) treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the person in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, Merger Sub, the
Surviving Corporation, or the Paying Agent, as the case may be.

 



 

(g) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact
by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and,
if required by Parent, the posting by such person of a bond in such reasonable
amount as Parent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Certificate, the
Paying Agent shall issue, or pay or cause to be paid, in exchange for such
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration and any cash
in lieu of fractional shares and any dividends and distributions on such
Certificate, in each case deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this
Agreement.

 



 

(h) _Adjustments to Merger Consideration_. In the event that the Company or
Parent changes the number of shares of Company Common Stock, Parent Common
Stock, shares of capital stock of the Company, shares of capital stock of
Parent or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for
shares of Company Common Stock, Parent Common Stock, shares of capital stock
of the Company or shares of capital stock of Parent, as applicable, issued

 



     

 

 



 

and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a result of a reclassification,
stock split (including a reverse stock split), stock dividend or distribution,
subdivision, exchange or readjustment of shares, or other similar transaction,
then any number or amount contained herein which is based upon the price of
Parent Common Stock, or the number of shares of Parent Common Stock or Company
Common Stock, as the case may be, the Stock Consideration, the Cash
Consideration, the Mixed Election Consideration and any other similarly
dependent items shall be equitably adjusted to reflect such change; _provided_
, _however_ , that nothing in this _Section 2.02(h)_ shall be deemed to
permit or authorize any party hereto to effect any such change that it is not
otherwise authorized or permitted to undertake pursuant to this Agreement.

 



 

Section 2.03 _Treatment of Company Employee Stock Plans_. The Company will
adopt resolutions, provide all required notices and take such other actions as
are necessary to effect the following:

 



 

(a) _Effect on Company Stock Options_. At the Effective Time, each Company
Stock Option (or portion thereof) that is outstanding and unexercised as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time (whether vested or unvested) shall
without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the
holder thereof, other than the Company delivering any notices required
pursuant to the terms of the Company Employee Stock Plan, be cancelled and
terminated and shall be converted into a right to receive an amount of Mixed
Election Consideration that would be payable with respect to the Net Option
Shares underlying such Company Stock Option no later than the Companys next
payroll date immediately following the Closing Date (the " _Option Payment_
"). The payment of the Option Payment to the holder of a Company Stock Option
shall be reduced by any applicable Tax withholding; provided that the
applicable Taxes required to be withheld from the Option Payment (i) shall
reduce first the cash portion of the Option Payment, with any remaining amount
reducing the stock portion of the Option Payment and with the value of any
reduction of the stock portion for purposes of such deduction to be determined
based on the Equity Award Measurement Price, and (ii) shall be promptly
remitted by the Company in cash to the applicable Governmental Authority. At
or immediately following the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall
cause to be deposited, with the Company, for the benefit of the holders of
Company Stock Options, the cash portion of the total Mixed Election
Consideration payable with respect to the holders of the Company Stock Options
in immediately available funds to be paid through the Companys payroll
systems. For the avoidance of doubt, each outstanding Company Stock Option
with an exercise price per share that is in excess of the Cash Election
Consideration shall be cancelled and extinguished at the Effective Time
without any present or future right to receive any portion of the Merger
Consideration or any other payment. For purposes hereof, " _Net Option Shares_
" means, with respect to a Company Stock Option, the quotient of (i) the
product of (A) the excess, if any, of the Cash Election Consideration over the
exercise price per share of such Company Stock Option _multiplied by_ (B) the
number of Shares subject to such Company Stock Option, _divided by_ (ii) the
Cash Election Consideration.

 



 

(b) _Effect on Company Restricted Stock Units_.

 



 

(i) As of the Effective Time, each Company Restricted Stock Unit (or portion
thereof) that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and
subject to a performance-based vesting condition that relates solely to the
value of the Company

 



     

 

 



 

Common Stock shall, to the extent such Company Restricted Stock Unit vests in
accordance with its terms in connection with the Merger (the " _Participating
RSUs_ "), be cancelled and extinguished and converted into the right to
receive the Cash Election Consideration, the Stock Election Consideration or
the Mixed Election Consideration in accordance with the Election made by the
holder of such Participating RSUs in accordance with Section 2.02(b)(vi) (with
payment to be effected pursuant to _Section 2.01)_, subject to the applicable
tax withholdings and subject to the provisions of Section 2.01(c) (as
applicable, the " _Cash Election RSUs_ ", the " _Stock Election RSUs_ " or the
" _Mixed Election RSUs_ "). Any then-outstanding Company Restricted Stock Unit
that is subject to a performance-based vesting condition that relates solely
to the value of the Company Common Stock and is not vested after giving effect
to the foregoing vesting determination will be cancelled and extinguished at
the Effective Time without any present or future right to receive any portion
of the Merger Consideration or any other payment.

 



 

(ii) At the Effective Time, each Company Restricted Stock Unit (or portion
thereof) that is outstanding and unvested immediately prior to the Effective
Time (and does not vest as a result of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby) and is either (x) subject to time-based vesting
requirements only or (y) subject to a performance-based vesting condition
other than the value of the Company Common Stock (including any other long-
term incentive award subject to such performance-based vesting, whether
denominated in dollars or shares) shall, by virtue of the Merger, be assumed
by Parent (each, an " _Assumed RSU_ "). Each such Assumed RSU shall be subject
to substantially the same terms and conditions as applied to the related
Company Restricted Stock Unit immediately prior to the Effective Time,
including the vesting schedule (and the applicable performance-vesting
conditions in the case of a grant contemplated by clause (y) of the preceding
sentence) and any provisions for accelerated vesting applicable thereto,
except that the number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to each
Assumed RSU shall be equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock underlying such unvested Company Restricted Stock Unit
award as of immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (ii) Equity
Award Exchange Ratio (with the resulting number, rounded down to the nearest
whole share). As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall
deliver to each holder of a Company Restricted Stock Unit that is assumed by
Parent pursuant to this _Section 2.03(b)(ii)_ appropriate notices setting
forth the number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to each Assumed RSU
then held by such holder.

 



 

(c) _Effect on ESPP_. As soon as practicable following the date of this
Agreement, the Company shall take such action as may be necessary to: (i)
cause any offering period (or similar period during which shares may be
purchased) underway as of the date hereof under the Company ESPP to be the
final offering period under the Company ESPP, such that no new offering period
will commence under the Company ESPP after the date hereof, and the current
offering period underway shall be terminated no later than the Business Day
immediately preceding the anticipated Closing Date (the " _Final Exercise
Date_ "), (ii) make any pro-rata adjustments that may be necessary to reflect
the shortened offering period (or similar period), but otherwise treat such
shortened offering period (or similar period) as a fully effective and
completed offering period for all purposes under the Company ESPP, (iii) cause
each participants outstanding purchase right under the Company ESPP (the "
_Company ESPP Rights_ ") to be exercised as of the Final Exercise

 



     

 

 



 

Date, (iv) provide that no new participants enroll in the Company ESPP after
the date hereof and that no current participant in the Company ESPP can
increase his or her payroll deductions from those in effect on the date
hereof, and (v) terminate the Company ESPP as of the Effective Time. On the
Final Exercise Date, the funds credited as of such date under the Company ESPP
within the associated accumulated payroll withholding account for each
participant under the Company ESPP shall be used to purchase shares of Company
Common Stock in accordance with the terms of the Company ESPP, and each share
purchased thereunder immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
cancelled at the Effective Time and converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration in accordance with _Section 2.01(b)_. Any accumulated
contributions of each participant under the Company ESPP as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall, to the extent not used to purchase shares
in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Company ESPP (as amended
pursuant to this _Section 2.03(c)_), be refunded to such participant as
promptly as practicable following the Effective Time (without interest). No
further Company ESPP Rights shall be granted or exercised under the Company
ESPP after the Final Exercise Date. The Company shall provide timely notice to
participants of the setting of the Final Exercise Date and termination of the
Company ESPP in accordance with the Company ESPP. Each participant in the
Company ESPP who purchases shares thereunder on the Final Exercise Date (the "
_Participating ESPP Holders_ ") shall have the right to elect to receive their
Merger Consideration in the form of the Cash Election Consideration, the Stock
Election Consideration or the Mixed Election Consideration in accordance with
the Election made by such participant in accordance with _Section
2.02(b)(vi)_, subject to the provisions of _Section 2.01(c)_ (as applicable,
the " _Cash Election ESPPs_ ", the " _Stock Election ESPPs_ " or the " _Mixed
Election ESPPs_ ").

 



 

(d) _Form S-8_. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time (but in no
event later than 15 Business Days following the Effective Time), Parent shall
cause to be filed with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any
successor form), if available for use by Parent, relating to the shares of
Parent Common Stock issuable with respect to the Assumed RSUs eligible for
registration on Form S-8 and shall use all reasonable efforts to maintain the
effectiveness of such registration statement (and maintain the current status
of the prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for so long as the
Assumed RSUs remain outstanding.

that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably
be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Each of the Companys
subsidiaries is duly qualified, licensed or admitted to do business and is in
good standing (with respect to jurisdictions that recognize the concept of

voting of or the right to participate in dividends or other earnings on any
capital stock, membership interests, partnership interests, voting securities
or other ownership interests of the Company or any subsidiary of the Company.

consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, subject
to any regulatory approvals referenced in _Section 3.01(d)(ii)_ and subject

the terms of this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby are fair to and in the best interests of the Company and

other anti-takeover provision set forth in the Companys certificate of
incorporation or its bylaws, the " _Takeover Provisions_ ") applicable to a
"business combination" (as defined in such Section 203 of the DGCL) not to
apply to the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement, and the
consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Subject to _Section 4.03_, the Company hereby consents to the
inclusion of a description of the Company Board Recommendation in the Joint
Proxy Statement.

 



 

(d) _No Conflicts; Approvals and Consents_.

 



 

(i) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company do not, and
the performance by the Company of its obligations hereunder and the
consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby will
not, conflict with, result in a violation of, breach of, constitute (with or
without notice or lapse of time or both) a default under, result in or give to
any person any right of any material payment or material reimbursement,
termination, cancellation, modification or acceleration of, or result in the

directly held or available for use by Parent and its subsidiaries, including
cash on hand at the Company on or after the Closing Date (whether directly
held or available for use by the Company and its subsidiaries), in the
aggregate, shall provide Parent and Merger Sub with cash proceeds on the
Closing Date sufficient for the satisfaction of all of Parents and Merger
Subs payment obligations under this Agreement, including the payment of any
amounts required to be paid pursuant to _Article II_, any fees and expenses
of or payable by Parent, Merger Sub, or the Surviving Corporation in
connection with the Merger and the Debt Financing and any indebtedness
required to be repaid, redeemed, retired, cancelled, terminated or otherwise
satisfied in connection with

 



     

 

 



 

the Merger (including all indebtedness of the Company required to be repaid,
redeemed, retired, cancelled, terminated or otherwise satisfied in connection
with the Merger). Parent acknowledges that its obligations under this
Agreement are not conditioned upon or subject to its receipt of the proceeds
made available under the Debt Financing Commitment or any other financing
(such obligations being subject only to the satisfaction of the conditions set
forth in _Sections 6.01_ and _6.03)_.

 



 

(iii) As of the date of this Agreement, the Debt Financing Commitment is in
full force and effect and constitutes the valid and binding obligation of
Parent and, to the knowledge of Parent, each other party thereto, enforceable
in accordance with their terms against Parent and, to the knowledge of Parent,
each other party thereto (except as such enforcement may be subject to
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar
laws, now or hereafter in effect, relating to creditors rights generally, and
general equitable principles). As of the date hereof, (A) neither the Debt
Financing Commitment nor the Fee Letter has been modified, amended or
otherwise altered (and no such modification, amendment or alteration is
contemplated by Parent or, to the knowledge of Parent, any other party thereto
except as may be contemplated to add lenders, lend arrangers or similar
entities that have not executed the Debt Financing Commitment as of the date
hereof), (B) no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of
time or both, would constitute a default or breach on the part of Parent under
any term or condition of the Debt Financing Commitment, and (C) none of the
respective commitments under any of the Debt Financing Commitment have been
withdrawn, terminated or rescinded (and no such withdrawal, termination or
rescission is contemplated by Parent or, to the knowledge of Parent, any other
party thereto). As of the date of this Agreement and assuming the accuracy of
the representations and warranties made by the Company in _Section 3.01_,
Parent (x) is not aware of any fact or occurrence that makes any of the
representations or warranties of Parent in the Debt Financing Commitment
inaccurate in any material respect, (y) has no reason to believe that it will
be unable to satisfy on a timely basis any term or condition of closing to be
satisfied by it or its subsidiaries in the Debt Financing Commitment, and (z)
has no reason to believe that any portion of the Debt Financing will not be
made available to Parent on the Closing Date. As of the date of this
Agreement, Parent has fully paid any and all commitment fees or other fees
required by the Debt Financing Commitment to be paid by it on or prior to the
date of this Agreement, and Parent will in the future pay any such fees as
they become due.

 



 

(iv) Assuming (i) satisfaction of the conditions to Parents obligation to
consummate the Merger and (ii) the payment of the aggregate Merger
Consideration payable to the holders of Company Common Stock and equity awards
pursuant to _Article II_, payment of all amounts required to be paid in
connection with the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby, and payment of all related fees and expenses, Parent and
its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis will be Solvent as of the Effective
Time, and, in each case, immediately after the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby. For the purposes of this Agreement, the term
" _Solvent_ " when used with respect to any person, means that, as of any date
of determination (a) the amount of the "fair saleable value" of the assets of
such person will, as of such date, exceed (i) the value of all "liabilities of
such person, including contingent and other liabilities," as of such date, as
such quoted terms are generally determined in accordance with applicable laws

 



     

 

 



 

governing determinations of the insolvency of debtors, and (ii) the amount
that will be required to pay the probable liabilities of such person on its
existing debts (including contingent and other liabilities) as such debts
become absolute and mature, (b) such person will not have, as of such date, an
unreasonably small amount of capital for the operation of the businesses in
which it is engaged or proposed to be engaged following such date, and (c)
such person will be able to pay its liabilities, including contingent and
other liabilities, as they mature. For purposes of this definition of
"Solvent", "not have an unreasonably small amount of capital for the operation
of the businesses in which it is engaged or proposed to be engaged" and "able
to pay its liabilities, including contingent and other liabilities, as they
mature" means that such person will be able to generate enough cash from
operations, asset dispositions or refinancing, or a combination thereof, to
meet its obligations as they become due.

 



 

(k) _Ownership of Merger Sub; No Prior Activities_. Merger Sub was formed
solely for the purpose of engaging in the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and activities incidental thereto. All of the outstanding capital
stock of Merger Subs, and at the Effective Time, will be owned directly or
indirectly by Parent. Except for obligations or liabilities incurred in
connection with its incorporation and as contemplated by this Agreement,
Merger Sub has not, and prior to the Effective Time will not have, incurred,
directly or indirectly through any subsidiary or affiliate, any obligations or
liabilities or engaged in any business activities of any type or kind
whatsoever or entered into any agreements or arrangements with any person.

 



 

(l) _Brokers_. As of the date hereof, except for any such fees payable to Bank
of America, N.A., none of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective
stockholders, members, directors, officers, employees or affiliates, has
incurred or will incur on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub, any brokerage,
finders, advisory or similar fee in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

(m) _Ownership of Company Capital Stock_. None of Parent, Merger Sub, or any
of their subsidiaries own (as defined in Section 203 of the DGCL) or
beneficially owns (within the meaning of Section 13 of the Exchange Act and
the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder), or will prior to the
Closing Date own or beneficially own, any shares of Company Common Stock or
other securities of the Company or any options, warrants, or other rights to
acquire Company Common Stock or other securities of the Company, or any other
economic interest (through derivative securities or otherwise) in the Company,
or is a party, or will prior to the Closing Date become a party, to any
Contract, arrangement or understanding (other than this Agreement) for the
purpose of acquiring, holding, voting or disposing of any shares of Company
Common Stock. Neither Parent, Merger Sub, nor any of their respective
"affiliates" or "associates" (each as defined in Section 203 of the DGCL) is,
or has been at any time within the last three (3) years, an "interested
stockholder" as defined in Section 203 of the DGCL. Neither Parent nor any of
its subsidiaries has taken, nor authorized or permitted any of its
Representatives to take, any action that would cause Parent or any of its
"affiliates" or "associates" (each as defined in Section 203 of the DGCL)
thereof to be deemed an "interested stockholder" as defined in Section 203 of
the DGCL or otherwise render Section 251 of the DGCL inapplicable to the
Merger.

Notice_ "), which notice shall include the most current Proposal Information

or type of consideration thereof) shall require a new Recommendation Change
Notice, except that the Recommendation Change Notice Period shall be reduced

have discussed and negotiated in good faith with Parent and its

such Company Takeover Proposal would continue to constitute a Company Superior
Proposal (assuming the adjustments or modifications to the terms of this
Agreement proposed in writing by Parent in a manner capable of being accepted
by the Company as a binding contract were to be given effect) and (2) that the
failure to take such action would reasonably be likely to constitute a breach
of its fiduciary duties under applicable law.

the Companys stockholders, in their capacities as such, than the Merger from
a financial point of view, taking into account all relevant financial, legal,
regulatory, financing, certainty and timing of consummation aspects of such
Company Takeover Proposal (including any changes to the financial or other
terms of this Agreement or the Merger proposed in writing by Parent in a
manner capable of being accepted by the Company as a binding contract as a
binding contract), except that all of the references to "25%" and "75%" in the

Recommendation Change Notice Period that the Company Board intends to take
such action (an " _Company Intervening Event Recommendation Change Notice_ "),

Event (it being understood that (x) such Company Intervening Event
Recommendation Change Notice and any amendment or update to such notice and
the determination to so deliver such notice shall not

 



     

 

 



 

constitute a Company Change of Recommendation for purposes of this Agreement
and (y) any material change to the status of the Company Intervening Event
shall require a new Company Intervening Event Recommendation Change Notice,
except that the Recommendation Change Notice Period shall be reduced to two
(2) Business Days after the initial Recommendation Change Notice Period), (D)
during the Recommendation Change Notice Period, the Company shall have
discussed and negotiated in good faith with Parent and its Representatives, if

shall prohibit the Company or the Company Board, directly or indirectly,
including through its Representatives, from (i) disclosing to the Companys
stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9
promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) making any disclosure to its
stockholders if the Company Board has determined, after consultation with
outside legal counsel, that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with
applicable law; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the case of the foregoing
clauses (i) or (ii) of this _Section 4.03(g)_, any such action taken or
statement made that contains a Company Change of Recommendation shall be
subject to the provisions of this _Section 4.03_ (it being understood,
however, that the disclosure of a "stop, look and listen" notice of the type
contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act in and of
itself shall not be deemed a Company Change of Recommendation).

 



 

Section 4.04 _Other Actions_. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in
this Agreement, including _Section 5.03_, (and provided that Parents
obligations to arrange and obtain, and the Companys obligations to cooperate
with Parent arranging and obtaining, the Debt Financing shall be governed

other and use (and shall cause their respective subsidiaries to use) their
respective reasonable best efforts to take or cause to be

Section 4.05 _Financing_.

 



 

(a) _Efforts to Obtain the Financing_. Although the parties hereto acknowledge
and agree that obtaining the Debt Financing is not a condition to Closing,
prior to Closing, each of Parent and Merger Sub shall use its, and shall cause
their respective subsidiaries to use their, reasonable best efforts to (i)
take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all
things reasonably necessary to arrange, obtain and consummate the Debt
Financing described in the Debt Financing Commitment on the terms and
conditions described therein, (ii) maintain in full force and effect the Debt
Financing Commitment until the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby and to materially comply with its obligations thereunder, (iii)
negotiate and enter into definitive agreements with respect to, and including
as contemplated in, the Debt Financing Commitment on the terms and conditions
(including the flex provisions, if applicable) contained in the Debt Financing
Commitment and Fee Letter or, if available, on other terms that are, in the
aggregate, not materially less favorable to Parent than the terms and
conditions contained in the Debt Financing Commitment and in any event do not
contain Prohibited Terms, (iv) to satisfy (or, if deemed advisable by Parent,
in its sole discretion, seek a waiver of) on a timely basis all conditions to
funding in the Debt Financing Commitment (other than any condition where the
failure to be so satisfied is a direct result of the Companys failure to
furnish information required to be furnished pursuant to _Section 4.05(b)_),
(v) comply with its and their obligations under the Debt Financing Commitment
in all material respects, not take or fail to take any action that would
result in a failure of any of the conditions in the Debt Financing Commitment
or in any definitive agreement related to the Debt Financing prevent or impede
or delay or make less likely the availability of the Debt Financing, (vi) to
fully pay, or cause to be fully paid, all commitment or other fees arising
pursuant to the Debt Financing Commitment as and when they become due, and
(vii) if all conditions to the Debt Financing Commitment have been satisfied,
draw the full amount of the Debt Financing and cause the Debt Financing
Parties to fund the Debt Financing required to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby upon the terms set forth therein on the Closing Date.
Parent shall not agree to any amendments or modifications to, or grant any
waivers of, any condition or other provision under the Debt Financing
Commitment without the prior written consent of the Company to the extent such
amendments, modifications or waivers would (A) reduce the aggregate amount of
cash proceeds available from the Debt Financing such that such cash proceeds,
together with the financial resources of Parent and its affiliates including
cash on hand and the proceeds of loans under existing credit facilities of
Parent or its subsidiaries on the Closing Date, in the aggregate, are
insufficient to fund the amounts required to be paid by Parent or Merger Sub
under this Agreement and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (B) impose new or additional conditions or amend, modify or expand
existing conditions precedent as

 



     

 

 



 

compared to those in the Debt Financing Commitment and Fee Letter as in effect
on the date hereof in each case in a manner that would materially delay or
prevent the funding of the Debt Financing, (C) adversely affect the ability of
Parent to enforce its rights against other parties to the Debt Financing
Commitment, Fee Letter or the definitive documentation governing the Debt
Financing as so amended, replaced, supplemented or otherwise modified,
relative to the ability of Parent to enforce its rights against such other
parties to the Debt Financing Commitment and Fee Letter as in effect on the
date hereof, (D) otherwise prevent, or materially impede, impair or delay the
Closing, or (E) affect Parents ability to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement on the terms contemplated by this Agreement
(the terms described in (A)-(E), collectively, the " _Prohibited Terms_ ");
_provided_ , that for the avoidance of doubt, nothing herein shall prohibit
other amendments, including those to replace or amend the Debt Financing
Commitment to add or replace lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication
agents or similar entities that have not executed the Debt Financing
Commitment as of the date hereof. Parent shall promptly provide the Company
with copies of all executed amendments, modifications or replacements of the
Debt Financing Commitment or definitive agreements related to the Debt
Financing. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent or Merger
Sub shall give the Company prompt notice of the receipt of any written notice
or other written communication from any Debt Financing Party with respect to
any (x) actual or alleged in writing material breach or default, termination
or repudiation by any party to any of the Debt Financing Commitment or any
definitive document related to the Debt Financing or any provisions of the
Debt Financing Commitment or any definitive document related to the Debt
Financing, or (y) of any termination, expiration, or waiver, amendment or
other modification of the Debt Financing Commitment. If any portion of the
Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitment become
unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated thereby (including flex
provisions, if applicable), and such portion is required to fund any portion
of the aggregate Cash Consideration and any fees, expenses and other amounts
contemplated to be paid by Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or
the pursuant to this Agreement (taking into account the cash on hand and other
proceeds available to Parent and its subsidiaries), Parent and Merger Sub
shall use their reasonable best efforts to arrange and obtain in replacement
thereof alternative financing from alternative sources in an amount sufficient
to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement on terms that do
not contain any Prohibited Terms, it being understood that if Parent proceeds
with any alternative financing, Parent will be subject to the same obligations
with respect to such alternative financing as set forth in this Agreement with
respect to the Debt Financing; provided, however that if the Company is then
currently seeking specific performance or injunctive relief pursuant to
_Section 8.11_ to cause the consummation of the Merger, the restriction on
including Prohibited Terms in such alternative financing at such time shall
not apply. Parent will deliver to the Company true, correct and complete
copies of all agreements pursuant to which any source has committed to provide
such alternative financing. Any reference in this Agreement to (1) the "Debt
Financing" shall include any such alternative financing, (2) the " _Debt
Financing Commitment_ " shall include the commitment letter (including any
related exhibits, schedules, annexes, supplements and other related documents)
and the corresponding fee letter with respect to any such alternative
financing, and (3) the " _Debt Financing Parties_ " shall include the
financing institutions contemplated to provide any such alternative financing.
The Company acknowledges that the covenants and obligations contained in this
_Section 4.05_ and the Debt Financing Commitment are the sole and exclusive
covenants and obligations of Parent and its subsidiaries and each of their
respective Representatives in connection with obtaining the Debt Financing;

 



     

 

 



 

 _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent and Merger Sub expressly acknowledge and
agree that Parents and Merger Subs obligations to hold the Closing and
consummate the Merger (including pursuant to _Section 1.02_ and _Section
1.03_) shall not in any way be conditioned upon whether the Debt Financing is
available or has been obtained and failure to obtain all or any portion of the
Debt Financing (or any alternative financing) will not in and of itself
relieve or alter Parents obligations to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement upon the terms set forth in the Transaction
Documents.

 



 

(b) _Financing Cooperation_. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall use
reasonable best efforts to provide to Parent and Merger Sub, and shall cause
each of its subsidiaries to use its reasonable best efforts to provide, and
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its Representatives, including
legal and accounting advisors, to provide all cooperation reasonably requested
by Parent and Merger Sub that is reasonably necessary in connection with
arranging, obtaining and syndicating the Debt Financing and causing the
conditions in the Debt Financing Commitment to be satisfied ( _provided_ that
such requested cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing
operations of the Company or its subsidiaries), which cooperation will
include:

 



 

(i) assisting with the preparation of Offering Documents, registration
statements, confidential information memoranda and similar documents required
in connection with the Debt Financing;

 



 

(ii) furnishing to Parent and the Debt Financing Parties as promptly within 40

each fiscal year, within its audited consolidated balance sheet as of such
year and related audited statements of income and cash flows, and as promptly

between such senior management of the Company and its subsidiaries and the

(iv) assisting Parent in obtaining any corporate credit and family ratings
from any ratings agencies contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitment,

from the Companys independent auditors with respect to the Required
Information;

 



     

 

 



 

(vi) assisting in the preparation of, and executing and delivering, definitive
financing documents, including guarantee and collateral documents, schedules

Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001, as
amended at least five (5) Business Days prior to Closing; cooperating with
Parent, and taking all corporate actions, subject to the occurrence of the
Closing to the extent requested by the Debt Financing Parties at least eight
(8) Business Days prior to the Closing, reasonably requested by Parent to
permit the consummation of the Debt Financing;

 



 

(xi) cooperating with Parent to obtain legal opinions, such surveys and title
insurance as reasonably requested by Parent or any of the Debt Financing
Parties in connection with the Debt Financing; and

 



 

(xii) providing monthly financial statements, if so requested by Parent, in a
form and on a timeframe consistent with the Companys ordinary course of
business;

 



 

 _provided_ , _however_ , that such cooperation shall not (A) require the
Company, any of its subsidiaries or its Representatives to incur any liability
that is not contingent upon the Closing (or otherwise promptly reimbursed by
Parent) or, without limitation of the foregoing, execute or perform any
definitive financing documents (except authorization letters) prior to the
Closing or any other agreement, certificate, document or instrument that would
be effective prior to the Closing, (B) include any actions that would (1)
result in a violation of the organizational documents of the Company or any of
its subsidiaries, prior to Closing, any Contract to which the Company or any

action would have a material adverse effect on the company and its
subsidiaries or any laws, or (2) cause any representation, warranty, covenant
or other obligation in this Agreement to be breached or any condition set
forth in _Article VI_ to fail to be satisfied (unless Parent has waived such
breach or condition), (C) involve consenting to the pre-filing of UCC-1s or
any other grant of Liens that results in the Company or any of its affiliates
being responsible to any third parties for any representations or warranties
prior to the Closing, (D) require the giving of representations or warranties
(other than customary authorization letters described above) to any third
parties or the indemnification thereof prior to Closing, (E) require the
waiver or amendment of any terms of this Agreement or the payment of any fees
or reimbursement of any expenses prior to the Closing for which the Company
has not received prior reimbursement or is not otherwise indemnified by the

the Debt Financing until the Closing has or has substantially concurrently
occurred), (G) require the delivery of any projections to any third parties,
or (H) require the delivery of any financial statements in a form or subject

any Debt Financing Parties for the Debt Financing or is otherwise required
under the terms of the Debt Financing Commitment). All non-public or otherwise
confidential information regarding the Company or any of its affiliates
obtained by Parent pursuant to this _Section 4.05(b)_ will be kept
confidential in accordance with customary market standards and the terms of
the Debt Financing Commitment.

 



 

The Company will be deemed to be in compliance with this _Section 4.05(b)_
unless and until (x) Parent provides written notice (the " _Non-Cooperation
Notice_ ") to the Company of the alleged failure to comply, (y) Parent
includes in such Non-Cooperation Notice reasonable detail regarding the

Business Days shall not constitute any of the days specified as Blackout Dates
in the definition of Marketing Period).

 



 

(c) _Current Information_. The Company hereby consents to the reasonable use
of the Companys and its subsidiaries marks and logos in connection with the
Debt Financing; _provided_ , _however_ , that such marks and logos are used in
a manner that does not harm or disparage the Company or any of its
subsidiaries or the reputation or goodwill of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to update or
correct any Required Information as promptly as practicable so that such
Required Information does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or

 



     

 

 



 

necessary in order to make the Required Information, in light of the
circumstances under which the statements contained in the Required Information
are made, not misleading.

any comments from the SEC or any request from the SEC for amendments or
supplements to the Joint Proxy/S-4 or Joint Proxy Statement, and shall, as

of all correspondence between it and its Representatives, on the one hand, and
the SEC, on the other hand, and all written

received from the SEC and advise the other party of any oral comments with
respect to the Joint Proxy Statement or the Joint Proxy/S-4 received from the

rules and regulations thereunder in connection with the issuance of Parent
Common Stock in connection with the Merger, and the Company shall furnish all
information concerning the Company and the holders of the Shares as may be
reasonably requested in connection with any such actions.

 



 

(b) If, at any time prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval
or the Parent Stockholder Approval, any information relating to the Company or
Parent, or any of their respective affiliates, is discovered by the Company or
Parent which, in the reasonable judgment of the Company or Parent, should be
set forth in an amendment of, or a supplement to, the Joint Proxy/S-4 and/or
the Joint Proxy Statement, so that any of such documents would not include any
misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading, the party which discovers such information shall
promptly notify the other party, and the Company and Parent shall cooperate in
the prompt filing with the SEC of any necessary amendment of, or supplement
to, the Joint Proxy Statement or the Joint Proxy/S-4 and, to the extent
required by law, in disseminating the information contained in such amendment
or supplement to stockholders of the Company and the stockholders of Parent.
Nothing in this _Section 5.01(b)_ shall limit the obligations of any party
under _Section 5.01(a)_. For purposes of this _Section 5.01_, any
information concerning or related to the Company, its affiliates or the
Company Special Meeting will be deemed to have been provided by the Company,
and any information concerning or related to Parent, its affiliates or the
Parent Special Meeting will be deemed to have been provided by Parent.

 



 

(c) As promptly as practicable after the Joint Proxy/S-4 is declared effective
under the Securities Act, the Company and Parent shall cause the Joint Proxy
Statement to be mailed to their respective stockholders entitled to vote at
the Company Special Meeting or the Parent Special

Parent Special Meeting, as applicable, to be held as soon as reasonably
practicable following such mailing. The Company and Parent shall hold the
Company Special Meeting and the Parent Special Meeting on the same date. Each
party shall cooperate and keep the other party informed on a current basis
regarding its solicitation efforts and voting results following the
dissemination of the Joint Proxy Statement to the stockholders of each party.

 



 

(d) The Company shall (i), in consultation with Parent, take all necessary
actions to establish a record date for, and to duly call, give notice of, and
convene the Company Special Meeting in accordance with applicable law and the
organizational documents of the Company for the purpose of obtaining, among
other things, the Company Stockholder Approval and (ii) include the Company
Board Recommendation in the Joint Proxy Statement, maintain such Company Board
Recommendation and solicit and use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the
Company Stockholder Approval; except in each case if the Company Board shall
have made a Company Change of Recommendation as permitted by (and solely
pursuant to the terms of) _Section 4.03_.

 



 

(e) Parent shall (1), in consultation with the Company, take all necessary
actions to establish a record date for, and to duly call, give notice of, and
convene the Parent Special Meeting in accordance with applicable law and
organizational documents of Parent for the purpose of obtaining the Parent
Stockholder Approval and (2) include the Parent Board Recommendation in the
Joint Proxy Statement, maintain such recommendation and solicit and use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain the Parent Stockholder Approval.

 



 

(i) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Parent
Board may, prior to the receipt of the Parent Stockholder Approval, withdraw,
amend or modify, or publicly propose to withdraw, amend or modify, the Parent
Board Recommendation in a manner adverse to the Company in connection with an
Parent Intervening Event (a " _Parent Change of Recommendation_ ") if (and
only if): (A) an Parent Intervening Event has occurred and is continuing, (B)
the Parent Board determines in good faith after consultation with its
financial advisor and outside legal counsel that failure to take such action
would reasonably be likely to constitute a breach of the Parent Boards
fiduciary duties under applicable law, (C) prior to taking such action, Parent
provides the Company prior written notice equal to the Recommendation Change
Notice Period that the Parent Board intends to take such action (a " _Parent
Intervening Event Recommendation Change Notice_ "), which notice shall include
a reasonable summary of the Parent Intervening Event (it being understood that
(x) such Parent Intervening Event Recommendation Change Notice and any
amendment or update to such notice and the determination to so deliver such
notice shall not constitute a Parent Change of Recommendation for purposes of
this Agreement and (y) any material change to the status of the Parent
Intervening Event shall require a new Parent Intervening Event Recommendation
Change Notice, except that the Recommendation Change Notice Period shall be
reduced to two (2) Business Days after the initial Recommendation Change
Notice Period), (D) during the Recommendation Change Notice Period, Parent
shall have discussed and negotiated in good faith with the Company and its
Representatives, if requested by the Company, any adjustments or modifications
to the terms of this Agreement or with respect to a new proposal from the
Company, and (E) at the end of the Recommendation Change Notice Period (and
any subsequent Recommendation Change

 



     

 

 



 

Notice Periods required pursuant hereto), the Company shall not have made a
written offer or proposal capable of being accepted by Parent that the Parent
Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor
and outside legal counsel, would obviate the need for the Parent Board to
effect such Parent Change of Recommendation.

 



 

(ii) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit Parent or the Parent
Board, directly or indirectly, including through its Representatives, from (A)
disclosing to the Parents stockholders a position contemplated by Rule
14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act or (B) making any
disclosure to its stockholders if the Parent Board has determined, after
consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to do so would be
inconsistent with applicable law; provided, however, that in the case of the
foregoing clauses (A) or (B) of this _Section 5.01(e)(ii)_, any such action
taken or statement made that contains a Parent Change of Recommendation shall
only be made in compliance with _Section 5.01(e)(i)_.

 



 

(iii) For purposes of this Agreement, a " _Parent Intervening Event_ " means a
Change that affects or would be reasonably likely to affect (x) the business,
financial condition or continuing results of operations of Parent and its
subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (y) the benefits of the Merger to Parent or
the shareholders of Parent, in either case that (A) is material, individually
or in the aggregate with any other such Changes, to Parent and its
subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or the shareholders of Parent, (B) is not
known and is not reasonably foreseeable (or the material consequences of which
are not known and not reasonably foreseeable) as of the date hereof and (C)
does not relate to or involve any Parent Takeover Proposal; provided that (I)
in no event shall any action taken by any party hereto pursuant to the
affirmative covenants set forth in _Section 5.03_, or the consequences of any
such action, constitute, be deemed to contribute to or otherwise be taken into
account in determining whether there has been a Parent Intervening Event, (II)
in no event shall any Change that would fall within any of the exceptions to
the definition of "Company Material Adverse Effect" constitute, be deemed to
contribute to or otherwise be taken into account in determining whether there
has been a Parent Intervening Event and (III) in no event shall any item set
forth in _Section 5.01(e)(iii)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter constitute,
be deemed to contribute to or otherwise be taken into account in determining
whether there has been a Parent Intervening Event.

 



 

(iv) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Parent Takeover Proposal_ " means,
other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, any _bona fide_
proposal, indication of interest or offer from any person or "group" (as
defined in or under Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) relating to (A) any
direct or indirect acquisition or purchase of a business that constitutes or
generates 25% or more of the net revenues or assets of the Parent and its
subsidiaries, taken as a whole or any assets representing 25% or more of the
consolidated assets of the Parent and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole (in
any case contemplated by this clause (A), measured by the lesser of book or
fair market value thereof as of the last day of Parents last fiscal year as
of such time), (B) any direct or indirect acquisition or purchase of 25% or
more of any outstanding class of voting or equity securities of Parent or of
any subsidiary of Parent, (C) any tender offer or exchange offer that if
consummated would result in any person beneficially owning 25% or more of any
outstanding class of voting or equity securities of Parent or any of its
subsidiaries, or (D) any merger, consolidation,

 



     

 

 



 

business combination, or other similar extraordinary transaction involving
Parent or any of its subsidiaries pursuant to which the holders of the Parent
Common Stock immediately preceding such transaction hold, directly or
indirectly, less than 75% of the outstanding voting or equity interests in the
surviving or resulting entity of such transaction. For the avoidance of doubt,
the inclusion of references to "Parent Takeover Proposal" in this Agreement
does not impose any obligation of Parent with respect to a Parent Takeover
Proposal as between Parent and the Company.

 



 

(f) The Company and Parent shall not, without the prior written consent of the
other party, adjourn, postpone or otherwise delay the Company Special Meeting
or the Parent Special Meeting, respectively; _provided_ , that the Company and
Parent may, with the consultation of the other party, adjourn or postpone the
Company Special Meeting or the Parent Special Meeting, as applicable, if, as
of the time for which such meeting is originally scheduled, (i) there are
insufficient Shares or shares of Parent Common Stock, as applicable,
represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to
conduct the business of such meeting, (ii) if the Company or Parent, as
applicable, believes in good faith that the Company or Parent has not received
proxies representing a sufficient number of shares necessary to obtain the
Company Stockholder Approval or the Parent Stockholder Approval, as
applicable, (iii) to the extent necessary to ensure that any required
supplement or amendment to the Joint Proxy Statement is provided to the
Companys stockholders or Parents shareholders, as applicable, within a
reasonable amount of time in advance of the Company Special Meeting or the
Parent Special Meeting, as applicable, or (iv) as otherwise required by
applicable law. Except if the Company Board shall have made a Company Change
of Recommendation as permitted by (and solely pursuant to the terms of)
_Section 4.03_, or the Parent Board has made a Parent Change of
Recommendation pursuant to _Section 5.01(e)_, the Company and Parent shall
continue to use all reasonable best efforts to assist in the solicitation of
proxies from stockholders relating to the Company Stockholder Approval or the
Parent Stockholder Approval, as applicable.

 



 

Section 5.02 _Access to Information; Confidentiality; Effect of Review_.

 



 

(a) _Access_. From the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time, the
Company and Parent shall, and shall cause each of their subsidiaries and
affiliates and their respective Representatives to use reasonable efforts to:
(i) provide to each other and each others respective Representatives
reasonable access during normal business hours in such a manner as not to
interfere unreasonably with the operation of the Company or Parents business,
or any of their respective subsidiaries, as applicable, upon prior written
notice to the other party, to its officers, employees, auditors, properties,
offices and other facilities and its subsidiaries and to the books and records
thereof; and (ii) furnish as reasonably promptly as practicable to each other
and each others respective Representatives such information concerning its
business, properties, contracts, assets and liabilities and its subsidiaries
as reasonably requested by the other party; _provided_ , that the Company and
Parent, as applicable, shall not be required to afford such access or furnish
such information to the extent that it believes in good faith that doing so
would: (A) result in a loss of attorney-client privilege or work-product
protection, (B) violate any of its obligations with respect to confidentiality
to any third party or otherwise breach, contravene or violate any of its then
effective Contracts to which it or any of its subsidiaries is a party, or (C)
breach, contravene, or

 



     

 

 



 

violate any applicable law; _provided_ , _further_ , that the Company and
Parent, as applicable, shall use commercially reasonable efforts to allow for
such access or disclosure in a manner that does not result in a breach of
clauses (A), (B) or (C), including pursuant to the use of "clean room"
arrangements pursuant to which Representatives of Parent and the Company could
be provided access to such information). Parent and the Company may, as each
deems advisable and necessary, reasonably designate any competitively
sensitive material to be provided to the other under this _Section 5.02_ as
"Outside Counsel Only Material." Such materials and information contained
therein shall be given only to the outside counsel of the recipient and will
not be disclosed by such outside counsel to employees, officers or directors
of the recipient unless express permission is obtained in advance from the
source of the materials (Parent or the Company, as the case may be) or its
legal counsel.

 



 

(b) To the extent that any of the information or material furnished pursuant
to this _Section 5.02_ or otherwise in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement may include material subject to the attorney-client privilege, work
product doctrine or any other applicable privilege concerning pending or
threatened legal proceedings or governmental investigations, the parties
understand and agree that they have a commonality of interest with respect to
such matters and it is their desire, intention and mutual understanding that
the sharing of such material is not intended to, and shall not, waive or
diminish in any way the confidentiality of such material or its continued
protection under the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other
applicable privilege. All such information that is entitled to protection
under the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other applicable
privilege shall remain entitled to such protection under these privileges,
this Agreement, and under the joint defense doctrine. All information provided
pursuant to _Section 5.02(a)_ shall be subject to the applicable terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement and that certain Clean Team Agreement, dated October
10, 2018, by and between the Company and Parent.

 



 

Section 5.03 _Regulatory Matters; Reasonable Best Efforts_.

 



 

(a) On the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, each party
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Closing to occur, including
using reasonable best efforts to take all actions reasonably necessary, proper
or advisable to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (including the Merger). Without limiting the foregoing or the
provisions set forth in _Section 5.03(b)_ (and subject to the terms and
limitations in _Section 5.03(b)_), each party shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the Closing to occur on or prior to the Termination Date.
Nothing in this _Section 5.03_ shall impose any obligation on Parent with
respect to obtaining or arranging the Debt Financing, it being agreed that
Parents obligations with respect to such matters shall be governed solely by
_Section 4.05_ and the Debt Financing Commitment. Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, Parent shall not knowingly take any action
(including the acquisition by it or its subsidiaries of any interest in any
Person that is material to Parent and its subsidiaries that derives its
revenues primarily from products, services or lines of business that compete
with the Companys products, services or lines of business if such action
would make it materially more likely that any Consent required under any
Antitrust Law with respect to the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement would not be obtained by the Termination Date;
provided that nothing in this _Section_

 



     

 

 



 

 _5.03_ shall prevent Parent or any of its subsidiaries from taking any action
permitted under _Section 4.02_ (including any item listed on _Section 4.02_
of the Parent Disclosure Letter).

 



 

(b) Without limiting the generality of the other provisions of this _Section
5.03_, each of the Company and Parent shall promptly following the execution
and delivery of this Agreement, file or cause to be filed with the United
States Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ ") and the United States
Department of Justice (the " _DOJ_ ") the notification and report form, if
any, required for the transactions contemplated hereby and any supplemental
information requested in connection therewith pursuant to the HSR Act (and
each of Parent and the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to make such
filings within ten (10) Business Days following the execution and delivery of
this Agreement), as well as comparable pre-merger notification filings, forms
and submissions with any foreign Governmental Authority that may be required
by the Antitrust Laws of any applicable foreign jurisdiction as soon as
reasonable practicable (including the Specified Jurisdictions) (and each of
Parent and the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to file such filings,
forms and submissions within 30 Business Days following the date hereof). Each
of Parent and the Company shall promptly (i) cooperate and coordinate with the
other in the making of such filings, (ii) supply the other with any
information that may be required in order to effectuate such filings and (iii)
supply any additional information that reasonably may be required or requested
by the FTC, the DOJ or the competition or merger control authorities of any
other applicable jurisdiction. Each party hereto shall promptly inform the
other party or parties hereto, as the case may be, of any communication from
any Governmental Authority regarding any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (including the Merger). If any party hereto or affiliate
thereof receives a request for additional information or documentary material
from any such Governmental Authority with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including the Merger), then such party shall
use reasonable best efforts to make, or cause to be made, as soon as
reasonably practicable and after consultation with the other party, any
additional information that reasonably may be required or requested by such
Governmental Authority and otherwise make an appropriate response in
compliance with such request. Subject to applicable law, no filing of, or
amendment or supplement to, or written correspondence with any Governmental
Authority or its staff with respect to such Antitrust Laws shall be made by
the Company or Parent without providing the other party a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment thereon and consider in good faith the
comments of the party with respect thereto. For purposes of this _Section
5.03_, the "reasonable best efforts" of Parent shall include promptly opposing
any motion or action for a temporary, preliminary or permanent injunction
against the Merger or any portion thereof, including any legislative,
administrative or judicial action, and taking any and all steps necessary to
have vacated, lifted, reversed, overturned, avoided, eliminated or removed any
decree, judgment, injunction or other order (whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent) that restricts, prevents or prohibits the consummation of the
Merger or any other transactions contemplated by this Agreement under the HSR
Act or other Antitrust Laws; _provided_ , that, nothing herein shall require
Parent, its subsidiaries or affiliates to propose, commit, offer to commit or
otherwise effect, by undertaking, consent decree, hold separate order or
otherwise, to the sale, divestiture, license or disposition of any assets or
businesses of Parent or its subsidiaries or affiliates or of the Company or
its subsidiaries, or otherwise offer or commit to take any action that limits
the freedom of action, ownership or control with respect to, or ability to
retain or hold, any of the business, assets, product lines, properties or
services of Parent or its subsidiaries or affiliates or of the Company or its
subsidiaries, in each case, except to the extent set forth on Section 5.03(b)
of the Parent Disclosure Letter; provided, further, that nothing herein shall

 



     

 

 



 

require Parent, its subsidiaries or affiliates to agree to or take any action
that, individually or in the aggregate, would have a material adverse effect
on Parent, the Company and their respective subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
following the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

(c) In addition to the obligations under _Section 5.03(b)_, each of Parent
and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i) obtain, and to
cooperate in obtaining, all necessary consents, waivers and approvals under
any Company Material Contracts or Leases with third parties to which the
Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party in connection with this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
(including the Merger) so as to maintain and preserve the benefits under such
Contracts following the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
(including the Merger), (ii) obtain all actions or non-actions, waivers,
consents, approvals, orders and authorizations from Governmental Authorities
(other than pursuant to efforts with respect to the Antitrust Laws referenced
in _Section 5.03(b)_), necessary or appropriate to permit the consummation of
the Merger and to provide, and cooperate in providing, notices to, and make or
file, and cooperate in the making or filing of, registrations, declarations or
filings with, third parties required to be provided prior to the Effective
Time, (iii) executing or delivering any additional instruments reasonably
necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by, and to fully carry
out the purposes of, this Agreement and (iv) opposing any motion or action for
a temporary, preliminary or permanent injunction against the Merger or any
portion thereof, including any legislative, administrative or judicial action,
and taking any and all steps necessary to have vacated, lifted, reversed,
overturned, avoided, eliminated or removed any decree, judgment, injunction or
other order (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) that restricts,
prevents or prohibits the consummation of the Merger or any other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement under any applicable laws.

 



 

(d) In connection with and without limiting the foregoing, to the extent
reasonably practicable and unless prohibited by applicable law or by the
applicable Governmental Authority, the parties hereto agree to: (i) give each
other reasonable advance notice of all substantive discussions or meetings
with any Governmental Authority relating to the Merger or any other
transactions contemplated hereby; (ii) give each other an opportunity to
participate in each of such substantive discussions or meetings where
permitted by applicable law and the relevant Governmental Authority; (iii)
keep the other party reasonably apprised with respect to any substantive
communications with any Governmental Authority regarding the Merger or any
other transactions contemplated hereby; (iv) cooperate in the filing of any
analyses, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions or other
written communications explaining or defending the Merger or any other
transactions contemplated hereby, articulating any regulatory or competitive
argument and/or responding to requests or objections made by any Governmental
Authority; (v) provide each other (or counsel of each party, as appropriate)
with copies of all written communications to or from any Governmental
Authority relating to the Merger or any other transactions contemplated
hereby; and (vi) cooperate and provide each other with a reasonable
opportunity to participate in, and consider in good faith the views of the
other with respect to, all material deliberations with any Governmental
Authority with respect to all efforts to satisfy the conditions set forth in
_Section 6.01(c)_. Any such disclosures, rights to participate or provisions
of information by one party to the other under this _Section 5.03_ may be
made on an outside counsel-only basis to the extent required under applicable
Law or as appropriate to protect confidential business information, and may be
withheld or redacted as necessary to comply with

 



     

 

 



 

contractual arrangements, to preserve attorney-client, attorney work product
or other legal privilege, or the extent required under applicable Law. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing subsections of _Section 5.03_, the
Company and Parent, at the direction of the Company Board or the Parent Board,
as applicable, shall use reasonable best efforts to, (A) ensure that no
Takeover Law, or Takeover Provision is or becomes applicable to the Merger,
this Agreement or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and (B) if any Takeover Law or Takeover Provision becomes applicable to the
Merger, this Agreement or any other transaction contemplated by this
Agreement, ensure that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as reasonably practicable on the
terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of
such Takeover Law or Takeover Provision on the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

Section 5.04 _Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance_.

 



 

(a) Without limiting the other provisions of this _Section 5.04_, Parent
agrees (i) that, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, all
rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation from
liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time
now existing in favor of the current or former directors and officers, and the
fiduciaries currently indemnified under benefit plans of the Company and its
subsidiaries, as provided in their respective certificate or articles of
incorporation, by-laws (or comparable organizational documents) or other
agreements providing indemnification, advancement or exculpation, shall
survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance
with their terms, (ii) that Parent shall cause Surviving Corporation to honor
all such rights and (iii) that for six (6) years from and after the Effective
Time, no such provision in any certificate or articles of incorporation, by-
laws, certificate of formation, limited liability company agreement (or
comparable organizational document) or other agreement shall be amended,
modified or repealed in any manner that would adversely affect the rights or
protections thereunder to any such individual with respect to acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time. From and after the
Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and their
subsidiaries to assume all indemnification agreements in effect as of the date
of this Agreement with directors or officers of the Company and its
subsidiaries and to otherwise honor and perform, in accordance with their
respective terms.

 



 

(b) For six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
maintain or obtain directors and officers liability (and fiduciary)
insurance policies (which policies by its express terms shall survive the
Merger) covering acts or omissions occurring on or prior to the Effective Time
of the Merger with respect to those persons who are currently covered by the
Companys respective directors and officers liability (and fiduciary)
insurance policies on terms with respect to such coverage and in amounts no
less favorable to the Company Indemnified Parties than those set forth in the
relevant policy in effect on the date of this Agreement; _provided_ , that the
annual cost thereof shall not exceed 250% of the annual cost of such policies
as of the date hereof. If such insurance coverage cannot be maintained for
such cost, Parent shall maintain the most advantageous policies of directors
and officers insurance otherwise obtainable for such cost. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company may purchase a six-year "tail" prepaid policy on
terms and conditions no less

 



      

 

 



 

favorable to the Company Indemnified Parties than the existing directors and
officers liability (and fiduciary) insurance maintained by the Company,
covering without limitation the transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ ,
that the aggregate cost thereof shall not exceed 250% of the annual cost of
the directors and officers liability (and fiduciary) insurance maintained by
the Company as of the date hereof. If such "tail" prepaid policy has been
obtained by the Company prior to the Effective Time, it shall satisfy the
obligations set forth in the first two sentences of this paragraph (b).

 



 

(c) For six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to indemnify and hold harmless each
present and former director, officer and fiduciaries indemnified under benefit
plans of the Company or any of its subsidiaries (in each case, for acts or
failures to act in such capacity), and any person who becomes such a director
or officer, between the date hereof and the Effective Time (collectively, the
" _Company Indemnified Parties_ "), against any costs or expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees, costs and expenses and experts fees, travel
expenses, court costs, retainers, transcript fees, legal research,
duplicating, printing and binding costs, as well as telecommunications,
postage and courier charges), judgments, fines, losses, claims, amounts paid
in settlement, penalties, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with
any claim, action, suit, proceeding, hearing or investigation, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or relating to
matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether or
not threatened, asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time
(including any matters arising in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement), to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
law (and the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, also advance expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees,
costs and expenses and experts fees, travel expenses, court costs, retainers,
transcript fees, legal research, duplicating, printing and binding costs, as
well as telecommunications, postage and courier charges) to such persons as
incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law; _provided_ ,
the person to whom expenses are advanced provides a written undertaking to
repay such advances if it is ultimately determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction that such person is not entitled to indemnification. Neither
Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall settle, compromise or consent to
the entry of any judgment in any claim, action, suit, proceeding, hearing or
investigation for which indemnification could be sought by a Company
Indemnified Party pursuant to this _Section 5.04(c)_, unless (i) such
settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of such
Company Indemnified Party from all liability arising out of such claim,
action, suit, proceeding, hearing or investigation, (ii) such settlement,
compromise or consent is solely for monetary damages for which Parent or the
Surviving Corporation has indemnified fully the Company Indemnified Party or
(iii) such Company Indemnified Party otherwise consents in writing (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditions or delayed) to such
settlement, compromise or consent. Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall
cooperate with an Indemnified Person in the defense of any matter for which
such Indemnified Person could seek indemnification hereunder.

 



 

(d) The obligations of Parent, the Surviving Corporation under this _Section
5.04_ shall not be terminated or modified by such parties in a manner so as to
adversely affect any Company Indemnified Party, or any other person entitled
to any benefits of this _Section 5.04_ without the prior written consent of
the affected Company Indemnified Party, or such other person, as the case may
be.

 



     

 

 



 

(e) The provisions of this _Section 5.04_ are (i) intended to be for the
benefit of, and, from and after the Effective Time, will be enforceable by,
each of the Company Indemnified Parties and (ii) in addition to, and not in
substitution for or in limitation of, any other rights to indemnification,
advancement of expenses, exculpation or contribution that any such person may
have by contract or otherwise.

 



 

(f) If any of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns consolidates with or mergers with or into any other
person and shall not be the continuing or surviving company, partnership or
other person of such consolidation or merger, then, and in each such case,
proper arrangements shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent
or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, assume the obligations set forth
in this _Section 5.04_.

 



 

Section 5.05 _Fees and Expenses_. Except as provided in this _Section 5.05_,

transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the party
incurring such fees or expenses.

applicable law, reasonable best efforts to consult with the other party hereto
shall be made prior to any such release or public statement and (b) in
connection with any actions by the Company or Company Board in connection with
a Company Change of Recommendation or by Parent or Parent Board in connection
with a Parent Change of Recommendation, the Company and Parent shall, and
shall cause their subsidiaries to, consult with each other before issuing any
press release, making any other public statement, having any communication
with the press or scheduling any press conference or conference call with
investors or analysts with respect to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and, except for any public statement or press
release as may be required by applicable law, order of a court of competent
jurisdiction or any listing agreement with or rule of NASDAQ, shall not, and
shall cause their subsidiaries not to, issue any such press release, make any
such other public statement, have any communication with the press or schedule
any such press conference or conference call before that consultation and
providing each other the opportunity to review and comment upon any such press
release or public statement, in any such case, to the extent such press
release, public statement, communication with the press or press conference or
conference call relates to the Merger, this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby. The initial press release of the parties announcing the
execution of this Agreement shall be a joint press release of Parent and the
Company in a form that is mutually agreed.

 



 

Section 5.07 _Stockholder Litigation_. Prior to the earlier of the Effective
Time and the termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Article VII_,
in the event that any stockholder litigation related to this Agreement, the
Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement is brought, or

as applicable, shall promptly after becoming aware thereof (and in any event
within 24 hours thereof) notify the other party of any such Transaction
Litigation and shall keep the other party reasonably informed with respect to
the status thereof. Parent and the Company, as applicable, shall have the
right, at its sole discretion, to participate in the defense or settlement of
any Transaction Litigation, and, in any event, prior to the Effective Time,
neither Parent nor the Company shall settle, compromise, come to an
arrangement regarding or agree to settle, compromise or come to an arrangement
regarding any Transaction Litigation, without the other partys prior written
consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed); _provided_ , that after the time the Company Stockholder Approval is
obtained, if requested by Parent, the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to defend or to settle any unresolved Transaction Litigation in
consultation with Parent.

 



 

Section 5.08 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company

transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who is subject
to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with
respect to the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the

Section 5.10 _Employee Matters_.

 



 

(a) With respect to employees of the Company or any of its subsidiaries
immediately before the Effective Time (" _Company Employees_ "), Parent shall,
or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, for a period of twelve (12)
months following the Closing (or, if earlier, the termination of the
applicable Company Employees employment with Parent, the Surviving
Corporation and their subsidiaries), provide to such Company Employee base
salary or wage rate (as applicable), commission and target annual cash
incentive opportunity, and severance benefits that are not materially less, in

(c) Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that each
Company Employee receives full credit (for all purposes, including eligibility

(or predecessor employers to the extent the Company or relevant subsidiary
provides such past service credit under its employee benefit plans) under each
of the comparable employee benefit plans, programs and policies of Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or the relevant subsidiary, as applicable, in which such
Company Employee becomes a participant from and after the Closing Date;
provided, however, that no such service recognition shall result in any
duplication of benefits. As of the Closing Date, Parent shall use commercially
reasonable efforts, or shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
Surviving Corporation or relevant subsidiary to, credit to Company Employees
the amount of vacation time that such employees had accrued under any
applicable Company Employee Benefit Plan as of the Closing Date. With respect

Corporation or the relevant subsidiary for the benefit of any Company
Employees, Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) cause to be
waived any eligibility waiting periods, any evidence of insurability
requirements and the application of any pre-existing condition limitations
under such plan, and (ii) cause each Company Employee to be given credit under
such plan for all amounts paid by such Company Employee under any similar
Company Employee Benefit Plan for the plan year that includes the Closing Date
for purposes of applying deductibles, co-payments and out-of-pocket maximums

(d) The provisions of this _Section 5.10_ are solely for the benefit of the
parties to this Agreement. Nothing in this _Section 5.10_ shall create any
right in any person, including any employees, former employees, independent
contractor, any participant in any Company Employee

 



     

 

 



 

Benefit Plan or any beneficiary thereof, nor create any right to continued
employment with Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation, or any of
their subsidiaries (nor limit the ability of Parent and its subsidiaries to

terminating the provisions of any Company Employee Benefit Plan.

the right or control to direct the Companys or its subsidiaries operations

consummating the Merger becoming incapable of being satisfied or (b) take any
action or fail to take any action which would, or would be reasonably likely
to, individually or in the aggregate, prevent, materially delay or materially
impede the ability of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company to consummate the
Merger or the other transactions contemplated under this Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 5.13_, if any
obligation hereunder is covered or otherwise addressed by any other provision

Section 7.05 _Termination Fees_.

 



 

(a) If Parent or its designee shall receive full payment of the Company
Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 7.03_, then the receipt of the Company
Termination Fee by Parent or its designee shall be the sole and exclusive
remedy of Parent, Merger Sub and their respective affiliates and
representatives for any and all liability, loss and damage relating to or
arising out of this Agreement, the Merger and the other agreements,
certificates, instruments and transactions contemplated hereby. In no event
shall the Company be required to pay the Company Termination Fee more than
once in any circumstance. The Company, Parent and Merger Sub each acknowledge
that the agreements contained in _Section 7.03_ are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and that, without these
agreements, none of Parent, Merger Sub, or the Company would enter into this
Agreement, and that any amounts payable pursuant to _Section 7.03_ do not
constitute a penalty but constitute payment of liquidated damages and that the
liquidated damages amount is reasonable in light of the substantial but
indeterminate harm anticipated to be caused by the other partys breach or
default under this Agreement, the difficulty of proof and calculation of loss
and damages, the inconvenience and non-feasibility of otherwise obtaining an
adequate remedy, the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone
while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the
expectation of the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby and the value of the transactions to be consummated
hereunder. If the Company fails to promptly pay the Company Termination Fee
when required to be paid pursuant to _Section 7.03_ and, in order to obtain
payment of the Company Termination Fee, Parent or Merger Sub commences a suit
that results in a final non-appealable order against the Company for the
payment of the Company Termination Fee to Parent, the Company shall pay Parent
its reasonable, documented and out-of-pocket costs and expense (including
reasonable, documented and out-of-pocket attorneys fees) in connection with
such suit, together with interest, commencing from the date that the Company
Termination Fee was due and payable, on the amount of the Company Termination
Fee at the prime rate published in the Money Rates section of The Wall Street
Journal in effect on the date such payment of the Company Termination Fee was
required to be made.

 



 

(b) If the Company or its designee shall receive full payment of the Parent
Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 7.04_, then the receipt of the Parent
Termination Fee by Parent or its designee shall be the sole and exclusive
remedy of the Company and their respective affiliates and representatives for
any and all liability, loss and damage relating to or arising out of this
Agreement, the Merger and the other agreements, certificates, instruments and
transactions contemplated hereby. In no event shall the Company be required to
pay the Company Termination Fee more than once in any circumstance. The
Company, Parent and Merger Sub each acknowledge that the agreements contained
in _Section 7.04_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and that, without these agreements, none of Parent, Merger Sub,
or the Company would enter into this Agreement, and that any amounts payable
pursuant to _Section 7.04_ do not constitute a penalty but constitute payment
of liquidated damages and that the liquidated damages amount is reasonable in
light of the substantial but indeterminate harm anticipated to be caused by
the other partys breach or default under this Agreement, the difficulty of
proof and calculation of loss and damages, the inconvenience and non-
feasibility of otherwise obtaining an adequate remedy, the efforts and
resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement
and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation
of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and the value of
the transactions to be consummated hereunder. If Parent fails to promptly pay
the Parent Termination Fee when required to be paid pursuant to _Section
7.04_ and, in order to obtain payment of the Parent Termination Fee,

 



     

 

 



 

the Company commences a suit that results in a final non-appealable order
against Parent for the payment of the Parent Termination Fee to the Company,
Parent shall pay the Company its reasonable, documented and out-of-pocket
costs and expense (including reasonable, documented and out-of-pocket
attorneys fees) in connection with such suit, together with interest,
commencing from the date that the Parent Termination Fee was due and payable,
on the amount of the Parent Termination Fee at the prime rate published in the
Money Rates section of The Wall Street Journal in effect on the date such
payment of the Parent Termination Fee was required to be made.

a disclosure letter need not be set forth in any other section of the

reasonably apparent on the face of the information disclosed in the disclosure
letter to the person to which such disclosure is being made. The fact that any

laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the laws that might otherwise

each of their respective affiliates and their respective general or limited
partners, stockholders, managers, members, directors, officers, employees,
advisors, counsel or affiliates in any way relating to their Debt Financing
Commitment and related fee letters or the performance thereof or the

accordance with, the domestic Law of the State of New York without giving
effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule whether of the State
of New York or any other jurisdiction that would cause the application of Law
of any jurisdiction other than the State of New York.

 



 

(b) Each of the parties (i) irrevocably submits itself to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or, to the
extent such court does not have jurisdiction, the United States District Court
of the District of Delaware, as well as to the jurisdiction of all courts to
which an appeal may be taken from such courts, in any suit, action or
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any of the

proceeding shall be brought, heard and determined exclusively in such court,

Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated herein in any other court,
and (v) waives any defense of inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any

(c) Notwithstanding anything contrary in this Agreement, each of the parties
hereto agrees that it will not bring or support any action, cause of action,
claim, cross-claim or third-party claim of any kind or description, whether in

Debt Financing Parties in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including but not limited to any
dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the Debt Financing Commitment
or the performance thereof, in any forum other than any New York federal court
sitting in the Borough of Manhattan, or, if such court does not have subject
matter jurisdiction, in any state court located in the City and County of New
York. The parties hereto further agree that all of the provisions of _Section
8.14_ relating to waiver

or third party-claim referenced in this _Section 8.09(c)_.

 



 

(d) Each of the parties agrees that service of any process, summons, notice or

Section 8.10 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned, in whole or
in part, by operation of law or otherwise by any of the parties hereto without
the prior written consent of the other party. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
each of Parent and Merger Sub may (a) assign any of its rights or delegate any
of its obligations under this Agreement, by operation of law or otherwise, to
one or more of its subsidiaries (but no such assignment shall relieve the
assigning party of any of its obligations hereunder, including the obligation
to deliver the Parent Common Stock (and not the equity securities of any other
party) as part of the Merger Consideration) and such assigning party shall
remain liable and responsible for all of its obligations under this Agreement
and (b) collaterally assign any of its rights, but not its obligations, under
this Agreement to any of its financing sources; provided, however, that no
assignment of any rights or obligations of Parent or Merger Sub shall enlarge,
alter or change any obligation of the Company or impede or delay the
consummation of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby. Any
attempted or purported assignment in violation of this _Section 8.10_ shall
be null and void and of no effect whatsoever. Subject to the provisions of
this _Section 8.10_, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the
benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties and their respective successors
and permitted assigns.

 



 

Section 8.11 _Specific Performance_. The parties agree that irreparable damage
would occur and that the parties would not have any adequate remedy at law in
the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is
accordingly agreed that in the event of any breach or threatened breach by any
other party of any covenant or obligation contained in this Agreement, the
non-breaching party shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions without
proof of damages to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, without the necessity
of posting bonds or similar undertakings in connection therewith, this being
in addition to any other remedy which may be available to such non-breaching
party at law or in equity, including monetary damages. The right of specific
enforcement is an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and without that right, neither the Company nor Parent would have
entered into this Agreement. Each party hereto hereby waives and agrees not to
assert any objections to any remedy referred to in this _Section 8.11_
(including any objection on the basis that there is an adequate remedy at Law
or that an award of such remedy is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at
Law or equity). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the Company
or any of its Representatives be entitled to seek the remedy of specific
enforcement of this Agreement or the Debt Financing against the Debt Financing
Parties.

 



     

 

 



 

Section 8.12 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect. Upon such determination that any
term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced,
the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so
as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable law in an acceptable manner to the end
that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent
possible.

 



 

Section 8.13 _Debt Financing Parties_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, neither the Debt Financing Parties (in their
capacity as such) shall have any liability to the Company, its subsidiaries or
any of their respective equity holders, representatives or affiliates relating
to or arising out of this Agreement, the financing of the transactions
contemplated hereby or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby,
whether at law or equity, in contract or in tort or otherwise, and the Company
(on behalf of itself and its subsidiaries) agrees that neither it nor any
Company stockholder (other than Parent and Merger Sub) shall have any rights
or claims, and shall not seek any loss or damage or any other recovery or
judgment of any kind, including direct, indirect, consequential, special,
exemplary or punitive damages, against any Debt Financing Party in connection
with this Agreement, the Debt Financing or the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby, whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or
otherwise; _provided_ , that following consummation of the Merger, the
foregoing will not limit the rights of the parties to the Debt Financing under
the Debt Financing Commitment.

ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR DEBT FINANCING
