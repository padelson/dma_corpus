CONVERSION OF SECURITIES

Section 2.1 _Conversion of Securities_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of any of the Parties or any
other shareholders of Company T: 

(a) _Securities of Merger Sub_. Each ordinary share, par value US$0.0001 per
share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into one fully paid and nonassessable
ordinary share, par value US$0.0001 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.
Such share shall be the only issued and outstanding share capital of the
Surviving Corporation.

(b) _Merger Consideration_.

 

(i) Other than as provided in Section 2.1(b)(ii), each Class A ordinary share,
par value US$0.0001 per share, of Company T ("Company T Class A Share") and
Class B ordinary share, par value US$0.0001 per share, of Company T ("Company
T Class B Share" ) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time (individually, a "Company T Share" and collectively, the "Company T
Shares") (other than the Excluded Shares and any Dissenters Shares), shall be
cancelled in exchange for the right to receive _7.177 _ (the "Exchange
Ratio") validly issued, fully paid, non-assessable Class A ordinary shares,
par value US$0.00001 per share, of Company Y ("Company Y Class A Shares")
(such number of shares, the "Per Share Merger Consideration").

(ii) Each American depositary share of Company T, each of which represents
four Company T Class B Shares (the "Company T ADSs"), shall be cancelled in
exchange for the right of the holder of the relevant Company T ADS at the
direction of the Company T Depositary to receive  _1.595_ American depositary
shares of Company Y, each of which represents 18 Company Y Class A Shares (the
"Company Y ADSs") (such number of Company Y ADSs, the "Per ADS Merger
Consideration" and together with the Per Share Merger Consideration, the
"Merger Consideration").

 



3 As of the Effective Time, all Company T Shares, including Company T Shares
represented by Company T ADSs, shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of its holder, automatically be cancelled, shall no longer
be issued or outstanding and shall cease to exist and the register of members
of Company T will be amended accordingly. Each Company T Share (other than
the Excluded Shares and any Dissenters Shares) shall thereafter represent only
the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration and each Company T
Share represented by a Company T ADS, together with such Company T ADS, shall
thereafter represent only the right to receive the Per ADS Merger
Consideration, as the case may be, without interest, and any Dissenters Shares
shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the applicable payments
due and owing as referred to in Section 2.6.

(c) _Cancellation of Company T Shares_. Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b), each
Company T Share and each Company T ADS issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time that is (i) issued to the Company T Depositary and
reserved for future grants under the Company T Share Incentive Plan, or (ii)
repurchased and held by Company T in treasury either in the form of Company T
Shares or Company T ADSs (collectively, the "Excluded Shares") shall, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of its holder,
automatically be cancelled, shall no longer be issued or outstanding and shall
cease to exist, and the register of members of Company T will be amended
accordingly, and no consideration shall be delivered or deliverable
in exchange therefor.

(d) _Untraceable and Dissenting Shareholders_. The Per Share Merger
Consideration shall not be issued or delivered to Company T shareholders who
are untraceable unless, except as provided below, they notify the Exchange
Agent of their current contact details prior to the Effective Time. A Company
T shareholder will be deemed to be untraceable if (i) he has no registered
address in the register of members maintained by Company T, (ii) on the last
two consecutive occasions on which a dividend has been paid by Company T, a
check payable to such shareholder either (A) has been sent to such
shareholder and has been returned undelivered or has not been cashed or (B)
has not been sent to such shareholder because on an earlier occasion a check
for a dividend so payable has been returned undelivered, and in any such case
no valid claim in respect thereof has been communicated in writing to Company
T or (iii) notice of the Company T Shareholders Meeting has been sent to such
shareholder and has been returned undelivered.

 

(e) _Certain Adjustments_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Article II to
the contrary, if between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time
the outstanding Company T Shares or Company Y Shares, as applicable, or
securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for Company T
Shares or Company Y Shares, as applicable, shall have been changed into a
different number of shares or a different class by reason of the occurrence or
record date of any share dividend, subdivision, reclassification,
recapitalization, split, combination, consolidation, readjustment, exchange of
shares or similar transaction, the Per Share Merger Consideration and Per ADS
Merger Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect such share
dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination,
consolidation, readjustment, exchange of shares or similar transaction.

 



4 Section 2.2 _Treatment of Company T Options_. (a) Each Company T Option
that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether vested
or unvested, shall, at the Effective Time, be assumed by Company Y and be
replaced by Company Y with a Company Y Option. Each such Company Y Option
shall be exercisable for that number of whole Company Y Class A Shares
(rounded down to the nearest whole share) equal to the product of (i) the
total number of Company T Shares subject to such Company T Option and (ii) the
Exchange Ratio, at an exercise price per Company Y Class A Share (rounded up
to the nearest whole cent) equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the
exercise price per share of the Company T Option by (y) the Exchange Ratio.
Each such Company Y Option shall continue to have, and shall be subject to,
the same terms and conditions as applied to the Company T Option immediately
prior to the Effective Time (but taking into account any changes thereto
provided for in the Company T Share Incentive Plan, any award agreement, or
any other contract or agreement, including by reason of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby).

 

(b) Unless otherwise determined by Company Y, the Company T Share Incentive
Plan shall terminate as of the Effective Time. Company T shall take all
actions necessary to (i) effect the measures contemplated in this Section 2.2,
including but not limited to the adoption of any plan amendments, obtaining
Company T Board approval, and/or obtaining the necessary employee
or optionholder consents and (ii) to ensure that from and after the Effective
Time neither Company Y nor the Surviving Corporation will be required to issue
Company T Shares, other share capital of the Surviving Corporation or any
other consideration (other than as required by this Section 2.2) to any
Person pursuant to or in settlement of Company T Options or any other awards
granted under the Company T Share Incentive Plan.

 

Section 2.3 _Exchange Fund_. (a) Subject to the conditions and terms of the
depositary agreement dated as of August 16, 2011 (the "Company T Deposit
Agreement"), entered into among Company T, The Bank of New York Mellon (the
"Company T Depositary"), as depositary and all owners and beneficial owners
from time to time of Company T ADSs, prior to the Effective Time, Company Y
shall, subject to Company Ts prior approval (which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), appoint a commercial bank or
trust to act as exchange agent hereunder for the purpose of canceling Company
T Shares and Company T ADSs in exchange for the Per Share Merger Consideration
and the Per ADS Merger Consideration, as applicable (the "Exchange Agent").

 

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, Company Y shall deposit, allot and issue or
cause to be deposited, alloted and issued, as the case may be, with the
Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the holders of Company T Shares and Company
T ADSs (other than the Excluded Shares) a number of Company Y Class A Shares
and Company Y ADSs sufficient to settle the Merger Consideration provided in
Section 2.1(b) and Section 2.2. The Company Y ADSs shall be issued in
accordance with the depositary agreement dated as of December 8, 2010 (the
"Company Y Deposit Agreement"), entered into among Company Y, Citibank, N.A.
(the "Company Y Depositary"), as depositary and all owners and beneficial
owners from time to time of the Company Y ADSs, and Company Y shall cause the
Company Y Depositary to issue the Per ADS Merger Consideration to the
Exchange Agent.

 



5 Section 2.4 _Exchange Procedures_. (a) _Holders of Company T Shares: _ (i)
promptly after the Effective Time (and in any event within five business days
thereafter), the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail
to each registered holder of Company T Shares (other than the Company
T Depositary and holders of Excluded Shares and Dissenters Shares) (A) a form
of letter of transmittal (which shall specify how the delivery of the Merger
Consideration to the registered holders of Company T Shares shall be effected)
and (B) instructions for effecting the surrender of any and all share
certificates which have been issued representing Company T Shares (the
"Certificates"). Each registered holder of Company T Shares (including Company
T Shares not represented by a Certificate ("Uncertificated Shares")) shall be
entitled to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration, without interest, for
each Company T Share (including Company T Shares formerly represented by
a Certificate and Uncertificated Shares) cancelled at the Effective Time
multiplied by (x) the number of Company T Shares represented by such
Certificate (or declaration of loss or non-receipt and, if applicable,
indemnity in the required form and in compliance with Section 2.9) or (y) the
number of Uncertificated Shares, as the case may be, provided that each holder
of a Certificate shall be required to surrender such Certificate (or a
declaration of loss or non-receipt and, if applicable, indemnity in the
required form and in compliance with Section 2.9) to the Exchange Agent
together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed and completed in
accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may
reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, and the Certificate so
surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled; and (ii) if the Per Share Merger
Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name
the cancelled Company T Share is registered, it shall be a condition of
payment that (A) a share transfer form in respect of Company T Shares
represented by the Certificate so surrendered (if any) shall be in a proper
form to transfer the relevant Company T Shares and (B) the Person requesting
such payment shall have paid any transfer and other Taxes required by reason
of the payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration to a Person other than
the registered holder of such cancelled Company T Shares and shall have
established to the reasonable satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that
such Tax either has been paid or is not applicable. Upon the cancellation of
any Company T Shares at the Effective Time, the registered holder of
such cancelled Company T Shares shall have no further rights in respect of
such cancelled Company T Shares, and each Certificate in respect of such
cancelled Company T Shares shall be deemed at any time after the Effective
Time to represent only the right to receive the Per Share Merger
Consideration as contemplated by this Article II, without interest.

 



6 (b) _Holders of Company T ADSs_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set
forth in Section 2.4(a) above, promptly after the Effective Time (and in any
event within five business days thereafter), the Surviving Corporation and the
Exchange Agent shall mail to the Company T Depositary (A) a form of letter of
transmittal (which shall specify how the delivery of the Merger Consideration
to the Company T Depositary shall be effected); and (B) instructions for
effecting the surrender of any and all Certificates representing Company T
Shares in the form of Company T ADSs. The Company T Depositary shall be
entitled to receive the Per ADS Merger Consideration, without interest, for
each Company T Share held by the Company T Depositary in respect of which a
Company T ADS has been issued (other than those Company T ADSs represented by
Company T Shares issued to the Company T Depositary and reserved for future
grants under the Company T Share Incentive Plan) (the "Aggregate ADS
Payment"), _provided_ that the Company T Depositary shall be required to
surrender such Certificates it holds to the Exchange Agent, together with such
letter of transmittal, duly executed and completed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be required
by the Exchange Agent, and the Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be
cancelled. Promptly after the payment of the Aggregate ADS Payment (and in any
event within five business days thereafter), and subject to the Company T
Deposit Agreement, the Surviving Corporation and the Exchange Agent shall
cause the Company T Depositary to mail to each registered holder of Company T
ADSs (other than holders of Excluded Shares) (X) a form of letter of
transmittal (which shall specify how the delivery of the Merger Consideration
to the registered holders of Company T ADSs shall be effected); and (Y)
instructions for effecting the surrender of any and all Receipts (as such term
is defined in the Company T Deposit Agreement) evidencing Company T ADSs.
Each holder registered on the register of Receipts of Company T of such
Company T ADSs cancelled at the Effective Time shall be entitled to receive
the Per ADS Merger Consideration for each Company T ADS cancelled at
the Effective Time multiplied by the number of Company T ADSs held by such
holder, _provided_ that each holder of a Receipt shall be required to
surrender such Receipt to the Company T Depositary together with such letter
of transmittal, duly executed and completed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be required
by the Company T Depositary, and the Receipts so surrendered shall forthwith
be cancelled pursuant to the Company T Deposit Agreement. Each Receipt in
respect of such cancelled Company T ADS shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the Per ADS Merger
Consideration as contemplated by this Article II. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary set forth in this Section 2.4(b), Company Y and each registered
holder of Company T ADSs shall each pay any applicable fees, charges and
expenses provided under the Company T Deposit Agreement in connection
with distribution of the Per ADS Merger Consideration to Company T ADS
holders and any and all Taxes under applicable Law.

(c)  _Settlement of Fractional Securities_. No fractional Company Y Class A
Shares or Company Y ADSs shall be issued to holders of Company T Shares and
Company T ADSs as part of the total Merger Consideration. The Exchange Agent
shall (i) receive all Company Y ADSs not used for share exchange in the
Merger because of the existence of fractional Company Y Class A Shares or
Company Y ADSs and (ii) sell such Company Y ADSs on behalf of the holders of
fractional Company Y Class A Shares or Company Y ADSs on The New York Stock
Exchange and pass on the proceeds due and payable to such holders of Company T
Shares and Company T ADSs in cash. Each holder of Company T Shares or Company
T ADSs (except the holders of the Excluded Shares and Dissenters Shares) who
would have received fractional Company Y Class A Shares or Company Y ADSs but
for this Section 2.4(c) shall receive a cash payment representing such
holders proportionate interest in the net proceeds from the sale by the
Exchange Agent pursuant to this Section 2.4(c).

(d) _Arrangements with Depositaries._ Each of Company Y and Company T will
use reasonable efforts to put into place appropriate arrangements with the
Company Y Depositary and the Company T Depositary to give effect to this
Article II.

 



7 Section 2.5 _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights_. Subject to Section
2.6, the Merger Consideration paid in respect of the cancellation of Company T
Shares and Company T ADSs in accordance with the terms of this Article II
shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to Company T Shares (including Company T Shares previously
represented by Certificates and Uncertificated Shares) or Receipts. At the
Effective Time, the register of members of Company T and the register of
Receipts of Company T shall be closed, and thereafter there shall be no
further registration of transfers on the register of members of the Surviving
Corporation of Company T Shares or on the register of Receipts of Company T of
Company T ADSs that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. From and after the Effective Time, (i) the holders of Company
T Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and
(ii) subject to the Company T Deposit Agreement, the holders of Receipts that
evidenced ownership of Company T ADSs outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time, shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Company T
Shares or Receipts, except as otherwise provided for herein or by
applicable Law. Subject to the last sentence of Section 2.6, if, at any time
after the Effective Time, Certificates or Receipts are presented to the
Surviving Corporation, or the Company T Depositary, where applicable, for any
reason, they shall be cancelled as provided in this Article II.

Section 2.6 _Dissenting Shares_. No Person who has validly exercised such
Persons rights to dissent from the Merger pursuant to Section 238 of the
Cayman Companies Law shall be entitled to receive the Per Share Merger
Consideration with respect to Company T Shares owned by such Person
("Dissenters Shares") unless and until such Person shall have effectively
withdrawn or lost such Persons rights to dissent from the Merger under the
Cayman Companies Law. If a holder of Dissenters Shares effectively withdraws
its demand for, or loses its rights to, dissent from the Merger pursuant to
Section 238 of the Cayman Companies Law with respect to any Dissenters Shares,
such Company T Shares shall cease to be Dissenters Shares. Each Dissenters
Share shall be entitled to receive only the payment resulting from the
procedure in Section 238 of the Cayman Companies Law. Company T shall promptly
give Company Y (i) copies of notices of objection, notices of dissent, any
written demands for appraisal, attempted withdrawals of such demands, and any
other instruments served pursuant to applicable Law that are received by
Company T relating to Company T shareholders rights to dissent from the
Merger and (ii) the opportunity to direct or approve all offers, negotiations
and proceedings with respect to demand for appraisal under the Cayman
Companies Law. Company T shall not, except with the prior written consent of
Company Y, voluntarily make any payment with respect to any exercise by
a shareholder of its rights to dissent from the Merger, any demands for
appraisal, offer to settle or settle any such demands or approve any
withdrawal of any such demands.

Section 2.7 _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
which remains undistributed to the holders of Company T Shares (other than the
Excluded Shares and the Dissenters Shares) at the date nine months after the
Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation on the
instruction of the Surviving Corporation, and any holder of Company T Shares
(other than the Excluded Shares and the Dissenters Shares) who has not
theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to the
Surviving Corporation and Company Y (subject to this Agreement and abandoned
property, escheat and similar laws) for the Per Share Merger Consideration
or the Per ADS Merger Consideration, as the case may be, exchangeable for
such Company T Shares to which such holder is entitled, without any interest
on any portion thereof. Any such portion of the Exchange Fund remaining
unclaimed by such holders of Company T Shares at such time at which amounts
would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Entity
shall, to the extent permitted by Law, become the property of the Surviving
Corporation or its designee, free and clear of any claims or interest of any
Person previously entitled thereto.

 



8 Section 2.8 _No Liability_. None of Company Y, Merger Sub, Company T,
the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person
in respect of any Merger Consideration from the Exchange Fund delivered to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law.

 

Section 2.9 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate shall
have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit or
declaration of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation or by the
Exchange Agent, an indemnity or the posting by such Person of a bond in such
reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent may
direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect
to such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Exchange Agent will deliver
in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the applicable Per
Share Merger Consideration with respect to Company T Shares formerly
represented thereby pursuant to this Agreement.

 

Section 2.10 _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Surviving Corporation, Company
T, Company Y and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such
amounts as it reasonably determines is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under any provisions of Tax Law of the
United States, PRC, or other applicable jurisdictions. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate Governmental Entity
by the Surviving Corporation, Company T, Company Y or the Exchange Agent, as
the case may be, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to (a) the holder of Company T Shares or
Company T ADSs in respect to which such deduction and withholding was made by
the Surviving Corporation or Company Y, as the case may be, (b) Company Y in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Company T with
respect any Termination Fee paid by Company T, and (c) Company T in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made by Company Y with respect to
any No Vote Termination Fee or Termination Fee paid by Company Y.

 

Section 2.11 _Agreement of Fair Value_. Company Y, Merger Sub and Company T
respectively agree that the Per Share Merger Consideration represents the
fair value of Company T Shares for the purposes of Section 238(8) of the
Cayman Companies Law.

fair to, and in the best interests of, Company T and its shareholders; and
(iii) resolved to recommend that the shareholders of Company T authorize and

the Plan of Merger, the Required Company T Vote). This Agreement has been duly
and validly executed and delivered by Company T and, assuming the due
authorization, execution and delivery by Company Y and Merger
Sub, constitutes a valid, legal and binding agreement of Company T,
enforceable against Company T in accordance with its terms, subject to
bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and
similar Laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors
rights and to general equity principles (the "Bankruptcy and Equity

Meeting in accordance with Section 233(6) of the Cayman Companies Law

or otherwise in order for Company T to authorize and approve this Agreement,
the Merger or the Plan of Merger or to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby.

filed, furnished or provided and those filed or furnished with the SEC
subsequent to the date hereof, including any amendments thereto,
collectively, the "Company T SEC Reports"). Each of the Company T SEC Reports,
as of its filing date (and as of the date of any amendment or incorporation by
reference), has complied or, if filed or furnished after the date hereof and

with all applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act,

such filing), any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a
material fact required to be stated or incorporated by reference therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. No executive officer

Agreement, will fairly present, in all material respects, the consolidated
balance sheets of Company T and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of the dates

Company T Financial Information has been prepared in accordance with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent

Company T, including its Subsidiaries, required to be included in reports
filed or furnished under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to
the chief executive officer and chief financial officer of Company T by
others within those entities. Neither Company T nor, to Company Ts knowledge,
Company Ts independent registered public accounting firm, has identified or
been made aware of "significant deficiencies" or "material weaknesses" (as
defined by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board) in the design or
operation of Company Ts internal controls and procedures which could

behalf of Company Y or Merger Sub for inclusion or incorporation by reference
in the Form F-4.

or Asset of Company T or any of its Subsidiaries.

22 Section 3.18 _PRC Subsidiaries_. (a) True and complete copies of each of
the constitutional documents and certificates and related contracts and
agreements of Company Ts Subsidiaries formed in the PRC ("Company T PRC
Subsidiaries") have been provided or made available to Company Y and Merger

relevant rules and regulations.

(c) The registered capital of each Company T VIE is fully contributed in
accordance with applicable Law.

(d) No approvals are required to be obtained for the performance by the
respective parties of their obligations and the transactions contemplated
under the Company T VIE Contracts other than those already obtained or
contemplated by the Company T VIE Contracts.

(e) The execution, delivery and performance by each of the relevant parties
of their respective obligations under each of the Company T VIE Contracts, and
the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereunder, did not, do not
and will not (i) result in any violation of their respective articles
of association, their respective business licenses or constitutive documents;
(ii) result in any violation of any applicable PRC Laws, or (iii) conflict
with or result in a breach or violation of any of the terms or provisions of,
or constitute a default under, any Judgment of any court of the PRC having
jurisdiction over the relevant parties to the Company T VIE Contracts, as the
case may be, any agreement or instrument to which any of them is expressed to
be a party or which is binding on any of them.

(f) (i) The Company T VIE Contracts, taken as a whole, comprise all of the
contracts enabling Company T to effect control over each Company T VIE and
consolidate the financial statements of each Company T VIE, and (ii) each of
the Company T VIE Contracts is legally valid, enforceable and binding under
PRC Laws.

 

(g) Company T has effective control of and is the primary beneficiary of each
Company T VIE. Except as provided in the Company T VIE Contracts, nominee
equity holders equity interests in any Company T VIE are not subject to any
Liens (other than Permitted Liens) or any third-party rights or claims. There
are no disputes, disagreements, claims or any legal proceedings of
any material nature, raised by any Governmental Entity or any other Person,
against or affecting any of Company T, Company T VIEs or any of Company T
VIEs shareholders that: (i) challenge the validity or enforceability of any
part or all of the Company T VIE Contracts taken as whole; (ii) challenge the
Company T VIE structure or the ownership structure as set forth in the Company

thereof or any arrangements or performance of or in accordance with the
Company T VIE Contracts was, is or will be in violation of any PRC Laws, in
each case in the preceding clauses (i) through (iv), where such dispute,
disagreement, claim or legal proceeding has a materially disproportionate
adverse effect on Company T, Company T VIEs or any of their shareholders as
compared to other similarly situated enterprises in the PRC which adopt a
similar "variable interest entity" structure that allows one entity to
exercise voting control and have a substantial economic interest in another
entity where such first entity does not, directly or indirectly, own a
majority of the equity interests of the second entity.

rights agreement, "poison pill" or similar agreement or plan. To Company Ts

any other person makes any other express or implied representation or warranty
with respect to Company T or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective
business, operations, assets, liabilities, condition (financial or otherwise)

breach or default under any Company Y Material Contract so listed either by
Company Y or, to Company Ys knowledge, by any other party thereto, and no
event has occurred that with the lapse of time or the giving of notice or both
would constitute a default thereunder by Company Y or, to Company Ys
knowledge, any other party, in each case except as would not individually or

reasonable best efforts to take or cause to be taken all other actions
necessary, proper or advisable consistent with this Section 6.5 to cause the

required authorizations, as applicable, under all applicable antitrust Laws as
soon as practicable.

 

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the Parties
contained in Section 6.5(a), each of Company Y and Company T shall use its
reasonable best efforts to resolve such objections if any, as may be asserted
by any applicable Governmental Entity or other person with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby under any antitrust Law. In connection with
the foregoing, if any administrative or judicial action or proceeding,
including any action or proceeding by a private party, is instituted (or
threatened to be instituted) challenging any transaction contemplated by this
Agreement as violative of any antitrust Law, each of Company Y and Company T
shall cooperate with each other to contest and resist any such action or
proceeding and to use their reasonable best efforts to have vacated, lifted,
reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order,
whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that
prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, so long as such actions by Company Y or Company T do not
have, and are not reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate,
a Company T Material Adverse Effect or a Company Y Material Adverse Effect;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Company T may expressly condition any such
actions and any agreement to take any such actions upon the consummation of
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby.

 

Section 6.6 _Public Announcements_. The initial press release with respect to
the execution of this Agreement shall be a joint press release to be

or otherwise making any public statements with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including, without limitation, the Merger, and
shall not issue any such press release or make any such public statement prior
to obtaining the approval of such other Party (such approval not to
be unreasonably withheld or delayed), except with respect to any action taken
by the Company T Board pursuant to, and in accordance with, Section 6.2 and
Section 6.4(a), any action taken by the Company Y Board pursuant to, and in
accordance with, Section 6.4(b), or as may be required by Law or by any
applicable listing agreement with or rules of a securities exchange, as
determined by Company Y or Company T, as the case may be.

 



42 Section 6.7 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_. (a) Each
of Company Y and the Surviving Corporation agrees that, from and after the
Effective Time, it will indemnify and hold harmless each individual who at the
Effective Time is, or at any time prior to the Effective Time was, a director
or officer of Company T or its Subsidiaries (the "Indemnified Parties")
against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees),
judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities incurred
in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation,
whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or
related to such Indemnified Parties service as a director or officer of
Company T or its Subsidiaries or services performed by such persons at the
request of Company T or its Subsidiaries at or prior to the Effective Time,
whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time,
including, for the avoidance of doubt, in connection with (i) the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) actions to enforce this
provision or any other indemnification or advancement right of any Indemnified
Party; _provided_ that such indemnification shall be subject to any
limitation imposed from time to time under applicable Law. The Articles of
Association will contain provisions with respect to rights to indemnification,
advancement of expenses and limitations on, or exculpation from,
liabilities, for acts or omissions that are at least as favorable to the
directors, officers or employees of Company T as those contained in the
memorandum and articles of association of Company T as in effect on the date
hereof, except to the extent prohibited by the Cayman Companies Law or any
other applicable Law, which provisions will not be amended, repealed or
otherwise modified for a period of six years from the Effective Time in any
manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of the Indemnified
Parties, unless such modification is required by Law.

(b) Company Y or the Surviving Corporation shall have the right, but not the
obligation, to assume and control the defense of any threatened or actual
litigation, claim or proceeding relating to any acts or omissions covered
under this Section 6.7 (each, a "Claim") unless there is a conflict of
interest between Company Y and the Surviving Corporation, on the one hand, and
the Indemnified Party, on the other (for the avoidance of doubt, conflict of
interest shall be deemed to exist in the event of any threatened or
actual litigation, claim or proceeding relating to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement), but in any event, no such Claim shall be
settled or compromised without Company Ys prior written consent (such consent
not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); _provided_ , that
none of Company Y or the Surviving Corporation shall settle, compromise or
consent to the entry of any judgment in any such Claim for which
indemnification has been sought by an Indemnified Party hereunder, unless
such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of
such Indemnified Party from all liability arising out of such Claim or such
Indemnified Party otherwise consents in writing to such
settlement, compromise or consent. Each of Company Y, the Surviving
Corporation and the Indemnified Parties shall cooperate in the defense of any
Claim and shall provide access to properties and individuals as reasonably
requested and furnish or cause to be furnished records, information and
testimony, and attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings,
trials or appeals, as may be reasonably requested in connection therewith.

 



43 (c) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, Company Y shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain Company Ts existing policies of
directors and officers liability insurance for the benefit of those persons
who are covered by such policies at the Effective Time (or Company Y may
substitute therefor policies of at least the same coverage with respect to
matters occurring prior to the Effective Time), to the extent that such
liability insurance can be maintained at a cost to Company Y not greater than
300 percent of the annual premium (such 300 percent threshold, the "Maximum
Premium") for the current Company directors and officers liability insurance
as set forth in Section 6.7 of the Company T Disclosure Schedule; _provided_
that if such insurance cannot be so maintained or obtained at such costs,
Company Y shall maintain or obtain as much of such insurance as can be so
maintained or obtained at an annual premium amount not in excess of the
Maximum Premium.

 

(d) If Company Y or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) shall consolidate with or merge into any other
corporation or entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation
or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) shall transfer all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any individual,
corporation or other entity, then, and in each such case, proper provisions
shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Company Y or the Surviving
Corporation shall assume all of the obligations set forth in this Section 6.7.

 

(e) The provisions of this Section 6.7 shall survive the consummation of the
Merger and are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable
by, each of the Indemnified Parties and their heirs and legal representatives,
each of which shall be a third-party beneficiary of the provisions of this
Section 6.7.

qualified as to materiality, to be untrue or inaccurate, or any representation
or warranty of such Party not so qualified, to be untrue or inaccurate in any
material respect, at or prior to the Effective Time, (ii) any material
failure of Company T or Company Y, as the case may be, to comply with or
satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied
by it hereunder, (iii) the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event the
occurrence or non-occurrence of which would be likely to cause any condition
to the obligations of any Party to effect the transactions contemplated hereby
not to be satisfied, (iv) any notice of, or other communication relating to,
a default or event which, with notice or lapse of time or both, would become a
default, received by such Party or any of its Subsidiaries between the date of

material to the financial condition, properties, businesses, results of
operations or prospects of such Party and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole to

legal proceedings of any nature, which, in each case, if pending on the date
of this Agreement, would have been required to have been disclosed pursuant to
Section 3.17, (vii) any notice or other communication from any third party
alleging that the consent of such third party is or may be required in

event or occurrence that has, or would reasonably be expected to have, a
Company T Material Adverse Effect or a Company Y Material Adverse Effect with
respect to Company T or Company Y, as the case may be; _provided_ , _however_
, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 6.8 shall not cure
such breach or non-compliance or limit or otherwise affect the remedies
available hereunder to the Party receiving such notice.

this Article VIII, written notice thereof shall be given to the other Party or
Parties specifying the provision hereof pursuant to which such termination is
made, and this Agreement shall become void and of no effect with no liability
on the part of any Party hereto (or of any of its Representatives); _provided_
, _however_ , that (i) this Section 8.5, Section 6.9 and Article IX (in each
case, subject to the terms thereof) shall remain in full force and effect and
survive termination of this Agreement, and (ii) nothing herein shall relieve
any Party from liability for fraud.

(b) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Company Y pursuant to
Section 8.3, Company T shall pay Company Y in cash in same-day funds as
promptly as possible (but in any event within two business days) after such
termination the Termination Fee. The Parties acknowledge and agree that in no
event shall Company T be required to pay the Termination Fee on more than one
occasion, whether or not the Termination Fee may be payable under more than
one provision of this Agreement, at the same or at different times or upon the
occurrence of different events.

(c) In the event that this Agreement is terminated (i) by Company Y or
Company T pursuant to Section 8.2(d), Company Y shall pay Company T the No
Vote Termination Fee in cash in same day funds (x) in the event this Agreement
is terminated by Company T, as promptly as possible (but in any event within
two business days) after such termination or (y) in the event this Agreement
is terminated by Company Y, prior to such termination or (ii) by Company T
pursuant to Section 8.4, Company Y shall pay Company T in cash in same-day
funds as promptly as possible (but in any event within two business days)
after such termination the Termination Fee. The Parties acknowledge and agree
that in no event shall Company Y be required to pay the No Vote Termination
Fee or the Termination Fee on more than one occasion, whether or not the No
Vote Termination Fee or the Termination Fee may be payable under more than one
provision of this Agreement, at the same or at different times or upon the
occurrence of different events.

 



52 (d) (i) Subject to Section 8.5(f) and Section 9.8, Company Ys receipt of the
Termination Fee from Company T pursuant to Section 8.5(b) shall be the sole
and exclusive remedy of Company Y and its Subsidiaries against the Company T
Related Parties (other than the Company T Voting Shareholders pursuant to the
terms of the Company T Voting Agreements) for any loss suffered as a result
of any breach of any covenant or agreement or the failure of the Merger to be
consummated, and upon payment of such amount, none of the Company T Related
Parties (other than the Company T Voting Shareholders pursuant to the terms
of the Company T Voting Agreements) shall have any further liability or
obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and, (ii) subject to Section 8.5(f), Company
Ts receipt of the No Vote Termination Fee or the Termination Fee from Company
Y pursuant to Section 8.5(c) shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Company
T against the Company Y Related Parties (other than the Company Y Voting
Shareholders pursuant to the terms of the Company Y Voting Agreements) for any
loss suffered as a result of any breach of any covenant or agreement or the
failure of the Merger to be consummated, and upon payment of such amount,
none of the Company Y Related Parties (other than the Company Y Voting
Shareholders pursuant to the terms of the Company Y Voting Agreements) shall
have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. For the
avoidance of doubt, subject to Section 8.5(f), (A) under no circumstances will
Company Y be entitled to monetary damages in excess of the amount of the
Termination Fee and (B) under no circumstances will Company T be entitled to
monetary damages in excess of the amount of the No Vote Termination Fee or the
Termination Fee, as applicable.

 

(e) The Parties expressly acknowledge and agree that, with respect to any
termination of this Agreement under circumstances in which the No Vote
Termination Fee or the Termination Fee is payable pursuant to this Section
8.5, payment of the Termination Fee, as required hereunder, shall constitute
liquidated damages with respect to any claim for damages or any other claim
which Company T, on the one hand, or Company Y, on the other hand, as the
case may be, would otherwise be entitled to assert against Company Y, on the
one hand, or Company T, on the other hand, as the case may be, or their
respective assets, or against any of their respective employees or equity
holders (without limiting any claims otherwise available to (i) Company T
against the Company Y Voting Shareholders pursuant to the Company Y Voting
Agreements or (ii) Company Y against the Company T Voting Shareholders
pursuant to the terms of the Company T Voting Agreements) or any other Company
T Related Party or Company Y Related Party, as the case may be, with respect
to any such termination of this Agreement. The Parties expressly acknowledge
and agree that, in light of the difficulty of accurately determining actual
damages with respect to the foregoing upon any such termination of this
Agreement under circumstances in which the No Vote Termination Fee or
the Termination Fee is payable pursuant to this Section 8.5, the right to
such payment (A) constitutes a reasonable estimate of the damages that will be
suffered by reason of any such termination of this Agreement, and (B) shall be
in full and complete satisfaction of any and all damages arising as a result
of any such termination of this Agreement.

 



53 (f) Each of the Parties acknowledges that the agreements contained in this
Section 8.5 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the other Parties would not
have entered into this Agreement; accordingly, if Company T or Company Y, as
the case may be, fails to promptly pay the amount due pursuant to this
Section 8.5, and, in order to obtain such payment, Company Y or Company T, as
the case may be, commences a suit which results in a judgment against the
other Party, with respect to Company Y or Merger Sub, or Parties, with
respect to Company T for amounts set forth in this Section 8.5, such paying
Party shall pay the other Party or Parties, as applicable, its reasonable and
documented costs and expenses (including attorneys fees) in connection with
such suit.

Section 9.4 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial_. (a) This
Agreement shall be construed, performed and enforced in accordance with the
Laws of the State of New York without giving effect to its principles or rules
of conflict of laws to the extent such principles or rules would require or
permit the application of the Laws of another jurisdiction other than the
State of New York except that the following matters arising out of or relating
to this Agreement shall be construed, performed and enforced in accordance
with the Laws of the Cayman Islands in respect of which the Parties
hereto hereby irrevocably submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the
courts of the Cayman Islands: the Merger, the vesting of the rights, property,
choses in action, business, undertaking, goodwill, benefits, immunities and
privileges, contracts, obligations, claims, debts and liabilities of the
Merger Sub in Company T, the cancellation of Company T Shares in consideration
of the issue of Company Y Class A Shares, the rights provided for in Section
238 of the Cayman Companies Law with respect to any Dissenters Shares, the
fiduciary or other duties of the Company T Board and the Company Y Board, and
the internal corporate affairs of Company T and Company Y. Save as aforesaid
any Proceeding (whether sounding in contract, tort, equity or otherwise)
arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the other Transaction Agreements
or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, including any Proceeding
against any Company T Related Party or Company Y Related Party, shall
be brought solely and exclusively in any New York State court or Federal
court of the United States of America sitting in the County of New York in the
State of New York. Each of the Parties hereto agrees that a final judgment
(subject to any appeals therefrom) in any such Proceeding shall be conclusive
and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any
other manner provided by Law. Each Party hereby irrevocably submits to the
exclusive jurisdiction of such courts in respect of any such Proceeding, and
hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent it may
legally and effectively do so, any objection which it may now or hereafter
have to the laying of venue of any such Proceeding in any such court in
accordance with the provisions of this Section 9.4(a). Each of the Parties
hereto hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, the
defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such Proceeding in any
such court. Each of the Parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
consents to service of process in the manner provided for notices in Section
9.3. Nothing in this Agreement or any of the other Transaction Agreements will
affect the right of any Party to this Agreement to serve process in any other
manner permitted by Law.

 



56 (b) Each Party acknowledges and agrees that any Proceeding which may arise
under or relate to this Agreement or the other Transaction Agreements is
likely to involve complicated and difficult issues, and therefore each such
Party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives any right such Party may
have to a trial by jury in respect of any Proceeding directly or indirectly
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the other Transaction
Agreements or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, including any
controversy or Proceeding involving any Company T Related Party or Company Y
Related Party under any such agreement. Each Party certifies and acknowledges
that (i) no representative, agent or attorney of any other Party has
represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other Party would not, in the
event of a Proceeding, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver, (ii) each Party
understands and has considered the implications of this waiver, (iii) each
Party makes this waiver voluntarily, and (iv) each Party has been induced to
enter into this Agreement by, among other things, the mutual waivers and
certifications in this Section 9.4(b).

Section 9.5  _Descriptive Headings_. The descriptive headings herein are
inserted for convenience of reference only and are not intended to be part of
or to affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

 

Section 9.6 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except as expressly set forth in
Section 6.7 and Section 6.13, this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure
solely to the benefit of each Party hereto and its successors and permitted
assigns, and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or
shall confer upon any other person any rights, benefits or remedies of any
nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.

Section 9.7 _Severability_. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed
severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof. If any
provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof to any person or any
circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and equitable
provision shall be substituted therefor in order to carry out, so far as may
be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid or
unenforceable provision and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the
application of such provision to other persons or circumstances shall not be
affected by such invalidity or unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity
or unenforceability affect the validity or enforceability of such provision,
or the application thereof, in any other jurisdiction.

Section 9.8 _Specific Performance_. The Parties agree that irreparable damage,
for which monetary damages would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the
event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed by
Company T in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached
by Company T. Subject to the preceding sentence, it is accordingly agreed that
Company Y and Merger Sub shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement, without the necessity of proving the inadequacy
of money damages as a remedy, this being in addition to any other remedy to
which they are entitled at Law or in equity. Neither Company Y nor Merger Sub
shall be required to provide any bond or other security in connection with an
injunction or injunctions sought in accordance with this Agreement to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
(i) while Company Y and Merger Sub may pursue both a grant of specific
performance and the payment of the Termination Fee pursuant to Section
8.5(b), under no circumstances shall Company Y and Merger Sub be permitted or
entitled to receive both a grant of specific performance and any money
damages, including all or any portion of the Termination Fee, and (ii) the
Parties hereto agree that Company T shall under no circumstances be entitled
to an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief to prevent
breaches of this Agreement or to otherwise enforce the terms hereof.

 



57 Section 9.9 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by action taken by
Company T, Company Y and Merger Sub at any time before or after approval of
the Merger by the earlier of the Required Company T Vote or the Required
Company Y Vote but, after any such approval, no amendment shall be made which
requires the approval of such shareholders under applicable Law without such
approval. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing
signed on behalf of the Parties.

Section 9.10 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time,
each Party hereto (for these purposes, Company Y and Merger Sub shall together
be deemed one Party and Company T shall be deemed the other Party) may (a)
extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of
the other Party, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and
warranties of the other Party contained herein or in any document,
certificate or writing delivered pursuant hereto, or (c) waive compliance by
the other Party with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein. Any
agreement on the part of either Party hereto to any such extension or waiver
shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf
of such Party. The failure of either Party hereto to assert any of its rights
hereunder shall not constitute a waiver of such rights.

 

Section 9.11 _Interpretation_. (a) The words "hereof," "herein" and "herewith"
and words of similar import shall, unless otherwise stated, be construed to
refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this
Agreement, and article, section, paragraph, exhibit and schedule references
are to the articles, sections, paragraphs, exhibits and schedules of this
Agreement unless otherwise specified. Whenever the words "include," "includes"
or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed
by the words "without limitation." All terms defined in this Agreement shall
have the defined meanings contained herein when used in any certificate or
other document made or delivered pursuant hereto unless otherwise defined
therein. The definitions contained in this Agreement are applicable to the
singular as well as the plural forms of such terms and to the masculine as

attachments thereto and instruments incorporated therein. References to a
person are also to its permitted successors and assigns.

 



58 (b) The Parties have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of
this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly
by the Parties and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
disfavoring any Party by virtue of the authorship of any provisions of this
Agreement.
