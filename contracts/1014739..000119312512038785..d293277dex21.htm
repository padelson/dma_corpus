Section 1.05. _Consents; Assignment of Contracts and Rights_.

 

(a) Prior to the Closing Date, the Sellers shall act diligently and reasonably
to obtain each consent, approval or waiver, in a form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the Buyers, required to be satisfied or obtained
prior to the Effective Time in order to assign the Assigned Contracts to the
applicable Buyer in a manner consistent with the terms of each Assigned
Contract and as otherwise required under this Agreement; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Sellers shall not make any agreement or understanding
affecting, in any material respect, the Business or the Purchased Assets as a
condition for obtaining any such consents or waivers except with the prior
written consent of the Buyers. During the period prior to the Effective Time,
the Buyers shall use reasonable best efforts to cooperate with the Sellers to
obtain such consents, approvals and waivers. 

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, this Agreement
shall not constitute an agreement to assign any Assigned Contract or Assigned
Facility Lease or any claim or right or any benefit arising thereunder or
resulting therefrom if and for so long as such assignment, without the consent
of a third party thereto, would constitute a breach or other contravention of
such Assigned Contract or Assigned Facility Lease or in any way adversely
affect the rights of the Buyers or the Sellers thereunder. If such consent is
not obtained, or if an attempted assignment thereof would be ineffective
or would adversely affect the rights of any Seller thereunder so that the
Buyers would not in fact receive all such rights, each Buyer and each Selling
Party will cooperate in a mutually agreeable arrangement under which the
applicable Buyer would obtain the benefits and perform and discharge the
obligations thereunder in accordance with this Agreement, or under which such
Seller would enforce for the benefit of such Buyer at such Buyers sole cost
and expense, with such Buyer being responsible for the performance and
discharge of such Sellers obligations, any and all rights of the Sellers
against a third party.

(c) If any landlord that has the right to consent to any assignment of an
Assigned Facility Lease refuses or fails to give its consent to the assignment
of such Lease, or if any right of sublease, recapture or termination by any
landlord would be triggered by the request for consent to assignment
(collectively, "Landlord Rights") and Selling Parties are permitted by the
terms of such Lease to sublease, license or otherwise arrange for Buyers to
occupy the premises demised by the Assigned Facility Lease for the permitted
use under such Lease as of the Closing Date (an "Occupancy Agreement"), then
in all such cases at the option of the Selling Parties, the applicable
Selling Party shall

 



7  enter into a sublease, license or Occupancy Agreement with the applicable
Buyer for such Store on a fully net basis and on such terms as will confer and
impose on the applicable Buyer all of the applicable Selling Parties rights
and obligations under the Assigned Facility Lease for such Store on the same
terms and conditions as applicable to such Selling Party until such landlord
consents to the assignment of the Assigned Facility Lease to such Buyer (or
any other Buyer). If and when any such consent shall be obtained or such Lease
shall otherwise become assignable, the respective Occupancy Agreement shall be
terminated with no further obligations of the Selling Parties, Selling
Parties shall promptly assign all their rights and obligations under the
respective Assigned Facility Lease to the applicable Buyers without payment of
further consideration and the Buyers shall, without the payment of any
further consideration therefor, assume such rights and obligations.

Section 1.06. _Consideration_.

 

(a) The purchase price for the Purchased Assets is a cash amount (the
"Purchase Price") equal to (1) $143,500,000 which amount less the Holdback
shall be paid to the Sellers at Closing, _plus_ (2) the Inventory Purchase
Price plus (3) the Transferred Current Assets _minus_ (4) if the conditions
set forth in  _Section 1.06(c)_ are not satisfied, the Holdback, as adjusted
pursuant to the terms of _Section 1.06(c)_. The Purchase Price shall be
subject to adjustment as provided in _Sections 1.08_ , _1.11_ , _1.12_ , 
_1.13_ , _1.14_ and _1.15_.

(b) At least five Business Days prior to the Closing Date, BioScrip shall
deliver to the Parent a certificate (the "Closing Certificate") setting
forth, in detail reasonably acceptable to the Buyers, a good faith estimate of
the amount of the Inventory Purchase Price (as agreed upon pursuant to the
subsequent sentence, the "Estimated Inventory Purchase Price"). Parent and
BioScrip shall discuss in good faith the Closing Certificate and agree on a
final Closing Certificate not less than three Business Days prior to the
Closing Date. At the Closing, the Buyers shall deliver the Closing Purchase
Price by wire transfer of immediately available funds to BioScrip pursuant to
the wire instructions set forth in Section 1.06(b) of the Disclosure Letter.

 

(c) $15,000,000 of the Purchase Price shall be retained by Buyers (the
"Holdback"), such amount to be released as described on Section 1.06(c) of
the Disclosure Letter. The existence of the Holdback shall not increase,
diminish or alter the indemnity obligations of the Selling Parties, including
any applicable survival periods, under this Agreement.

a mutually agreeable date as soon as reasonably practicable after the

organization; (b) has all requisite corporate power and authority to make,
execute, deliver and perform this Agreement and each other agreement and
instrument required to be executed, delivered and performed by it in

relief generally and by general principles of equity or as may apply to
restrictive covenants or the enforcement of any particular remedy; (d) neither

and (e) no material ungiven notice to, or material unobtained consent,
approval, authorization or permit of, any Governmental Authority required by
federal or Delaware General Corporation Law to be obtained by Sellers or any

which such opinion is being given, may rely upon certificates of Governmental

the Selling Parties and their Affiliates;

Assets will be deemed to have occurred at the Effective Time. All sales at a
Facility after the Effective Time shall be for the account of the Buyers.

 

(e) _Purchased Assets Are Indivisible_. Subject to _Sections_ _1.05_ , _1.12_
and _1.13_ , the rights to purchase and sell the Purchased Assets are

the provisions of this Agreement.

 

Section 1.08. _Prorations_.

(a) All payments under or pursuant to the Assigned Contracts or the Assigned
Facility Leases and utilities expenses for the Transferred Facilities relating
to periods both before and after the Closing Date, whether payable before or
after the Closing Date, shall be prorated between the Buyers, on the one hand,
and the Sellers, on the other hand, on the basis of a 365-day year as of the
Effective Time (collectively, the "Prorated Charges"). With respect to any
products sold (or services rendered) to the Sellers pursuant to the Assigned
Contracts or other obligations pursuant to which a Seller purchases products
(for example, purchase orders), the Buyers and the Sellers shall use their
respective reasonable best efforts to arrange for vendors to bill the
appropriate Sellers directly on or prior to the Closing Date and the
appropriate Buyers directly after the Closing Date. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained in this Agreement, amounts due for supplies
received from or services rendered by third-party vendors to the Sellers prior
to the Effective Time shall be for the account of and paid by the Sellers,
except to the extent such amounts are Assumed Liabilities as contemplated in
_Section 1.03_, which shall be the sole responsibility of the Buyers.

(b) Any ad valorem, use, real and personal property and similar Taxes,
installments or special assessments arising from, or relating to, the
Purchased Assets or the conduct of the Business, which become due and payable
on or after the Closing Date and relate to a Straddle Tax Period
(collectively, the "Apportioned Obligations"), shall be prorated and adjusted
between the Buyers, on the one hand, and the Sellers, on the other hand, as
of the Effective Time on a per diem basis and the Sellers shall be responsible
for and, in any case where payment to the applicable taxing authority is to be
made by the Buyers, shall pay to the Buyers, an amount equal to the Taxes
allocable to the portion of such Straddle Tax Period ending as of the
Effective Time at least ten (10) days prior to the date such Taxes become due
and payable. Subject to the foregoing, the Buyers shall prepare and file all
Tax Returns related to the Apportioned Obligations after providing BioScrip a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon the same.

(c) The Buyers and the Sellers shall cooperate in good faith to resolve any
dispute with respect to prorations. In the event the Buyers, on the one hand,
and the Sellers, on the other hand, are unable to resolve such dispute within
twenty (20) days after the date such dispute arose (the "Resolution Period"),
the Buyers, on the one hand, and the Sellers, on the other hand, shall submit
the items remaining for resolution in writing, together with written summaries
prepared and submitted by the Sellers, on the one hand, and the Buyers, on
the other hand, within thirty (30) days following the end of the Resolution
Period, to an Independent Accounting Firm. The Independent Accounting Firm
shall be instructed to, within 20 days of such submission, resolve any
differences between the Buyers and the Sellers based solely upon the written
summaries submitted to the Independent Accounting Firm in accordance with the
preceding sentence, and, in reaching a decision on each item of dispute, the
Independent Accounting Firms position shall be limited to either the Sellers
or the Buyers position set forth in such written summaries on each disputed
item. Such resolution shall, in the absence of manifest error, be final,
binding and conclusive upon each of the parties to this Agreement. The Buyers
and the Sellers agree that the Independent Accounting Firm must agree to the
time periods set forth in this _Section _ _1.08_  

 



11  as a condition to its engagement and such time periods shall only be
extended upon the showing of good cause by the Independent Accounting Firm to
each of the parties to this Agreement. The costs, fees and expenses of the
Independent Accounting Firm shall be borne by the non-prevailing party or, in
the event of a dispute involving multiple items, by the party whose overall
position varies the greatest from that of the Independent Accounting Firm.
For purposes of this Agreement the "Independent Accounting Firm" means shall
be Grant Thornton LLP or, if such firm is unable or unwilling to act, such
other nationally recognized accounting firm agreed upon in writing by Parent
and BioScrip. All payments made by the Buyers or Sellers pursuant to or in
connection with this Agreement shall be net of applicable withholding taxes,
if any.

 

Section 1.09. _Removal of Equipment and Signage_. Not later than sixty (60)
days following the Closing, the Buyers shall remove at their expense and,
unless return is requested by the Selling Parties as provided below, destroy
all of the Selling Parties signage that are not Purchased Assets and are
located at the Transferred Facilities; _provided_ ,  _however_ , if requested
by the Selling Parties, the Buyers shall arrange transportation of such
signage to a location designated by the Selling Parties at the Selling
Parties expense. Not later than thirty (30) days following the Closing, the
Buyers shall remove at their expense all of the Purchased Assets that are
located at any of the Facilities that are not Transferred Facilities;
_provided, that_ , upon receipt of consent from the Selling Parties (not to
be unreasonably withheld), the Buyers shall have the right to additional days
in an amount not to exceed 60 additional days as reasonably necessary to
complete such removal. Not later than thirty (30) days following the Closing,
the Selling Parties shall remove at their expense all of the Selling Parties
equipment that are not Purchased Assets and are located at the Transferred
Facilities and the Buyers and their respective Affiliates shall provide access
to such equipment to the Selling Parties and each of their respective
Representatives during normal business hours and upon reasonable advance
notice to the Buyers; _provided, that_ , upon receipt of consent from the
Buyers (not to be unreasonably withheld), the Selling Parties shall have the
right to additional days in an amount not to exceed 60 additional days as
reasonably necessary to complete such removal, _provided further_ , that, such
removal requirement shall not apply to any equipment located at
the Transferred Facilities that is being utilized by any Buyer or Selling
Party in relation to the Transition Services Agreement until 30 days following
termination of the Transition Services Agreement.

 

Section 1.10. _Purchase Price Allocation_. Within ninety (90) days after the
determination of the Inventory Purchase Price, the Buyers shall deliver to
BioScrip a schedule (the "Allocation Schedule") allocating the Purchase Price
(together with any assumed liabilities and any other items treated as
consideration for the Purchased Assets for Tax purposes) among the Purchased
Assets and the various Buyers and Sellers. The Allocation Schedule shall be
prepared in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury
Regulations thereunder. Such allocation shall be deemed final unless BioScrip
shall have notified Parent in writing of any disagreement with the Allocation
Schedule within thirty (30) days after delivery of the Allocation Schedule to
BioScrip by Parent. In the event of such disagreement, BioScrip and
the Buyers shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to resolve such
disagreement. In the event that BioScrip and the Buyers do not reach an
agreement within 90 days after the date of delivery of the Allocation Schedule
to BioScrip by the Parent (the "Allocation Schedule Resolution Period"), the
Buyers and the Selling Parties shall submit the items remaining for resolution
in writing, together with written summaries prepared and submitted by the
Selling Parties, on the one hand, and the Buyers, on the other hand, within
thirty (30) days following the end of the Allocation Schedule Resolution
Period, to the Independent Accounting Firm. The Independent Accounting Firm
shall be instructed to, within twenty (20) days of such submission, resolve
any differences between the Buyers and the Selling Parties based solely upon
the written summaries submitted to the Independent Accounting Firm in
accordance with the preceding sentence, and, in reaching a decision on each
item of dispute, the Independent Accounting Firms position shall be limited
to either the Selling Parties or the Buyers position set forth in such
written summaries on each disputed item. Such resolution shall, in the
absence of manifest error, be final, binding and conclusive upon each of the
parties to this Agreement. The Buyers

 



12  and the Selling Parties agree that the Independent Accounting Firm must
agree to the time periods set forth in this _Section 1.10_ as a condition to
its engagement and such time periods shall only be extended upon the showing
of good cause by the Independent Accounting Firm to each of the parties to
this Agreement. The costs, fees and expenses of the Independent Accounting
Firm shall be borne by the non-prevailing party or, in the event of a dispute
involving multiple items, by the party whose overall position varies the
greatest from that of the Independent Accounting Firm. The Buyers and the
Selling Parties agree to file their respective IRS Forms 8594, and all
federal, state, and local Tax Returns, in accordance with the Allocation
Schedule as finally determined under this _Section 1.10_.

Section 1.11. _Inventory Purchase Price_. The Selling Parties shall conduct or
shall engage a mutually acceptable inventory valuation firm, at the expense of
the Buyers, to conduct, commencing at the close of business on the Business
Day immediately preceding the Closing Date or on such other date mutually
agreed upon by the Buyers and the Selling Parties prior to Closing, a full
review and valuation of the Inventory (the "Inventory Count"). The Inventory
Count shall be (i) conducted at times and in a manner so as not to
unreasonably interfere with the Sellers operation of the Business, (ii)
completed not later than the Closing Date and (iii) completed in accordance
with the rules set forth in Annex B (the "Calculation Rules"). Representatives
of Buyers may, at Buyers election, observe and confirm such Inventory Count.
Upon the completion of the Inventory Count, the Buyers and the Selling
Parties shall each execute a jointly prepared statement setting forth the
quantity of each item of Inventory as identified during the Inventory Count
(the "Inventory Count Statement"). In addition, upon completion of the
Inventory Count, the aggregate value of the Inventory as of the completion of
the Inventory Count, valued according to the Calculation Rules and Inventory
Count Statement (the "Inventory Value"), shall be determined by the Selling
Parties in good faith. The Inventory Count as determined pursuant to this
_Section 1.11_ shall be the price payable by Buyers for the Inventory (the
"Inventory Purchase Price") and included in the consideration set forth in
_Section 1.06_ of this Agreement. On the fifth Business Day following the
date on which the Inventory Purchase Price is determined in accordance with
this _Section 1.11_: (i) if the Inventory Purchase Price exceeds the
Estimated Inventory Purchase Price, Parent shall pay BioScrip, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds the amount by which the Inventory
Purchase Price exceeds the Estimated Inventory Purchase Price; and (ii) if
the Inventory Purchase Price is less than the Estimated Inventory Purchase
Price, BioScrip shall pay Parent, by wire transfer of immediately available
funds the amount by which the Inventory Purchase Price exceeds the
Estimated Inventory Purchase Price. For the avoidance of doubt, if the
Inventory Purchase Price equals the Estimated Inventory Purchase Price, no
amounts will be due and payable.

Section 1.12. _Rejection of Assets_. If, between the date of this Agreement
and the Closing Date, the Buyers determine that any of the cost of moving any
of the Purchased Assets (other than Inventory) that are not housed within the
Transferred Facilities outweighs the value of such assets to the Buyers, the
Buyers may, upon notice to Sellers, reject such assets and such assets shall
remain the property of the applicable Selling Party,  _provided, however_ ,
that such rejection shall not have any impact on the consideration to be paid
to the Selling Parties pursuant to this Agreement.

Section 1.13. _Closing Date_. The Selling Parties, on the one hand, and the
Buyers, on the other hand, agree to use their respective reasonable best
efforts to satisfy all conditions to Closing such that the Closing Date shall
occur on or before the Termination Date. If the conditions to Closing have not
been satisfied and are not capable of being satisfied (and the applicable
parties have not otherwise agreed to waive such unsatisfied condition) prior
to the Termination Date solely due to (i) the failure to obtain consents for
the assignment of each Assigned Contract listed as a Required Consent; (ii)
the failure to satisfy the condition in _Section 9.01(c)_ with respect to
Pharmacy Permits for each Store (other than for Stores for which the use of a
POA is allowed by applicable Law); or (iii) the failure to obtain Lease
Consents for each Assigned Facility Lease (other than those Assigned
Facility Leases for which the Selling Parties are permitted to sublease,
license or otherwise arrange for the applicable Buyer to occupy

 



13  the premises demised by such lease and continue to operate the Store at that
location), then BioScrip, in its sole discretion, will be permitted, by
providing the Buyers with written notice not less than five (5) Business
Days prior to the Termination Date, to take any of the following actions in
order to eliminate the requirements, deliveries or conditions set forth in
clauses (i), (ii) or (iii), as applicable, in order to effect the Closing on
or before the Termination Date:

(a) with respect to clause (i) in this _Section 1.13_, in the event that a
Required Consent for a particular Assigned Contract or Contracts is not
obtained, the Purchase Price shall be reduced by an amount determined in
accordance with Section 1.13(a) of the Disclosure Letter;

 

(b) with respect to clause (ii) in this _Section 1.13_, if after complying
with its obligations under  _Section 6.01_ of this Agreement, BioScrip
reasonably determines that the required licenses (including Pharmacy Permits)
as contemplated by _Section 9.01(c)_ of this Agreement with respect to a
Store or Stores in jurisdictions where use of a POA is not allowed by
applicable Law will not be obtained prior to the Termination Date, such Store
location (but not the accompanying assets at such Store location) shall be
excluded from the Purchased Assets and the Purchase Price shall be reduced by
an amount determined in accordance with Section 1.13(b) of the Disclosure
Letter; and

(c) with respect to clause (iii) in this _Section 1.13_, if after complying
with its obligations under _Section 6.06_ and _Section 6.07_ of this
Agreement, BioScrip reasonably determines that it cannot obtain a
particular Lease Consent and lease extension as set forth in Section 6.07 of
the Disclosure Letter prior to the Termination Date (other than with respect
to those Assigned Facility Leases for which the Selling Parties are permitted
to sublease, license or otherwise arrange for the applicable Buyer to occupy
the premises demised by such lease and continue to operate the Store at that
location), such Store location (but not the accompanying assets at such Store
location) shall be excluded from the Purchased Assets and the Purchase Price
shall be reduced by an amount determined in accordance with Section 1.13(b) of
the Disclosure Letter.

_provided, however_ , that the Selling Parties shall not be required to close
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement if the aggregate reductions in
the Purchase Price pursuant to this  _Section 1.13_ result in a Purchase
Price reduction greater than $35,000,000, provided, however, that the Buyers
may waive the conditions with respect to any or all Required Consents, receipt
of licenses, permits or Lease Consents and extensions necessary to ensure
that any Purchase Price Reduction does not exceed such amount.

Section 1.14.  _Post-Closing Event_. If the Post-Closing Event occurs on or
prior to the Post-Closing Date, then (I) the Purchase Price payable in
accordance with _Section 1.06(a)(1)_ shall be increased in an amount equal to
$45,000,000 and if the Closing has occurred, then within 5 Business Days of
the Post-Closing Event, Parent shall pay BioScrip by wire transfer of
immediately available funds a cash amount equal to $45,000,000 and (II) the
Basket Amount shall increase to $2,762,000 and (III) the Cap shall increase
to $29,500,000.

Section 1.15. _Final Adjustment Determination and Adjustment Amount._  

(a) As promptly as practicable following the Closing Date (but in any event
within thirty (30) days), BioScrip shall prepare and deliver to Parent a
schedule setting forth BioScrips calculation of the Transferred Current
Assets and other Prorated Charges paid or payable by one party but allocable
to the other party in accordance with  _Section 1.08(a)_, as well as the
Adjustment Deficit or Adjustment Surplus, as applicable (the "Preliminary
Adjustment Schedule"). Except as disclosed in Section 1.15(a) of the
Disclosure Letter, such calculation shall be made, in all material respects,
in accordance with GAAP as in effect as of the date of this Agreement applied
on a basis consistent with the preparation of the Selling Parties
consolidated year end financial statements and utilizing the calculation
methodology set forth in Section 1.15(a) of the Disclosure Letter.

 



14 (b) The Buyers shall have thirty (30) days following delivery of the
Preliminary Adjustment Schedule during which to review the Adjustment
Schedule. Following delivery to Parent of the Adjustment Schedule, BioScrip
shall (i) provide Parent and the Buyers, with copies of, or reasonable access
during normal business hours to, all information reasonably requested by the
Buyers, and (ii) cooperate with the reasonable requests of the Buyers and the
authorized representatives of the Buyers with respect to the review of the
Adjustment Schedule, including by providing on a timely basis all information
reasonably necessary in reviewing the Adjustment Schedule. The Buyers may
dispute BioScrips calculation of the Adjustment Deficit or Adjustment
Surplus, as applicable by delivering to BioScrip within such 30-day period
following delivery of the Preliminary Adjustment Schedule a written notice of
such dispute (a "Notice of Dispute") which shall set forth in reasonable
detail the basis for such dispute. In the event the Buyers do not deliver a
Notice of Dispute within such 30-day period, the Preliminary Adjustment
Schedule shall be deemed to be the Final Adjustment Schedule. BioScrip and the
Buyers shall cooperate in good faith to resolve any such dispute as promptly
as possible, and upon such resolution, the Final Adjustment Schedule shall be
prepared in accordance with the agreement of BioScrip and the Buyers.

(c) In the event that BioScrip and the Buyers are unable to resolve any
dispute regarding the Adjustment Schedule within 15 days following the
delivery of the Notice of Dispute (the "Adjustment Resolution Period"),
BioScrip and Parent shall submit the items remaining for resolution in
writing, together with written summaries prepared and submitted by BioScrip,
on the one hand, and the Buyers, on the other hand, within thirty (30) days
following the end of the Adjustment Resolution Period, to the Independent
Accounting Firm. The Independent Accounting Firm shall, within twenty (20)
days of such submission, resolve any differences between BioScrip and the
Buyers based solely upon the written summaries submitted to the Independent
Accounting Firm in accordance with the preceding sentence, and, in reaching a
decision on each item of dispute, the Independent Accounting Firms position
shall be limited to either BioScrips or the Buyers position set forth in
such written summaries on each disputed item. Such resolution shall, in the
absence of manifest error, be final, binding and conclusive upon each of the
parties to this Agreement. BioScrip and the Buyers agree that the Independent
Accounting Firm must agree to the time periods set forth in this _Section
1.15_ as a condition to its engagement and such time periods shall only be
extended upon the showing of good cause by the Independent Accounting Firm to
each of the parties to this Agreement. The costs, fees and expenses of the
Independent Accounting Firm shall be borne by the non-prevailing party or, in
the event of a dispute involving multiple items, by the party whose overall
position varies the greatest from that of the Independent Accounting Firm.

(d) For the purposes of this Agreement, "Final Adjustment Deficit" means the
Adjustment Deficit and "Final Adjustment Surplus" means the Adjustment
Surplus, in each case as finally agreed or determined in accordance with
this  _Section 1.15_. On the earlier of (A) the fifth Business Day following
the date on which the Final Adjustment Schedule is determined in accordance
with this _Section 1.15_ and (B) 180 days following the Closing Date: 

(i) the Buyers shall pay BioScrip, by wire transfer of immediately available
funds, in the case of a Final Adjustment Surplus, the amount of the Final
Adjustment Surplus; or

(ii) BioScrip shall pay the Buyers, by wire transfer of immediately available
funds, in the case of a Final Adjustment Deficit, the amount of the Final
Adjustment Deficit.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE SELLING PARTIES

 

Subject to the exceptions set forth in the corresponding sections of the
letter from BioScrip, dated as of the date of this Agreement, addressed to
the Buyers (the "Disclosure Letter"), each of the Selling Parties jointly and
severally represents and warrants to Buyers that:

existing and in good standing under the Laws of its respective jurisdiction of
organization, and has the requisite corporate power and authority to own its
properties and to carry on its business as presently conducted and is duly
qualified to do business and is in good standing (where such concept exists)
as a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its
business or the ownership or leasing of its properties makes such
qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified or in
good standing as a foreign corporation or have such power or authority would
not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect. Complete and correct copies of the certificate of
incorporation and by-Laws of each Seller as currently in effect have been made
available to Parent and, as so made available, are in full force and effect,
and no other organizational documents are applicable to or binding upon any
Seller.

Section 2.02. _Authority; Enforceability_. Each Selling Party has all
necessary corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement
and the Ancillary Agreements to which it is a party, to perform its
obligations hereunder and thereunder and to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby. The execution, delivery and performance by
each Selling Party of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements to which
it is a party and the consummation by each Selling Party of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby have been duly and validly authorized by all
necessary corporate action on the part of each Selling Party and no other
corporate proceedings on the part of any Selling Party are necessary pursuant
to its governing documents or the Laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation to
authorize this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements to which it is a party or
to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. Each Selling
Partys Board of Directors has, at a meeting duly called and held or by
written consent, (i) approved this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby and (ii) determined that the terms of this Agreement are fair to and

and delivery of this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement or the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. This Agreement has been
duly executed and delivered by the Selling Parties, and each Ancillary
Agreement will be duly executed and delivered by each Selling Party that is a
party thereto, and, assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by the
other parties hereto and thereto, constitutes or will constitute a legal,
valid and binding agreement of each Selling Party enforceable against each
Selling Party in accordance with its terms, subject to the effects of
bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and
other similar Laws relating to or affecting creditors rights generally and
general equitable principles (whether considered in a proceeding in equity or
at Law).

Section 2.03. _Non-Contravention; Material Contracts_.

 

(a) Other than as set forth in Section 2.03(a) of the Disclosure Letter, the

party, except, in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) of this _Section
2.03(a)_, for any such conflict, violation, breach, default, loss, right or
other occurrence which would not reasonably be expected to have, individually
or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. Schedule 2.03(a) shall also
identify such consents as the Selling Parties and the Buyers agree are
required consents (the "Required Consents")).

(b) All contracts, agreements or leases other than real property leases that,
(i) during the year ended December 31, 2011 involved the receipt or payment by
any Selling Party or their Affiliates related to the Business of $500,000 or
more in the aggregate or (ii) that are otherwise material to the operation of

performed by them to date under the Assigned Contracts and the Assigned
Facility Leases and are not (with or without the lapse of time or the giving
of notice, or both) in breach thereunder, except, in the case of clauses (i),
(ii) and (iii) of this _Section 2.03(c)_, for any such default, failure,
invalidity, unenforceability, non-performance, breach or other occurrence
which would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

 

Section 2.04. _Governmental Consents_. The execution, delivery and performance
by each Selling Party of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements to which
it is a party and the consummation by each Selling Party of the transactions

to, any Governmental Authority, except as required under, pursuant to or with
respect to (a) the HSR Act, (b) consents or approvals of Governmental
Authorities in connection with the permissible transfer of Permits
and obtaining Pharmacy Permits, (c) the Exchange Act, and (d) except for the
Required Consents, any other consent, approval, authorization, permit, action,
filing or notification, the failure of which, individually or in the
aggregate, would not and will not result in a material violation or material
breach of any of the terms, conditions or provisions of, or constitute a
default, an event of default or an event creating rights of acceleration,
termination, revocation or cancellation or a loss of rights under (i) any
material licenses, Permits, including Pharmacy Permits or approvals issued by

the Purchased Assets is subject. To the Knowledge of the Selling Parties,
there is no reasonable basis for any such action or of any governmental
investigations relating to the Business or the Purchased Assets. Since
January 1, 2008, no Selling Party has received any notice of any complaints
filed against any Seller under HIPAA or any other applicable patient privacy
and data protection Laws, and to the Knowledge of the Selling Parties, no
such violation exists.

of any Governmental Authority or other Person to take any Leased Real

(a) Each Selling Party is, in respect to the Business, in compliance in all
material respects with all applicable Laws (including, without limitation,
the Fair Labor Standards Act) respecting labor, employment and employment
practices, occupational health and safety, or workplace safety and
insurance/workers compensation Laws, terms and conditions of employment and

Governmental Authority responsible for the enforcement of Labor Laws to
conduct a material investigation or audit of or affecting any Selling Party
with respect to any Facility and, to the Knowledge of the Selling Parties, no
such investigation is in progress. Except as would not reasonably be expected
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect, there

Business, complied in all material respects with all applicable Law
administered by the Department of Homeland Security, including, but not
limited to, the Immigration Reform and Control Act. Except to the extent of a
fraudulent or wrongful act or misrepresentation by a Business Employee
(including by providing any Selling Party with false or wrongfully
obtained documentation), of which actions the Selling Parties have no
Knowledge, each Business Employee is a United States citizen or has a current
and valid work visa or otherwise has the lawful right to work in the United
States. Each Selling Party has in its files a Form I-9 that, is validly and

Employee for whom such form is required under applicable Law, in each case
other than to the extent any such Form I-9 is not validly and properly
completed in accordance with applicable Law as a result of a fraudulent or
wrongful act or misrepresentation by the corresponding Business Employee
(including by providing any Selling Party with false documentation) of which
act the Selling Parties have no Knowledge.

(c) There are no material claims pending before a court or administrative
agency or, to the Knowledge of the Selling Parties, threatened, against any

expected to affect the Facilities or the Purchased Assets, arising out of any
statute, ordinance or regulation relating to unfair labor practices,
discrimination, employment practices or occupational or safety and health
standards.

Section 2.11.  _Environmental Compliance_. (i) In connection with or relating
to the Facilities or Purchased Assets, to the Knowledge of the Selling
Parties, the activities of the Selling Parties and their Affiliates comply and
have complied, in all material respects, with all applicable Environmental
Laws, and such Selling Parties or their Affiliates possess and comply, and
have complied, with all applicable Environmental Permits required under such
Laws to operate as they currently operate, in each case in

 



20  connection with or relating to the Facilities or Purchased Assets; (ii)
except as would not reasonably be expected individually or in the aggregate to
have a Material Adverse Effect, there are no, and there have not been any,
Materials of Environmental Concern at any of the Facilities or Purchased
Assets under circumstances that have resulted in or are reasonably likely to
result in Environmental Liability of the Sellers or any of their Affiliates
under any applicable Environmental Laws; (iii) in connection with or relating
to the Facilities or Purchased Assets, except as would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, none of the Sellers or
their Affiliates has received any written notification alleging that it is

Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act or
similar foreign, state or local Law concerning, any release or threatened
release of Materials of Environmental Concern at any location except, with
respect to any such notification or request for information concerning any
such release or threatened release, to the extent such matter has been fully
resolved such that no Environmental Liabilities exist and no further action is
required with the appropriate foreign, federal, state or local regulatory
authority or otherwise; and (iv) Sellers have made available to Parent
all material reports of environmental assessments, audits and similar
investigations in the possession of the Sellers and conducted since January 1,
2008 in connection with or relating to the Facilities or Purchased Assets.
There are no Actions relating to the Facilities or Purchased Assets and
arising under Environmental Laws pending or, to the Knowledge of the Selling
Parties, threatened against the Selling Parties or any of their Affiliates
which would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate,
a Material Adverse Effect. In connection with or relating to the Facilities or
Purchased Assets, except as would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect, at each property where Asbestos-Containing Material
("ACM") has been identified, all ACM is non-friable, encapsulated or abated
and the Sellers have implemented an Asbestos Operation and Management Plan if
the ACM is still present.

 

Section 2.12. _Financial Schedules_. Set forth in Section 2.12 of the
Disclosure Letter are (i) unaudited selected results of operations data for
the Business for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010 and the eleven months
ended November 30, 2011 (collectively, the "Separate Operations Data") and
(ii) unaudited selected balance sheet data as of November 30, 2011 (the
"Separate Balance Sheet Data"). The Separate Operations Data and the Separate
Balance Sheet Data have been compiled from source books, records and financial
reports of BioScrip and its Subsidiaries. Such source books, records and
financial reports were prepared by BioScrip in the ordinary course of its
business, are complete and accurate in all material respects and were subject
to BioScrip internal controls. The allocations of the Separate Operations
Data among the Business are consistent with Section 2.12(a) of the Disclosure
Letter and the allocations of the Separate Balance Sheet Data are allocated in
the manner described in Section 2.12(b) of the Disclosure Letter. The

conducted the Businesses in the ordinary course in all material respects
consistent with past practice, and, since such date, there has not been any
change, event or occurrence which has had or would reasonably be expected to

terminated or provided formal notice of its intention to terminate its
relationship with any Seller or materially reduced or provided formal notice
of its intention to materially reduce the aggregate value of its annual
transactions with any Seller. "Material Supplier" means the ten (10) largest

except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, be or reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Regulatory Event. To the Knowledge of the
Selling Parties, no event has occurred that, with the giving of notice, the

Parties in any Payment Program;

(f) no Selling Party nor, to the Knowledge of the Selling Parties, any of

the Buyers shall not, without the prior written consent of BioScrip (which
shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), contact or
communicate with any vendor, employee, independent contractor or other
business partner of the Selling Parties with respect to or in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (iv) if BioScrips
auditors or other third-party service providers shall so request in connection
with the release of any books, records or other information (including work
papers), the Buyers agree to execute a customary release as may be reasonably
requested by such auditors or third-party service providers. Accordingly, to
the extent that providing access to certain information or personnel or taking
certain action under this _Section 4.02(a)_ would not so comply in a given
form or manner or pursuant to a given process, the parties to this Agreement
shall agree on a form or manner of access or conduct that will both enable the
Buyers to operate the Transferred Facilities, and conduct business
and service customers at the Transferred Facilities following the Effective
Time and will comply with applicable Law and any such policy ( _e.g.,_ pricing
information may be redacted from the item files and pharmacy reimbursement
rates may be redacted from third party plan information). To the extent of
any conflict between this _Section 4.02_ and the Access Agreement in terms of
information or access to be provided, the terms of the Access Agreement shall
prevail.

 

(b) Between the date hereof and through and including the Closing Date, upon
reasonable notice and at reasonable times, the Sellers will give the Buyers
and their respective authorized representatives access to personnel,
facilities and books and records of Sellers to the extent relating to the
Business and the Purchased Assets and will permit the Buyers to make copies
thereof and will cooperate with regard to such inspections as it may
reasonably request. The Buyers acknowledge and agree that the Buyers and their
respective representatives shall not be afforded access to any employee
records or other records or information the disclosure of which would be
prohibited by any applicable Law. Any and all such information gathered by the
Buyers shall be kept strictly confidential. In the event the transaction
contemplated herein is not consummated, such information shall be returned to
the Sellers or destroyed in accordance with Sellers instructions. After the
date hereof and prior to Closing, the Buyers will be provided a reasonable
opportunity to interview individuals being considered for
Transferred Employee or status, and to conduct the Buyers normal pre-
employment activities, including but not limited to drug testing and
confirmation of citizenship (or other authority to work).

 



30 (c) As soon as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement
but, in no event prior to the date that the transactions contemplated hereby
are generally communicated to employees of the Business, the Sellers shall
permit the Buyers and their Representatives access to each Transferred
Facility after normal business hours (unless other times are permitted by the
Sellers) in order to prepare as-built surveys. During the forty-five (45) days
preceding the Closing Date, the Sellers shall permit the Buyers and their
Representatives access to each Transferred Facility after normal business
hours (unless other times are permitted by the Sellers) to install wiring for
communication devices and other store systems (including computers and other
systems) and take other similar action at such Facility, all at the Buyers
cost and without causing material damage to such Facility; provided that the
Buyers shall not be permitted, without the prior written consent of the
appropriate Seller, which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld or
delayed, or unless contemplated by the Transition Services Agreement, to
install any equipment in the Transferred Facilities until immediately
following the Effective Time. The Buyers agree to repair any damage which may
be caused due to the exercise of their rights pursuant to this _Section
4.02(c)_ and to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Seller Indemnitees
from any and all Damages arising out of or in any way connected with the
Buyers exercise of their rights pursuant to this  _Section 4.02(c)_.

(d) The Sellers obligation to provide the foregoing access shall be
conditioned on the requirement that the Buyers shall not unreasonably
interfere with the Sellers Business.

(e) After the Effective Time, the Selling Parties and their Affiliates will
hold, and will use their respective reasonable best efforts to cause their
respective officers, directors, employees, accountants, counsel, consultants,
advisors and agents to hold, in confidence, unless required to disclose by
judicial or administrative process or by other requirements of Law or by the
rules, regulations or policies of any United States or foreign securities
exchange, all documents and information concerning the Purchased Assets and
Assumed Liabilities, except to the extent that such information can be shown
to have been (i) in the public domain prior to the Effective Time, (ii) in the
public domain at or after the Effective Time through no fault of the
Selling Parties or their Affiliates or (iii) later lawfully acquired by the
Selling Parties from sources other than those related to their prior ownership
of the Business; _provided_ that the Selling Parties may disclose such
information to their officers, directors, employees, successors, accountants,
counsel, consultants, advisors and agents in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement so long as such Persons are informed by the
Selling Parties of the confidential nature of such information and are
directed by the Selling Parties to treat such information confidentially. The
obligation of the Selling Parties and their Affiliates to hold any such
information in confidence shall be satisfied if the Selling Parties exercise
the same care with respect to such information as they would take to preserve
the confidentiality of their own similar information. For so long as such
information remains subject to the foregoing confidentiality obligations,
the Selling Parties shall not use the same for any purpose other than tax,
accounting and regulatory and other compliance purposes and evaluating,
enforcing and performing their rights and obligations under this Agreement and
the Ancillary Agreements or otherwise in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby.

Section 4.03. _Notices of Certain Events_. From the date hereof until the
Closing Date, each party shall promptly notify the other party of:

(a) any written notice or other written communication from any Person
alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

 

(b) any written notice or other written communication from any Governmental
Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
and

 



31 (c) any change or fact of which it is aware that will or is reasonably likely
to result in any of the conditions set forth in Article 9 becoming incapable
of being satisfied.

Section 4.04. _Nonsolicitation; Proprietary Information; Noncompetition_.

(a) For a period of five years after the Closing Date, no Selling Party nor
any of their respective controlled Affiliates, shall directly or indirectly
through any of their respective stockholders, officers, directors, employees,
agents, or representatives or otherwise, recruit or otherwise solicit or
induce (i) any Transferred Employee or (ii) any member of senior management,
key employee or executive officer of any Buyer with whom such Selling Party
has become acquainted in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement to terminate his or her employment or other relationship with such
Buyer. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing shall prevent any Selling Party
or any of its Affiliates from soliciting or hiring any person (i) who is
terminated by any Buyer following the Closing or (ii) as result of a general
solicitation of employment not specifically directed toward employees of any
Buyer.

 

(b) Each Selling Party agrees that, for a period of five years after the
Closing Date, each Selling Party and each of its respective Affiliates and
their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, or representatives
shall hold in strict confidence all Proprietary Information it possesses. In
the event that any Selling Party or any of its respective Affiliates
or Representatives, as the case may be, is required by Law to disclose any
Proprietary Information, such Selling Party shall promptly notify the Parent
in writing so that the Parent may, at its sole cost and expense, seek a
protective order and/or other motion filed to prevent the production or
disclosure of Proprietary Information. If such motion has been denied, then
such Selling Party may disclose only such portion of the Proprietary
Information which is required by Law to be disclosed; provided, that, (A)
such Selling Party shall use reasonable best efforts to preserve the
confidentiality of the remainder of the Proprietary Information and (B) such
Selling Party shall not, and shall not permit any of its
respective Representatives to, oppose any motion for confidentiality brought
by the Parent in any such instance. The Selling Parties will continue to be
bound by their respective obligations pursuant to this _Section 4.04(b)_ for
any Proprietary Information that is not required to be disclosed pursuant to
the immediately preceding sentence above, or that has been afforded protective
treatment pursuant to such motion.

(c) Each Selling Party agrees that, for a period of two (2) years after the
Closing Date, each Selling Party and each of its respective Affiliates will
not solicit for employment any general manager, pharmacist-in-charge,
reimbursement manager or sales manager, in each case engaged in the infusion
business of any Buyer or any of their respective Affiliates; provided that in
each case, this _Section 4.04(c)_ shall not prohibit any advertisement or
general solicitation that is not specifically targeted at such persons.

(d) In furtherance of the sale of the Purchased Assets to Buyers hereunder by
virtue of the transactions contemplated hereby and to more effectively protect
the value of the Purchased Assets so sold, for a period of five years after
the Closing Date (the "Restricted Period"), to the greatest extent allowed by
Law, each Selling Party agrees that it shall not, and it shall cause each of
its respective controlled Affiliates to not, directly or indirectly through
their respective officers, directors, employees, stockholders, agents, or
representatives in any manner whatsoever, directly or indirectly, operate,
own, lease, engage or participate in as an owner, consultant, landlord,
partner, employee, joint venturer, shareholder or director, in, for, or in
connection with (i) the operation of any community retail drug pharmacy stores
or otherwise offering or selling any oral pharmaceutical products within fifty
(50) miles of any Store, (ii) except as expressly permitted by this
Agreement, offering or selling any oral transplant, HIV or oncology
pharmaceutical products anywhere in the United States or (iii) the operation
of any traditional mail or specialty mail service pharmacy business that is or
could reasonably be deemed to be competitive with the Business as conducted
as of the Effective Time anywhere within the United States; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that:

(i) any BioScrip Entity may sell or provide (a) injectable pharmaceutical
products and (b) oral Hepatitis C pharmaceutical products, in each case that
are prohibited by the immediately preceding paragraph, if such products (i)
are incidental to and offered only in combination with the goods and services
of such BioScrip Entitys infusion business, (ii) are maintained at DeMinimis
Sales Levels and (iii) are consistent with the operation of the Remaining
Business as conducted on the date of this Agreement;

 



32 (ii) if there is a Change of Control of BioScrip (excluding any acquisition of
a significant ownership stake of BioScrips business and operations or equity
by (a) Persons who are members of management of BioScrip immediately prior to
the Change of Control, (b) Persons who are not, immediately prior to the
Change of Control directly or indirectly engaged in a business that would
violate this _Section 4.04(d)_, or (c) any Person controlled by such Persons
described in (a) or (b)), this _Section 4.04(d)_ shall not apply to
the business and operations of the successor of BioScrips business and
operations (whether by merger, operation of Law or otherwise);

(iii) nothing in this _Section 4.04(d)_ shall limit the ability of any
BioScrip Entity to purchase any pharmacy that also conducts specialty pharmacy
activities, provided that, if such acquired business derives 40% or more of
its "Net Revenue" (net revenue as determined in accordance with GAAP
consistently applied) from activities that would be prohibited under this
_Section 4.04(d)_ ("Prohibited Acquired Business"), then within 12 months
following such acquisition, all or a portion of such Prohibited Acquired
Business shall be sold to an unrelated third party or parties (which may
include Buyer) or, alternatively, all or a portion of such Prohibited
Acquired Business shall be eliminated or terminated, such that thereafter such
acquired business derives no more than 25% of its Net Revenue derived from
such Prohibited Acquired Business; and

 

(iv) nothing in this _Section 4.04(d)_ shall limit the ability of any
BioScrip Entity from leasing or subleasing the Distribution Center.

(e) For purposes of this _Section 4.04_, "DeMinimis Sales Levels" shall
mean an amount determined on a per location and per therapeutic class basis
that does not exceed 115% of the Net Revenue compounded annually derived by
such location for such product for the preceding twelve full consecutive month
period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent an infusion patient is
converted to a patient who is treated with any injectable product subject to
the first paragraph of _Section 4.04(d)_ (the "Converted Patients"), any Net
Revenue derived from such Converted Patients shall be applied towards the
115% limit in the previous sentence and any Net Revenue derived from any
Converted Patients shall be added to Net Revenue for the preceding twelve (12)
month period on a pro forma basis. For locations controlled by any BioScrip
Entity as of the Closing Date, the measurement period shall be the twelve (12)
full month period immediately preceding the Closing Date and each twelve (12)
full month period thereafter prior to the fifth anniversary of the Closing
Date. For locations acquired by any BioScrip Entity that do not constitute
Prohibited Acquired Business, the measurement period shall be the twelve (12)
full month period immediately preceding the date of acquisition of such
location by any BioScrip Entity and each twelve (12) full month period
thereafter prior to the fifth anniversary of the Closing Date. If any BioScrip
Entity acquires operations to be consolidated with other BioScrip locations,
the DeMinimis Sales Levels shall be calculated on a pro forma basis based on
combined sales for the referenced time period.

(f) For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this _Section 4.04_ shall limit
(i) BioScrips or any of its Affiliates ability to provide chronic or acute
infusion and related products and services, (ii) the use

 



33  by a BioScrip Entity of unrelated third party retail pharmacies as first
dose infusion pharmacies or (iii) the ability of any BioScrip Entity to
jointly market its infusion business or otherwise collaborate with an
unrelated third party provider of traditional, community pharmacy, mail or
specialty products, provided that the Selling Parties receive no economic
benefit from the provision of such products and services of such unrelated
third party.

(g) Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the Selling Parties and their
respective Affiliates may acquire and hold, as a passive investment,
securities listed on a stock exchange or automated quotation system of any
Person to the extent that such investment does not directly or indirectly
confer upon the Sellers or any of their respective Affiliates more than five
percent of the voting power with respect to, or interests in the profits of,
such Person.

(h) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing shall prevent any BioScrip Entity
from (X) at any time, providing any injectable products and (Y) after the
third anniversary of the Closing Date, providing any oral products to the
extent that such injectable or oral products (i) replace infusion products
previously and customarily provided by infusion pharmacies, (ii) are
customarily provided by infusion pharmacies at such time, and (iii) are
incidental to and offered only in combination with the goods and services of
such BioScrip Entitys infusion business.

(i) During the Restricted Period and for a period of 12 months thereafter,
the Buyers and their Affiliates shall have the right, at their sole expense,
to perform an audit ("Audit") not more than once every calendar year with
respect to any facility operated by a BioScrip Entity or any controlled
Affiliate of the Selling Parties compliance with this _Section 4.04_ subject
to the following procedures:

(i) The Buyers shall utilize Persons to conduct Audits (such Persons,
"Auditors") who are qualified by appropriate training and experience for such
work, and shall perform all Audits in accordance with HIPAA and with
published administrative safeguards or procedures against unauthorized use or
disclosure (in the audit report or otherwise) of any individually identifiable
information (including protected health care information) contained in the
information to be audited, except that no Auditor shall perform any duties
with respect to the Parents or any of its controlled Affiliates infusion
business, except with respect to Converted Patients. For the avoidance of
doubt, such Auditor shall be subject to the terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement and shall execute a business associate agreement reasonably
satisfactory to the Auditors and the Selling Parties.

 

(ii) The Selling Parties must be contacted to initiate an Audit. The Selling
Parties will identify an audit coordinator who will have day-to-day
responsibility for coordinating and facilitating the Audit. The Buyers will
provide reasonable advance notice of its intent to conduct an Audit and will
provide information reasonably requested by the Selling Parties. Further, the
Buyers will use reasonable best efforts to provide the Selling Parties at
least three Business Days advance notice of the Audit.

(iii) The Parties shall use (and shall cause their representatives to use)
reasonable best efforts so that Audits are performed in a manner so as to
minimize disruption to each Parties respective businesses. The Selling
Parties shall provide full cooperation to the Buyers and the Auditors in their
conduct of the Audits, including furnishing all reasonably requested
information on a timely basis. Notwithstanding the foregoing, except
as contemplated by this _Section 4.04(i)_, solely with respect to this
_Section 4.04_, the Selling Parties shall not be obligated to provide any
access to any facility of any BioScrip Entity. Any third party Auditors
utilized by the Buyers, if any, must execute a confidentiality agreement in
form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Selling Parties, provided,
that such confidentiality agreement shall, other than as required by
applicable Law, in no way, limit the ability of such Auditors to communicate
with the Buyers.

 



34 (iv) Upon completion of an Audit, the Buyers may, in their sole discretion,
deliver to the Selling Parties such information as the Buyers deem
appropriate in order to address with the Selling Parties any of the Audit
results. The Selling Parties shall have thirty days following receipt of such
information from the Buyers to provide a response to the Buyers. Promptly
following such thirty (30)-day period, representatives of the Buyers and the
Selling Parties shall meet (the "Audit Dispute Meeting") in order to (i)
review and discuss such information and (ii) mutually agree upon the
appropriate manner in which to respond to the issues presented by such
information.

(v) For disputes that are unresolved within forty-five (45) days of the Audit
Dispute Meeting (the "Audit Dispute Resolution Period"), BioScrip and Parent
shall submit the items remaining for resolution in writing, together
with written summaries prepared and submitted by BioScrip, on the one hand,
and the Buyers, on the other hand, within thirty (30) days following the end
of the Audit Dispute Resolution Period, to a mutually agreeable independent
third party, or if BioScrip and Parent are unable within five (5) days of the
end of the Audit Dispute Resolution Period to agree on such third party to the
Independent Accounting Firm. The independent third party or Independent
Accounting Firm shall, within twenty (20) days of such submission, resolve
any differences between BioScrip and the Buyers. Such resolution shall, in the
absence of manifest error, be final, binding and conclusive upon each of the
parties to this Agreement. BioScrip and the Buyers agree that the independent
third party or Independent Accounting Firm must agree to the time periods set
forth in this _Section 4.04(i)_ as a condition to its engagement and such
time periods shall only be extended upon the showing of good cause by the
independent third party or Independent Accounting Firm to each of the parties
to this Agreement. The costs, fees and expenses of the independent third party
or Independent Accounting Firm shall be borne by the non-prevailing party.

(vi) The foregoing dispute resolution process shall not be deemed to restrict
the ability of Buyers to seek injunctive relief in the event of any violation
of the Selling Parties of this _Section 4.04_.

Section 4.05.  _Prescription Files_. Commencing on the Closing Date and in
accordance with a schedule to be provided by the Buyers, the Sellers will
deliver the Prescription Files to the Buyers, both in original hard copy
format and in an electronic format reasonably acceptable to the Buyers in
accordance with all applicable state board of pharmacy regulations; _provided
that_ , the Sellers shall preserve and maintain copies of the Prescription
Files at the applicable Facilities in accordance with all applicable state
board of pharmacy regulations; _provided, further, that,_ the cost of any
conversion into such mutually agreed upon electronic format shall be at the
Buyers sole cost and expense. The Selling Entities will provide
all reasonable cooperation to the Buyers in this process. After the Effective
Time, the Sellers will afford promptly to each of the Buyers and their agents
reasonable access (with an opportunity to make copies) (subject, however, to
confidentiality and similar non-disclosure obligations) during normal
business hours and upon reasonable notice to the Sellers, the Sellers
prescription records as may reasonably be required by the Buyers for
legitimate business purposes.

 

Section 4.06. _Matters Related to Prescriptions_. Prior to the Closing Date,
the Sellers shall use reasonable best efforts to fill and deliver to
customers of the Facilities any partial-fill prescriptions with a remaining
quantity balance as of the Closing Date (each, an "IOU Prescription"). For any
IOU Prescriptions remaining on the Closing Date, the Sellers shall credit the
prescription to the applicable customer or to the third-party payor, on the
Closing Date. The Buyers assume no liability for IOU Prescriptions. In
addition, prior to the Closing Date, the Sellers shall reverse and return
to stock any filled prescriptions that have not been picked up, shipped or
otherwise delivered, providing all necessary notice to any third-party payors,
and shall provide to the Buyers a list of such prescriptions so that the
Buyers are prepared to fill such prescriptions on or after the Closing Date.

 



35 Section 4.07. _Maintenance of Licenses and Provider Numbers; Assistance in
Transfer of Licenses, Permits and Registrations._

(a) The Selling Parties shall use their respective reasonable best efforts
to maintain in good standing in all respects, until the later of five (5)
days after (i) the Closing Date or (ii) the expiration of any applicable POA
and related affidavit (with respect to the State of Texas), any and all
licenses, permits or approvals required in order for Selling Parties to
lawfully operate the Business as conducted on the date hereof and for the
Buyers to operate the Business as contemplated under any applicable POA or
affidavit.

 

(b) The Sellers shall, within three (3) Business Days of the date of this
Agreement shall ensure that NPPES and CMS (through the submission of a form
855S or other appropriate submission) has properly been notified of the full
and correct United States Postal Service for each Store.

(c) The Sellers will use reasonable best efforts to assist the Buyers in
obtaining the transfer of the Permits, including incurring reasonable costs,
entering into the POAs, directing its employees to cooperate with such
transfer and making any notifications required to be sent by the Sellers to
the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration ("DEA") and applicable state pharmacy
boards prior to the Effective Time. It is understood that the Buyers are
responsible for any expenses associated with any of the foregoing transfers or
assignments.

Section 4.08.  _Controlled Substances Inventory_. To the extent required by
applicable Law or DEA regulations in context of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, the Sellers will undertake and deliver to Buyers at each
Facility an inventory of "controlled substances" located at such Facility, as
close as practicable prior to the Effective Time.

 

Section 4.09. _Telephone and Facsimile Numbers_. The Selling Parties shall
file or provide the Buyers information required for the Buyers to file a
change form with the applicable phone company, including billing information,
related to each phone and facsimile number of the Sellers set forth in Section
1.01(q) of the Disclosure Letter in order to authorize the applicable phone
company to transfer such numbers to the applicable Buyer as of the close of
Business on the date immediately preceding the Closing Date and thereafter
shall promptly take such reasonable additional actions of the Sellers as
are required to transfer ownership of such numbers to the applicable Buyer.
The Buyers shall take all steps required to be taken by the Buyers by the
applicable Buyers phone company in order to permit transfer of such telephone
and facsimile numbers as of the Closing Date; provided, however, that in the
event the applicable phone company is unable to transfer any such numbers to
the applicable Buyer as of the close of business on the Business Day
immediately preceding the Closing Date, the applicable Seller shall, pending
the effectiveness of such transfer, promptly forward any such calls or data
received by such Seller in a manner reasonably acceptable to applicable Buyer
to a phone or facsimile number, as applicable, provided by such Buyer at
least one (1) Business Day prior to the Business Day immediately preceding the
Closing Date.

 

Section 4.10. _Data Transfer Requirements_. Not less than ten (10) days prior
to the Closing Date, the Buyers and the Selling Parties shall have agreed to
a final approach for the conversion of Prescription Files (including
e-commerce), such Prescription Files shall have been converted in accordance
with such agreed final approach, and a user interface test with respect to
patient outreach, prescription transfer and transfer of prescription images
shall have been performed by the Buyers and the Selling Parties immediately
after such conversion, which test shall have produced results reasonably
acceptable to the Buyers.

 



36 Section 4.11. _Contracts_. __ On or prior to the Closing Date, the Selling
Parties shall have delivered or otherwise made available to the Buyers copies
of all material contracts, agreements and commitments in the possession of the
Selling Parties on the date of this Agreement or that come into the possession
of the Selling Parties between the date of this Agreement and the Effective
Time that relate to the ownership or operation of the Business or the
Purchased Assets that are not Assigned Contracts, provided, however, that the
Selling Parties may redact or omit from such copies any information related
solely to the Remaining Business. In the event that such material contracts,
agreements and commitments are provided by any means other than actual
delivery of physical copies, such material contracts, agreements and
commitments shall be available to the Buyers for a period of not less than
sixty (60) days.

 

Section 4.12. _Exclusivity_. During the period from the date hereof to the
Closing Date or the date this Agreement is terminated in accordance with
provisions hereof, no Selling Party nor any Affiliate thereof nor any of their
respective Affiliates, nor any of their respective officers, directors,
employees, stockholders, agents, shall directly, or indirectly through
Representatives, initiate, enter into any agreement, discussion, negotiation
with or provide any information to, any other corporation, firm, entity or
other persons or initiate, solicit, encourage, entertain or consider any
inquiries or proposals, with respect to (i) the possible disposition of any
of the Transferred Facilities or the Purchased Assets, (ii) any sale of any
shares of capital stock of, or business combination involving any, Seller or
any Affiliate thereof, whether by way of merger, consolidation, share

this Agreement or that would otherwise have a Material Adverse Effect (an
"Acquisition Transaction"). The Sellers shall promptly communicate to the

Acquisition Transaction and any request by or indication of interest on the
part of any third party with respect to initiation of any Acquisition
Transaction or discussions with respect thereto.

collection methods consistent with past practices. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the Sellers shall obtain Buyers written consent
prior to engaging a third party to collect any Accounts Receivable (in a

be unreasonably withheld provided that Sellers facilitate a meeting (whether
in person or telephonically) between Buyers and such third party to discuss
such partys collection practices, policies and procedures.

Section 4.14. _Required Employees_. In the event that the Required Employees
do not execute and deliver non-competition and non-solicitation agreements
with the Buyers substantially in the form set forth in Section 4.14 of the

employment by Buyers in accordance with _Section 8_ of this Agreement (or
where such Required Employee is not offered employment due to failure to
satisfactorily satisfy drug screening, background checks and eligibility to

Selling Parties shall take the actions as specified in Section 4.14 of the
Disclosure Letter.

 

Section 4.15. _Post-Closing Receivables_. If at any time following the
Effective Time, the Selling Parties or any of their Affiliates receive any

Parent any such amounts received.

 



37 ARTICLE 5

COVENANTS OF THE BUYERS

Each Buyer agrees that:

Section 5.01. _Confidentiality_. Prior to the Effective Time and after any
earlier termination of this Agreement, the Buyers and their respective
Affiliates will hold, and will use their commercially reasonable best efforts
to cause their respective officers, directors, employees,
accountants, counsel, consultants, advisors and agents to hold, in
confidence, unless compelled to disclose by judicial or administrative process
or by other requirements of Law or by the rules, regulations or policies of
any United States or foreign securities exchange, all documents and
information concerning the Business that the Selling Parties have furnished to
the Buyers or any of their Affiliates in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, except to the extent that such information
can be shown to have been (i) in the public domain through no fault of the
Buyers or any of their respective Affiliates or (ii) later lawfully acquired
by the Buyers or any of their respective Affiliates from sources other
than the Selling Parties; _provided_ that the Buyers may disclose such
information to its officers, directors, employees, accountants, counsel,
consultants, advisors and agents in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement so long as such Persons are informed by the
Buyers of the confidential nature of such information and are directed by the
Buyers to treat such information confidentially. The obligation of the Buyers
or any of their respective Affiliates to hold any such information in
confidence shall be satisfied if they exercise the same care with respect to
such information as they would take to preserve the confidentiality of their
own similar information. If this Agreement is terminated prior to
the Effective Time, the Buyers and their respective Affiliates will, and will
use their respective reasonable best efforts to cause their respective
officers, directors, employees, accountants, counsel, consultants, advisors
and agents to, destroy or deliver to the Selling Parties, upon request, all
documents and other materials, and all copies thereof, obtained by the Buyers
or any of their respective Affiliates or on their behalf from the Selling
Parties in connection with this Agreement that are subject to such
confidence.

Section 5.02. _Access_. After the Closing Date, the Buyers will afford
promptly to each of the Selling Parties and their agents reasonable access
(with an opportunity to make copies) (subject, however, to confidentiality and
similar non-disclosure obligations), so long as the appropriate Selling
Parties provide the appropriate Buyers with a reasonable indemnity upon
request, during normal business hours and upon reasonable notice, to the
Buyers books, records (whether in hard copy or computer format), workpapers,
contracts, commitments, Tax Returns, personnel and records relating to the
Transferred Facilities or the Purchased Assets as the Selling Parties shall
reasonably request for any reasonable business purpose relating to the Selling
Parties prior ownership or operation of the Transferred Facilities or the
Purchased Assets; _provided_ that any such access by the Selling Parties shall
not unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the business of the Buyers. The
Selling Parties shall bear all of the out-of-pocket costs and expenses
(including attorneys fees, but excluding reimbursement for general overhead,
salaries and employee benefits) reasonably incurred in connection with the
foregoing.

 

Section 5.03. _Contractual Overpayments_. If at any time in the one-year
period following the Effective Time, the Buyers or any of their Affiliates
receive a refund amount or a reduction in an amount payable from a vendor that
relates to a contractual overpayment under any of the Assigned Contracts or
Assigned Facility Leases actually paid by the Selling Parties or
their respective Affiliates prior to the Effective Time, the Buyers shall
promptly pay to BioScrip an amount equal to the amount of such refund or
reduction, provided, that, if any such amount is credited against amounts
payable to such vendor by the applicable Buyer, the Buyers shall "make whole"
the Selling Parties or their respective Affiliates by promptly paying such
make whole amount to BioScrip.

 



38 Section 5.04. _HIPAA Privacy Standards_. (a) After the Effective Time,
the Buyers shall make the Prescription Files available for access and
amendment to individuals in accordance with the Health Insurance Portability
and Accountability Act of 1996 privacy standards (the "HIPAA Privacy

require Parent or any Affiliate thereof without its consent, which consent
shall not unreasonably be withheld, to agree to any particular remedy,
including without limitation, (i) executing settlements, undertakings, consent
decrees, stipulations or other agreements with any Governmental Authority (or
with any private party, but only in this latter case, in order to vacate,

that in connection with such efforts the Buyers or the Selling Parties sell or
otherwise dispose of any of the Purchased Assets and the Closing occurs, the
Buyers will be entitled to retain all net proceeds received from the
applicable sale or disposition to a third party.

Section 6.03. _Certain Filings._ The Buyers and the Selling Parties shall
cooperate with one another (a) in determining whether any action by or in
respect of, or filing with, any Governmental Authority is required, or any

transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (b) in taking such actions
or making any such filings, furnishing information required in connection
therewith and seeking timely to obtain any such actions, consents, approvals
or waivers. The Selling Parties shall obtain and deliver to Buyers at the

Taxes as transferee in connection with the consummations of the transactions
contemplated hereby.

Section 6.04. _Public Announcements._ From the date hereof through the
Closing Date, no public release or announcement concerning the transactions

its reasonable best efforts to allow the other parties reasonable time
to comment on such release or announcement in advance of such issuance;

respective employees

 



41  after reasonable prior notice to, and consultation with, the other;

ARTICLE 7

 

TAX MATTERS

Section 7.01. _Tax Representations._ The Selling Parties hereby jointly and
severally represent and warrant to Buyers that:

 

(a) the Sellers have filed or caused to be filed all Tax Returns required to
be filed by or with respect to the Business and the Purchased Assets. All
such Tax Returns were duly and timely filed (after giving effect to any
extensions) and are true, correct and complete in all material respects. The
Sellers have timely paid, or made provision to pay, all material Taxes
owed with respect to the Business and the Purchased Assets. None of the
Sellers have waived or been requested to waive any statute of limitations in
respect of Taxes owed by it, to the extent such Taxes relate to the Business
and the Purchased Assets, which waiver is currently in effect. There are no
Liens for Taxes on any of the Purchased Assets that arose in connection with
the failure to pay any Taxes when due. All Taxes (including with respect to
employees of the Business, income Taxes, social security and other payroll
Taxes), that the Sellers are required by Law to withhold or collect for
payment have been duly withheld and collected, and either paid to the
appropriate Governmental Authority, set aside in accounts for such purpose,
or accrued or reserved against. None of the Purchased Assets is "tax-exempt
use property" within the meaning of Section 168(h) of the Code; and

 



42 (b) there is no claim or dispute concerning any liability for Taxes of the
Selling Parties, to the extent such Taxes relate to the Business or the
Purchased Assets, claimed or raised in writing by any taxing authority.

 

Section 7.02. _Other Tax Matters._

(a) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, this _Section
7.02(a)_ shall govern cooperation with respect to Tax matters. The Buyers and
the Selling Parties agree to furnish or cause to be furnished to each other,
upon request, as promptly as practicable, such information and assistance
relating to the Business and the Purchased Assets (including access to books
and records) as is reasonably necessary for the filing of all Tax Returns,
the making of any election relating to Taxes, the preparation for any audit by
any taxing authority, and the prosecution or defense of any Action relating to
any Tax. Except with respect to information that is generally available to
the public, the party requesting such information shall treat such
information so obtained in a manner consistent with the way in which it treats
its own records. The Buyers and the Selling Parties shall retain all books and
records with respect to Taxes pertaining to the Purchased Assets for a period
of at least seven years following the Closing Date. The Buyers and the Selling
Parties shall cooperate with each other in the conduct of any audit or other
proceeding relating to Taxes involving the Purchased Assets or the Business.

(b) The Apportioned Obligations shall be apportioned between the Sellers and
the Buyers in accordance with _Section 1.08(b)_.

(c) All excise, sales, use, value added, registration stamp,
recording, documentary, conveyancing, franchise, property, transfer, gains,
transaction privilege tax and similar Taxes, levies, charges and fees
(collectively, "Transfer Taxes") incurred in connection with the transfer of
the Purchased Assets pursuant to this Agreement shall be borne equally by the
Buyers, on the one hand, and the Sellers, on the other hand. The Buyers and
the Sellers shall cooperate in providing each other with any appropriate
resale exemption certifications and other similar documentation.

(d) Apportioned Obligations and Transfer Taxes shall be timely paid, and all
applicable Tax Returns relating thereto shall be filed, as provided by
applicable Law. The paying party shall provide to the non-paying party drafts
of all Tax Returns described in the preceding sentence and a statement setting
forth the amount of reimbursement to which the paying party is entitled under
_Section 1.08(b)_ and _Section 7.02(c)_, as the case may be, together with
appropriate supporting information and schedules at least thirty (30) calendar
days prior to the due date for the filing of such Tax Return (including
extensions), or such shorter period as is necessary to allow for the timely
filing of such Tax Return. The non-paying party shall have the right, at its
expense, to review all work papers and procedures used to prepare any such
Tax Return. If the non-paying party, within ten (10) Business Days after
delivery of any such Tax Return, notifies the paying party in writing that it
objects to any items in such Tax Return, the parties will use
their reasonable best efforts, acting in good faith, to resolve such disputed
items between themselves. If the parties fail to resolve such disputed items
within five (5) Business Days, such disputed items shall be resolved (within a
reasonable time, taking into account the deadline for filing such Tax Return)
by the Independent Accounting Firm. Upon resolution of all such items, the
relevant Tax Return shall be adjusted, if necessary, to reflect such
resolution and shall be binding upon the parties without further adjustment.
The costs, fees and expenses of the Independent Accounting Firm shall be borne
equally by the parties. The non-paying party shall make reimbursement promptly
pursuant to this _Section 7.02(d)_ but in no event later than ten (10) days
after the resolution of the relevant Tax Return. Any payment not made within
such time shall bear interest at the Applicable Rate until paid.

 



43 ARTICLE 8

EMPLOYEES AND EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

Section 8.01. _Employees and Offers of Employment._

(a) Section 8.01(a) of the Disclosure Letter contains a true and complete
list of all Business Employees, provided, however, that Business Employees who
are reasonably estimated to spend less than 50% of their employed time devoted
to the Business may be identified by title rather than name. The term
"Business Employee" means any individual who, as of the relevant date, is
employed by any Seller at a Facility or otherwise provides material service
(i.e., reasonably estimated to be more than 10% of their employed time) in
connection with the Business, whether as an employee, director, or independent
contractor, whether salaried or hourly.

(b) Except as set forth in Section 8.01(b) of the Disclosure Letter, since
January 1, 2011, no individual who would otherwise have been classified as a
Business Employee has been transferred to any other position with any Selling
Party or any Affiliate thereof such that such individual ceased to be a
Business Employee.

 

(c) Section 8.01(a) of the Disclosure Letter shall be organized by Facility or
corporate office, and shall include the title, scheduled hours per week,
business unit supported and approximate percentage of time spent providing
services for each Business Employee as of the date thereof. Such list shall be
updated as necessary to reflect new hires or other personnel
changes occurring between the date delivered to the Buyers through and
including the Closing Date not less than seven (7) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date.

Section 8.02. _Termination by Selling Parties; Employment at Buyers 
Discretion._

(a) Section 8.02(a)(i) of the Disclosure Letter contains a list of those
Business Employees whom the Buyers and the Selling Parties have agreed shall
be offered employment by Buyers, subject to satisfactory completion of drug
screening, background checks and eligibility to participate in federal and
state healthcare program checks for hire by Buyers (the "Selected Employees")
and shall further identify those Selected Employees who the Buyers deem to be
"Required Employees." Section 8.02(a)(ii) of the Disclosure Letter contains a
list of those Business Employees whom the Buyers and the Selling Parties have
agreed shall be offered employment by the Buyers subject to interviews with
the Buyers and, subject further to satisfactory completion of drug screening,
background checks and eligibility to participate in federal and state
healthcare program checks for hire by Buyers, such interviews to be performed
as soon as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement. Any of
such Business Employees who are subsequently offered employment following such
interview shall be added to the Selected Employees list. The Buyers may
additionally update, with the consent of BioScrip, not to be unreasonably
withheld, and deliver to the Selling Parties, Section 8.02(a)(i) of the
Disclosure Letter (other than with respect to the Required Employees) no later
than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date. Effective as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Selling Parties shall terminate
the employment or independent contractor status of the Selected Employees and
the Selling Parties shall not, within a period of one hundred and eighty
(180) days thereafter, offer to reemploy any such Selected Employee. The
Buyers will offer employment to the Selected Employees, effective as of the
Effective Time. Any such offer of employment shall be (a) for "at will"
employment, (b) in the same capacity in which, and the same location at which,
the Selected Employee was employed by the Selling Parties immediately prior to
the Effective Time, (c) at a cash salary level at least equal to that
provided by the Selling Parties and shall include a cash bonus opportunity
until such salaries and bonuses are adjusted by the Buyers in the ordinary
course of business, (d) providing each such Selected Employee and his or her
eligible dependents employee benefits comparable in the aggregate to the
benefits provided to similarly situated

 



44  employees of the Buyers, (e) providing each Selected Employee full service
credit (equal at least to the level existing immediately prior to the
Effective Time) for vesting and for eligibility purposes under any employee
benefit plan for employees of the Buyers ("Buyer Employee Plans"), and (f)
providing that with respect to any medical, dental or other similar welfare
benefits that are provided under any Buyer Employee Plan, any applicable pre-
existing condition exclusions (to the extent satisfied under the comparable
Employee Plan immediately prior to the Effective Time) be waived, and any
expenses incurred before the Effective Time under the comparable Buyer
Employee Plan be taken into account under such Buyer Employee Plan for
purposes of satisfying applicable deductible in the plan year in which the
Effective Time occurs. The Selected Employees who pass drug screening,
background checks and eligibility to participate in federal and state
healthcare program checks for hire by Buyers, accept and commence employment
with Buyers as of the Effective Time are hereinafter collectively referred to
as the "Transferred Employees." In the event that any Selling Party
determines to terminate the employment of any employee who is not a
Transferred Employee, such Selling Party shall be liable for all employee
benefits, severance, retirement benefits or payments (whether or not under a
tax-qualified retirement plan), post-termination benefits or payments,
employment agreements, retention payments, bonuses and all other employment-
related liabilities due to such terminated employee.

 

(b) Section 8.02(a)(i) of the Disclosure Letter shall be organized by Facility

become a Transferred Employee.

Section 8.03. _ERISA, Labor and Employment Representations._

(a) No Selling Party nor any of their respective ERISA Affiliates maintains
or contributes to, or has any obligation to contribute to (or has any
liability with respect to) any "employee pension benefit plan," within the
meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA, that is a "multiemployer plan," within the
meaning of Section 3(37) of ERISA, or subject to Section 412 of the Code, or
Section 302 or Title IV of ERISA. No Seller has any liability with respect to
any person under Title IV of ERISA.

(b) No Selling Party or any ERISA Affiliate maintains, contributes to, or has
any liability for medical, health, life or other welfare benefits for present
or future terminated employees or retirees (other than any welfare benefits
provided in compliance with Section 4980B of the Code and part 6 of subtitle B
of Title I of ERISA ("COBRA")) for which the Buyers could be held liable.

Section 8.04. _Benefits Plans._  

(a) _Liabilities_. Except as provided in _Section 8.04(c)_, Sellers (with
respect to their employees, directors and independent contractors) and
BioScrip (with respect to its employees, directors and independent
contractors) shall be solely responsible for paying, providing or satisfying
when due all vacation, sick pay, or other paid time off accrued but unused as
of the Effective Time, as well as all employee benefits, severance, retirement
benefits or payments (whether or not under a tax-qualified retirement plan),
post-termination benefits or payments, employment agreements,
retention payments, bonuses and all other employment-related liabilities due

to the Effective Time. The Buyers shall be solely responsible for compliance
with the requirements of COBRA, including, without limitation, the provisions
of continuation coverage with respect to all Transferred Employees and their
spouses and dependents, for whom a qualifying event occurs after the Effective
Time. For purposes of this _Section 8.04(b)_, the terms "continuation
coverage" and "qualifying event" shall have the meanings ascribed to them in
COBRA.

(c) _Pro rata Cash Bonus for Year of Effective Time_. The Buyers agree that,
effective as of the Effective Time, they shall make available to all
Transferred Employees the opportunity to participate, on a pro rata basis, in
the Buyers bonus plan for the year in which the Effective Time occurs,
_provided, however_ , that such bonus plans of the Buyers shall be
substantially comparable to the applicable Selling Partys annual bonus plan
in terms of the cash bonus potential to such Transferred Employee (on a pro
rata basis).

(d) _Benefit Plans Assets_. No assets or liabilities of any Employee Plan
shall be transferred to the Buyers or any of their Affiliates or to any plan
of the Buyers or any of their respective Affiliates.

Section 8.05.  _No Third Party Beneficiaries._ No provision of this Article 8
shall (i) create any third party beneficiary or other rights in any employee
or former employee (including any beneficiary or dependent thereof) of the
Selling Parties or of any of their respective Subsidiaries in respect of
continued employment (or resumed employment) with either the applicable Buyer
or any of their respective Affiliates or the Business, (ii) no provision of
this Article 8 shall create any such rights in any such Persons in respect of
any benefits that may be provided, directly or indirectly, under any Employee
Plan or any plan or arrangement which may be established by the Buyers or
their Affiliates or (iii) constitute an amendment to any Employee Plans or
other employee benefits or compensation plans or arrangements of the Selling
Parties.

for each of the Buyer Indemnitees or the Seller Indemnitees, as applicable
with respect to any and all claims relating to a breach of this Agreement
shall be pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in this Article
10. In furtherance of the foregoing, each of the Buyer Indemnitees or the
Seller Indemnitees, as applicable hereby waives, to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Law, any and all rights, claims and causes of
action it may have against the other parties hereto, arising under or based
upon any Federal, state, local or foreign Law, other than the right to
seek indemnity pursuant to this Article 10. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the provisions of this Article 10 shall in no way limit any other express
indemnification rights of any party set forth in this Agreement.

 



49 (e) The amount of any Damages subject to indemnification hereunder shall be
calculated net of any third-party insurance (not self-insurance) proceeds or
other third-party payments received by the Indemnitee on account of such
Damages. In the event that the Indemnitor reimburses the Indemnitee for any
Damages prior to the receipt or realization of any proceeds, payments or
benefits referred to in the immediately preceding sentence, the Indemnitee
shall remit to the Indemnitor an amount equal to the amount of such proceeds,
payments or benefits, as the case may be. In the event any payment is made in
respect of Damages pursuant to this Article 10, the Indemnitor who made such
payment shall be subrogated to the extent of such payment to any related
rights of recovery of the Indemnitee receiving such payment against any third
party.

(f) Without limitation of their respective rights and obligations as set forth
elsewhere in this Article 10, and subject to the procedures for
indemnification claims set forth in this Article 10, the Indemnitee shall act
in good faith, shall use reasonable best efforts to mitigate any Damages.

 

(g) All indemnity payments, shall be treated as additional adjustments to the
amount of the total consideration paid for the Purchased Assets for all Tax
purposes, except as otherwise required by applicable Tax Law or by a
"determination" within the meaning of Section 1313 of the Code.

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the
indemnification provided for in this Article 10 shall not cover, and in no
event shall any party hereto be liable for, any indirect, consequential,
incidental, exemplary or special damages, punitive damages, lost profits, lost
revenues, diminution in value, multiple of earnings or profits theory,
business interruptions, or loss of business opportunity or reputation
damages (except to the extent included in a Third Party Claim).

Section 10.03. _Procedures._

 

(a) _Third Party Claims_.

(i) If any Indemnitee shall desire to assert any claim for indemnification
provided under this Article 10 in respect of, arising out of or involving a
claim or demand made by any Person (other than a Buyer Indemnitee or a Seller
Indemnitee) against the Indemnitee (a "Third Party Claim"), such Indemnitee
shall notify the Indemnitor in writing, and in reasonable detail (taking into
account the information then available to such Indemnitee), of the Third
Party Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that the failure of an Indemnitee to
notify the Indemnitor shall relieve the Indemnitor from its obligation to
indemnify only to the extent that the Indemnitor is actually prejudiced as a
result of such failure. The Indemnitee shall deliver to the Indemnitor,
promptly after the Indemnitees receipt thereof, copies of all notices and
documents (including court papers) received by the Indemnitee relating to
the Third Party Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that the failure to deliver
such copies shall relieve the Indemnitor from its obligation to indemnify only
to the extent that the Indemnitor is actually prejudiced as a result of such
failure. 

(ii) Upon receipt of notification of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnitor shall
be entitled to participate in the defense of the Third Party Claim and, if it
so chooses, to assume the defense thereof with counsel selected by the
Indemnitor and reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnitee. Should the
Indemnitor so elect to assume the defense of a Third Party Claim,
the Indemnitor shall not be liable to the Indemnitee for legal expenses
subsequently incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with the defense
thereof, unless the Third Party Claim involves potential conflicts of interest
or substantially different defenses for the Indemnitee and the Indemnitor. If
the Indemnitor assumes such defense, the Indemnitee shall have the right to
participate in defense thereof and to employ counsel, at its own expense
(except as provided in the immediately preceding sentence), separate from the
counsel employed by the Indemnitor, it being understood that the Indemnitor
shall control such defense. The Indemnitor shall be liable for the

 



50  fees and expenses of counsel employed by the Indemnitee for any period
during which the Indemnitor has not assumed the defense thereof and as
otherwise contemplated by the two immediately preceding sentences. If the
Indemnitor chooses to defend any Third Party Claim, all the parties hereto
shall cooperate in the defense or prosecution thereof. Such cooperation shall
include the retention and (upon the Indemnitors request) the provision to
the Indemnitor of records and information that are reasonably relevant to such
Third Party Claim, and the use of reasonable best efforts to make employees
available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information
and explanation of any material provided thereunder.

(iii) Whether or not the Indemnitor shall have assumed the defense of a Third
Party Claim, the Indemnitee shall not admit any liability with respect to, or
settle, compromise or discharge, such Third Party Claim without the
Indemnitors prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld
or delayed. The Indemnitor may settle, compromise or discharge such Third
Party Claim with the written consent of the Indemnitee, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed, or without such consent if such settlement,
compromise or discharge (A) includes an unconditional release of the
Indemnitee from all liability in respect of such Third Party Claim, (B) does
not subject the Indemnitee to any injunctive relief or other equitable remedy,
and (C) does not include a statement or admission of fault or culpability on
the part of any Indemnitee.

(iv) Notwithstanding the foregoing, (A) if a Third Party Claim relates to
Apportioned Obligations, the Buyers shall be entitled to control the defense
of such Third Party Claim and (B) if a Third Party Claim relates to Transfer
Taxes, BioScrip shall be entitled to control the defense of such Third Party
Claim (any Third Party Claim referred to above in this clause (iv), a "Tax
Claim"). In the case of any Tax Claim, the party not entitled to control such
Tax Claim (the "Non-Controlling Party") shall be entitled to participate
fully (at the Non-Controlling Partys sole expense) in the conduct of such Tax
Claim and the party controlling the defense of such Tax Claim shall not settle
such Tax Claim without the consent of the Non-Controlling Party (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld). The costs and expenses of
conducting the defense of such Tax Claim shall be reasonably apportioned in
the same manner as the Apportioned Obligations or the Transfer Taxes or other
Taxes, as the case may be, to which the Tax Claim relates. Notwithstanding any
other provision, BioScrip shall be entitled to control in all respects any
proceedings relating to Taxes based on or related to income ("Income Taxes")
of the Selling Parties or any of their Affiliates and, except as provided
above in this _Section 10.03(a)(iv)_, all other proceedings relating to Taxes
of the Selling Parties or any of their Affiliates, and the Buyers shall be
entitled to control in all respects any proceedings relating to Income Taxes
of the Buyers or any of their respective Affiliates and, except as provided
above in this _Section 10.03(a)(iv)_, all other proceedings relating to
Taxes of the Buyers or any of their Affiliates.

(b) _Direct Claims_. If any Indemnitee shall desire to assert any claim
for indemnification provided for under this Article 10 other than a claim in
respect of, arising out of or involving a Third Party Claim, such Indemnitee
shall notify the Indemnitor in writing, and in reasonable detail (taking into
account the information then available to such Indemnitee), of such claim
promptly after becoming aware of the existence of such claim; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the failure of an Indemnitee to notify the Indemnitor shall
relieve the Indemnitor from its obligation to indemnify only to the extent
that the Indemnitor is actually prejudiced as a result of such failure.

 

Section 10.04. _Limitations on Indemnification_.

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in no event
shall the cumulative indemnification obligations of the Selling Parties under
_Section 10.02(a)(ii)_ (other than with respect to the Fundamental
Representations or a breach of _Section 2.08(b)_) and _Section 10.02(b)_ in
the aggregate exceed an amount equal to $25,000,000, subject to adjustment
pursuant to _Section 1.14_ (the "Cap"); _provided_ , _however_ , that any
and all breaches constituting fraud or breaches of any covenants or agreements
set forth herein shall not be subject to the Cap.

 



51 (b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no
indemnification claims for Damages shall be asserted by the Buyer Indemnitees
pursuant to _Section 10.02(a)(ii)_ (other than with respect to the
Fundamental Representations or a breach of _Section 2.08(b)_) or the Seller
Indemnitees pursuant to  _Section 10.02(c)(ii)_, respectively, under Article
10 unless the aggregate amount of Damages that would otherwise be payable
under _Section 10.02(a)(ii)_, on the one hand, and _Section 10.02(c)(ii)_,
on the other hand, exceed an amount equal to $2,333,333, subject to
adjustment pursuant to _Section 1.14_ (the "Basket Amount"), whereupon the
Buyer Indemnitees or the Seller Indemnitees, as the case may be, shall be
entitled to receive all amounts for Damages in excess of the Basket Amount up
to the Cap. For the sake of clarity the Basket Amount shall not apply to
indemnification claims for Damages asserted by the Buyer Indemnitees pursuant
to _Section 10.02(b)_.

 

(c) No party hereto shall be obligated to indemnify any other Person with
respect to (i) any representation, warranty, covenant or condition
specifically waived in writing by the other party on or prior to the Closing
and (ii) any Damages to the extent that such Damages are expressly reserved
for in the Separate Balance Sheet Data.

 _CALCULATION RULES_

 

Inventory is recorded upon receipt at the operating location. Physical
inventory procedures attached describe count and cutoff procedures. In
summary, the Selling Parties do an 80% count at quarter end at all sites and
monthly in the Community stores. The Selling Parties do a full wall to wall
physical at year-end. All counts are done to the pill level, so open bottles
are emptied and counted as part of the physical count. Locations receive in
all incoming inventory before the Selling Parties start the count. Transfers
between locations are ceased in advance of the counts to ensure no in-transit
inventory.

 

Community Scriptmed and Mail and Specialty TechRx have Purchase Order
functionality that allows order tracking through receipt and payment. For
these systems and locations, the Selling Parties match receipts and invoices
and accrue any uninvoiced receipts at month-end. In the case of PfW
(Community), the Selling Parties book ending inventory and if margins
fluctuate more than a reasonable level, the Selling Parties review the manual
receiving log from the store and test for cut-off.

The inventory cost method is FIFO. However each system computes the FIFO cost
differently:



     |  |  |

_Community Scriptmed_ : Valuation is at true FIFO based on purchase layers. 

---|---|---|--- 
 



     |  |  |

_Community PfW_ : Valuation is current cost based on cost file from
Amerisource. Turns are relatively high; thus, the Selling Parties
have concluded that current costs closely approximately FIFO. In January of
each year, the Selling Parties review price increases to determine if any
price increases on large quantity drugs and/or high cost drugs require manual
adjustment.  

---|---|---|--- 



     |  |  |

_Mail and Specialty TechRx_ : Valuation is at average cost, which the Selling
Parties have concluded closely approximates FIFO.  

---|---|---|--- 

Inventory reserves are updated each month end for excess and obsolete
inventory based on historical waste rate per dollar purchased, which is used
to create a general excess and obsolete reserve. A valuation reserve is also
established to reflect the rebate value in inventory, which adjusts invoice
cost to actual cost, net of rebates. Cash discounts are related to payment
terms and are recognized upon payment to the vendor if paid within the early
payment terms.

Each location is instructed to examine inventory monthly for dates of
expiration. The locations pull anything under 90 days dating in Mail and 30
days in Community. The inventory is pulled and prepared for return to GENCO,
the Selling Parties returns processor. In Community stores, the stock from
inventory is removed and the inventory is returned. A copy of the return form
is provided to accounting to make appropriate adjustments to the general
reserve. In Mail, the amount is segregated in "morgue" inventory warehouse.
Accounting writes down the morgue inventory at month-end. Returns are
consolidated in morgue until a return is accumulated and scheduled.

Partial dispenses are done in the Community Pharmacy if a patient is in need
of the product. If the patient does not have insurance, a 3-5 day supply is
given, and the sale is recorded as a cash sale using the actual quantity
dispensed. If the Selling Parties record a full refill quantity and only have
a partial fill, the store will record the Rx "owed" and mark it as will call
so it is not considered shipped. The Selling Parties do not have a large
volume of these types of partial fills. In Mail, partial Rxs are not mailed,
but a multiple Rx order may be partially shipped if one Rx cannot be filled in
total. This Rx is backordered and filled at a later date when stock
is available. Reference is made to Selling Parties physical inventory count instructions,

to be effective and valid under applicable Law, but if any provision or
portion of any provision of this Agreement is held invalid, illegal or

other party hereto; except that the Assignees may transfer or assign, in whole

amendment or waiver is in writing and is signed, in the case of an amendment,
by each party to this Agreement, or in the case of a waiver, by the party
against whom the waiver is to be effective. No failure or delay by any party
in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as
a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude
any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right,
power or privilege. The rights and remedies herein provided shall be

with this Agreement and applicable Law and will exercise the same due care
with respect to the provision of Services to the Buyers as BioScrip would
exercise in providing the same Services to itself. BioScrip is responsible for
the time and effort, as well as the costs associated, if necessary, with on-
boarding and training new hires or acquiring temporary resources required to
provide the Services hereunder.

(d)  _Subcontractors_. BioScrip may, directly or through one or more
Affiliates, hire or engage one or more subcontractors or other third parties
(each, a " _Subcontractor_ ") to perform any or all of its obligations under
this Agreement; provided, that: (i) BioScrip shall remain responsible for the
acts and omissions of each Subcontractor as if they were BioScrips own acts
and omissions, including each Subcontractors compliance with the terms
and conditions of this Agreement; (ii) without limiting clause (i) of the
proviso to this Section 1(d), BioScrip shall be responsible for ensuring that
the obligations with respect to the nature, quality and standards of care set
forth in this Section 1 are satisfied with respect to any Service provided by
any Subcontractor; (iii) the use of any Subcontractor will not increase the
Service Fees payable by Buyers hereunder; and (iv) the use of any
Subcontractor will not adversely affect the quality of any Service provided
to the Buyers or any Affiliates thereof.

(e) _Management and Control_. Except as otherwise provided herein, management
of, and control over, the provision of the Services (including the
determination or designation at any time of the resources and employees of
BioScrip, its Affiliates or any Subcontractor to be used in connection with
the provision of the Services) shall reside solely with BioScrip. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, all labor matters relating to any
employees of BioScrip, its Affiliates and any third party service provider
shall be within the exclusive control of such parties, and Buyers shall not
and shall cause its Affiliates to not take any action affecting, or have any
rights with respect to, such matters.

 

(f) _Outside Events_. If one of the following events materially and adversely
affects BioScrips ability to perform the Services (each, an " _Outside
Event_ "): (1) the failure by a telephone provider or other key provider to
perform the services provided by such provider or (2) the Buyers making
material changes to their business (i.e., changes to the systems of the
Buyers), then BioScrip will no longer be required to perform the Services
affected by such Outside Event until such time that the Outside Event no
longer materially and adversely affects BioScrips ability to perform such
Services. If such Outside Event affects BioScrips ability to perform the
Services affected by such Outside Event for a period of 20 days or longer,
then BioScrip will have the right to permanently cease the provision of
such Services affected by such Outside Event.

(g) _Required Consents_. The Parties shall each cooperate in good faith
and use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain on terms favorable to each
Party any consents, licenses or approvals of third parties that are necessary
for BioScrip to provide the Services to Buyers, or Buyers to receive the
Services. _(h) Good Faith Cooperation; Knowledge Sharing_. The Parties will use good
faith efforts to cooperate with each other in all reasonable respects
relating to the provision and receipt of the Services. With respect to each
Service, the Parties acknowledge and agree that, given the interrelationship
between their respective businesses to date and the knowledge that each
Partys key employees have concerning the other Partys business, for the
period beginning on the Closing Date (as defined in the Purchase Agreement)
and ending on the applicable termination date of such Service, they will each
use commercially reasonable efforts to make such key employees available to
the other, for any reasonable purpose relating to the provision or receipt of
such Service or the transition of the operations of each Partys business
related to such Service.

_(i) Substitutions_. Buyers or BioScrip may request that any of the Services
or any component thereof be supplemented, modified, substituted or otherwise
altered. Upon such request, the Parties shall discuss in good faith the scope
and nature of such request and related issues, including any potential
additional fees. If the Parties agree upon the scope and nature of such
request and related issues, the Parties shall amend this Agreement
accordingly. Until the execution of any such amendment, BioScrip shall not be
obligated to provide any such substituted Services.

_2\. Financial Terms_.

_(a) Service Fees_. Buyers shall pay to BioScrip those service fees set forth
in the Schedules attached hereto (the " _Service Fees_ "). Except as may
otherwise be agreed upon in writing by the Parties or as set forth in Section
2(g), other than the Service Fees, Buyers shall not be obligated to pay any
other fees, charges, expenses, costs, or other amounts of any kind under this
Agreement or in connection with the Services. If Buyers request that BioScrip
provide, or cause one or more of its Affiliates to provide, any Services after
expiration of the duration period for such Service set forth in the Schedules
attached hereto, and BioScrip agrees to provide such Services, then the
Service Fees for each such Service shall be an amount equal to one hundred ten
percent (110%) of the highest Service Fees specified for such Service in the
applicable Schedule, and such amount shall continue to increase by ten
percent (10%) over the amount that Buyers paid during the immediately
preceding month for each month thereafter in which such Service is provided;
provided that the Service Fees for such each such Service shall in no event
exceed one hundred seventy percent (170%) of the highest Service Fees
specified for the applicable Service in the applicable Schedule.

_(b) Billing_. Buyers shall promptly pay any bills and invoices that it
receives from BioScrip or its Affiliates for Service Fees, subject to
receiving, if requested, any appropriate supporting documentation for such
bills and invoices. BioScrip shall bill such Service Fees in arrears at the
end of each calendar month. Unless otherwise provided herein or on a Schedule,
Buyers shall pay all invoices by wire transfer of immediately available funds
no later than thirty (30) days following the later of (i) receipt by Buyers
of BioScrips or any of its Affiliates invoice, or (ii) the last day of the
calendar month in which the Service Fees that are the subject of the invoice
were provided (such date, the "Due Date"). Should Buyers dispute any portion
of any invoice, Buyers shall promptly notify BioScrip in writing of the nature
and basis of the dispute but shall pay any undisputed amounts on such invoice
in accordance with the foregoing sentence. While such dispute is pending,
BioScrip shall continue performing the Services in accordance with this
Agreement.

_(c) Failure to Pay Amounts Due_. If Buyers fail to pay the full amount of
any undisputed amount of any invoice within thirty (30) days after the
applicable Due Date, such failure shall be considered a material breach of
this Agreement (except to the extent of any invoiced amounts reasonably
disputed by Buyers in good faith and of which dispute Buyers have notified
BioScrip in accordance with the requirements of this Agreement). (d) _Interest on Late Payments_. All payments required to be made pursuant to
this Agreement shall bear interest from and including the applicable Due Date
to but excluding the date of payment at an annual rate equal to the lesser of
(a) nine percent (9%) per annum, or (b) the maximum amount permitted by
applicable Law, in each case from the applicable Due Date to the payment
date. Such interest shall be payable at the same time as the payment to which
it relates and shall be calculated on the basis of the number of days
(excluding the payment date) by which the payment date follows the applicable
Due Date.

(e) _Taxes_. All Service Fees to be paid by Buyers to BioScrip under this
Agreement are exclusive of any applicable taxes required by law (including
withholding, sales, use, excise or services taxes, which may be assessed on
the provision of the Services hereunder). If any taxes are assessed on the
provision of any of the Services provided under this Agreement, Buyers shall
be responsible for such taxes and BioScrip shall invoice such tax to Buyers
together with any Service Fees and pay such tax directly to the applicable
governmental authorities, and provide Buyers with a receipt showing payment
thereof. The Parties shall cooperate with each other in determining the extent
to which any tax is due and owing under the circumstances, and shall provide
and make available to each other any resale certificate, information
regarding out-of-state use of materials, services or sale, and other exemption
certificates or information reasonably requested by the other Party. This
Section 2(e) shall have no application to any tax imposed or based upon the
income or profit of BioScrip or any of its Affiliates, or to any income or
withholding tax that BioScrip or any of its Affiliates has to withhold with
respect to payroll or wage payments.

 

(f) _Records_. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in Section 4,
BioScrip shall keep reasonable and accurate records pertaining to the Service
Fees. Except as otherwise may be required by applicable Law or BioScrips
contractual obligations, BioScrip shall retain such records pursuant to
BioScrips customary document retention policy. BioScrip shall provide such
information and cooperation as Buyers and its auditors and inspectors may
reasonably request. BioScrip shall promptly remedy any material breach of its
obligations hereunder identified in any audit report that BioScrip reasonably
agrees is a material breach of its obligations hereunder.

(g) _Expense Reimbursement_. Except to the extent otherwise provided in the
Schedules attached hereto, the Buyers will reimburse BioScrip for all
reasonable and documented expenses for travel, meals and lodging incurred by
BioScrip directly in the performance of their obligations under this
Agreement. In the event that a portion of such expenses were incurred in
connection with activities unrelated to the delivery of the Services, BioScrip
will make a good faith estimate as to the portion of the expenses attributable
to other activities and will bill the Buyers only for the portion of the
expenses attributable to its provision of the Services. The charges for which
reimbursement is sought must be in compliance with BioScrips employee expense
policies. Expenses will be charged at cost with no mark-up. BioScrip will
maintain documentation of expenses incurred and retain copies of invoices or
receipts for expenses in accordance with its established expense policy.
BioScrip will make copies of all documentation and receipts that it
retains available to the Buyers upon request. BioScrip will bill the Buyers
monthly for expenses as they accrue. The Parties may specify any additional
limitations or other requirements related to the reimbursement of expenses in
the applicable Schedule attached hereto. It is acknowledged and agreed that
if BioScrip is reasonably required to incur expenses beyond the limitations
set forth in the applicable Schedules attached hereto in order to provide the
Services, then BioScrip will be excused from performing the Services until
the expense limitation is removed or changed as mutually agreed by the
Parties; provided that BioScrip will give the Buyers reasonable notice of the
need to exceed any such limitation prior to suspension of any of the
Services. It is further acknowledged and agreed that BioScrip will bear its
own employee severance costs and that BioScrip will not include any employee
severance costs in its charges to the Buyers for any of the Services under
this Agreement. BioScrip shall receive prior approval from the Buyers with
respect to any third party costs incurred in connection with the provision of
the Services and not specifically contemplated in the Schedules attached
hereto. and shall be reimbursed for such costs in accordance with the
procedures set forth in this Section 2(g).

3\. _Term of Agreement; Termination_.

(a) _Term_. This Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and shall
continue (unless sooner terminated pursuant to the terms hereof, including
pursuant to the terms of any applicable Schedule) for twelve (12) months;
provided, that, if BioScrips obligation to perform all of the Services has
expired or been terminated pursuant to the terms hereof prior to the
expiration of the Term, this Agreement shall automatically terminate. Neither
BioScrip nor any of its Affiliates shall be obligated to provide Services
following the expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement or any
particular Service.

(b) _Termination by Buyers for Material Breach_. Buyers may terminate this
Agreement upon written notice to BioScrip in the event of a material breach
of this Agreement by BioScrip. Such termination shall become effective thirty
(30) days from the date of BioScrips receipt of such notice unless the breach
is cured within such thirty (30) day period. If at any time during the Term,
BioScrip is not performing the Services in any material respects in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement, the Buyers will promptly provide written
notice of such non-performance detailing the circumstances of such non-
performance to BioScrip. (c) _Termination by BioScrip_. BioScrip may terminate this Agreement at any
time upon written notice to Buyers in the event of (i) an uncured failure to
pay amounts due and properly invoiced hereunder that are not the subject of a
good faith dispute or (ii) any material breach of this Agreement by Buyers
that is the result of Buyers willful misconduct or gross negligence;
provided, that in each case any termination described in clause (i) or (ii)
shall become effective thirty (30) days from the date of Buyers receipt of
notice unless the non-payment or material breach, as the case may be, is
cured within such thirty (30) day period. BioScrip may not terminate this
Agreement for non-payment of amounts that are reasonably disputed by Buyers in
good faith and of which Buyers have notified BioScrip in accordance with the
requirements of this Agreement. Other than as set forth in this Section 3(c)
and Section 1(f), BioScrip may not terminate this Agreement or any Services,
or suspend performance of any Services or other obligations under this
Agreement, for any other reason or under any other circumstances.

(d) _Remedy for Buyers  Failure to Perform Obligations other than Payment
Obligations_. Except as set forth in Section 3(c), if at any time Buyers shall
not be in compliance with their covenants and obligations hereunder: (i) if
the particular covenant or obligation is one upon which BioScrips ability to
perform the Services depends, then BioScrip shall be excused from a delay or
failure to perform the Services whose performance depends upon Buyers
performance, but only if BioScrip (x) gave Buyers reasonable advance written
notice of Buyers delinquency and (y) used commercially reasonable efforts to
perform the Services notwithstanding Buyers delinquency, and only to the
extent BioScrips ability to perform the Services is affected; and (ii) if
the particular covenant or obligation is not one upon which BioScrips ability
to perform the Services depends, BioScrip shall not be excused from continued
performance of the Services in accordance with this Agreement.

(e) _Partial Termination_. In addition to Buyers right to terminate under
Section 3(b), Buyers may terminate any and all of the Services in accordance
with the terms and conditions set forth in the Schedules and in the
Termination Form set forth in Appendix 2 of the Playbook. Upon termination of
particular Services pursuant to this _Section 3(e)_, the Agreement shall
otherwise remain in full force and effect with respect to such Services that
have not been terminated.

(f) _Effect of Termination_. Notwithstanding any other provision in this
Agreement to the contrary, whether this Agreement is terminated by BioScrip or
Buyers, or any particular Service is terminated by Buyers, upon termination
of this Agreement, Buyers will remain liable for the payment of Service Fees
accruing for the period prior to termination even though such amounts may not
become due until after termination. Further, in the event of termination of
this Agreement, _Sections_ _1(e)_ , _2(e)_ , _2(f)_ , _3(f)_ , _4_ , _5_ ,
_10_ , _16_ _and_ _17_ shall continue in full force and effect.

 

4\. _Confidentiality_.

(a) _Definition of Proprietary Information_. " _Proprietary Information_ "
means any non-public information disclosed previously or in the future by a
party either directly or indirectly, in writing, orally or by drawings or
observation (a " _Disclosing Party_ ") to another party (a " _Receiving Party_
"), either directly or indirectly, in writing, orally or by inspection of
tangible objects (including documents, business plans, source code, software,
documentation, financial analyses, marketing plans, customer names, customer
lists, customer data, product plans, products, services, inventions,
processes, designs, drawings, engineering or hardware configuration
information, know-how, trade secrets, or any other proprietary or business
information) or other non-public information, the confidential or proprietary
nature of which is reasonably apparent under the circumstances. 

(b) _Non-Disclosure and Non-Use_. A Receiving Party shall protect the
Proprietary Information of the Disclosing Party using at least the same
degree of care to prevent the unauthorized use,  dissemination, distribution, disclosure, or publication of such Proprietary
Information as the Receiving Party uses to protect its own Proprietary
Information. In no event shall the Receiving Party use less than a reasonable
standard of care in its treatment of such Proprietary Information. The
Receiving Party shall not have the right to use the Disclosing Partys
Proprietary Information for any purpose other than the purposes contemplated
by this Agreement (including performing, receiving, and assuming
responsibility for the Services, exercising rights and responsibilities under
this Agreement, and enforcing this Agreement) without the consent of the
Disclosing Party, which the Disclosing Party may give or withhold in its sole
discretion. The Receiving Party shall limit disclosure of such Proprietary
Information to the Receiving Partys employees, Affiliates, and third party
contractors (including outsourcing service providers) (i) who have a need to
know such Proprietary Information for the purposes of this Agreement, (ii) who
are informed of the confidential nature of such Proprietary Information, and
(iii) who have agreed in writing to use, hold, and protect such Proprietary
Information in accordance with this Agreement. The Receiving Party shall be
responsible for any breaches of this Section 4 by its employees, Affiliates,
Subcontractors and others to whom Proprietary Information of the Disclosing
Party is disclosed.

(c) _Exceptions_. The restrictions of this  _Section 4_ shall not apply to
Proprietary Information that: (i) was publicly known at the time of the
Disclosing Partys communication thereof to the Receiving Party; (ii) becomes
publicly known through no fault of the Receiving Party subsequent to the time
of the Disclosing Partys communication thereof to the Receiving Party; (iii)
was in the Receiving Partys possession free of any obligation of confidence
at the time of the Disclosing Partys communication thereof to the Receiving
Party; (iv) is developed by the Receiving Party independently of and without
reference to any of the Disclosing Partys Proprietary Information or other
information that the Disclosing Party disclosed in confidence to any third
party; (v) is rightfully obtained by the Receiving Party from third parties
authorized to make such disclosure without restriction; or (vi) is identified
in writing by the Disclosing Party as no longer proprietary or confidential.

(d) _Disclosures Required by Law_. If a Party (the " _Compelled Party_ ") is
required by Law or court order to disclose the other Partys (the " _Affected
Party_ ") Proprietary Information, to the extent permitted by applicable law,
regulation or court order, the Compelled Party will promptly notify the
Affected Party in writing prior to making any such disclosure in order to
facilitate the Affected Partys ability to seek a protective order or other
appropriate remedy from the proper authority to prevent or limit
such disclosure. The Compelled Party shall cooperate at all times with the
Affected Party in seeking a protective order or other remedy to maintain the
confidentiality of the Affected Partys Proprietary Information.

 

(e) _Injunctive Relief_. Each Party hereby recognizes and acknowledges the
confidential and sensitive nature of each others Proprietary Information. As
a result of such confidential and sensitive nature, a Partys failure to
comply with any provision of this Section 4 will be considered to cause
irreparable harm to the other Party for which monetary damages shall
constitute an inadequate remedy. Accordingly, each Party shall be entitled to
injunctive relief to enforce the terms of this Section 4, in addition to any
other remedy available to it at law or in equity.

 

(f) _Return or Destruction of Proprietary Information_. The Receiving Party
shall return or destroy all documents and other tangible objects containing
or representing Proprietary Information which have been disclosed to it by the
Disclosing Party, and all copies, excerpts and summaries thereof no later than
seven (7) Business Days after written request from the Disclosing Party.

(g) _No Assignment of Ownership_. Disclosure of Proprietary Information does
not cause an assignment of ownership or license rights of Intellectual
Property rights in such information from the Disclosing Party to the Receiving
Party. Nothing in this Agreement or any Schedule attached hereto gives
authority to one party to use the name, trademarks, service marks, trade
names or domain names of the other party for any purpose whatsoever. ___5\. Indemnification and Limitation of Liability_. 

_(a) BioScrip s Indemnification Obligations_. BioScrip agrees to indemnify,
defend and hold harmless Buyers and their Affiliates, each of their
respective shareholders, members, partners, Affiliates, employees, directors,
managers and officers and the successors and assigns of the foregoing
(collectively, the "Buyers Indemnified Parties"), from and against any and
all losses, damages, deficiencies, awards, assessments, judgments, fines,
penalties, costs, injuries, settlements, liabilities and expenses (including
any reasonable legal, accounting, expert, consulting and investigative fees,
costs and expenses) (collectively, "Losses") incurred by the Buyers
Indemnified Parties arising from the gross negligence, fraud or willful
misconduct of BioScrip in connection with its performance of the Services.

 

 _(b) Buyers  Indemnification Obligations_. Each Buyer agrees to indemnify
and hold harmless BioScrip and its Affiliates, each of their respective
shareholders, members, partners, Affiliates, employees, directors, managers
and officers and the successors and assigns of the foregoing (collectively,
the "BioScrip Indemnified Parties"), from and against any and all Losses
incurred by the BioScrip Indemnified Parties arising from the gross
negligence, fraud or willful misconduct of Buyers in connection with the
performance of its obligations under this Agreement.

 

 _(c) Notice, Defense and Settlement_. If a Party seeks indemnification with
respect to any Losses, such Party shall provide the other Party with timely
notice of the existence of such claim and such information, documents and
cooperation as are reasonably necessary to permit the other Party to establish
a defense to such claim, and a Partys indemnification obligation (if any)
shall be reduced to the extent that it is actually prejudiced by the other
Partys failure to comply with the foregoing notice and cooperation
requirements. A Party shall not take any final action (including any
settlement or compromise) with respect to any Losses for which it seeks or
intends to seek indemnification from the other Party without the prior written
consent of the other Party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.

 

 _(d) Liability for Payment Obligations_. Nothing in this Section 5 shall be
deemed to eliminate or limit, in any respect, the Buyerss express obligation
in this Agreement to pay all fees or expenses payable for Services rendered in
accordance with this Agreement. __

_(e) Exclusion of Other Remedies_. The indemnification expressly provided in
Section 5 shall be the sole and exclusive monetary remedies of the Buyers
Indemnified Parties or BioScrip Indemnified Parties, as applicable, for any
Losses, whether arising from statute, principle of common or civil law,
principles of strict liability, tort, contract or otherwise, arising out of a
breach by a Party of this Agreement or the Services provided hereunder.

_(f) Limitation of Liability_. Except as expressly set forth herein, the
Buyers acknowledge and agree that the Services are provided as-is, that the
Buyers receiving the Services assume all risks and liability arising from or
relating to Buyers use of and reliance upon the Services and each Buyer makes
no representation or warranty, express or implied, with respect thereto;
provided, however, that BioScrip will exercise the same due care with respect
to the provision of Services to the Buyers as BioScrip would exercise in
providing the same Services to itself. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, the indemnification provided for in this Section 5
shall not cover, and in no event shall any Party or any of its Affiliates be
liable for, any special, incidental, consequential (including loss of revenues
or profits), exemplary or punitive damages (except for any of the foregoing
damages payable to a third person) arising from any claim relating to this
Agreement or any of the Services to be provided hereunder or the performance
of or failure to perform its obligations under this Agreement, whether such
claim is  based on warranty, contract, tort (including negligence or strict liability)
or otherwise, all of which are hereby excluded by agreement of the Parties
regardless of whether or not a Party has been advised of the possibility of
such damages. BIOSCRIP SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND,
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE SERVICES AND THIS
AGREEMENT, INCLUDING ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY IN REGARD TO QUALITY,
PERFORMANCE, NONINFRINGEMENT, COMMERCIAL UTILITY, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS
OF THE SERVICES FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Notwithstanding anything contained
herein to the contrary, in no event shall BioScrip be liable to any of the
Buyers for any Losses except for those Losses arising from the gross
negligence, fraud or willful misconduct of BioScrip in connection with its
performance of the Services.

6\. _Relationship of Parties_. Except as specifically provided herein, neither
Party shall: (a) act or represent or hold itself out as having authority to
act as an agent or partner of the other Party; or (b) in any way bind or
commit the other Party to any obligations or agreement. Nothing contained in
this Agreement shall be construed as creating a partnership, joint venture,
agency, trust, fiduciary relationship or other association of any kind, each
Party being individually responsible only for its obligations as set forth in
this Agreement. The Parties respective rights and obligations hereunder shall
be limited to the contractual rights and obligations expressly set forth
herein on the terms and conditions set forth herein. Further, nothing in this
Agreement shall constitute or be deemed to constitute an employment
relationship between any of the Buyerss (or its Affiliates) and BioScrips
employees engaged in providing the Services.

7\. _Dispute Resolution_.

 

(a) _Senior Management Resolution_. Except as otherwise expressly provided
hereunder and without prejudice to Section 7(a), all disputes between
BioScrip and the Buyers arising out of or relating to this Agreement (other
than disputes arising with respect to the formation and validity of this
Agreement) (hereinafter a " _Dispute_ ") shall be submitted first to informal
resolution by senior management representatives of both Parties, which such
representatives shall work in good faith to resolve such Dispute in an
amicable fashion.

 

(b) _Materiality Threshold_ With respect to disputes for charges under any
Schedule attached hereto, no dispute may be initiated by a party pursuant to
this Section 7(d) unless the amount in dispute is at least $1,000 in regard to
any individual Services listed in the Schedules attached hereto or at least
$10,000 in the aggregate (calculated on a monthly basis). __  

8\. _Successors and Assigns_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure
to the benefit of the Parties and their respective successors and permitted
assigns. Neither Party may assign its rights or delegate its obligations under
this Agreement without the express prior written consent of the other Party;
provided, however, Buyers may assign this Agreement and any or all rights, or
obligations hereunder (including, Buyers rights to seek indemnification
hereunder) to any Affiliate of Buyers or to any subsidiary or any lender of
Buyers as collateral security; provided, that no such assignment shall
relieve Buyers from any obligations hereunder; provided, further that upon any
such permitted assignment, the references in this Agreement to Buyers shall
also apply to such assignee unless the context otherwise requires. 

9\. _Force Majeure_. If a Party is prevented from or delayed in complying,
either totally or in part, with any of the terms or provisions of this
Agreement by reason of fire, flood, storm, strike, walkout, or lockout, any
court order, seizure by any governmental authority, riot, war, rebellion, acts
of terrorism, nuclear accident or other causes beyond the reasonable control
of any such Party or other acts of God, in each case that actually prevents or
delays the Party from complying with any of the terms or provisions of  this Agreement notwithstanding the use of commercially reasonable efforts to
comply (a "Force Majeure Event") then upon notice to the other Party, the
affected provisions and/or other requirements of this Agreement shall be
suspended during the period of such disability and the affected Party shall
have no liability to the other Party, its Affiliates or any other person in
connection therewith, but only to the extent such prevention or delay could
not have been avoided with reasonable planning for business continuity and
disaster recovery, consistent with industry practice. The affected Party will
give the other Party reasonable notice of the Force Majeure Event once it
occurs and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to resume performance as
soon as practicable. If a Selling Party is the Party whose performance is
affected, Buyers shall have the right to terminate upon notice and without
termination fees of any kind any Services affected by the Force Majeure Event
if BioScrip does not resume performance of such Services in accordance with
this Agreement within ninety (90) days. As soon as practicable following
receipt of any such notice, BioScrip shall advise Buyers in writing as to
whether termination of such Services shall require the termination or partial
termination of, or otherwise affect the provision of, any other Services. If
such is the case, Buyers may withdraw their termination notice in writing
within five (5) days after being so advised by BioScrip. Otherwise, such
termination shall be final, and Buyers shall be solely responsible for the
consequences of any such partial termination and BioScrip shall have
no further obligation or liability under this Agreement for or related to the
performance of such terminated Service. The Service Fees will be reduced by
the amount associated with any particular Service that has been terminated.
Nothing in this Section 9 will be construed to require the settlement of any
strike, walkout, lockout or other labor dispute on terms which in the
reasonable judgment of a Party is contrary to its interest. It is understood
that the settlement of a strike, walkout, lockout or other labor dispute will
be entirely within the discretion of the affected Party.

10.  _Notices_. All notices or other communications required or permitted
hereunder shall be in writing and shall be given as set forth in the Purchase
Agreement. __

 

11\. _Entire Agreement; Amendments_. This Agreement, Schedules, and the
Exhibits referred to herein and the documents delivered pursuant hereto
contain the entire understanding of the Parties with regard to the subject
matter contained herein or therein, and supersede all other prior
representations, warranties, agreements (whether written or
oral), understandings or letters of intent related to the transactions
contemplated hereby between or among either of the Parties. This Agreement
shall not be amended, modified or supplemented except by a written instrument
signed by an authorized representative of each of the Parties.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Purchase Agreement
shall control in the event of any conflict with this Agreement or the Purchase
Agreement.

 

12\. _Interpretation_. Initially capitalized terms used in this Agreement and
not otherwise defined herein have the meanings given to such terms in the
Purchase Agreement and shall be equally applicable to both the singular and
plural forms. For purposes of this Agreement: (a) the words "include,"
"includes" and "including" shall be deemed to be followed by the words
"without limitation"; (b) the word "or" shall be disjunctive but not
exclusive; and (c) the words "herein," "hereof," "hereby," "hereto" and
"hereunder" refer to this Agreement as a whole, including all Schedules and
Exhibits attached to this Agreement. Unless the context otherwise requires,
references herein (i) to Sections, Schedules, and Exhibits mean the Sections
of, the Schedules and the Exhibits attached to, this Agreement, (ii) to an
agreement, instrument or other document means such agreement, instrument or
other document as amended, supplemented and modified from time to time to the
extent permitted by the provisions thereof and by this Agreement and (iii) to
a statute means such statute as amended from time to time and includes any
successor legislation thereto and any regulations promulgated thereunder. The
Schedules and Exhibits referred to herein shall be construed with and as an
integral part of this Agreement to the same extent as if they were set forth
verbatim herein. Headings of Sections are inserted for convenience of
reference only and shall not be deemed a part of or to affect the meaning or
interpretation of this  Agreement. This Agreement shall be construed without regard to any
presumption or rule requiring construction or interpretation against the party
drafting an instrument or causing any instrument to be drafted.

___13\. Waivers_. Any term or provision of this Agreement may be waived
in writing, or the time for its performance may be extended in writing, by
the Party or Parties entitled to the benefit thereof. Any such waiver shall be
validly and sufficiently authorized for the purposes of this Agreement if, as
to any Party, it is authorized in writing by an authorized representative of
such Party. The failure of any Party to enforce at any time any provision of
this Agreement shall not be construed to be a waiver of such provision, nor in
any way to affect the validity of this Agreement or any part hereof or the
right of any Party thereafter to enforce each and every such provision. No
waiver of any breach of this Agreement shall be held to constitute a waiver of
any other or subsequent breach.

 

 __ _14\. Partial Invalidity_. Wherever possible, each provision hereof shall
be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable
law, but in case any one or more of the provisions contained herein shall, for
any reason, be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect,
such provision shall be ineffective to the extent, but only to the extent, of
such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability without invalidating the
remainder of such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision or provisions or
any other provisions hereof, unless such a construction would be
unreasonable. The Parties agree that if any provision contained herein is, to
any extent, held invalid or unenforceable in any respect under the laws
governing this Agreement, they shall take any actions necessary to render the
remaining provisions of this Agreement valid and enforceable to the fullest
extent permitted by law and, to the extent necessary, shall amend or otherwise
modify this Agreement to replace any provision contained herein that is held
invalid or unenforceable with a valid and enforceable provision giving effect
to the intent of the Parties.

___15\. Execution in Counterparts; No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This
