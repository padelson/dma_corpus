THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "Agreement") is entered into as of
January 31, 2019, by and among (i) Tyler Technologies, Inc., a Delaware
corporation ("Parent"), (ii) TMP Subsidiary, Inc., a Delaware corporation and
a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"), (iii) MP Holdings Parent,
Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), and (iv) Arlington Capital
Partners II, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, solely in its capacity as
representative for the Sellers (the "Representative"). Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company and, as applicable, the Representative are sometimes referred to in
this Agreement as a "Party" and collectively as the "Parties." Capitalized
terms that are used in this Agreement and not otherwise defined herein shall
have the respective meanings ascribed to such terms in ARTICLE XI.

W I T N E S E T H:

WHEREAS, the Parties intend to effectuate a merger (the "Merger") of Merger
Sub with and into the Company in accordance with this Agreement and the
Delaware General Corporation Law (the "DGCL"), with the Company surviving the
Merger (the "Surviving Company");

WHEREAS, the boards of directors of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub have,
upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, (i) unanimously
approved this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby and (ii) declared that this Agreement, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby are advisable on the terms and conditions set
forth herein;

WHEREAS, the board of directors of the Company has recommended that the
stockholders of the Company adopt and approve this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby;

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, (i) in accordance
with Section 2.1 of the Company Stockholder Agreement, the Majority ACP
Holders (as defined in the Company Stockholder Agreement) have approved this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, and,
(ii) in accordance with the DGCL, the stockholders of the Company holding a
majority of the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company
representing the Requisite Stockholder Approval have approved this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, by written
consent; and

WHEREAS, Parent, as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub, has adopted and
approved this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby in accordance
with the DGCL.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, and
for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of
which are hereby acknowledged, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the
Parties hereby agree as follows: 

ARTICLE I

EFFECTS OF THE MERGER; MERGER CONSIDERATION

1.1 Merger. At the Effective Time and upon the terms and subject to the
conditions of this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the DGCL, Merger
Sub shall merge with and into the Company, the separate corporate existence of
Merger Sub shall cease and the Company shall continue as the Surviving Company
and as a wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent.

1.2 Effect of the Merger. At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger
shall be as provided in the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the
Effective Time by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of
Merger Sub or the Company, all of the property, rights, privileges, powers and
franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Company,
and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall
become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Company.

1.3 Certificate of Incorporation; Bylaws. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of Merger Sub or the Company,
(a) the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Company shall be amended
and restated in the form of Exhibit A and, as so amended, shall be the
certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Company until thereafter amended
in accordance with the terms thereof or as provided by applicable Law, and (b)
the bylaws of the Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Company until thereafter amended in
accordance with the terms thereof, the certificate of incorporation of the
Surviving Company or as provided by applicable Law; provided that, in each
case, the name of the corporation set forth therein shall be changed to
MicroPact Holdings, Inc.

1.4 Officers of the Surviving Company. The officers of Merger Sub immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall, from and after the Effective Time, be the
officers of the Surviving Company until the earlier of their resignation or
removal or until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified,
as the case may be.

1.5 Common Stock of Merger Sub. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of Merger Sub, the Company or Parent, each
share of common stock of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall each be converted into and exchanged for one (1)
share of common stock of the Surviving Company.

1.6 Effect on Company Capital Stock. At the Effective Time, upon the terms and
subject to the conditions of this Agreement, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or the
Sellers, as the case may be:

(a) Preferred Stock. At the Effective Time, no share of Preferred Stock shall
be issued and outstanding, requiring no action by virtue of the Merger.

(b) Common Stock. Each share of Common Stock, including, subject to Section
1.7, Vested Restricted Stock but excluding Unvested Restricted Stock, that is
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
canceled, extinguished and automatically converted 

into the right to receive an amount of cash (without interest) equal to the
Per Share Merger Consideration (as reduced at the Closing by the Per Share
Portion of each of the Holdback Amounts and the Representative Expense Fund
Amount consistent with Section 1.9(a), and subject to adjustment as provided
in Section 1.10(e)) in cash, payable in accordance with and subject to the
conditions provided in this ARTICLE I.

(c) Treasury Stock. Each share of treasury stock of the Company, if any, shall
automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no
consideration shall be paid or delivered in exchange therefor.

(d) Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, including this Section 1.6, shares of Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares of
Common Stock cancelled in accordance with Section 1.6(c)) and held by a holder
who has not voted in favor of adoption of this Agreement or consented thereto
in writing and who has properly exercised appraisal rights of such shares of
Common Stock in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (such shares of Common
Stock being referred to collectively as the "Dissenting Shares" until such
time as such holder fails to perfect or otherwise loses such holder\'s
appraisal rights under the DGCL with respect to such shares of Common Stock)
shall not be converted into a right to receive a portion of the Merger
Consideration, but instead shall be entitled to only such rights as are
granted by Section 262 of the DGCL; provided, however, that if, after the
Effective Time, such holder fails to perfect, withdraws, or loses such
holder\'s right to appraisal pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL or if a court
of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not entitled to
the relief provided by Section 262 of the DGCL, such shares of Common Stock
shall be treated as if they had been converted as of the Effective Time into
the right to receive the portion of the Merger Consideration, if any, to which
such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 1.6(b), without interest thereon.
The Company shall provide Parent prompt written notice of any demands received
by the Company for appraisal of shares of Common Stock, any withdrawal of any
such demand and any other demand, notice or instrument delivered to the
Company prior to the Effective Time pursuant to the DGCL that relates to such
demand, and Parent shall have, at Parent's sole cost and expense, the
opportunity and right to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect
to such demands. Except with the prior written consent of Parent, the Company
shall not make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any
such demands.

1.7 Employee Loans; Treatment of Unvested Restricted Stock.

(a) To the extent that the purchase price for any shares of the Vested
Restricted Stock payable under the applicable Restricted Stock Award Agreement
was paid by a promissory note or other form of a loan or advance by the
Company or its predecessor and any amounts payable pursuant to such note, loan
or advance remain unpaid and outstanding as of the Closing, the amounts
payable to the respective Seller by Parent pursuant to Section 1.6(b) shall be
reduced by the applicable amounts so owed by such Seller in order to satisfy
such obligations in full (the aggregate of the unpaid amounts as of the
Closing of all Sellers pursuant to such notes, loans or advances, the "Seller
Loans Balance"). 

(b) At the Effective Time, each share of Unvested Restricted Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, if any, shall be canceled
and extinguished. Holders of Unvested Restricted Stock will be entitled to
receive an Unvested Restricted Stock Refund Payment to the extent required by
such holder's Restricted Stock Award Agreement(s).

1.8 Merger Consideration. The aggregate consideration in respect of all shares
of Common Stock and Vested Restricted Stock shall be an amount equal to (a)
One Hundred and Eighty-Five Million Dollars ($185,000,000), plus (b) the
amount, if any, by which the Working Capital exceeds the Working Capital
Target, minus (c) the amount, if any, by which the Working Capital Target
exceeds the Working Capital, minus (d) Transaction Expenses, plus (e) the
Seller Loans Balance (such resulting amount pursuant to clauses (a)-(e), and
as such amount may be adjusted pursuant to the provisions of Section 1.10, the
"Merger Consideration"). The Merger Consideration shall be allocated among the
Sellers as specified in the Pre-Closing Statement delivered pursuant to
Section 1.10. The Parties acknowledge and agree that neither Parent, Merger
Sub nor the Surviving Company shall have any liability to any Person relating
to, or obligation to verify, the allocation of the Merger Consideration among
the Sellers as set forth in the Pre-Closing Statement (including with respect
to the determination of the Per Share Merger Consideration and the Per Share
Portion), and upon payment of the amounts set forth in this Section 1.8 in
accordance with the Pre-Closing Statement, Parent and Merger Sub will have
satisfied all of their respective obligations under this Agreement with
respect thereto, subject to any adjustments to the Merger Consideration
pursuant to Section 1.10.

1.9 Closing Payments. At the Closing, Parent shall make or cause to be made,
by wire transfer of immediately available funds, the following payments (each
such payment, a "Closing Payment"):

(a) payment to the account designated by American Stock Transfer and Trust
Company, LLC, appointed by Parent to act as its paying agent in the Merger
(the "Paying Agent") of a cash amount equal to the aggregate amount of the
Estimated Closing Consideration payable to the Sellers accordance with Section
1.6(b) and as set forth in the Pre-Closing Statement to be distributed by the
Paying Agent to the Sellers in accordance with this ARTICLE I; provided, that
if any Seller has not delivered to Parent a duly executed and completed Letter
of Transmittal and Surrendered Certificate(s) prior to the Closing Date, the
amount allocated with respect to such Seller will be paid to the Paying Agent
on behalf of such Seller (and distributed thereto upon delivery of such
executed and completed Letter of Transmittal and Surrendered Certificate(s)).
The term "Estimated Closing Consideration" means the Estimated Merger
Consideration less (i) the Holdback Amounts and less (ii) the Representative
Expense Fund Amount.

(b) payment to the Representative of a cash amount equal to Five Hundred
Thousand Dollars ($500,000) (such amount, the "Representative Expense Fund
Amount") to a bank account designated in writing by the Representative; and 

(c) payment on behalf of the Group Companies, to the payees thereof, of an
aggregate cash amount equal to the amount of all Closing Date Indebtedness of
the type identified in item (i) of the definition of "Indebtedness" and all
Transaction Expenses (other than the Unvested Restricted Stock Refund
Payments, which shall instead be paid by Parent to the account designated by
the Company for further distribution to the holders of Unvested Restricted
Stock entitled thereto in accordance with Section 1.7(b)).

Each of the Closing Payments shall be made in the amounts and as set forth in
the Pre-Closing Statement delivered pursuant to Section 1.10.

1.10 Adjustment of the Merger Consideration.

(a) Pre-Closing Statement. No later than three (3) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date (or at such earlier time as may reasonably be practicable), the
Company shall deliver to Parent a statement (the "Pre-Closing Statement")
including or setting forth the following:

(i) a good faith estimate of the Closing Balance Sheet;

(ii) a calculation of estimated Working Capital;

(iii) the amounts of the Closing Date Indebtedness and the holders thereof;

(iv) the amounts of the Transaction Expenses and the payees thereof, including
the Unvested Restricted Stock Refund Payments, including wiring instructions
with respect to each payee of Transaction Expenses;

(v) the Company's good faith estimate of the Merger Consideration as of the
Adjustment Time (the "Estimated Merger Consideration"); and

(vi) the allocation of the Estimated Closing Consideration among Sellers.

The Pre-Closing Statement shall include reasonably detailed calculations with
respect to each component of the Estimated Merger Consideration. As
applicable, the Pre-Closing Statement shall be prepared in a manner consistent
with the definitions of the terms Working Capital, Transaction Expenses and
the Accounting Rules and practices referred to therein, including the
definitions of any defined terms used in such definitions and including as
reflected on Exhibit B).

(b) Final Merger Consideration Adjustment. The Merger Consideration shall be
adjusted following the Closing based on the difference between the Final
Closing Date Merger Consideration (as determined in accordance with this
Section 1.10) and the Estimated Merger Consideration, if any, and payment
shall be made in respect of any such post-Closing adjustment as set forth in
Section 1.10(e).

(c) Closing Statement. No later than ninety (90) days after the Closing Date,
Parent shall cause to be prepared in good faith and delivered to the
Representative a statement (the "Closing Statement"), including an unaudited
consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of the Adjustment Time (the
"Closing Balance Sheet") and setting forth Parent's calculation of the Merger 

Consideration as of the Adjustment Time ("Closing Date Merger Consideration").
The Closing Statement shall be prepared in a manner consistent with the
definitions of the terms Working Capital, Transaction Expenses and the
Accounting Rules and practices referred to therein (including as reflected on
Exhibit B). The Closing Statement shall entirely disregard (i) any and all
effects on the assets or liabilities of the Group Companies as a result of the
Transaction or of any financing or refinancing arrangements entered into at
any time by Parent or its Affiliates or any other transaction entered into by
Parent or its Affiliates in connection with the consummation of the
Transaction and (ii) any of the plans, transactions, or changes which Parent
intends to initiate or make or cause to be initiated or made after the Closing
with respect to any Group Company or their respective businesses or assets, or
any facts or circumstances that are unique or particular to Parent or its
Affiliates or any of their assets or liabilities. For the avoidance of doubt,
unless the Representative otherwise agrees in writing, Parent may not amend,
adjust, supplement or modify the Closing Statement or the amount of Closing
Date Merger Consideration following its delivery to the Representative. If
Parent fails to deliver the Closing Statement within such ninety (90)-day
period, then in addition to any other rights the Representative may have under
this Agreement, the Representative shall have the right to elect that the
Estimated Merger Consideration be deemed to be the amount of the Closing Date
Merger Consideration and be final and binding and used for purposes of
calculating the adjustment pursuant to Section 1.10(e). The Parties
acknowledge that no adjustments may be made to the Working Capital Target.

(d) Disputes.

(i) The Representative shall have thirty (30) days after receipt of the
Closing Statement to review the Closing Statement; provided that if Parent
does not promptly provide access or other information specified in Section
1.10(f) (and in any event within five (5) Business Days of any request by the
Representative), then the Representative shall have thirty (30) days plus the
number of days between the date of the Representative's request for such
access or information and the date Parent grants or provides such access or
information. If the Representative disagrees with Parent's calculation of the
Closing Date Merger Consideration as set forth in the Closing Statement, the
Representative may, within such period, deliver a written notice to Parent (a
"Dispute Notice") disagreeing with such calculation and, to the extent
reasonably able to so specify, setting forth the Representative's basis for
such disagreement (the "Disputed Items"). If the Representative fails to
deliver a Dispute Notice during such period, the Representative shall have
waived its rights to contest the Closing Statement and the calculations of the
Closing Date Merger Consideration set forth therein shall be deemed to be
final and binding upon the Parties, and such amount shall be used as the Final
Closing Date Merger Consideration for purposes of calculating the adjustment
pursuant to Section 1.10(e).

(ii) If a Dispute Notice is duly delivered pursuant to Section 1.10(d)(i), the
Representative and Parent shall, during the thirty (30) days following such
delivery, attempt to reach an agreement on all or a portion of the Disputed
Items. If Parent and the Representative reach an agreement on any Disputed
Item during such period, the resolution of such Disputed Items shall be in
writing and shall be final and binding upon the Parties. If, during such
thirty (30)-day period, the Representative and Parent are unable to reach an 

agreement on all of the Disputed Items, then all Disputed Items remaining in
dispute following such thirty (30)-day period shall be submitted by the
Representative and Parent to the Accounting Referee (the "Referred Disputed
Items") as promptly as reasonably practicable for a determination resolving
such Referred Disputed Items (it being agreed and understood that the
Accounting Referee shall act as an arbitrator to determine the Referred
Disputed Items (and, as a result thereof, the Closing Date Merger
Consideration) and shall do so based solely on presentations and information
provided by Parent and the Representative, as further specified below, and not
by independent review). In conducting its review, the decision of the
Accounting Referee shall be solely based on (A) the definitions and other
applicable provisions of this Agreement, (B) a single presentation by each of
the Representative and Parent limited to the Referred Disputed Items (which
presentations the Accounting Referee shall be instructed to forward to Parent
and the Representative, as applicable) and (C) one (1) written response
submitted to the Accounting Referee by each of the Representative and Parent
within ten (10) Business Days after receipt of each such presentation (which
responses the Accounting Referee shall be instructed to forward to Parent and
the Representative, as applicable), and not on independent review. The scope
of the disputes to be resolved by the Accounting Referee shall be limited to
resolving the Referred Disputed Items, and, in connection therewith, fixing
mathematical errors and determining whether the Referred Disputed Items were
determined in accordance with this Agreement (including the definition of the
terms Working Capital, Transaction Expenses and the Accounting Rules) and the
Accounting Referee is not to make any other determination. The Accounting
Referee shall deliver to the Representative and Parent, as promptly as
practicable (but in any case no later than thirty (30) days from the date of
engagement of the Accounting Referee), a report setting forth its calculations
of the Closing Date Merger Consideration based solely upon (x) the Accounting
Referee's final determination of the Referred Disputed Items and (y) the items
which were finally determined pursuant to Sections 1.10(d)(i) and 1.10(d)(ii)
and not submitted to the Accounting Referee for resolution, which such Closing
Date Merger Consideration amount shall not be less than the applicable amount
thereof shown in Parent's calculation delivered pursuant to Section 1.10(c)
nor more than the amount thereof shown in the Representative's calculation
delivered pursuant to Section 1.10(d)(i). Such report shall be final and
binding upon the Parties, absent manifest error, and shall be used for
purposes of calculating the adjustment pursuant to Section 1.10(b).
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the dispute resolution
mechanism contained in this Section 1.10(d) shall be the exclusive mechanism
for resolving disputes regarding the Merger Consideration adjustment. Judgment
may be entered upon the determination of the Accounting Referee in any court
having jurisdiction over the Party against which such determination is to be
enforced. The fees, costs and expenses of the Accounting Referee shall be
borne by the Parties in proportion to the relative amount each Party's
determination has been modified, with any amount borne by the Representative
to be paid out of the Representative Expense Fund Amount. For example, if the
Representative challenges the calculation of the Closing Date Merger
Consideration by an amount of $100,000, but the Accounting Referee determines
that the Representative has a valid claim for only $60,000, the Representative
(on behalf of the Sellers) shall bear 40% of the fees and expenses of the
Accounting Referee and Parent shall bear the other 60% of such fees and
expenses of the Accounting Referee. The Representative 

and Parent shall, and Parent shall cause the Group Companies, and each of its
and their representatives to, reasonably cooperate and assist in any review by
the Accounting Referee of the Closing Statement and the calculations of the
Closing Date Merger Consideration.

(e) Final Closing Date Merger Consideration. Following the time that the
Closing Date Merger Consideration is finally determined pursuant to this
Section 1.10 (such finally determined amount, the "Final Closing Date Merger
Consideration"), payment shall be made as follows:

(i) If the Final Closing Date Merger Consideration is greater than or equal to
the Estimated Merger Consideration (the amount of such excess, the "Increase
Amount"), then within five (5) Business Days after the Final Closing Date
Merger Consideration is finally determined pursuant to this Section 1.10, (A)
Parent shall pay by wire transfer of immediately available funds an amount
equal to the Increase Amount to the Paying Agent (for further distribution to
the Sellers who delivered to Parent a duly completed and executed Letter of
Transmittal and Surrendered Certificate(s) prior to such time), and (B) Parent
shall disburse the Adjustment Holdback Amount to the Paying Agent (for further
distribution to the Sellers who delivered to Parent a duly completed and
executed Letter of Transmittal and Surrendered Certificate(s) prior to such
time).

(ii) If the Final Closing Date Merger Consideration is less than the Estimated
Merger Consideration, then within five (5) Business Days after the Final
Closing Date Merger Consideration is finally determined pursuant to this
Section 1.10, (A) the Adjustment Holdback Amount shall be deemed automatically
reduced by the full amount of such deficiency (for purposes of clarity, the
absolute amount of such deficiency will be subtracted from the Adjustment
Holdback Amount thereby resulting in a reduction of the Adjustment Holdback
Amount) (it being understood that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, the Adjustment Holdback Amount shall be the sole source of
recovery for any payment required to be made to Parent pursuant to this
Section 1.10(e)(ii)), and (B) Parent shall disburse in accordance with Section
1.11 to the Paying Agent (for further distribution to the Sellers who
delivered to Parent a duly completed and executed Letter of Transmittal and
Surrendered Certificate(s) prior to such time) the balance of the Adjustment
Holdback Amount, if any, remaining after the reduction of the Adjustment
Holdback Amount pursuant to the preceding clause (A).

(iii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 1.10(e), if, at
the time that Parent is required to make any payments to the Paying Agent (on
behalf of the Sellers) pursuant to this Section 1.10(e), any Seller has not
delivered Parent a duly completed and executed Letter of Transmittal and
Surrendered Certificate(s) prior to such time, then the amount allocated with
respect to such Seller will be paid to the Paying Agent on behalf of such
Seller (and distributed thereto upon delivery of such executed and completed
Letter of Transmittal and Surrendered Certificate(s)).

Upon payment of the amounts provided in this Section 1.10(e) in accordance
herewith, none of the Parties may make or assert any claim under this Section
1.10. 

(f) Cooperation. During the period of time from and after the Closing Date
through the final determination and payment of the Final Closing Date Merger
Consideration in accordance with this Section 1.10, Parent shall afford, and
shall cause the Group Companies to afford, to the Representative and any
accountants, counsel or financial or other advisers retained by the
Representative in connection with the review of the Closing Date Merger
Consideration, and afford to the Accounting Referee in connection with any
review by it in accordance with Section 1.10(d)(ii), direct access during
normal business hours upon reasonable advance notice to all the books,
properties, records, contracts, documents, information, personnel and
representatives of the Group Companies and their accountants (including the
work papers of the Surviving Company's accountants) relevant to the review or
preparation of the Closing Statement and the calculation of the Closing Date
Merger Consideration and, if requested by the Representative, shall provide
any such books, records, contracts, documents and information electronically
and in such formats as are reasonably requested.

(g) No Further Ownership Rights in Common Stock. The Estimated Closing
Consideration paid in accordance with the terms of this ARTICLE I, subject to
the indemnification provisions set forth in this Agreement, payment of the
amounts provided in Section 1.11, and the rights of Sellers with respect to
the Holdback Amounts, the Representative Expense Fund Amount and any
Additional Merger Consideration Payment, each as provided herein, shall be
deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the
shares of Common Stock formerly represented by the Stock Certificates. From
and after the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of
transfers of shares of Common Stock on the stock transfer books of the
Surviving Company.

(h) Adjustments. Without limiting the other provisions of this Agreement, if
at any time during the period between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of Common Stock shall
occur, including by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock
split (including reverse stock split), or combination, exchange or
readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend or distribution paid in stock,
the applicable Per Share Merger Consideration and any other amounts payable
pursuant to this Agreement shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect such
change.

1.11 Other Payments. In order to facilitate the payment of any Other Seller
Payments pursuant to this Agreement, such funds shall be paid to an account
designated by the Paying Agent (on behalf of the Sellers) for distribution to
the Sellers entitled thereto on a pro rata basis (based on each Seller's Pro
Rata Share), subject to such Sellers delivering to Parent a duly completed and
executed Letter of Transmittal and Surrendered Certificate(s) prior to such
time. The Parties acknowledge and agree that Parent and the Surviving Company
shall have no liability to any Person relating to, or obligation to verify,
the allocation of any Other Seller Payment among the Sellers as set forth in
this Section 1.11, and upon payment of any Other Seller Payment in accordance
with this Section 1.11 or as directed by the Representative, Parent will have
satisfied all of its obligations under this Agreement with respect thereto. 

1.12 Withholding. Parent, the Company and Paying Agent shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from the amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement such
amounts as it reasonably determines it is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payments under any provision of U.S. federal,
state, local or foreign tax Law and instead shall pay such amount to the
applicable Governmental Authority. Before making any such deduction or
withholding described in the previous sentence, except for (a) any withholding
required as a result of a failure to deliver the certificate as described in
Section 2.3(h), (b) any withholding on payments under any compensatory
payments made in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the payments with respect to Vested Restricted Stock and
the payment of any Unvested Restricted Stock Refund Amount, Parent shall give
the Representative notice of the intention to make such deduction or
withholding, and such notice, which shall include the authority, basis and
method of calculation for the proposed deduction or withholding, at least
three (3) Business Days before such deduction or withholding is required, in
order for the Representative to obtain reduction of or relief from such
deduction or withholding. To the extent that amounts are properly so withheld
by Parent, the Company, or Paying Agent, and paid to the applicable
Governmental Authority, such amounts withheld shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the recipient in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent or other withholding
agent.

1.13 Letters of Transmittal.

(a) Promptly following the date hereof, the Company shall deliver to each
Seller a Letter of Transmittal in a form mutually agreed to by Parent and the
Company (a "Letter of Transmittal"). Promptly following the receipt by the
Paying Agent of the Estimated Closing Consideration, the Paying Agent shall
deliver to each Seller who delivered to Parent a duly completed and executed
Letter of Transmittal and Surrendered Certificates(s) at least two (2)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date the portion of the Estimated Closing
Consideration allocated to each such Seller in accordance with the Pre-Closing
Statement and to the bank account designated in such Seller's Letter of
Transmittal. Following the Closing, but subject to Section 1.13(c), upon
delivery by a Seller that did not receive such portion of the Estimated
Closing Consideration promptly following the Closing pursuant to the
immediately preceding sentence to Parent of a duly completed and executed
Letter of Transmittal and Surrendered Certificate(s), the Paying Agent shall
pay to such Seller within five (5) Business Days after such delivery, (x) the
amounts to which such Seller is entitled to pursuant to the immediately
preceding sentence and (y) if the Final Closing Date Merger Consideration has
been finally determined as of such time, the amounts to which such Seller is
entitled to pursuant to Section 1.10(e), in each case, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the account designated by such Seller in such
Seller's Letter of Transmittal. No interest or dividends will be paid or
accrued on the consideration payable to any Seller hereunder. At the Effective
Time, all Common Stock will cease to exist and each share of Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (including any Stock
Certificate that prior to the Effective Time represented such shares of Common
Stock) shall be deemed from and after the Effective Time, for all purposes, to
evidence the right to receive the applicable portion of the Merger
Consideration as provided in Section 1.6(b) and of the Other Seller Payments
as provided in Section 1.11. If after the Effective Time, any Stock
Certificate is presented to the Paying Agent, it shall be exchanged as
provided in this Section 1.13(a). 

(b) In the event that any stock certificate representing the shares of Common
Stock has been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of a customary
affidavit of that fact by the Seller claiming such certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent or the Surviving Company, as applicable,
will pay, in exchange for the shares represented by such lost, stolen or
destroyed certificate, the consideration to which such Seller would otherwise
be entitled pursuant to Section 1.6(b) without any requirement to post any
bond or other security.

(c) Promptly following the date that is one (1) year after the Closing Date,
Parent may instruct the Paying Agent to deliver to the Surviving Company all
cash delivered to the Paying Agent pursuant to this Agreement that is still in
its possession at such time, in which case the Paying Agent's duties shall
terminate. Thereafter, each Seller may deliver a duly completed and executed
Letter of Transmittal and Surrendered Certificates(s) to the Surviving Company
and (subject to applicable abandoned property, escheat and similar Laws)
receive in consideration therefor, and the Surviving Company shall promptly
pay, the portion of the Merger Consideration deliverable to such Seller in
respect of its Surrendered Certificates(s) as determined in accordance with
this ARTICLE I without any interest thereon.

1.14 Merger Consideration Holdbacks. Parent shall retain, and not pay at
Closing, the Holdback Amounts for the purpose of securing any adjustment to
the Merger Consideration to be paid by the Sellers in accordance with Section
1.10(e) and any indemnification claims pursuant to Section 9.2(a)(iv). The
Holdback Amounts shall be paid to the Sellers in the amount and at such
time(s) as contemplated by Section 1.10(e) and Section 9.5(b), respectively.

1.15 Additional Merger Consideration.

(a) EBITDA Statement. On or before February 1, 2020, Parent shall cause to be
calculated and delivered to the Representative a statement (an "EBITDA
Statement"), setting forth Parent's calculation of the Net EBITDA for the
period beginning on January 1, 2019 and ending on December 31, 2019 (the
"Measurement Period"). During the thirty (30) days following the delivery of
the EBITDA Statement, Parent shall provide the Representative and its advisors
access to such accounting and other records of the Group Companies to the
extent requested and reasonably necessary to evaluate the accuracy of the
EBITDA Statements. If, within thirty (30) days following receipt of the EBITDA
Statement, the Representative does not deliver to Parent written notice of a
dispute with respect to the calculations set forth in such EBITDA Statement,
then the Net EBITDA set forth in the EBITDA Statement shall be deemed to be
the Net EBITDA for all purposes under this Agreement and Parent shall pay, or
cause the Company to pay, the applicable Additional Merger Consideration
Payment no later than March 15, 2020. In the event the Representative delivers
written notice to Parent within thirty (30) days of the delivery of the EBITDA
Statement stating that the Representative objects to Parent's calculation
thereof and specifying the basis for such objection in reasonable detail and
setting forth the proposed modification to such EBITDA Statement, such dispute
shall be resolved in the same manner as any dispute regarding the Closing
Statement in accordance with the provisions of Section 1.10(d) (for the
avoidance of doubt, the Accounting Rules shall not apply to calculation of the
Net EBITDA); provided, however, that once the Net EBITDA is finally determined
pursuant to the provisions of Section 1.10(d), the applicable Additional
Merger Consideration Payment (as defined below) shall 

be made no later than the later of (x) March 15, 2020 and (y) the date that is
ten (10) days following such date of final determination.

(b) Additional Merger Consideration Payment. Subject to Section 1.15(a), in
the event the Net EBITDA for the Measurement Period exceeds the minimum EBITDA
threshold set forth below, Sellers shall be entitled to receive, and Parent
shall pay (or cause the Surviving Company to pay) to the Representative (for
distribution to Sellers in accordance with Section 1.11), the applicable
additional Merger Consideration payment set forth in the table below (the
"Additional Merger Consideration Payment") in accordance with this Agreement.
For the avoidance of doubt, unless otherwise required by applicable Law, any
Additional Merger Consideration Payments made to Sellers will be treated as
additional Merger Consideration.

(c) Operation of the Group Companies during the Measurement Period.

(i) From and after the Closing until the end of the Measurement Period, Parent
covenants and agrees (i) to maintain the Group Companies as a separate and
standalone business unit, (ii) to cause the Group Companies to maintain books
and records that are separate from those of Parent and its other Affiliates as
necessary for Parent to calculate the Net EBITDA for the Measurement Period
and any Additional Merger Consideration Payment, (iii) to provide reasonable
access to the Representative, upon advance written request, to such books and
records referenced in clause (ii) above, and (iv) to reasonably cooperate with
the Representative to estimate expenses to be allocated to the Group Companies
for purposes of determining the Net EBITDA for the Measurement Period.

(ii) From and after the Closing until the end of the Measurement Period,
Parent shall act in good faith to give effect to the intent and purposes of
Parent's agreements and obligations under this Section 1.15 and, in
furtherance thereof shall or shall not take, as applicable, the actions set
forth below, provided, for the avoidance of doubt, that any action taken by
Parent that would not adversely affect in any material respect the amount or
timing of the Additional Merger Consideration Payment shall not constitute an
act in bad faith: 

(A) Parent shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates (including the Group
Companies) not to, take or omit to take any action for the purpose of, or the
primary effect of which is, undermining the Group Companies' ability to
achieve the EBITDA Thresholds or avoiding, reducing or delaying any Additional
Merger Consideration Payment;

(B) Parent shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates (including the Group
Companies) not to, divert the sale of any Group Company products and services
in favor of a sale of products and services offered by or through Parent or
its other Affiliates if the primary purpose of such diverted sale is to reduce
the Net EBITDA; provided, for the avoidance of the doubt, that nothing in this
Section 1.15(c)(ii)(B), shall limit the ability of Parent or its Affiliates,
subject to clause (A) above, to operate in the Ordinary Course of Business
consistent with past practices with respect to the sale of products or
services sold by Parent on or prior to the date hereof, including submission
of more than one offer or bid (such as for a legacy Parent product or service
and for a Group Company product or service) for a proposed sale;

(C) Parent shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates (including the Group
Companies) not to, transfer or assign the assets of the Group Companies as of
the Closing Date to Parent or any Affiliate of Parent (other than the Company
or its Subsidiaries) or any third party unless, in the case of such transfer
to Parent or any Affiliate of Parent, (x) such assets and any revenue derived
therefrom shall continue to be included in full in the Net EBITDA for all
purposes hereunder ("Transferred Company Assets") and (y) Parent maintains
separate books and records necessary for Parent to include such Transferred
Company Assets in Net EBITDA;

(D) Parent shall adopt, in meaningful consultation with the Company's
management, an operating budget for the Group Companies for the 2019 calendar
year, including with respect to the compensation of employees of the Group
Companies (the "Company Budget"); and

(E) To the extent the approval or consent of Parent or any Affiliate is
required or otherwise sought by the Company's management (whether under
Parent's or any Affiliate's policies or otherwise) for any proposed
transaction, opportunity or other action of any Group Company in accordance
with the Company Budget, Parent shall, and shall cause any such Affiliate to,
exercise such approval or consent in good faith and in a manner that (x)
Parent reasonably believes to be in the best interests of the Group Companies
consistent with the principles and assumptions utilized in the creation of the
Company Budget and (y) is consistent with Parent's approvals and consents in
respect of its other business units and Affiliates. 

(d) Additional Considerations.

(i) For the avoidance of doubt, Parent shall have no obligation to fund any
monies for the Group Companies during the Measurement Period (provided,
however, that Parent shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, deplete
the Group Companies' working capital to below levels that are adequate for
them to operate in the Ordinary Course of Business) or to operate the Group
Companies in order to achieve any, or maximize the amount of, the Additional
Merger Consideration Payment, and nothing contained in this Section 1.15,
except as expressly provided in Section 1.15(c), is intended to control or
otherwise restrict in any way management or the board of directors (or other
equivalent governing body) of Parent or its Affiliates or any Group Company
from operating the Group Companies and making all business and customer
decisions (including regarding efforts or resources to secure or maintain
business, the hiring or termination of employees and the incurrence of
expenses) and requiring compliance with Parent's and its Affiliates' internal
controls, corporate governance policies and procedures, legal and regulatory
compliance standards and other similar matters, in each case in the manner
which Parent's or its Affiliate's management or board of directors (or other
equivalent governing body) deem appropriate in their good faith judgment;
provided, however, that such operating decisions or compliance requirements
are consistently applied, as applicable, to Parent and its Affiliates. For the
avoidance of doubt, nothing contained in this Section 1.15(d) is intended to
in any way limit, abridge, restrict, amend or modify any of the express
provisions of Section 1.15(c).

(ii) The Parties acknowledge that Parent is a publicly traded corporation,
which provides a wide range of services and other business activities through
itself and its direct and indirect Subsidiaries, and Parent's and its
Affiliates' boards of directors, officers and managers owe their fiduciary
duties to their respective stockholders, members or other equityholders and
nothing herein shall operate to limit, modify or abrogate such fiduciary
duties. For the avoidance of doubt, none of Parent, any Group Company or any
of their respective Affiliates: (A) will owe the Sellers any fiduciary or
similar duty in respect of this Section 1.15, (B) are making any
representations or warranties to the Sellers with respect to the operations of
the Surviving Company or other Group Companies after the Closing or with
respect to any estimates or projections relating to Net EBITDA, or (C) will be
restricted or otherwise limited from taking any action (or refraining from
taking any action) with respect to the business activities of Parent or its
Affiliates (other than as expressly set forth in Section 1.15(c)).

1.16 Issuances or Transfers of Common Stock. Except as provided in this
Section 1.16, as of the date of this Agreement, the stock transfer books of
the Company shall be closed and there shall be no further registration of
issuances or other transfers that occur after the date of this Agreement on
the stock record books of the Company of the shares of Preferred Stock or
Common Stock. On or before the fifth (5th) Business Day prior to the Closing,
only the following transfers of shares of Common Stock shall be permitted:

(a) transfers permitted under the Company Stockholder Agreement or any other
agreement between the Company and a Seller, a copy of which has been made
available to Parent; 

(b) transfers for estate planning or Tax purposes; and

(c) otherwise permitted transfers among Sellers.

1.17 No Liability. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this ARTICLE I,
none of the Company, Parent, the Representative or the Surviving Company shall
be liable to any Person for any amount properly paid in good faith to a public
official pursuant to any withholding, abandoned property, escheat or similar
law.

or declaration to, or filing with any Person, including any Governmental
Authority, pursuant to, any provision of (i) the Organizational Documents of
any Group Company; (ii) any Material Contract, Material Government Contract or

5.2 Access to Information.

(a) From and after the date hereof until the earlier of the Closing Date or
the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, upon
reasonable advance notice, and subject to the restrictions contained in the
confidentiality agreements to which the Group Companies are subject, the
Company shall provide to Parent and Parent's authorized representatives during
normal business hours reasonable access to all books and records of the Group
Companies (in a manner so as to not interfere with the normal business
operations of any Group Company) for any reasonable purpose (provided, the
continuation of due diligence shall not be deemed a reasonable purpose). All
of such information shall be treated as confidential information pursuant to
the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, the Company shall not be required to disclose any
competitively sensitive information or disclose any other information to
Parent or its representatives if such disclosure would be reasonably likely to
(x) jeopardize any attorney-client or other legal privilege, (y) contravene
any applicable Laws, fiduciary duty or binding agreement entered into prior to
the date hereof, or (z) if the Parties are in an adversarial relationship in
litigation or arbitration (in which case the furnishing of information,
documents or records contemplated by this Section 5.2(a) shall be subject to
applicable rules relating to discovery) (the matters referred to in this
sentence with respect to any Person, the "Access Limitations").

(b) From and after the Closing Date, in connection with any reasonable
business purpose, including the determination of any matter relating to the
rights or obligations of the Sellers under this Agreement, upon reasonable
prior request and subject to the Access Limitations, Parent shall, and shall
cause the Group Companies to, (i) afford the Representative and its authorized
representatives reasonable access, during normal business hours, to the
offices, properties, books, records and other documents of Parent and its
Affiliates in respect of the Group Companies and (ii) make available to the
Representative and its authorized representatives the employees of the
Company, Parent and its Affiliates in respect of the Group Companies whose
assistance, expertise, testimony, notes and recollections or presence is
necessary to assist the Representative in connection with the inquiries for
any of the purposes referred to above, including the presence of such Persons
as witnesses in hearings or trials for such purposes; provided, however, that
(x) such requests shall not unreasonably interfere with the normal operations
of Parent or any of its Affiliates, (y) that the auditors and accountants of
Parent or its Affiliates shall not be obligated to make any work papers (to
the extent such exist) available to any Person unless and until such Person
has signed a customary agreement relating to such access to work papers in
form and substance reasonably acceptable to such auditors or accountants, and
(z) that if the Parties are in an adversarial relationship in litigation or
arbitration, the furnishing of information, documents or records contemplated
by this Section 5.3(b) shall be instead subject to applicable rules relating
to discovery.

(c) During the period from the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the
Closing Date or the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its
terms, Parent hereby agrees that it is not authorized to and shall not (and
shall not permit any of its employees, agents, representatives or Affiliates
to) contact any customer, supplier, distributor, officer, employee or other
material business relation of any Group Company regarding the Transactions
without the prior written consent of the Company. 

5.3 Exclusivity. The Company and Parent agree to the following exclusivity
provisions from the date hereof and until the earlier of the Closing or the
termination of this Agreement (the "Exclusivity Period"):

(a) During the Exclusivity Period, the Company shall not intentionally, and
will direct that its Affiliates and representatives shall not intentionally,
directly or indirectly (whether or not in conjunction with a third party)
solicit, encourage or initiate any offer or proposal from, or enter into, re-
start, solicit, initiate or otherwise engage in any discussions or
negotiations with, or seek, encourage, or respond to or provide or disclose
any information to, or enter into any agreement, terms, arrangement or
understanding (whether or not legally binding) with, any Person or group of
Persons other than Parent, Merger Sub and their representatives with respect
to any transaction involving any acquisition of or investment in, or any
disposition (whether by way of sale, offer, transfer, assignment or otherwise)
of, a material portion of the capital stock of the Company (or interest
therein), or a material portion of the assets of the Company (any such
transaction an "Alternative Transaction"), except in any such case to notify
any such Person or group of Persons of the existence of this Section 5.3(a).

(b) If the Company or any of its representatives receives any bona fide
proposal for, or inquiry respecting, any Alternative Transaction, or any
request for nonpublic information in connection with any such Alternative
Transaction, the Company will promptly notify Parent, describing in reasonable
detail the identity of the Person or group of Persons making such proposal or
inquiry and the terms and conditions of such proposal or inquiry.

5.4 Efforts; Regulatory Filings and Consents.

(a) Without prejudice to Parent\'s obligations set forth in Section 5.4(d),
each of the Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the other
hand, shall use its respective reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate
with the other Parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable (i)
to consummate and make effective as promptly as possible, but in no event
later than the Termination Date, the Transactions, (ii) obtain or provide, or
cause to be obtained, as set forth in Section 3.3(a), all consents or
approvals by or notices to third parties that may be or become necessary for
its execution and delivery of this Agreement and the performance of its
obligations pursuant to this Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements,
(iii) to obtain all Governmental Approvals of any Governmental Antitrust
Authority required to be obtained by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub, or any
of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates in connection with the
Transactions or the taking of any action contemplated by this Agreement, (iv)
to defend vigorously, lift, mitigate or rescind the effect of any litigation
or administrative proceeding involving any Governmental Antitrust Authority
(including a private party challenge) adversely affecting this Agreement or
the Transactions, including promptly appealing any adverse court or
administrative decision; provided, however, that neither the Company and its
Affiliates, nor the Parent and Merger Sub, shall be required to make any
material monetary expenditures, offer or grant any material accommodation
(financial or otherwise) to any Person or commence or be a plaintiff in any
litigation to satisfy their obligations under this Section 5.4(a); provided,
further, that neither the Company and its Affiliates, nor the Parent and its
Affiliates, shall be required to sell or otherwise dispose of any portion of
the business 

of the Group Companies or the Parent or its Subsidiaries in order to satisfy
their obligations under this Section 5.4(a).

(b) Each of the Company and Parent shall (i) as soon as reasonably practicable
(and in any event within five (5) Business Days following the date of this
Agreement) file or cause to be filed with the United States Federal Trade
Commission (the "FTC") and the United States Department of Justice (the "DOJ")
the notification and report form, if any, required for the Transactions (which
form shall request early termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act)
and to supply as promptly as practicable any supplemental information
requested in connection therewith pursuant to the HSR Act and (ii) as soon as
reasonably practicable make all filings under the applicable Other Competition
Laws, if any, required for the Transactions, and shall take all other actions
necessary, proper or advisable to cause the expiration or termination of the
applicable waiting period under the HSR Act and the applicable Other
Competition Laws. Any such antitrust notification and report form or filing
and supplemental information shall be in substantial compliance with the
requirements of the HSR Act or the applicable Other Competition Laws, as the
case may be. All other regulatory filings shall be in substantial compliance
with the requirements of applicable Law. Each of Parent and the Company shall
furnish to the other Party such necessary information and reasonable
assistance as the other Party may request in connection with its preparation
of any filing or submission that is necessary under the HSR Act, the
applicable Other Competition Laws or other applicable Law, as the case may be.
The Company and Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to comply promptly
with any inquiries or requests for additional information from the FTC, the
DOJ, other Governmental Antitrust Authorities and any other Governmental
Authority having jurisdiction.

(c) Without limiting the generality of the undertakings set forth in Sections
5.4(a), 5.4(b) and 5.4(e) and subject to any appropriate confidentiality
protections, the Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the
other hand, shall each furnish to the other such necessary information and
reasonable assistance as the other may reasonably request in connection with
Section 5.4(b) and shall each promptly provide counsel for the other Party
with copies of all filings made by such Party, and all correspondence between
such Party (and its advisors) with any Governmental Antitrust Authority, other
Governmental Authority or, in connection with any proceeding by a private
party, and any other information supplied by such Party and such Party's
Affiliates to a Governmental Antitrust Authority or other Governmental
Authority in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions. Subject to
applicable Law, the Company and Parent shall permit counsel for the other
Party reasonable opportunity to review in advance, and shall consider in good
faith the views of the other Party in connection with, any proposed written
or, if practicable, oral communication to any Governmental Antitrust Authority
or other Governmental Authority relating to the Transactions. Each of the
Company and Parent agrees not to participate in any substantive meeting or
discussion, either in person or by telephone, with any Governmental Antitrust
Authority or other Governmental Authority in connection with the Transactions
unless it consults with the other Party in advance and, to the extent not
prohibited by such Governmental Antitrust Authority or other Governmental
Authority, gives the other Party the opportunity to attend and participate. 

(d) Without expanding any obligation set forth under this Section 5.4, Parent
agrees to consider, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates and, as determined
in its good faith, to take, or cause to be taken, such reasonable actions with
respect to the Group Companies, post-Closing, that are identified by any
Governmental Antitrust Authority as a condition to the granting of any
Governmental Approval necessary for the consummation of the Transactions or as
may be required to avoid, lift, vacate, reverse or resolve any legislative,
administrative or judicial action (including any suit instituted (or
threatened to be instituted) by the FTC, the DOJ or any other applicable
Governmental Authority or any private party challenging the Transactions as a
violation of the HSR Act or Other Competition Laws) that would otherwise
reasonably be expected to materially impair or delay the consummation of the
Transactions. Parent's consideration of any such reasonable action shall be
undertaken in good faith, and if, after such good-faith consideration, Parent
and its Affiliates determine that they will not undertake the action, such
decision shall not constitute a breach of this Agreement. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the Group Companies understand and acknowledge
that neither Parent, nor any of its Affiliates, will depreciate, sacrifice,
limit, alter or cannibalize the pre-Closing existing lines of business or
operations of the Parent and its Affiliates, even if such action is identified
as a condition for consummation of the Transactions by a Governmental
Antitrust Authority. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed so
as to require Parent or any of its Affiliates (other than, after the Closing,
the Group Companies, to the extent such action is determined and agreed to by
Parent under this Section 5.4(d)), to (i) sell, license, dispose of, hold
separate or operate in any specified manner any of its respective assets or
businesses (or to discuss, agree or commit to any of the foregoing), other
than assets or businesses of the Group Companies, or (ii) enter into any
consent decree, Order or agreement that alters its business or commercial
practices in any way or that in any way limits or could reasonably be expected
to limit the right of Parent to own, operate or retain all or any portion of
Parent's assets, properties or businesses (other than, after the Closing, the
Group Companies) or Parent's freedom of action with respect thereto. Further,
Parent and/or its Affiliates shall be under no obligation to take such action
as identified by a Governmental Antitrust Authority if not agreed to by the
Company. To the extent Parent and/or its Affiliates do decide to take such
action as identified by a Governmental Antitrust Authority with respect to the
Group Companies, such action, provided it has been agreed to by the Company,
shall not constitute a violation of Section 1.15(c).

(e) Without limiting any other obligation under this Agreement, during the
period from the date of this Agreement until the Closing Date, Parent, Merger
Sub and their respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates shall not take or agree
to take any action that would reasonably be expected to prevent or delay the
Parties from obtaining any Governmental Approval in connection with the
Transactions, including entering into an agreement to acquire (whether via
merger, consolidation, stock or asset purchase or otherwise) any material
amount of assets of or any equity in any other Person or any business or
division thereof if such agreement would be reasonably expected to create a
material risk of making it more difficult to obtain the Governmental Approval
of the FTC or DOJ or any other Governmental Antitrust Authority required in
connection with the Transactions. 

(f) The Company shall be responsible for all fees and expenses incurred with
obtaining any consents or approvals from third parties or giving notices as
set forth in clause (ii) of Section 5.4(a) (provided, however, that any such
fees and expenses shall be paid by the Company in full prior to the Closing or
accrued in full on the books and records of the Company prior to the Closing).
Parent (i) shall be responsible for the filing of the Certificate of Merger
and (ii) shall pay the filing fee under the HSR Act. Each of the Company and
Parent shall otherwise be responsible for their respective fees and expenses
in connection with their respective filings under the HSR Act.

5.5 Notification of Certain Matters. The Company shall give notice to Parent
and Parent shall give notice to the Company, as promptly as reasonably
practicable, upon becoming aware of (a) any fact, change, condition,
circumstance, event, occurrence, or non-occurrence that has caused or is
reasonably likely to cause any representation or warranty in this Agreement
made by it to be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect at any time
after the date of this Agreement and before the Effective Time that would
cause the conditions set forth in Sections 6.2(a) and 6.2(b) or Sections
6.3(a) and 6.3(b), as applicable, not to be satisfied as of the Closing Date,
(b) any material failure on its part to comply with or satisfy any covenant,
condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under this
Agreement, or (c) the institution of or a credible written threat of
institution of any Legal Proceeding related to this Agreement or the Merger;
provided, however, that the delivery of any notice in accordance with this
Section 5.5 shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available under
this Agreement to such Party (including the right to seek indemnification in
accordance with ARTICLE VIII or ARTICLE IX and the rights of the
Representative to seek indemnification in accordance with Section 10.13), the
representations or warranties of the Parties, or the conditions to the
obligations of the Parties; provided further, however, that the unintentional
failure to give notice under this Section 5.5 will not be deemed to be a
breach of covenant under this Section 5.5 and will constitute only a breach of
the underlying representation, warranty, condition or agreement, as the case
may be.

5.6 Confidentiality. Each of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges that the
information provided to it and its representatives in connection with this
Agreement (including Section 5.2(a)) and the Transaction is subject to the
terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, dated September 19, 2018, by and
between Parent and MicroPact, Inc. (the "Confidentiality Agreement"), the
terms of which are incorporated herein by reference.

5.7 Preservation of Records. In addition to and not in limitation of the
provisions of Section 5.2(a), Parent agrees to preserve and keep the records
relating to the businesses of the Group Companies for a period of seven (7)
years from the Closing Date and shall make such records and personnel
available to the Representative as may be reasonably requested in connection
with, among other things, any insurance claims by, Legal Proceedings (other
than Legal Proceedings between the Representative and Parent related to this
Agreement or the Transaction) or tax audits against, or governmental
investigations of, the Group Companies or in order to enable the
Representative to comply with its obligations under this Agreement and each
other Transaction Agreement.

5.8 Publicity. None of the Representative or, prior to the Closing, the
Company, on the one hand, or Parent, Merger Sub or, following the Closing, the
Surviving Company, on the other hand, shall issue any press release or public
announcement concerning this Agreement, the other 

Transaction Agreements or the Transaction or make any other public disclosure
containing or pertaining to the terms of this Agreement without obtaining the
Representative's or Parent's, as applicable, prior written approval, which
approval will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, unless, in the judgment
of the Party seeking to disclose, disclosure is otherwise required by
applicable Law or by the applicable rules of any stock exchange on which such
disclosing Party lists securities; provided that, to the extent any disclosure
is required by applicable Law or stock exchange rule, the Party intending to
make such disclosure shall use its commercially reasonable efforts consistent
with applicable Law or stock exchange rule to consult with the Representative
or Parent, as applicable, with respect to the text thereof and; provided,
further, that (i) the Company and Representative, on the one hand, and Parent
and its equityholders and Affiliates, on the other hand, shall be entitled to
disclose such information to their respective directors, officers, executive
employees, equity owners, partners, prospective partners, investors,
prospective investors, professional advisors and lenders who have a need to
know the information and who agree to keep such information confidential or
are otherwise bound to confidentiality and (ii) Parent's financing sources and
other professional advisors may publish "tombstones" or other customary
announcements which do not contain pricing details that are not otherwise
publicly available.

5.9 Director and Officer Liability; Indemnification.

(a) For a period of six (6) years after the Closing, Parent shall cause the
Group Companies, to the fullest extent provided in the Organizational
Documents thereof or in any other agreements disclosed on Section 5.9 of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, in each case as in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time, to indemnify and hold harmless (and advance applicable
expenses to) each Person who is as of the Effective Time, or has been at any
time prior to the Effective Time, an officer, manager or director of a Group
Company (each, a "DandO Indemnified Person") against any costs or expenses
(including attorneys' fees) incurred in connection with any claim, threatened,
pending or completed, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, or Losses arising out of or pertaining to matters existing or
occurring at or prior to the Closing Date and relating to the fact that the
DandO Indemnified Person was an officer, manager or director of any Group
Company.

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall purchase and maintain in
effect beginning on the Closing Date, and with a claims period of six (6)
years thereafter without any lapses in coverage, a "tail" policy providing
directors' and officers' liability insurance coverage for the benefit of those
Persons who are covered by any Group Company's directors' and officers'
liability insurance policies as of the date hereof or at the Closing with
respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective Time. Such policy shall
provide coverage that is at least equal to the coverage provided under the
Group Companies' current directors' and officers' liability insurance
policies; provided that the Company may substitute therefor policies of at
least the same coverage containing terms and conditions which are no less
advantageous to the beneficiaries thereof so long as such substitution does
not result in gaps or lapses in coverage with respect to matters occurring
prior to the Closing Date. The premium amounts for such tail policies shall be
fully paid by the Company prior to the Closing or included as a Transaction
Expense. Any such tail policies shall include a successor endorsement that
names Parent and the Surviving Company as additional insureds. During the term
of such tail policies, neither Parent nor the Surviving Company shall take any
action 

following the Closing to cause any such tail policy to be cancelled or any
provision therein to be amended or waived.

(c) If Parent, the Surviving Company, any of the Operating Subsidiaries or any
of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into
any other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity
of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and other assets to any Person, then, and
in each such case, Parent shall cause proper provision to be made so that the
applicable successors and assigns or transferees expressly assume the
obligations set forth in this Section 5.9.

5.10 Stockholder Approval. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement,
the Company has delivered to Parent the resolutions of the stockholders of the
Company representing the Requisite Stockholder Approval.

5.11 Restrictive Covenants Agreements. Contemporaneously with the execution of
this Agreement, as a material inducement to Parent's execution of this
Agreement, each of those holders of Common Stock who are employees of any
Group Company as of the date of this Agreement and whose names are set forth
on Section 5.11 of the Parent Disclosure Schedule (the "Employee Sellers"),
shall have entered into a Restrictive Covenants Agreement, to be effective
upon the Closing Date subject to consummation of the Merger, in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent (each, a "Restrictive Covenant
Agreement").

5.12 Employees.

(a) Contemporaneously with the execution of this Agreement, as a material
inducement to Parent's execution of this Agreement, the Company shall have
entered into a mutually acceptable Employment Agreement with each of the
individuals identified on Section 5.12(a) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule
(the "Key Employees").

(b) The Company shall be responsible for the payment of any Change of Control
Payments that are payable by any Group Company to any employee solely as a
result of the occurrence of the Merger; provided, however, that any such
Change of Control Payments shall be paid by the applicable Group Company in
full on or before the Closing or included as a Transaction Expense to be paid
at the Closing; and, provided further, that in no event shall any of the
following be considered Change of Control Payments: (i) any payments made
pursuant to any offer letter or any Contract entered into by a Group Company
with any employee of the Company at the direction of Parent, and (ii) any
bonus or other similar payments to any employee of a Group Company pursuant to
any agreement or arrangement adopted or entered into by Parent, the Surviving
Company or any of their Affiliates, or directed by Parent after the Effective
Time.

(c) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall cause any written employment
agreement between a Group Company and the individuals listed on Section
5.12(c) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule to have been terminated effective no
later than as of the Effective Time, and the Company shall provide
documentation thereof reasonably satisfactory to Parent. 

5.13 Corporate Records.

(a) On or before the Closing, the Company shall exercise commercially
reasonable efforts to deliver or caused to be delivered to Parent, each dated
within a reasonable time prior to the Closing, (i) certificates of
registration or qualification of each domestic Group Company from the
Secretary of State (or comparable Governmental Authority) of each state other
than its jurisdiction of organization in which, as set forth on Section 3.23
of the Company Disclosure Schedule, it is registered or qualified to do
business, and (ii) a legal existence or good standing certificate for each
domestic Operating Subsidiary from the Secretary of State (or comparable
Governmental Authority) of its jurisdiction of organization, as set forth on
Section 3.4(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

(b) The Representative shall cause to be delivered to Parent, within ten (10)
days after the Closing, all minute books of the Company in its possession.

(c) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall execute and deliver to
Parent, or cause the applicable Group Company or Group Companies to execute
and deliver to Parent, a letter or other document, in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to Parent, necessary and appropriate to change, at
Parent's sole cost and expense, the broker of record with respect to any of
the Group Companies' claims-made insurance policies listed on Section 3.22 of
the Company Disclosure Schedule to be effective upon the Closing Date.

any time prior to the Closing:

mutual agreement of the Parties or as provided in this Section 7.1(a)(iii),
the "Termination Date"); provided, however, that the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(a)(iii) shall not be available to any
Party whose breach of any provision of this Agreement has been a principal
cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the Closing to occur on or before the
Termination Date; and, provided further, that, if at any time prior to the
Termination Date the DOJ or the FTC makes a request for additional information
or documentary materials from either or both of the Company or Parent
authorized by Section 7A(e) of the Clayton Act (a "Second Request"), then the
Termination Date shall be extended for an additional 

sixty (60) days unless Parent and the Representative by mutual written consent
agree not to extend the Termination Date;

(iv) by the Representative, upon written notice to Parent, if there shall have
been a breach of any of the representations, warranties, agreements or
covenants set forth in this Agreement on the part of Parent or Merger Sub or
any of such representations and warranties shall have become untrue in a
manner that would result in any conditions set forth in Sections 6.3(a),
6.3(b) or 6.3(c) not being satisfied prior to the Termination Date, such
breach or inaccuracy has not been waived by the Representative, and the breach
or inaccuracy, if capable of being cured, has not been cured within thirty
(30) days following the Representative's written notice to Parent of such
breach or inaccuracy or is not capable of being cured on or prior to the
Termination Date; provided that the right to terminate this Agreement under
this Section 7.1(a)(iv) shall not be available to the Representative if the
Company is then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant,
or other agreement contained herein;

(v) by Parent, upon written notice to the Representative, if there shall have
been a breach of any of the representations, warranties, agreements or
covenants set forth in this Agreement on the part of the Company or any of
such representations and warranties shall have become untrue in a manner that
would result in any conditions set forth in Sections 6.2(a), 6.2(b) or 6.2(c)
not being satisfied prior to the Termination Date, such breach or inaccuracy
has not been waived by Parent, and the breach or inaccuracy, if capable of
being cured, has not been cured within thirty (30) days following Parent's
written notice to the Representative of such breach or inaccuracy or is not
capable of being cured on or prior to the Termination Date; provided that the
right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 7.1(a)(v) shall not be
available to Parent if it is then in material breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant, or other agreement contained herein;

(vi) by Parent if there has been a Company Material Adverse Effect since the
date hereof;

(vii) by the Representative, whether or not the Representative or the Company
has sought or is entitled to seek specific performance pursuant to Section
10.10, if (A) all of the conditions set forth in Sections 6.1 and 6.2 have
been satisfied or waived (other than those conditions which by their terms
cannot be satisfied until the Closing and those conditions that Parent's
breach has caused not to be satisfied) and (B) Parent fails to consummate the
Transactions within three (3) Business Days following the date on which the
Closing was required to have occurred pursuant to Section 2.1; or

(viii) by the Company is there has been a Parent Material Adverse Effect since
the date hereof.

(b) In the event of termination by the Representative or Parent pursuant to
this Section 7.1, written notice thereof shall forthwith be given to the other
and the Transaction shall be terminated, without further action by any Party.
If the Transactions are terminated as provided herein, Parent shall return to
the Company or destroy all documents and other material received 

from the Company or the Representative relating to the Transaction, whether so
obtained before or after the execution hereof.

7.2 Effect of Termination. If this Agreement is terminated and the Transaction
is abandoned as described in Section 7.1, this Agreement shall become null and
void and of no further force and effect, without any liability or obligation
on the part of any Party or their respective directors, officers, employees,
owners, representatives or Affiliates, and the Transaction shall be abandoned
without further action by the Parties, except for (i) the penultimate sentence
of Section 5.2(a) (Access to Information) and (ii) Sections 7.2 (Effect of
Termination) and ARTICLE X (Miscellaneous), each of which, shall survive such
termination. Nothing in this Section 7.2, however, shall be deemed to release
any Party from any liability for any willful breach by such Party of the terms
and provisions of this Agreement prior to termination. For purposes of this
Sections 7.2, "willful" shall mean a breach that is a consequence of an act
undertaken by the breaching Party with the knowledge (actual or constructive)
that the taking of such act would, or would be reasonably expected to, cause a
breach of this Agreement.

ARTICLE VIII

TAX MATTERS

8.1 Intended Tax Treatment. The Parties are entering into this Agreement with
the intention that the Merger qualify as a taxable purchase of the stock of
the Company for federal income tax purposes, and none of the Parties or any
Seller will take any position or actions inconsistent with such treatment.

8.2 Cooperation and Exchange of Information. The Representative, the Surviving
Company, and Parent shall provide each other with such cooperation and
information as any of them reasonably may request of the others, and at the
sole cost and expense of the requesting party, in preparing or filing any Tax
Return pursuant to this ARTICLE VII or in connection with any audit,
examination or other Legal Proceeding in respect of Taxes of the Group
Companies. Such cooperation and information shall include providing powers of
attorney, copies of relevant Tax Returns or portions thereof, together with
accompanying schedules, related work papers and documents relating to rulings
or other determinations by tax authorities. Each of the Representative, the
Surviving Company, and Parent shall retain all Tax Returns, schedules and work
papers, records and other documents in its possession relating to Tax matters
of The Company for any Taxable period beginning before the Closing Date until
the expiration of the statute of limitations of the Taxable periods to which
such Tax Returns and other documents relate, without regard to extensions
except to the extent notified by any of the other parties in writing of such
extensions for the respective Tax periods.

8.3 Tax Returns.

(a) The Company shall prepare and timely file, or cause to be prepared and
timely filed, all Tax Returns of the Group Companies required to be filed by
it that are due on or before the Closing Date (taking into account any
extensions), and shall timely pay all Taxes that are due and payable on or
before the Closing Date (taking into account any extensions). Any such Tax 

Return shall be prepared in a manner consistent with past practice (unless
otherwise required by applicable Tax Law).

(b) The Representative shall prepare and timely file, or cause to be prepared
and timely filed, all Tax Returns required to be filed by the Group Companies
after the Closing Date with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period (a "Seller Tax
Return"). Any such Seller Tax Return shall be prepared in a manner consistent
with the Group Companies' past practice (unless otherwise required by Law)
and, if it is an income or other material Tax Return, shall be submitted by
the Representative to Parent (together with schedules, statements and, to the
extent requested by Parent, supporting documentation) at least forty-five (45)
days prior to the due date (including extensions) of such Tax Return. If
Parent objects to any item on any such Seller Tax Return, Parent shall, within
thirty (30) days after delivery of such Tax Return, notify the Representative
in writing that it so objects, specifying with reasonable particularity any
such item and stating with reasonable specificity the factual or legal basis
for any such objection. If a notice of objection shall be duly delivered,
Parent and the Representative shall negotiate in good faith and use their
commercially reasonable best efforts to resolve such items. If Parent and the
Representative are unable to reach such agreement within ten (10) days after
receipt by the Representative of such notice, the disputed items shall be
resolved by the Accounting Referee and any determination by the Accounting
Referee shall be final. The Accounting Referee shall resolve any disputed
items within twenty (20) days of having the item referred to it pursuant to
such procedures as it may require. If the Accounting Referee is unable to
resolve any disputed items before the due date for such Tax Return, the Tax
Return shall be filed as prepared by the Representative and then amended to
reflect the Accounting Referee's resolution. The costs, fees, and expenses of
the Accounting Referee shall ultimately be borne by Parent, on the one hand,
and the Sellers, on the other hand, in the same proportion as the aggregate
amount of the disputed items that is unsuccessfully disputed (as determined by
the Accounting Referee) by Parent and the Representative (on behalf of the
Sellers), as applicable, bears to the total amount of the disputed items
submitted to the Accounting Referee. Except as provided in the preceding
sentence, all other costs and expenses incurred by the Parties in connection
with resolving any dispute hereunder before the Accounting Referee shall be
borne by the Party incurring such cost and expense.

(c) Parent shall prepare and timely file, or cause to be prepared and timely
filed, all Tax Returns required to be filed by the Group Companies after the
Closing Date with respect to a Straddle Period (a "Parent Tax Return"). Any
such Parent Tax Return shall be prepared in a manner consistent with the Group
Companies' past practice (unless otherwise required by Law) and, if it is an
income or other material Tax Return, shall be submitted by Parent to the
Representative (together with schedules, statements and, to the extent
requested by the Representative, supporting documentation) at least forty-five
(45) days prior to the due date (including extensions) of such Tax Return. If
the Representative objects to any item on any such Parent Tax Return that
relates to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, the Representative shall, within thirty
(30) days after delivery of such Tax Return, notify Parent in writing that it
so objects, specifying with reasonable particularity any such item and stating
with reasonable specificity the factual or legal basis for any such objection.
If a notice of objection shall be duly delivered, Parent and the
Representative shall negotiate in good faith and use their commercially
reasonable best efforts to resolve such items. If Parent and the
Representative are unable to reach such agreement within ten days after
receipt by Parent of such 

notice, the disputed items shall be resolved by the Accounting Referee and any
determination by the Accounting Referee shall be final. The Accounting Referee
shall resolve any disputed items within twenty (20) days of having the item
referred to it pursuant to such procedures as it may require. If the
Accounting Referee is unable to resolve any disputed items before the due date
for such Tax Return, the Tax Return shall be filed as prepared by Parent and
then amended to reflect the Accounting Referee's resolution. The costs, fees,
and expenses of the Accounting Referee shall ultimately be borne by Parent, on
the one hand, and the Sellers, on the other hand, in the same proportion as
the aggregate amount of the disputed items that is unsuccessfully disputed (as
determined by the Accounting Referee) by Parent and the Representative (on
behalf of the Sellers), as applicable, bears to the total amount of the
disputed items submitted to the Accounting Referee. Except as provided in the
preceding sentence, all other costs and expenses incurred by the Parties in
connection with resolving any dispute hereunder before the Accounting Referee
shall be borne by the Party incurring such cost and expense. The preparation
and filing of any Tax Return of the Group Companies that does not relate to a
Straddle Period shall be exclusively within the control of Parent.

8.4 Straddle Period Taxes. To the extent permissible under applicable Laws,
the Parties agree to elect (and have the Company and each Operating Subsidiary
elect) to have each Tax year of the Company and each Operating Subsidiary to
end on the Closing Date and, if such election is not permitted or required in
a jurisdiction with respect to a specific Tax such that the Company or any
Operating Subsidiary is required to file a Tax Return for a Straddle Period,
to utilize the following conventions for determining the amount of Taxes
attributable to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date:
(i) in the case of property Taxes and other similar Taxes imposed on a
periodic basis, the amount attributable to the portion of the Straddle Period
ending on the Closing Date shall equal the Taxes for the entire Straddle
Period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of
calendar days in the portion of the period ending on the Closing Date and the
denominator of which is the total number of calendar days in the entire
Straddle Period; and (ii) in the case of all other Taxes (including income
Taxes, sales Taxes, employment Taxes, withholding Taxes, etc.), the amount
attributable to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date
shall be determined as if the Company or Operating Subsidiary filed a separate
Tax Return with respect to such Taxes for the portion of the Straddle Period
ending on and as of the end of the day on the Closing Date using a "closing of
the books methodology." For purposes of clause (ii), (A) any item determined
on an annual or periodic basis (including amortization and depreciation
deductions) shall be allocated to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on
the Closing Date based on the relative number of days in such portion of the
Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date as compared to the number of days
in the entire Straddle Period; and (B) any item (or Tax) resulting from a
Parent Closing Date Transaction shall be attributed to the portion of the
Straddle Period beginning after the Closing Date. For the avoidance of doubt,
for purposes of allocating amounts required to be included by Parent or any
Group Company in income under Section 951(a) or 951A of the Code with respect
to any Straddle Period of a foreign Group Company, the taxable year of the
relevant foreign Operating Subsidiary giving rise to the income required to be
included shall be deemed to close on the Closing Date in the same manner as
described above. 

8.5 Contests. Parent agrees to give written notice to the Representative of
the receipt of any written notice by a Group Company or the Surviving Company,
Parent, or any of Parent's Affiliates which involves the assertion of any
claim, or the commencement of any Legal Proceeding, in each case relating to
Taxes and in respect of which an indemnity may be sought by Parent pursuant to
Section 8.10 (a "Tax Claim"); provided that failure to comply with this
provision shall not affect Parent's right to indemnification hereunder, except
to the extent that the Sellers are materially prejudiced thereby. The
Representative shall control the contest or resolution of any Tax Claim that
relates solely to a Pre-Closing Tax Period (a "Seller Tax Claim"); provided,
however, that the Representative shall obtain the prior written consent of
Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or
delayed) before entering into any settlement of a Seller Tax Claim or ceasing
to defend such Seller Tax Claim; and, provided, further, that Parent shall be
entitled to participate in the defense of such Seller Tax Claim and to employ
counsel of its choice for such purpose, the fees and expenses of which
separate counsel shall be borne solely by Parent. Parent shall control the
contest or resolution of any Tax Claim that relates to a Straddle Period (a
"Parent Tax Claim"); provided, however, that Parent shall obtain the prior
written consent of Representative (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned, or delayed) before entering into any settlement of a
Parent Tax Claim or ceasing to defend such Parent Tax Claim; and, provided,
further, that Representative shall be entitled to participate in the defense
of such Parent Tax Claim and to employ counsel of its choice for such purpose,
the fees and expenses of which separate counsel shall be borne solely by
Representative (on behalf of the Sellers).

8.6 338(g) Elections. Neither Parent nor any Group Company shall make an
election under Section 338(g) of the Code with respect to the Transactions, or
make any other Tax election or take any other action that has the effect of
increasing the amount of Taxes attributable to a Pre-Closing Tax Period.

8.7 Other Tax Matters. Parent shall cause the Group Companies that are U.S.
entities to join Parent's "consolidated group" (as defined in Treasury
Regulation Section 1.1502-76(h)) effective on the day after the Closing Date.

8.8 Transfer Taxes. Any Transfer Taxes payable in connection with the
Transaction shall be borne solely by Parent. Except as otherwise required by
Law, Parent shall duly and timely prepare and file any Tax Return relating to
such Taxes. Parent shall give the Representative a copy of each such Tax
Return for its review and comments at least fifteen (15) days prior to filing
and shall give the Representative a copy of such Tax Return as filed, together
with proof of payment of the Taxes shown thereon to be payable. The Parties
further agree, upon request, to use their reasonable best efforts to obtain
any certificate or other document from any Governmental Authority responsible
for Taxes or any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce, or
eliminate any Transfer Taxes (to the extent applicable) that could be imposed
with the transactions contemplated under this Agreement. 

8.9 Tax Refunds. Parent shall cause the Company to pay to the Representative
for the benefit of the stockholders of the Company, promptly upon receipt
thereof, any and all refunds of Taxes (including interest thereon if any
received from any Governmental Authority with respect to such refund) received
after the Closing Date with respect to, or attributable to any Pre-Closing Tax
Period, except to the extent that such refund (i) arises as the result of a
carryback of a loss or other Tax benefit from a period or portion thereof
beginning after the Closing Date or (ii) is included in the calculation of
Working Capital.

8.10 Tax Indemnification. Except to the extent treated as a liability in the
calculation of Working Capital, Sellers shall (severally, but not jointly,
based on each Seller's Pro Rata Share) indemnify Parent, the Surviving
Company, and each Purchaser Indemnitee and hold them harmless from and against
(a) all income Taxes of the Group Companies or relating to the business of the
Group Companies for all Pre-Closing Tax Periods; (b) all income Taxes of any
member of an affiliated, consolidated, combined, or unitary group of which a
Group Company (or any predecessor of a Group Company) is or was a member on or
prior to the Closing Date by reason of a liability under Treasury Regulation
Section 1.1502-6 or any comparable provisions of foreign, state, or local Law;
(c) all income Taxes of any person imposed on a Group Company arising under
the principles of transferee or successor liability or by Contract (other than
a Contract entered into in the Ordinary Course of Business that does not
primarily relate to Taxes), relating to an event or transaction occurring
before the Closing Date, and (d) all Taxes arising from the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and incurred by a Group Company (except to the
extent otherwise set forth in this Agreement) with respect to any Pre-Closing
Tax Period, excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, all Transfer Taxes. In each
of the above cases, Sellers shall (severally, but not jointly, based on each
Seller's Pro Rata Share) reimburse Parent for any Taxes of the Group Companies
that are the responsibility of Sellers pursuant to this Section 8.10 within
sixty (60) Business Days after Parent or the Surviving Company provides
written notice to the Representative of the payment of such Taxes, which
notice shall set forth the amount and type of such Taxes with reasonable
specificity, and certified evidence of payment thereof. The limitations on
indemnification set forth in Section 9.4, including the limitations set forth
in Section 9.4(a) and Section 9.4(b), shall apply to this Section 8.10 mutatis
mutandis.

8.11 Tax Treatment of Indemnification Payments. Any indemnification payments
pursuant to this Agreement shall be treated by the Parties as an adjustment
for Tax purposes to the Merger Consideration, unless otherwise required by
applicable Tax Law.

8.12 Survival. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the
provisions of this ARTICLE VIII shall survive until the earlier of (A) the
expiration of all applicable statutes of limitations (giving effect to any
waiver, mitigation, or extension thereof) plus 60 days and (B) the six
(6)-year anniversary of the Closing Date.

8.13 Overlap. To the extent that any obligation or responsibility pursuant to
ARTICLE IX may overlap with an obligation or responsibility pursuant to this
ARTICLE VIII, the provisions of this ARTICLE VIII shall govern. The
indemnities of Sellers set forth in this ARTICLE VIII and the indemnities of
Sellers set forth in ARTICLE IX, to the extent relating to Taxes, shall be
applied without duplication. 

ARTICLE IX

INDEMNIFICATION

9.1 Survival of Representations and Covenants. Except as otherwise set forth
in this Section 9.1, the representations and warranties of the Company, Parent
and Merger Sub contained in ARTICLE III and ARTICLE IV, or in any certificate
delivered pursuant to Section 6.2(e) or Section 6.3(d), shall survive the
Closing until March 15, 2020. The representations and warranties in Section
3.1 (Organization and Power), Section 3.2 (Authorization of Agreement),
Section 3.4 (Capitalization; Operating Subsidiaries), Section 3.24 (Financial
Advisors), Section 4.1 (Organization and Power), Section 4.2 (Authorization of
Agreement), Section 4.5 (Financial Capability), Section 4.6 (Solvency), and
Section 4.8 (Financial Advisors) (collectively, the "Fundamental
Representations") shall survive until the earlier of (A) the expiration of the
statute of limitations applicable for breach of contract claims in the State
of Delaware and (B) the six (6)-year anniversary of the Closing Date. The
representations and warranties contained in Section 3.10 (Taxes) shall survive
until the earlier of (A) the expiration of all applicable statutes of
limitations (giving effect to any waiver, mitigation, or extension thereof)
plus 60 days and (B) the six (6)-year anniversary of the Closing Date. All
covenants set forth herein to be performed prior to or at the Closing shall
terminate at the Closing, and all other covenants set forth herein to be
performed after the Closing shall survive the Closing in accordance with their
respective terms. It is the express intent of the Parties that, if an
applicable survival period set forth in this Section 9.1 is shorter than the
statute of limitations that would otherwise apply, then, by contract, the
applicable statute of limitations shall be reduced to the survival period
contemplated hereby. Any claim for indemnity under this Agreement with respect
to any breach of any representation, warranty or covenant shall be deemed
time-barred, and no such claim shall be made after the survival period
specified in this Section 9.1; provided, however, that if a claim notice is
delivered in good faith pursuant to and in accordance with the requirements of
this ARTICLE IX with respect to any breach of any representation, warranty or
covenant prior to the expiration of the applicable survival period, the
indemnification claim under this ARTICLE IX with respect to such
representation, warranty or covenant shall survive until such indemnification
claim is finally resolved pursuant to this ARTICLE IX.

9.2 General Indemnification.

(a) Subject to the other provisions of this ARTICLE IX, from and after the
Closing, each Seller shall (severally but not jointly based on each Seller's
Pro Rata Share), indemnify, defend and hold each of Parent, Merger Sub and/or
their respective officers, directors, employees, Affiliates and agents (each a
"Purchaser Indemnitee") harmless from any direct damages, losses, liabilities,
obligations, claims of any kind, interest or expenses (including reasonable
attorneys' fees and expenses) ("Loss") actually incurred as a result of (i)
any breach of any representation or warranty made by the Company (A) contained
in ARTICLE III or (B) in the certificate delivered pursuant to Section 6.2(e),
(ii) any breach by any Seller of any of its covenants or agreements contained
herein which are to be performed after the Closing Date, (iii) any claim made
by any Seller relating to the calculations and determinations set forth on the
Pre-Closing Statement of such Person's rights with respect to the Total Merger
Consideration or any part thereof or (iv) the potential 

material liability described as "Microsoft SPLA Matter" in Section 3.16(e) of
the Company Disclosure Schedule (the "Potential Liability").

(b) Subject to the other provisions of this ARTICLE IX, from and after the
Closing, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Company to, indemnify,
defend and hold each Seller and their respective Affiliates, officers,
directors, employees and agents (each a "Seller Indemnitee" and, together with
any Purchaser Indemnitee, an "Indemnified Party" and, collectively, the
"Indemnified Parties") harmless from any Loss actually incurred as a result of
(i) any breach of any representation or warranty made by Parent or Merger Sub
(A) contained in ARTICLE IV or (B) in the certificate delivered pursuant to
Section 6.3(d), or (ii) any breach by Parent or the Surviving Company
(including by way of being the successor of Merger Sub and the Company) of any
of their respective covenants or agreements contained herein which are to be
performed by Parent or the Surviving Company, as applicable, after the Closing
Date.

(c) The obligations to indemnify and hold harmless pursuant to this Section
9.2 shall survive the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby for
the applicable period set forth in Section 9.1, except for claims for
indemnification asserted in good faith prior to the end of such applicable
period (which such specific claims shall survive until final resolution
thereof).

9.3 Notice of Claims; Third Party Claims.

(a) Notice of Claims.

(i) Any Indemnified Party seeking indemnification hereunder shall give
promptly (and, in any event, within the applicable periods set forth in
Section 9.1) to the party obligated to provide indemnification to such
Indemnified Party (an "Indemnitor") a written notice (the "Notice of Claim")
describing in reasonable detail the facts giving rise to the claim for
indemnification hereunder and shall include in such Notice of Claim (if then
known) the amount or the method of computation of the amount of such claim,
and a reference to the provision of this Agreement upon which such claim is
based; provided, however, that the failure of any Indemnified Party to give
the Claim Notice promptly as required by this Section 9.3(a) shall not affect
such Indemnified Party's rights under this ARTICLE IX except to the extent (x)
such failure is actually prejudicial to the rights and obligations of the
Indemnitor or (y) such Notice of Claim is delivered after the expiration of
the applicable periods set forth in Section 9.1.

(ii) After the giving of any Claim Notice pursuant hereto, the amount of
indemnification to which an Indemnified Party shall be entitled under this
ARTICLE IX shall be determined: (i) by the written agreement between the
Indemnified Party and the Indemnitor; (ii) by a final judgment or decree of
any court of competent jurisdiction; or (iii) by any other means to which the
Indemnified Party and the Indemnitor shall agree. The judgment or decree of a
court shall be deemed final when the time for appeal, if any, shall have
expired and no appeal shall have been taken or when all appeals taken shall
have been finally determined. The Indemnified Party shall have the burden of
proof in establishing the amount of Losses suffered by it. All amounts due to
the Indemnified Party as so finally determined shall be paid by wire transfer
within thirty (30) days after such final determination. 

(b) Third Party Claims.

(i) If a claim, action, suit or proceeding by a Person who is not a Party or
an Affiliate thereof (a "Third Party Claim") is made against any Indemnified
Party, and if such Person intends to seek indemnity with respect thereto under
this ARTICLE IX, such Indemnified Party shall promptly (and, in any event,
within the applicable periods set forth in Section 9.1) give a Notice of Claim
to the Indemnitor; provided that the failure to give such Notice of Claim
shall not relieve the Indemnitor of its obligations hereunder, except to the
extent (x) such failure is actually prejudicial to the rights and obligations
of the Indemnitor or (y) such Notice of Claim is delivered after the
expiration of the applicable periods set forth in Section 9.1. Thereafter, the
Indemnified Party shall deliver to the Indemnitor, within five (5) days after
the Indemnified Party's receipt thereof, copies of all notices and documents
(including court papers) received by the Indemnified Party relating to the
Third Party Claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, should a Person be
physically served with a complaint with regard to a Third Party Claim, the
Indemnified Party must notify the Indemnitor with a copy of the complaint
within five (5) days after receipt thereof and shall deliver to the
Indemnitor, within five (5) days after the receipt of such complaint, copies
of notices and documents (including court papers) received by the Indemnified
Party relating to the Third Party Claim (or in each case such earlier time as
may be necessary to enable the Indemnitor to respond to the court proceedings
on a timely basis).

(ii) The Indemnitor shall have thirty (30) days after receipt of such notice
to assume the conduct and control, at the expense of the Indemnitor, of the
settlement or defense thereof, and the Indemnified Party shall, at its sole
cost and expense, cooperate with the Indemnitor in connection therewith;
provided that the Indemnitor shall permit the Indemnified Party to participate
in such settlement or defense through counsel chosen by such Indemnified Party
(and the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be borne by such Indemnified
Party). So long as the Indemnitor is reasonably contesting any such claim in
good faith, the Indemnified Party shall not pay or settle any such claim. If
the Indemnitor elects to conduct the defense and settlement of a Third Party
Claim, then the Indemnified Party shall have the right to pay or settle such
Third Party Claim; provided, that, in such event, it shall waive any right to
indemnity by the Indemnitor for all Losses related to such claim unless the
Indemnitor shall have consented to such payment or settlement. If the
Indemnitor does not notify the Indemnified Party within thirty (30) days after
the receipt of the Indemnified Party's Notice of Claim hereunder that it
elects to undertake the defense thereof, the Indemnified Party shall have the
right to contest, settle or compromise the claim but shall not thereby waive
any right to indemnity therefor pursuant to this Agreement. The Indemnitor
shall not, except with the consent of the Indemnified Party (which shall not
be unreasonably withheld or delayed), enter into any settlement that does not
include as a term thereof the giving by the Person(s) asserting such claim to
all Indemnified Parties of a release from all liability with respect to such
claim or consent to entry of any judgment.

(iii) All of the Parties shall cooperate in the defense or prosecution of any
Third Party Claim in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder and
each of Parent and the Surviving Company (or a duly authorized representative
of such Party) shall (and shall cause the Group Companies to) furnish such
records, information and testimony, and attend such 

conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials and appeals, as may be
reasonably requested in connection therewith.

9.4 Limitation on Indemnification Obligations. The rights of the Purchaser
Indemnitees and Seller Indemnitees to indemnification pursuant to Section 9.2
are subject to the following limitations:

(a) The Purchaser Indemnitees, on the one hand, and the Seller Indemnitees, on
the other hand, shall not be entitled to recover Losses pursuant to Section
9.2(a)(i) or Section 9.2(b)(i) until the total amount which the Purchaser
Indemnitees or the Seller Indemnitees, respectively, would recover thereunder
(as limited by the provisions of Section 9.4(f) and Section 10.15), but for
this Section 9.4(a), exceeds $1,850,000 (the "Deductible"), in which case the
Purchaser Indemnitees or the Seller Indemnitees, respectively, shall only be
entitled to recover Losses in excess of such amount, subject to the other
limitations herein; provided, that Losses indemnifiable in respect of (i)
breaches of the Fundamental Representations, (ii) the Potential Liability, or
(iii) any facts or circumstances which constitute Actual Fraud shall neither
be applied toward, nor limited by, the Deductible.

(b) The maximum liability of Sellers under Section 9.2(a) or of Parent and the
Surviving Company under Section 9.2(b) with respect to indemnifiable Losses
(except with respect to breaches of Fundamental Representations, the Potential
Liability or in cases of Actual Fraud) shall be an amount equal to $9,000,000.

(c) The maximum liability of Sellers under Section 9.2(a) or of Parent and the
Surviving Company under Section 9.2(b) with respect to indemnifiable Losses
for breaches of Fundamental Representations and in cases of Actual Fraud shall
not exceed the Final Closing Date Merger Consideration. The maximum liability
of Sellers under Section 9.2(a)(iv) with respect to indemnifiable Losses
related to the Potential Liability shall be not exceed the Special Holdback
Amount.

(d) The Purchaser Indemnitees shall not be entitled to indemnification
pursuant to Section 9.2(a) for any Loss to the extent that (i) prior to the
date hereof the Group Companies recorded a reserve in their consolidated books
and records with respect to such Loss or in a general category of items or
matters similar in nature to the specific items or matters giving rise to such
Loss, (ii) such Loss was taken into account in the Final Closing Date Merger
Consideration or if Parent shall have requested a reduction in the Merger
Consideration in a Dispute Notice on account of any matter forming the basis
for such Loss or alleged Loss, (iii) the Purchaser Indemnitees could have,
with commercially reasonable efforts, mitigated or prevented such Loss, or
(iv) such Loss results from or is magnified by the action or inaction of any
Purchaser Indemnitee after the Closing.

(e) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, Losses
for which Sellers may be liable pursuant to Section 9.2(a)(i) shall exclude
all Losses relating to the breach of any representation or warranty of the
Company to the extent the Representative establishes to a reasonable certainty
that Parent or Merger Sub had actual knowledge as of the Closing of material
information that is materially inconsistent with the representation or
warranty on which the claim of the Purchaser Indemnitee is based, and could
reasonably be expected to have an 

understanding of the relevance of such materially inconsistent information to
such representation and warranty, and thereby it can reasonably be concluded
that Parent or Merger Sub has waived the right to rely on such representation
or warranty or should be estopped from asserting such claim as a result
thereof. Parent and Merger Sub expressly acknowledge Sellers' and the
Representative's right to establish that Parent or Merger Sub have waived such
right or should otherwise be estopped from asserting such claim based on the
breach of such representation or warranty due to such actual knowledge.

(f) The amount of any and all Losses shall be determined net of (i) any
amounts recovered or recoverable by the Purchaser Indemnitees under insurance
policies or other collateral sources (such as contractual indemnities of any
Person which are contained outside of this Agreement) with respect to such
Losses, in each case, net of costs of collection resulting from making any
claim thereunder and (ii) any Tax benefits realizable by or accruing to the
Purchaser Indemnitees with respect to such Losses.

(g) In the event that a Purchaser Indemnitee realizes Tax benefits or
recovers, under insurance policies or from other collateral sources, any
amount in respect of a matter for which such Purchaser Indemnitee was
indemnified pursuant to Section 9.2(a), such Purchaser Indemnitee shall
promptly pay over to an account or accounts designated by the Representative
(on behalf of the Sellers) for distribution to the Sellers the amount so
recovered (after deducting therefrom the amount of the expenses incurred by
such Purchaser Indemnitee in procuring such recovery), but not in excess of
the sum of (i) any amount previously so paid to or on behalf of such Purchaser
Indemnitee in respect of such matter and (ii) any amount expended by the
Sellers in pursuing or defending any claim arising out of such matter; and

(h) For purposes of determining Losses pursuant to Section 9.2(a)(i) or
Section 9.2(b)(i) (but not for purposes of determining whether a breach has
occurred), the representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement
shall be considered without regard to any materiality qualification (including
such terms as "material," "Company Material Adverse Effect" and "Parent
Material Adverse Effect") set forth therein.

9.5 Manner of Payment.

(a) Except as provided in Section 9.5(b) with respect to the Potential
Liability, any indemnification payment to be made by Indemnifying Party
pursuant to this ARTICLE IX is to be paid by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account designated by the Indemnified Party within five
(5) Business Days after the date of the determination of the indemnification
payment either by a mutual agreement of Parent and the Representative or by a
final decision of a court of competent jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the
foregoing sentence, in the event Sellers are the Indemnitors, then Purchaser
may elect, in its sole discretion and upon written notice to the
Representative, that all or any part of any indemnification payment to be made
to the Purchaser Indemnitees (provided that such indemnification payment has
been determined either by a mutual agreement of Parent and the Representative
or by a final decision of a court of competent jurisdiction) is to be paid by
reduction, dollar for dollar, of the Additional Merger Consideration Payment
actually payable to Sellers. 

(b) As soon as practicable following the Closing, the Surviving Company shall
initiate an effort on behalf of Parent and the Surviving Company and use its
best efforts to confirm and resolve, including with any necessary third party
or third parties, the Potential Liability. This effort shall be led by
Kristoffer Collo in his capacity as President, MicroPact, of the Surviving
Company, or his designee (subject to reasonable approval by Parent), in
consultation with Parent and the Representative. The Surviving Company's
objective shall be to confirm and resolve the Potential Liability, while
minimizing the costs, fees, expenses and settlement amounts payable in
connection with such efforts, no later than one hundred eighty (180) days
after Closing (the "Resolution Date"). Parent and the Representative
acknowledge and agree that it may not be possible to determine with certainty
the amount of the Potential Liability on or before the Resolution Date and,
therefore, that the Resolution Date shall be extended for such additional
period as reasonably necessary to make such determination, as mutually agreed
in writing by Parent and the Representative. Once the Potential Liability is
confirmed and resolved, (i) if the amount thereof (the "Resolved Amount") is
greater than zero, the Special Holdback Amount shall be deemed automatically
reduced by the Resolved Amount, (ii) if the Resolved Amount is less than the
Special Holdback Amount (including if the Resolved Amount is zero), Parent
shall disburse the balance of the Special Holdback Amount to the Paying Agent
(for further distribution to the Sellers who delivered to Parent a duly
completed and executed Letter of Transmittal and Surrendered Certificate(s)
prior to such time). If the Resolved Amount is greater than the Special
Holdback Amount, then the Representative may elect, in its sole discretion, to
pay such excess amount by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account designated by Parent within five (5) Business Days after the date of
the determination of the Resolved Amount, or, in the event the Representative
elects not to make such payment, Parent shall cause such excess amount to be
recorded as a 2019 expense on the consolidated income statement of the Group
Companies (regardless of whether Parent may have accrued a balance sheet
reserve for any portion of the Potential Liability), which shall not
constitute a violation of Section 1.15(c). If the amount of the Potential
Liability has not been finally determined on or before the first anniversary
of the Closing, Parent and the Representative agree to negotiate the release
of the Special Holdback Amount (through the disbursement to the Paying Agent
for further distribution to the Sellers) except to the extent all or any
portion thereof is reasonably subject to continuing negotiations or dispute
with a third party or third parties as to the amount of the Potential
Liability. This Section 9.5(b) shall be the exclusive manner of payment by or
on behalf Sellers with respect to the Potential Liability. Parent shall
otherwise be responsible for any payment to a third party or third parties
with respect to the Potential Liability.

9.6 Representative. Each Seller hereby appoints the Representative to act as
the agent of the Sellers with full power to resolve all questions, disputes,
conflicts and controversies concerning Losses as provided in this ARTICLE IX.
Purchaser Indemnitees are entitled to rely on the acts and agreements of the
Representative as the acts and agreements of the Sellers under this ARTICLE
IX. With respect to any amount payable to the Seller Indemnitees under this
ARTICLE IX by Parent, payment by Parent of such amount to the Representative
shall be deemed a payment of such amount to the Seller Indemnitees, and upon
making any such payment to the Representative, Parent shall have no further
obligation or liability with respect thereto. 

9.7 Exclusive Remedy. Except (a) with respect to the matters covered by
Sections 1.10 and 1.15, (b) in the case where a Party seeks to obtain specific
performance pursuant to Section 10.10, (c) a Party's right to seek and obtain
any other equitable relief to which it shall be entitled under any other
Transaction Agreement, (d) any Party's right to seek any remedy on account of
the Company's Actual Fraud or actual common law fraud of Parent or Merger Sub
arising under this Agreement, as applicable and (e) the Representative's
rights to indemnification under Section 10.13, from and after the Closing, the
rights of the Parties to indemnification pursuant to the provisions of this
ARTICLE IX shall be the sole and exclusive remedy for the Parties with respect
to any matter in any way arising from or relating to this Agreement or its
subject matter. Subject to the foregoing, to the maximum extent permitted by
law, the Parties hereby waive all other rights and remedies with respect to
any matter in any way relating to this Agreement or arising in connection
herewith, whether under any Law at common law, in equity or otherwise.

ARTICLE X

10.1 Expenses. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or the other
Transaction Agreements, each Party shall bear its own costs and expenses

instrument contemplated hereby or thereby and the consummation of the
Transaction. Parent shall be solely responsible for all governmental fees and
charges applicable to any requests for Governmental Approvals or to the
consummation of the Transaction. Parent, on the one hand, and the
Representative, on the other hand, shall each pay one-half of all charges and
expenses of the Paying Agent in connection with this Agreement.

10.2 GOVERNING LAW. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN
ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO THE

SECTION 1.15(a) (WHICH WILL GOVERN ANY DISPUTE RESPECTIVELY ARISING
THEREUNDER), THE PARTIES AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTE, CONTROVERSY OR CLAIM ARISING
OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE TRANSACTION OR TO THIS AGREEMENT, OR THE VALIDITY,
INTERPRETATION, BREACH OR TERMINATION THEREOF, INCLUDING CLAIMS SEEKING
REDRESS OR ASSERTING RIGHTS UNDER ANY LAW, SHALL BE RESOLVED EXCLUSIVELY IN
THE STATE OR FEDERAL COURTS SITTING IN THE STATE OF DELAWARE (THE "DELAWARE
COURTS"). IN THAT CONTEXT, AND WITHOUT LIMITING THE GENERALITY OF THE
FOREGOING, EACH PARTY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY:

(a) SUBMITS FOR ITSELF AND ITS PROPERTY IN ANY ACTION RELATING TO THE

(b) CONSENTS THAT ANY SUCH ACTION MAY AND SHALL BE BROUGHT EXCLUSIVELY IN SUCH

OR JURISDICTION OF ANY SUCH ACTION IN ANY SUCH COURT OR THAT SUCH ACTION WAS
BROUGHT IN AN INCONVENIENT FORUM, AND AGREES NOT TO PLEAD OR CLAIM THE SAME;

(c) WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION (WHETHER BASED ON
CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE TRANSACTION OR
TO THIS AGREEMENT, OR ITS PERFORMANCE UNDER OR THE ENFORCEMENT OF THIS

(e) AGREES THAT NOTHING IN THIS AGREEMENT SHALL AFFECT THE RIGHT TO EFFECT
SERVICE OF PROCESS IN ANY OTHER MANNER PERMITTED BY THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF
DELAWARE.

10.4 Recovery of Costs and Attorneys' Fees . If there are any Legal
Proceedings arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, after the entry of a final written non-appealable order,
if one Party has prevailed in the dispute, it shall be entitled to recover
from the other Party all court costs, fees and expenses relating to such Legal
Proceeding, including reasonable attorneys' fees that are specifically
included in such court award.

10.5 Further Assurances. After the Closing, each Party shall from time to
time, at the request of and without further cost or expense to the other,
execute and deliver such other instruments of conveyance and assumption and
take such other actions as may reasonably be requested in order to more
effectively consummate the Transaction.

10.6 Entire Agreement. This Agreement (including the Schedules and Exhibits
hereto), the documents delivered pursuant hereto and the other Transaction
Agreements represent the entire understanding and agreement between the
Parties with respect to the Transaction and supersedes all prior agreements
among the Parties respecting the Transaction. The Parties have voluntarily
agreed to define their rights, liabilities and obligations respecting the
Transaction exclusively in contract pursuant to the express terms and
provisions of this Agreement; and the Parties expressly disclaim that they are
owed any duties or are entitled to any remedies not expressly set forth in
this Agreement. 

10.7 Amendments and Waivers. Prior to Closing, this Agreement can be amended,
supplemented or changed, and any provision hereof can be waived, only by
written instrument making specific reference to this Agreement signed by
Parent and the Company. Following Closing, this Agreement can be amended,
supplemented or changed, and any provision hereof can be waived, only by
written instrument making specific reference to this Agreement signed by
Parent and the Representative. The waiver by any Party of a breach of any
provision of this Agreement shall not operate or be construed as a further or
continuing waiver of such breach or as a waiver of any other or subsequent
breach. No failure on the part of any Party to exercise, and no delay in
exercising, any right, power or remedy hereunder shall operate as a waiver
thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of such right, power or
remedy by such Party preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, power or remedy. In the event any provision of
any other Transaction Agreement shall in any way conflict with the provisions
of this Agreement (except where a provision therein expressly provides that it
is intended to take precedence over this Agreement), this Agreement shall
control.

10.8 Notices. All notices, requests, demands, and other communications to any
Party or given under this Agreement will be in writing and delivered
personally, by overnight delivery or courier, by registered mail, or by
electronic transmission (with confirmation of receipt of electronic
transmission) to the Parties at the address or electronic mail address
specified below. Each notice, request, demand, or communication that is
mailed, delivered, or transmitted in the manner described above shall be
deemed sufficiently given, served, sent, and received for all purposes at such
time as it is delivered to the addressee with the return receipt, the delivery
receipt, the affidavit of messenger, the confirmation of receipt of electronic
transmission, or at such time as delivery is refused by the addressee upon
presentation. Each Party may designate by notice in writing a new address to
which any notice, demand, request, or communication may thereafter be so

10.9 Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any Law or public policy,
all other terms or provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in
full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the
Transaction is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any Party.
Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal
or incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as
closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the Transaction is
consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible.

10.10 Specific Performance.

(a) Each Party acknowledges and agrees that the other Parties would be
irreparably damaged if any of the provisions of this Agreement are not
performed in accordance with their specific terms and that any breach of this
Agreement by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub could not be adequately
compensated in all cases by monetary damages alone, even if available.
Accordingly, in addition to any other right or remedy to which any Party may
be entitled at law or in equity, before or after the Closing, each Party shall
be entitled to enforce any provision of this Agreement by a decree of specific
performance and to temporary, preliminary and permanent injunctive relief to
prevent breaches or threatened breaches of any of the provisions of this
Agreement, without posting any bond or other undertaking. Each of the Parties
further agrees that it shall not object to, or take any position inconsistent
with respect to, whether in a court of law or otherwise, (i) the
appropriateness of the specific performance contemplated by this Section 10.10
and (ii) the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts set forth in Section 10.3
with respect to any action brought for any such remedy.

(b) Each Party further agrees that (i) by seeking the remedies provided for in
this Section 10.10, a Party shall not in any respect waive its right to seek
any other form of relief that may be available to such party under this
Agreement or in the event that the remedies provided 

for in this Section 10.10 are not available or otherwise are not granted, and
(ii) nothing set forth in this Section 10.10 shall require any Party to
institute any action for (or limit any Party's right to institute any action
for) specific performance under this Section 10.10 prior or as a condition to
exercising any termination right under ARTICLE VII, nor shall the commencement
of any action pursuant to this Section 10.10 or anything set forth in this
Section 10.10 restrict or limit any such Party's right to terminate this
Agreement in accordance with ARTICLE VII, or pursue any other remedies under
this Agreement that may be available then or thereafter.

10.11 No Third-Party Beneficiaries; No Recourse Against Affiliates. Nothing in
this Agreement, express or implied, is intended or shall be construed to give
any rights to any Person or entity other than (a) the Parties and their
successors and permitted assigns, (b) the Purchaser Indemnitees and the Seller
Indemnitees and (c) each DandO Indemnified Person, who shall have the right to
enforce the obligations of Parent and the Company solely with respect to
Section 5.9. No past, present or future director, officer, employee,
incorporator, member, partner, stockholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney or
representative of the Company, any Operating Subsidiary, any Seller or any of
its respective Affiliates shall have any liability (whether in Law or in
equity or in contract or in tort) for any obligations or liabilities of the
Company arising under, in connection with or related to this Agreement or for
any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, the Transaction, including
any alleged nondisclosure or misrepresentations made by any such Persons.

10.12 Assignment. No Party may assign or transfer this Agreement or any right,
interest or obligation hereunder, directly or indirectly (by operation of Law
or otherwise), without the prior written approval of Parent, on the one hand,
and the Representative, on the other hand; provided, that each of Parent and
Merger Sub may assign its rights, but not its obligations, under this
Agreement to (a) any of its Affiliates or (b) its financing sources for
collateral purposes; and, provided, further that any such assignment shall not
relieve Parent or Merger Sub of its obligations hereunder. Any assignment in
violation of this Section 10.12 shall be void. Subject to the foregoing, this
Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties and
their respective successors and permitted assigns.

10.13 Authorization of Representative.

(a) By virtue of adoption of this Agreement by the Sellers, and without
further action by any such Seller, the Representative is hereby appointed,
authorized and empowered to act as an agent, representative and attorney-in-
fact for each of the Sellers in connection with and to facilitate the
consummation of the Transactions, including pursuant to the Paying Agent
Agreement and the matters related to (w) the Merger Consideration contemplated
by Section 1.10, (x) the payment of amounts from the Representative Expense
Fund Amount, (y) the preparation and filing of the Tax Returns with respect to
the Group Companies contemplated by ARTICLE VIII and (z) all other such items
and matters set forth in this Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements
contemplating participation by the Representative (collectively,
"Representative Actions"), in each case with the power and authority,
including power of substitution, acting in the name of or for and on behalf of
each Seller, and subject to the limitations set forth herein or therein: (i)
to execute and deliver and receive such waivers and consents as the
Representative, in its sole discretion, may deem necessary or desirable; (ii)
to collect and receive all moneys and other proceeds 

and property payable to the Representative from the Representative Expense
Fund Amount, and, subject to any applicable withholding Laws, and, net of any
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Representative, disburse and pay the
same to each Seller in accordance with such Seller's Pro Rata Share; (iii) to
authorize the set off, reduction, cancellation or the release of any funds
from the Holdback Amounts in accordance with this Agreement; (iv) to authorize
the release of any funds by the Paying Agent in accordance with this Agreement
and the Paying Agent Agreement; (v) to enforce and protect the rights and
interests of the Sellers and the Representative arising out of or under or in
any manner relating to any Representative Action, and to take any and all
actions which the Representative believes are necessary or appropriate in
respect thereof, including asserting or pursuing any claim, action, proceeding
or investigation (a "Claim") against Parent, Merger Sub and/or any of the
Group Companies (after the Closing) or defending any Claim by Parent, Merger
Sub and/or any of the Group Companies (after the Closing) against the Sellers
relating to this Agreement, consenting to, compromising or settling any such
Claims, conducting negotiations with Parent, Merger Sub, the Group Companies
(after the Closing) and their representatives regarding such Claims; (vi)
agree to, object to, negotiate, resolve, enter into settlements and
compromises of, demand arbitration or litigation of, and comply with Orders
with respect to, indemnification claims by Parent or any other Purchaser
Indemnitee pursuant to ARTICLE IX; (vii) to refrain from enforcing any right
of any Seller or the Representative arising out of or under or in any manner
relating to any Representative Action in connection with the foregoing;
provided, that no such failure to act on the part of the Representative,
except as otherwise provided in this Agreement shall be deemed a waiver of any
such right or interest by the Representative or by the Sellers unless such
waiver is in writing signed by the waiving party or by the Representative;
(viii) to make, execute, acknowledge, deliver and receive all such other
agreements, guarantees, Orders, receipts, endorsements, notices, requests,
instructions, certificates, stock powers, letters and other writings, and, in
general, to do any and all things and to take any and all action that the
Representative, in its sole and absolute discretion, may consider necessary or
proper or convenient in connection with or to carry out the Representative
Actions, and all other agreements, documents or instruments executed in
connection therewith; and (viii) take all such other actions as the
Representative shall deem necessary or appropriate, in its discretion, for the
accomplishment of the foregoing and the consummation of the Transactions. The
Parties acknowledge and agree that the appointment, authorization and
empowerment of the Representative set forth in this Section 10.13(a) shall not
include any matter specifically reserved for a Seller in this Agreement.

(b) The Representative shall be entitled to the payment of all its out-of-
pocket expenses incurred as the Representative subject to and in accordance
with the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, including Section
1.9(b), which such amounts to be used by the Representative to pay expenses
incurred by the Representative in its capacity as the Representative;
provided, that if the Transaction is not consummated, the Company shall
reimburse the Representative for all costs and expenses reasonably incurred by
the Representative in connection with the Transaction and neither Parent nor
Merger Sub shall have any liability to the Representative or the Company in
connection therefor. Once the Representative determines, in its sole
discretion, that the Representative will not incur any additional expenses in
its capacity as the Representative, then the Representative will distribute
the remaining unused Representative Expense Fund Amount, if any, to the
Sellers in accordance with their Pro Rata Shares. If, however, the
Representative incurs expenses, in its capacity as the Representative, in an
amount exceeding the Representative 

Expense Fund Amount, then the Representative shall be entitled to receive from
the Sellers in accordance with their Pro Rata Shares an amount for the
difference between the total expenses incurred by the Representative and the
Representative Expense Fund Amount. Furthermore, the Representative shall be
entitled to cause the Paying Agent to withhold and pay a portion of any Other
Seller Payments to the Representative, by providing written notice thereof to
the Paying Agent and Parent prior to its distribution of such Other Seller
Payment, for the purpose of the Representative making any payments or paying
any expenses under or in connection with this Agreement on behalf of the
Sellers to satisfy costs, expenses and/or liabilities of the Representative in
connection with the performance of its duties under this Agreement. In
connection with this Agreement, and any instrument, agreement or document
relating hereto or thereto, and in exercising or failing to exercise all or
any of the powers conferred upon the Representative hereunder, (i) the
Representative shall incur no responsibility whatsoever to any of the Sellers
by reason of any error in judgment or other act or omission performed or
omitted hereunder or any such other agreement, instrument or document,
excepting only responsibility for any act or failure to act which represents
willful misconduct, (ii) the Representative shall not be liable to Sellers for
any apportionment or distribution of payments made by the Representative in
good faith, and if any such apportionment or distribution is subsequently
determined to have been made in error, the sole recourse of any Seller to whom
payment was due, but not made or not made in full, shall be to recover from
the other Sellers any payment in excess of the amount to which such Seller is
determined to have been entitled, and (iii) the Representative shall be
entitled to rely on the advice of counsel, public accountants or other
independent experts experienced in the matter at issue, and any error in
judgment or other act or omission of the Representative pursuant to such
advice shall in no event subject the Representative to liability to any of the
Sellers. Each Seller shall indemnify, on a pro rata basis (based on such
Seller's Pro Rata Share), the Representative against all Losses (including any
and all expense whatsoever reasonably incurred in investigating, preparing or
defending against any litigation, commenced or threatened or any claims
whatsoever), arising out of or in connection with any claim, investigation,
challenge, action or proceeding or in connection with any appeal thereof,
relating to the acts or omissions of the Representative hereunder. The
foregoing indemnification shall not apply in the event of any action or
proceeding which finally adjudicates the liability of the Representative
hereunder for its willful misconduct.

(c) All of the indemnities, immunities and powers granted to the
Representative under this Agreement shall survive the Closing Date and/or any
termination of this Agreement. Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall have the
right to rely upon all actions taken or omitted to be taken by the
Representative pursuant to this Agreement, all of which actions or omissions
shall be legally binding upon the Sellers. The grant of authority provided for
herein (i) is coupled with an interest and shall be irrevocable and survives
the death, incompetency, bankruptcy or liquidation of any of the Sellers and
(ii) shall survive the Closing. Any amounts received by the Representative on
account of the Sellers, whether pursuant to Section 1.9 or otherwise, shall be
distributed to the Sellers, net of any reserve the Representative may deem
necessary in its reasonable discretion, in accordance with Section 1.11. 

(d) The Parties acknowledge and agree that the Representative shall have no
liability to, and shall not be liable for any Losses of, any Party in
connection with any obligations of the Representative under this Agreement or
otherwise in respect of this Agreement or the Transaction.

(e) In the event of the death, incapacity, liquidation, dissolution or
resignation of any Person serving as the Representative, as applicable, within
twenty (20) days of such death, incapacity, liquidation, dissolution or
resignation, the Sellers shall choose the successor representative by
affirmative vote of the Sellers who hold a majority of the voting power of the
Company based on their Pro Rata Share. Following such resignation, any
reference to the Representative herein shall be deemed to include such
successor representative.

10.14 Attorney Conflict Waiver. Recognizing that Sheppard Mullin Richter and
Hampton LLP has acted as legal counsel to the Representative and its
Affiliates and the Group Companies prior to the Closing, and that Sheppard
Mullin Richter and Hampton LLP intends to act as legal counsel to the
Representative and its Affiliates (which will no longer include the Group
Companies) after the Closing, each of Parent and the Company hereby waives, on
its own behalf and agrees to cause its Affiliates to waive, any conflicts that
may arise in connection with Sheppard Mullin Richter and Hampton LLP
representing the Representative or its Affiliates (including any of the
Sellers) after the Closing as such representation may relate to Parent, any
Group Company or the Transaction. In addition, all communications involving
attorney-client confidences between the Representative, its Affiliates or any
Group Company and Sheppard Mullin Richter and Hampton LLP in the course of the
negotiation, documentation and consummation of the Transaction shall be deemed
to be attorney-client confidences that belong solely to the Representative and
its Affiliates (and not the Group Companies). Accordingly, the Group Companies
shall not have access to any such communications, or to the files of Sheppard
Mullin Richter and Hampton LLP relating to its engagement, whether or not the
Closing shall have occurred. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
upon and after the Closing, (i) the Representative and its Affiliates (and not
the Group Companies) shall be the sole holders of the attorney-client
privilege with respect to such engagement, and none of the Group Companies
shall be a holder thereof, (ii) to the extent that files of Sheppard Mullin
Richter and Hampton LLP in respect of such engagement constitute property of the
client, only the Representative and its Affiliates (and not the Group
Companies) shall hold such property rights and (iii) Sheppard Mullin Richter and
Hampton LLP shall have no duty whatsoever to reveal or disclose any such
attorney-client communications or files to any of the Group Companies by
reason of any attorney-client relationship between Sheppard Mullin Richter and
Hampton LLP and any of the Group Companies or otherwise.

10.15 Limitation on Damages. Notwithstanding anything else to the contrary set
forth herein, except with respect to punitive or exemplary damages required to
be paid to a third party as part of a Third Party Claim under ARTICLE IX, no
Party or other Indemnitor shall be liable for, and no breach of any
representation, warranty or covenant contained herein or in any certificate
delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall give rise to any right on the part
of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, any Seller or any other Indemnified Party
to, any punitive, special, consequential, incidental, indirect, exemplary or
remote damages or Losses based thereon, including regarding the loss of future
revenue, income, profits, diminution of value or loss of business reputation
or 

opportunity, and no Party or other Indemnitor will be obligated to any other
Person for any Loss determined as a multiple of income, increase factor,

11.2 Certain Interpretive Matters. Unless otherwise expressly provided, for
purposes of this Agreement, the following rules of interpretation shall apply:

(a) Time of the Essence; Calculation of Time Periods. Time is of the essence
for each and every provision of this Agreement. When calculating the period of
time before which, within which or following which any act is to be done or
step taken pursuant to this Agreement, the 

date that is the reference date in calculating such period shall be excluded.
If the last day of such period is a non-Business Day, the period in question
shall end on the next succeeding Business Day.

(b) Accounting Terms. Accounting terms that are not otherwise defined in this
Agreement have the meanings given to them under GAAP, and if the definition of
an accounting term defined in this Agreement is inconsistent with the meaning
of such term under GAAP, the definition set forth in this Agreement will
control.

(c) Dollars. Any reference in this Agreement to "$" or dollars shall mean U.S.
dollars.

(d) Exhibits/Schedules/Construction. The Exhibits and Schedules to this
Agreement are an integral part of this Agreement and are hereby incorporated
herein and made a part hereof as if set forth herein. Any capitalized terms
used in any Schedule or Exhibit but not otherwise defined therein shall be
defined as set forth in this Agreement. If a subject matter is addressed in
more than one representation and warranty in this Agreement, each of Parent
and Merger Sub shall be entitled to rely only on the most specific
representation and warranty addressing such matter. Any disclosure set forth
in one section of the Schedules shall apply to (i) the representations and
warranties or covenants contained in the Section of this Agreement to which it
corresponds in number, (ii) any representation and warranty or covenant to
which it is referred by cross reference, and (iii) any other representation or
warranty or covenant to the extent it is reasonably apparent from the wording
of such disclosure that such disclosure is applicable to such representation
or warranty or covenant.

(e) Gender and Number. Any reference in this Agreement to gender shall include
all genders, and words imparting the singular number only shall include the
plural and vice versa.

(f) Headings. The provision of the Table of Contents, the division of this
Agreement into Articles, Sections and other subdivisions and the insertion of
headings are for convenience of reference only and shall not affect or be
utilized in construing or interpreting this Agreement. All references in this
Agreement to any "Article," "Section" or other subdivision are to the
corresponding Article, Section or other subdivision of this Agreement unless
otherwise specified.

(g) Herein. The words such as "herein," "hereinafter," "hereof," "hereunder"
and "hereto" refer to this Agreement as a whole and not merely to a
subdivision in which such words appear unless the context otherwise requires.

(h) Including. The word "including" or any variation thereof mean "including,
without limitation" and, if "without limitation" or the equivalent thereof are
not present, shall not be construed to limit any general statement that it
follows to the specific or similar items or matters immediately following it.

(i) Or. The term "or" has, except where otherwise indicated, the inclusive
meaning represented by the phrase "and/or." 

(j) Made Available. An item shall be considered "made available" to a Party
hereto, to the extent such phrase appears in this Agreement, only if such item
has been provided in writing (including via electronic mail) to such Party or
its representatives or posted by the Company or its representatives in the
Data Room.

(k) Reflected On or Set Forth In. An item arising with respect to a specific
representation or warranty shall be deemed to be "reflected on" or "set forth
in" a balance sheet or financial statements, to the extent any such phrase
appears in such representation or warranty, if (i) there is a reserve, accrual
or other similar item underlying a number on such balance sheet or financial
statements that related to the subject matter of such representation, (ii)
such item is otherwise specifically set forth on the balance sheet or
financial statements, or (iii) such item is reflected on the balance sheet or
financial statements and is specifically set forth in the notes thereto.

(l) Days. The term "day" refers to a calendar day unless expressly identified
as a Business Day.

(m) Material. As used in this Agreement, unless the context would require
otherwise, the term "material" and the concept of the "material" nature of an
effect upon the Group Companies or their business shall be measured relative
to the Group Companies, taken as a whole, as their business is currently being
conducted. There have been included in the Company Disclosure Schedule or the
Parent Disclosure Schedule and may be included elsewhere in this Agreement
items which are not "material" within the meaning of the immediately preceding
sentence for informational purposes and in order to avoid any
misunderstanding, and such inclusion shall not be deemed to be an agreement by
the Parties that such items are "material" or to further define the meaning of
such term for purposes of this Agreement.

(n) Joint Negotiation and Drafting. The Parties have participated jointly in
the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement and, in the event an ambiguity
or question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be
construed as jointly drafted by the Parties and no presumption or burden of
proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any Party by virtue of the
authorship of any provision of this Agreement.



[Remainder of Page Intentionally Left Blank] 

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Parties hereto have caused this Agreement to be
executed by their respective officers thereunto duly authorized, as of the
date first written above.

Exhibit B



Sample Working Capital and Agreed Principles





Agreed Principles



The Pre-Closing Statement and the Closing Statement shall be prepared on a
consolidated basis as of the Adjustment Time (except as otherwise expressly
set forth in the Agreement) using the usual year end close-the-books processes
of the Company. The Pre Closing Statement and the Closing Statement shall be
prepared in accordance with the Accounting Rules, subject to adjustments
provided for in this Exhibit B. A reconciliation between working capital
prepared under Historical Principles and Working Capital prepared pursuant to
the Accounting Rules will be included in the Pre-Closing Statement and the
Post-Closing Statement. Adjustments will be made to eliminate the cost of
investment in any Subsidiaries and to reconcile and eliminate any balances
owed between Subsidiaries.

In preparing the Pre-Closing Statement and the Closing Statement, no item
shall be included more than once.

The Pre-Closing Statement and the Closing Statement will be prepared in USD.
Assets and liabilities in the Pre-Closing Statement and the Closing Statement
denominated in a currency other than USD shall be converted into USD at the
USD spot rate of exchange applicable to such other currency as quoted by The
Wall Street Journal at or about the Adjustment Time on the Closing Date.

There should be no change in (i) the classification to a current liability of
any particular liability that has not been previously categorized as a current
liability, (ii) the classification to a long-term liability of any particular
liability that has not been previously categorized as a long-term liability,
(iii) the classification to a long-term asset of any particular asset that has
not been previously categorized as a long-term asset, or (iv) the
classification to a current asset of any particular asset that has not been
previously categorized as a current asset, in each case, other than a change
resulting solely from the passage of time.



The Deferred revenue adjustment should be equal to 50% of the deferred revenue
balance as of the relevant date.



The following is an illustrative example of the Working Capital calculation
utilizing the amounts for the corresponding line items set forth in the
September 30, 2018, consolidated balance sheet of the Company. The following
