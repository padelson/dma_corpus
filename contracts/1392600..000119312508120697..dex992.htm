-iv- AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (hereinafter referred to as this " _Agreement_
"), dated [], 2008, by and among ESSAR STEEL HOLDINGS LIMITED, a company
incorporated in Mauritius (the "Parent"), the entity designated pursuant to
_Section 6.11_ (the " _Purchaser_ "), and ESMARK INCORPORATED, a Delaware
corporation (the " _Company_ ").

WHEREAS, it is proposed that, on the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, the Purchaser make a cash tender offer (such tender
offer, as it may be amended and supplemented from time to time as permitted by
this Agreement, the " _Offer_ ") to purchase all of the issued and
outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company
(the " _Shares_ ") other than shares of Restricted Stock (as defined in
_Section 2.4_ below) for $17.00 per Share, net to the sellers in cash (such
price, or any such higher price per Share as may be paid in the Offer, is
referred to herein as the " _Offer Price_ "), subject to any required
withholding of Taxes;

WHEREAS, it is proposed that, on the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, following the consummation of the Offer,
Purchaser shall merge with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ "), pursuant
to which each outstanding Share shall be converted into the right to receive
the Offer Price, without interest, except for (i) Shares held by holders who
comply with the relevant provisions of the General Corporation Law of the
State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ ") regarding the right of stockholders to
dissent from the Merger and require appraisal of their Shares and (ii) Shares
held in the treasury of the Company or owned by Parent, Purchaser or any
wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent;

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company (the " _Company Board of
Directors_ ") (i) has approved this Agreement, (ii) has determined that the
Offer, the Merger and the other Transactions are fair to, advisable and in the
best interests of the Company and its stockholders, and (iii) is recommending
that the holders of the Shares (the " _Company Stockholders_ ") accept the
Offer, tender their Shares into the Offer and adopt this Agreement, in each
case, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement; and

WHEREAS, each of the Board of Directors of Parent and Purchaser has (i)
approved this Agreement and (ii) has determined that the Offer, the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement are fair to,
advisable and in the best interests of their respective corporations.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this
Agreement, and subject to the conditions set forth herein, the parties hereto
agree as follows: ARTICLE I

THE OFFER AND MERGER

Section 1.1 _The Offer_. (a) Provided that this Agreement shall not have been
terminated in accordance with _Section 8.1_ and none of the events or
conditions set forth in _Annex I_ hereto (other than clause (g) and (h)) shall
have occurred and be continuing and not have been waived by Parent
or Purchaser, as promptly as reasonably practicable and, in any event, within
ten (10) Business Days following the date of this Agreement, the Purchaser
shall commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the U.S. Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (together with the rules and regulations
thereunder, the " _Exchange Act_ ")) the Offer to purchase for cash all Shares
at the Offer Price. The obligations of the Purchaser to accept for payment and
to pay for any Shares validly tendered on or prior to the expiration of the
Offer and not properly withdrawn shall be subject to (i) there being validly
tendered and not properly withdrawn prior to the expiration of the Offer that
number of Shares which represents a majority of the Shares outstanding on a
fully-diluted basis (the " _Minimum Condition_ ") and (ii) the other
conditions set forth in _Annex I_ hereto. Subject to the prior satisfaction or
waiver by Parent or the Purchaser of the Minimum Condition and the other
conditions of the Offer set forth in _Annex I_ hereto, the Purchaser shall
(and Parent shall cause Purchaser to), in accordance with the terms of the
Offer, consummate the Offer and accept for payment and pay for all Shares
validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer promptly
after expiration of the Offer, which shall initially be the 20th Business Day
following the commencement of the Offer, _provided_ ,  _however_ , that (x)
if on the initial expiration date of the Offer or on any subsequent scheduled
expiration date of the Offer (as extended in accordance with this Agreement),
all conditions to the Offer shall not have been satisfied or waived, the
Purchaser may, from time to time, in its sole discretion, extend the Offer for
such period as the Purchaser may determine, (y) the Purchaser may, in its sole
discretion, extend the Offer for any period required by any rule, regulation,
interpretation or position of the SEC or the staff thereof applicable to the
Offer, and (z) the Purchaser may, in its sole discretion, provide a
"subsequent offering period" in accordance with Rule 14d-11 under
the Exchange Act, _provided that_ , in no event shall the Offer or any
"subsequent offering period" extend beyond the Outside Date without the mutual
written consent of the Company and Parent. In addition, the Purchaser may
increase the Offer Price and extend the Offer to the extent required by Law
in connection with such increase, in each case in its sole discretion and
without the Companys consent. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, neither Parent nor Purchaser shall, without the
prior written consent of the Company (i) change or waive the Minimum
Condition, (ii) reduce the Offer Price or decrease the number of Shares sought
to be purchased in the Offer, (iii) change the expiration date of the Offer
(except to the extent required or permitted pursuant to this _Section
1.1(a)_), impose any condition to the Offer in addition to the conditions set
forth or referred to in this  _Section 1.1(a)_ or amend, modify or
supplement any of the terms of the Offer in any manner adversely affecting the
holders of Shares.

(b) As soon as practicable on the date the Offer is commenced, Purchaser shall
file with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ")
a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with respect to the Offer, which
shall include the offer to purchase, form of the letter of transmittal and
form of notice of guaranteed delivery  



 

2  (collectively, together with any amendments and supplements thereto, the "
_Offer Documents_ "). Subject to the Companys compliance with  _Section
1.2(b)_, Parent and the Purchaser shall cause the Offer Documents to be
disseminated to holders of Shares as required by applicable U.S. federal
securities laws. Parent and the Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Company,
on the other hand, agree to promptly correct any information provided by it
for use in the Offer Documents if it shall have become false or misleading in
any material respect or as otherwise required by Law. The Purchaser further
agrees to take all steps necessary to cause the Offer Documents as so
corrected to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to holders of Shares as
required by applicable U.S. federal securities laws. The Company shall
promptly furnish to Parent and Purchaser all information concerning the
Company that is required or reasonably requested by Parent or Purchaser in
connection with the obligations relating to the Offer Documents contained in
this _Section 1.1(b)_. The Company and its counsel shall be given
a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Offer Documents before
they are filed with the SEC and Parent and Purchaser shall give reasonable and
good faith consideration to any comments made by the Company and its counsel.
In addition, Parent and the Purchaser shall provide the Company and its
counsel with (i) any comments or communications, whether written or oral, that
Parent, the Purchaser or their counsel may receive from time to time from the
SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents promptly after Parents
or the Purchasers, as the case may be, receipt of such comments, and (ii) a
reasonable opportunity to participate in the response of Parent or Purchaser
to those comments and to provide comments on that response (to which
reasonable and good faith consideration shall be given), including by
participating with Parent and/or Purchaser or their counsel in any discussions
or meetings with the SEC.

Section 1.2 _Company Actions_.

(a) The Company hereby consents to the Offer and represents and warrants that
the Company Board of Directors, at a meeting duly called and held, has (i)
approved this Agreement, and deemed this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger and
the Transactions advisable, fair to and in the best interests of the Company
Stockholders; (ii) approved and adopted this Agreement and the Transactions,
including the Offer and the Merger, in all respects, and, subject to the
accuracy of the representation set forth in _Section 3.5_ of this Agreement,
such approval constitutes approval of the Offer, the Merger, this Agreement
and the Transactions for purposes of Section 203 of the DGCL; and (iii)
subject to  _Section 5.2(e)_, resolved to recommend that the Company
Stockholders accept the Offer, that the Company Stockholders tender their
Shares in the Offer to Purchaser, and that the Company Stockholders adopt this
Agreement to the extent required by applicable Law (the " _Company Board
Recommendation_ "). The Company consents to the inclusion of the Company Board
Recommendation in the Offer Documents, to the extent that no Adverse
Recommendation Change shall have occurred in accordance with _Section 5.2_,
(it being understood that such consent shall not be deemed to limit the
Company Board of Directors rights under _Section 5.2_), _provided that_ , if
there has been an Adverse Recommendation Change made in accordance with
_Section 5.2_, such change shall be reflected in the Offer Documents or
amendments or supplements thereto.

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable on the day the Offer is commenced, the
Company shall, in a manner that complies with Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange  



 

3  Act, file with the SEC a Tender Offer Solicitation/Recommendation Statement
on Schedule 14D-9 (together with all amendments, supplements and
exhibits thereto, the " _Schedule 14D-9_ ") which shall, subject to the
provisions of _Section 5.2(d)_, contain the Company Board Recommendation. The
Company agrees to cause the Schedule 14D-9 to be filed with the SEC and
disseminated to holders of Shares as required by and in accordance with
applicable U.S. federal securities laws. The Company, on the one hand, and
Parent and the Purchaser, on the other hand, agree to promptly correct any
information provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if it shall have
become false or misleading in any material respect or as otherwise required by
Law. The Company agrees to cause the Schedule 14D-9 as so corrected to be
filed with the SEC and disseminated to holders of the Shares as required by
and in accordance with applicable U.S. federal securities laws. Parent and
Purchaser shall promptly furnish to the Company all information concerning
Parent and Purchaser that is required or reasonably requested by the Company
in connection with the obligations relating to Schedule 14D-9 contained in
this _Section 1.2(b)_. Parent, the Purchaser and their counsel shall be given
the reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Schedule 14D-9 and the
Company shall give reasonable and good faith consideration to any comments
made by the Parent and Purchaser and their counsel before it is filed with the
SEC. In addition, the Company shall provide the Parent, the Purchaser and
their counsel with (i) any comments or communications, whether written or
oral, that the Company or its counsel may receive from time to time from the
SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D -9 promptly after the
Companys receipt of such comments, and (ii) a reasonable opportunity to
participate in the response to those comments and to provide comments on that
response (to which reasonable and good faith consideration shall be given),
including by participating with the Company or its counsel in any discussions
or meetings with the SEC.

(c) In connection with the Offer, the Company shall promptly furnish to
the Purchaser mailing labels, security position listings and any available
listing or computer file containing the names and addresses of the record
holders of the Shares as of a recent date, and shall promptly furnish the
Purchaser with such information and assistance (including, but not limited
to, lists of holders of the Shares, updated periodically, and their addresses,
mailing labels and lists of security positions) as the Purchaser or its agents
may reasonably request.

 

Section 1.3 _Directors_. (a) Promptly upon the acceptance for payment and
payment for the amount of any Shares by the Purchaser pursuant to the Offer
and from time to time thereafter until completion of the Offer, Parent shall
be entitled to elect or designate such number of directors, rounded up to the
next whole number, on the Company Board of Directors as is equal to
the product of the total number of directors on the Company Board of
Directors (giving effect to the directors elected or designated by Parent
pursuant to this _Section 1.3_) multiplied by the percentage that the
aggregate number of Shares beneficially owned by the Purchaser, Parent and
any of their affiliates bears to the total number of Shares then outstanding
(on a fully-diluted basis) provided that those individuals designated or
elected by the United Steelworkers of America, AFL-CIO-CLC (" _USW Union_ ")
to serve on the Company Board of Directors pursuant to the terms of the
collective bargaining agreement between the Company and the USW Union shall
count as directors designated by Parent for purposes of the foregoing
calculation. The Company shall, upon Parents request, use its reasonable best
efforts to either promptly increase the size of the Company Board of
Directors, or promptly secure the resignations of such number



 

4  of its incumbent directors, or both, as is necessary to enable Parents
designees to be so elected or designated to the Companys Board of Directors,
and shall take all actions necessary to cause Parents designees to be so
elected or designated at such time. At such time, the Company shall, upon
Parents request, also cause persons elected or designated by Parent
to constitute the same percentage (rounded up to the next whole number) as is
on the Company Board of Directors of each committee of the Company Board of
Directors. The Companys obligations under this _Section 1.3_ shall be
subject to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 thereunder. The
Company shall promptly take all actions required pursuant to such Section
14(f) and Rule 14f-1 in order to fulfill its obligations under this _Section
1.3_, including, but not limited to, mailing to stockholders (together with
the Schedule 14D-9) such information as is required by such Section 14(f) and
Rule 14f-1 to enable Parents designees to be elected or designated to the
Company Board of Directors. Parent or the Purchaser shall supply to the
Company in writing and be solely responsible for the information and consents
with respect to either of them and their nominees, officers, directors and
affiliates to the extent required by such Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1.
Notwithstanding anything contained in this _Section 1.3(a)_, to the contrary,
Parent and Purchaser acknowledge and agree that its designations or elections
pursuant to this _Section 1.3(a)_ shall not cause the Company to violate its
Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws or applicable Law, including without
limitation, the rules and regulations of the NASDAQ National Market with
respect to independence of directors or otherwise. 

(b) Following the election or appointment of Parents designees pursuant to
_Section 1.3(a)_ and until the Effective Time, the approval of a majority of
the directors of the Company then in office who were not designated or
appointed by Parent and are not officers, directors or employees of Parent or
its Affiliates shall be required to authorize (and such authorization shall
constitute the authorization of the Company Board of Directors and no other
action on the part of the Company, including any action by any other director
of the Company, shall be required to authorize) (i) any termination of
this Agreement by the Company, (ii) any amendment to this Agreement, (iii)
any extension of time for performance of any obligation or action hereunder by
Parent or Purchaser, any waiver of compliance with any of the agreements or
conditions contained herein that are for the benefit of the Company, (iv) any
exercise of the Companys rights or remedies under this Agreement, (v) any
action seeking to enforce any obligation of Parent or Purchaser under this
Agreement or (vi) any other action with respect to this Agreement, or any
transactions contemplated hereby if such other action would or could adversely
affect, any holders of Shares other than Parent or Purchaser.

Section 1.4 ___Top Up Option_ __.

(a) The Company hereby grants to Parent and Purchaser an irrevocable option
(the " _Top-Up Option_ ") to purchase from the Company up to that number of
newly issued shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share (" _Common
Stock_ "), of the Company (the " _Top-Up Option Shares_ ") equal to the number
of shares of Common Stock that, when added to the Shares owned by Parent and
Purchaser immediately following consummation of the Offer, shall constitute
one share more than 90% of the Shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis
(after giving effect to the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares) for
consideration per Top-Up Option Share equal to the Offer Price. 



 

5 (b) The Top-Up Option shall be exercisable only after the purchase of and
payment for Shares pursuant to the Offer by Parent or Purchaser as a result
of which Parent and Purchaser own beneficially at least 85% of the Shares. The
Top-Up Option shall not be exercisable if the number of shares of Common Stock
subject thereto exceeds the number of authorized shares of Common Stock
available for issuance.

(c) In the event that Parent or Purchaser wish to exercise the Top-Up
Option, Parent and Purchaser shall give the Company one days prior written
notice specifying the number of shares of Common Stock that are or will be
owned by Parent and Purchaser immediately following consummation of the Offer
and specifying a place and a time for the closing of the purchase of the Top-
Up Option Shares. The Company shall, as soon as practicable following receipt
of such notice, deliver written notice to Purchaser specifying the number of
Top-Up Shares. At the closing of the purchase of the Top-Up Shares, the
portion of the purchase price owing upon exercise of the Top-Up Option that
equals the product of (i) the number of shares of Common Stock purchased
pursuant to the Top-Up Option, multiplied by (ii) the Offer Price, shall be
paid to the Company, at the election of Parent and Purchaser, in cash (by wire
transfer or cashiers check) or by delivery of a promissory note having full
recourse to Parent.

Section 1.5 _The Merger_. (a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, at the Effective Time, the Company and the Purchaser
shall consummate the Merger, pursuant to which (i) the Purchaser shall be
merged with and into the Company and the separate corporate existence of the
Purchaser shall thereupon cease, (ii) the Company shall be the successor or
surviving corporation in the Merger and shall continue to be governed by the
Laws of the State of Delaware, and (iii) the separate corporate existence of
the Company with all its rights, privileges, immunities, powers
and franchises shall continue unaffected by the Merger. The corporation
surviving the Merger is sometimes hereinafter referred to as the " _Surviving
Corporation_." The Merger shall have the effects set forth herein and in the
applicable provisions of the DGCL.

(b) The Certificate of Incorporation of the Purchaser, as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the Certificate of
Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation, except as to the name of the
Surviving Corporation, which shall be Esmark Incorporated, until thereafter
amended as provided by Law and such Certificate of Incorporation. 

(c) The Bylaws of the Purchaser, as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, except as
to the name of the Surviving Corporation, which shall be Esmark Incorporated,
until thereafter amended as provided by Law, the Certificate of Incorporation
of the Surviving Corporation and such Bylaws.

Section 1.6 _Effective Time_. Parent, the Purchaser and the Company shall
cause the appropriate Certificate of Merger to be executed and filed on the
Closing Date with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware as provided
in the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective on the date and time on which
the Certificate of Merger has been duly filed with the Secretary of State of
the State of Delaware, or such later time as agreed upon by the parties, such
time hereinafter referred to as the " _Effective Time_."



 

6 Section 1.7 _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") will
take place at 10:00 a.m., Pittsburgh time, on a date to be specified by the
parties, such date to be no later than the second Business Day after

" _Closing Date_ "), at the offices of McGuireWoods LLP, 625 Liberty Avenue,
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15222, unless another date or place is agreed to in
writing by the parties hereto.

Section 1.8 _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation_. The
directors of the Purchaser immediately prior to the Effective Time shall,
from and after the Effective Time, be the directors of the Surviving

ARTICLE II

CONVERSION OF SECURITIES 

Section 2.1 _Conversion of Capital Stock_. As of the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders of any Shares
or the holders of the common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the
Purchaser (the " _Purchaser Common Stock_ "):

(a) Each outstanding share of Purchaser Common Stock shall be converted into
and become one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation.

(b) All Shares that are owned by the Company as treasury stock and any Shares
owned by Parent, the Purchaser or any other wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent
shall be cancelled and retired, and no consideration shall be delivered in
exchange therefor.

(c) Each outstanding Share (other than Shares to be cancelled in accordance
with _Section 2.1(b)_ and other than Dissenting Shares) shall be converted
into the right to receive the Offer Price, payable to the holder thereof in
cash, without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ "), subject to any
required withholding of Taxes. From and after the  



 

8  Effective Time, all such Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be cancelled and retired, and each holder of a
certificate representing any such Shares shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration therefor
upon the surrender of such certificate in accordance with _Section 2.2_,
without interest thereon.

Section 2.2 _Paying Agent_.

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a reputable bank or
trust company located in the United States and reasonably acceptable to the
Company (as determined by a majority of the directors as of the date hereof)
(the " _Paying Agent_ ") for the holders of Shares in connection with the
Merger and to receive the funds to which holders of Shares shall become
entitled pursuant to _Section 2.1(c)_. At the Effective Time, Parent shall
deposit, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or one of Parents other
Subsidiaries to deposit, with the Paying Agent cash in an amount sufficient to
pay the aggregate Merger Consideration required to be paid pursuant to 
_Section 2.1(c)_. Such funds shall be invested by the Paying Agent as
directed by Parent or the Surviving Corporation, pending payment thereof by
the Paying Agent to the holders of the Shares. Earnings from such investments
shall be the sole and exclusive property of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation, and no part of such earnings shall accrue to the benefit of
holders of Shares.

(b) Promptly after the Effective Time, the Parent or Surviving Corporation
shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of Shares (the "
_Certificates_ "), whose Shares were converted pursuant to _Section 2.1_
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration (i) a letter of transmittal
(which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates
to the Paying Agent) and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of the
Certificates in exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration. Upon
surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent or to such
other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with such letter
of transmittal, duly completed and executed, the holder of such Certificate
shall be entitled to receive and Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to
promptly pay to such holder in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration for
each Share formerly represented by such Certificate and the Certificate so
surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. If payment of the Merger
Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name
the surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition precedent
of payment that (x) the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed
or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer, and (y) the Person
requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other Taxes required
by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than
the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or shall
have established to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such
Tax either has been paid or is not required to be paid. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this _Section 2.2_, each Certificate shall be deemed after
the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, without interest thereon.

(c) At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be
closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of
Shares on the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the
holders of Certificates  



 

9  evidencing ownership of Shares outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares,
except as otherwise provided for herein or by applicable Law. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for
any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this _Article
II_.

(d) At any time following twelve months after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver
to it any funds (including any interest received with respect thereto) made
available to the Paying Agent and not disbursed to holders of Certificates,
and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look only to the Surviving
Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws)
only as general creditors thereof with respect to the Merger Consideration
payable upon due surrender of their Certificates, without any interest
thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Surviving Corporation nor
the Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder of a Certificate for Merger
Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

(e) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the
posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as Parent may
direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect
to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate the applicable Merger Consideration with
respect thereto pursuant to this Agreement.

(f) Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement such amounts as Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent are required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such
payment under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law.
To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the
appropriate Taxing Authority by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the
Paying Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Certificates in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent.

Section 2.3 _Dissenting Shares_. (a) Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, Shares outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and held by a holder who has not voted in favor of the Merger
or consented thereto in writing and who has complied with Section 262 of
the DGCL (" _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into a right to
receive the Merger Consideration, unless such holder fails to perfect or such
holder waives, withdraws or otherwise loses his or her right to appraisal. A
holder of Dissenting Shares shall be entitled to receive payment of the
appraised value of such Shares held by such holder in accordance with Section
262 of the DGCL, unless, after the Effective Time, such holder fails to
perfect or such holder waives, properly withdraws or otherwise loses such
holders right to appraisal, in which case such Shares shall be converted into
and represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without
interest thereon, upon surrender of the Certificate or Certificates
representing such Shares pursuant to _Section 2.2_.



 

10 (b) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any written demands for
appraisal of any Shares, attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other
instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company relating
to rights of appraisal and (ii) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the DGCL. Except with
the prior written consent of Parent, the Company shall not make any payment
with respect to any demands for appraisal or settle or offer to settle any
such demands for appraisal.

Section 2.4 _Company Equity Plans_.

(a) Effective not later than immediately prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall terminate any and all equity compensation plans or arrangements
pursuant to which awards were granted to employees or directors of or other
service providers to the Company or its Subsidiaries (collectively, the "
_Equity Plans_ "). At the Effective Time, each option to purchase shares of
Common Stock of the Company granted under the Equity Plans (each, an "
_Option_ ") that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior thereto
shall become fully vested as of the Effective Time, and the Company shall take
all action necessary to cause, by virtue of the Merger and without any action
on the part of any holder of any Option, each Option to be cancelled and
converted into the right to receive from the Surviving Corporation immediately
after the Effective Time a cash payment (without interest) equal to the
product of (i) the excess, if any, of (x) the Offer Price over (y) the per
share exercise price of such Option, and (ii) the number of shares subject to
such Option as of the Effective Time (the " _Option Consideration_ "). As of
the Effective Time, all Options, whether or not vested or exercisable, shall
no longer be outstanding and shall automatically cease to exist, and each
holder of an Option shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto,
except the right to receive the Option Consideration.

(b) At the Effective Time, each restricted stock unit award evidencing the
right to receive shares of Common Stock granted under the Equity Plans that
vests based solely on the passage of time (each, a " _Time-Based RSU_ ") that
is outstanding immediately prior thereto shall become fully vested as of the
Effective Time, and the Company shall take all action necessary to cause, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of any holder of any
Time-Based RSU, such Time-Based RSU to be cancelled and converted into the
right to receive from the Surviving Corporation immediately after the
Effective Time the Merger Consideration.

(c) At the Effective Time, each restricted stock unit award evidencing
the right to receive shares of Common Stock granted under the Equity Plans
that vests based on the attainment of performance goals (each, a "
_Performance-Based RSU_ " and together with the Time-Based RSU, a "
_Restricted Stock Unit_ ") that is outstanding immediately prior thereto
shall become fully vested as to the maximum number of shares of Common Stock
payable under the award as of the Effective Time, and the Company shall take
all action necessary to cause, by virtue of the Merger and without any action
on the part of any holder of any Performance-Based RSU, such Performance-Based
RSU to be cancelled and converted into the right to receive from the Surviving
Corporation immediately after the Effective Time the Merger Consideration in
respect of the maximum number of shares of Common Stock payable under the
award as of the Effective Time.



 

11 (d) At the Effective Time, each deferred stock unit award evidencing the right
to receive shares of Common Stock granted under the Equity Plans that is
payable on future event or events (each a " _DSU_ ") that is outstanding
immediately prior thereto shall become payable as of the Effective Time, and
the Company shall take all action necessary to cause, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of any holder of any DSU, each DSU to be
cancelled and converted into the right to receive from the Surviving
Corporation immediately after the Effective Time, the Merger Consideration.

(e) Purchaser shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the amounts
otherwise payable pursuant to  _Section 2.4(a)-(d)_ to any holder of
Options, Restricted Stock Units or DSUs such amounts as the Company is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the
extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld by Purchaser, such withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the holder of the Options, Restricted Stock Units and/or DSUs
in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Purchaser. At
Purchasers election, amounts payable pursuant to _Section 2.4(a)-(d)_ may be
paid to the Surviving Corporation, which shall pay such amounts net of
such withholding and pay such withholding over to the appropriate Taxing
Authority.

Schedule, since November 27, 2007, the Company has and from January 1, 2005
until November 27, 2007, Wheeling-Pittsburgh Corporation has timely filed
with the SEC all forms, reports, schedules, statements, exhibits and other
documents required by it to be filed under the Exchange Act or the Securities
Act (collectively, the " _Company SEC Documents_ "). None of the  



 

17  Companys Subsidiaries is required to file periodic reports with the SEC
pursuant to the Exchange Act. As of its filing date or, if amended prior to
the Memorandum Date, as of the date of the last such amendment, each Company
SEC Document fully complied with the applicable requirements of the Exchange
Act and the Securities Act, as the case may be. As of its filing date or, if
amended prior to the Memorandum Date, as of the date of the last such
amendment, each Company SEC Document filed pursuant to the Exchange Act did
not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading. Each Company SEC Document that is a registration
statement, as amended or supplemented, if applicable, filed pursuant to the
Securities Act, as of the date such registration statement or amendment became
effective prior to the Memorandum Date, did not contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements made in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. All of the audited
financial statements and unaudited interim financial statements of the Company
included in the Company SEC Documents filed prior to the Memorandum Date (i)
comply in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements
and with the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto,
(ii) have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted
accounting principles (" _GAAP_ ") applied on a consistent basis during the
periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto and except,
in the case of the unaudited interim statements, as may be permitted under
Form 10-Q of the Exchange Act) and (iii) fairly present in all material
respects the financial position and the consolidated results of operations and
cash flows (subject, in the case of unaudited interim financial statements,
to normal and recurring year-end adjustments) of the Company and its
consolidated Subsidiaries as of the times and for the periods referred to
therein.

(b) Except as set forth in _Section 3.8(b) of the Companys Disclosure
Schedule_, the Company is in compliance in all material respects with the
applicable provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the applicable
listing and governance rules and regulations of the NASDAQ Stock Market.

(c) To the extent required by applicable Law, the Company maintains a system
of internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f)
and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) to provide reasonable assurances (i) that
the Company maintains records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly
reflect its transactions and dispositions of assets, (ii) that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
conformity with GAAP, (iii) that receipts and expenditures are executed only
in accordance with authorizations of management and the Board of Directors and
(iv) regarding prevention or timely detection of the
unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Companys assets that
could have a material effect on the Companys consolidated financial
statements. To the extent required by applicable Law, the Company has
evaluated the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting and,
to the extent required by applicable Law, presented in any applicable Company
SEC Document that is a report on Form 10-K or Form 10-Q or any amendment
thereto its conclusions about the effectiveness of the internal control over
financial reporting as of the end of the period covered by such report or
amendment based on such evaluation. The Company has disclosed, based on the
most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to  



 

18  the Companys auditors and the audit committee of the Board of Directors
(and made available to Parent a summary of the significant aspects of
such disclosure) (A) all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in
the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting that are
reasonably likely to adversely affect the Companys ability to record,
process, summarize and report financial information and (B) any fraud,
whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have
a significant role in the Companys internal control over financial reporting.
Except as disclosed in the Company SEC Documents or in _Section 3.8(c)_ of
the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company has not identified any material
weaknesses in the design or operation of the Companys internal control over
financial reporting.

 

(d) The Companys "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined in Rules
13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) are reasonably designed to
ensure that all information (both financial and non-financial) required to be
disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such
information is accumulated and communicated to the Companys management as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to
make the certifications of the chief executive officer and chief financial
officer of the Company required under the Exchange Act with respect to such
reports.

(e) Except as set forth in _Section 3.8(e)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, to the knowledge of the Company, there are no SEC inquiries or
investigations, other governmental inquiries or investigations or internal
investigations (other than customary internal audit reviews) pending or
threatened in each case regarding any accounting practices of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or any malfeasance by any director or executive
officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Since November 27, 2007,
there have been no internal investigations regarding accounting or revenue
recognition discussed with, reviewed by or initiated at the direction of the
chief executive officer, chief financial officer, general counsel or similar
legal officer, the Board or any committee thereof.

(f) Each of the principal executive officer of the Company and the principal
financial officer of the Company (or to the Companys knowledge, each former

officer of the Company, as applicable) has made all certifications required
by Rule 13a-14 or 15d-14 under the Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906 of
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 with respect to the Company SEC Documents, and
the statements contained in such certifications are true and accurate. For
purposes of this Agreement, "principal executive officer" and "principal
financial officer" shall have the meanings given to such terms in the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The Company does not have, and has not arranged
any, outstanding "extensions of credit" to directors or executive officers
within the meaning of Section 402 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.

(g) Except as set forth in _Section 3.8(g)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, or

partnership or any similar contract (including any contract or arrangement
relating to any transaction or relationship between or  



 

19  among the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any
unconsolidated affiliate, including any structured finance, special purpose or
limited purpose entity or person, on the other hand) or any "off-balance
sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K of the SEC),
where the result, purpose or effect of such contract is to avoid disclosure of
any material transaction involving, or material liabilities of, the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries in the Companys published financial statements or
other Company SEC Documents.

Section 3.9 _Absence of Certain Changes_. Except as specifically contemplated
by this Agreement or as set forth on Section 3.9 of the Company Disclosure

Memorandum Date (a) the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries has been
conducted in the ordinary course consistent with past practice, (b) neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has suffered, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Change, and (c) neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries has taken any action that, if taken after

forth in _Section 5.1_.

Section 3.10 _No Undisclosed Liabilities_. None of the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or any Joint Venture has any liabilities or obligations of any
nature (whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise, whether known or
unknown) required to be reflected or reserved against on a consolidated
balance sheet of the Company prepared in accordance with GAAP or the notes
thereto or, in the case of any Joint Venture whose financial results are
equity accounted by the Company, on a consolidated balance sheet of such
Joint Venture prepared in accordance with GAAP or the notes thereto, except
liabilities (i) as and to the extent reflected or reserved against on the most
recent balance sheet (including the notes thereto) included in the Financial
Statements or as set forth in _Section 3.10(i)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule or (ii) with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries, and to the
knowledge of the Company, MSC, incurred after the date of such balance sheet
in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice that,

expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

Company Disclosure Schedule, there is no suit, claim, action, charge,
proceeding, including, without limitation, arbitration proceeding or
alternative dispute resolution proceeding, or investigation pending or, to the
knowledge of the Company, threatened against, affecting or naming as a party
thereto the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that could, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to (i) have a Company Material Adverse
Effect or (ii) materially delay the consummation of the Transactions. Except
as set forth on  _Section 3.11_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, no
judgment, decree, injunction, rule or order of any Governmental Entity is
outstanding against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective properties or assets that could, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

Section 3.12 _Employee Benefit Plans; ERISA_.

(a) _Section 3.12(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule_ sets forth a correct
and complete list of: (i) all "employee benefit plans" (as defined in Section
3(3) of the  



 

20  Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (" _ERISA_ "))
and (ii) all employment or other compensation agreements, or bonus or other
incentive compensation, stock purchase, equity or equity-based compensation,
deferred compensation, change in control, severance, pension benefit, welfare
benefit, sick leave, vacation, salary continuation, health, life
insurance, educational assistance and other employee benefit plans, policies,
agreements or arrangements (x) which are applicable to current or former
employees, individual consultants or directors of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, (y) with respect to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries has any obligation or liability, contingent or otherwise, or (z)
for which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries could incur liability under
Section 4069 or 4212(c) of ERISA (collectively, the " _Company Plans_ ").
_Section 3.12(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule_ separately sets forth
each Company Plan which is subject to Title IV of ERISA and each
"multiemployer plan", as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA to which the
Company or a Subsidiary contributes (a " _Multiemployer Plan_ "), or is or has
been subject to Sections 4063 or 4064 of ERISA.

(b) Correct and complete copies of the following documents with respect to
each of the Company Plans (other than a Multiemployer Plan) have
been delivered or made available to Parent by the Company to the extent
applicable: (i) any plans and related trust documents, insurance Contracts or
other funding arrangements, and all amendments thereto; (ii) the most recent
Forms 5500 and all schedules thereto, (iii) the most recent actuarial report,
if any; (iv) the most recent Internal Revenue Service determination letter;
(v) the most recent summary plan descriptions; and (vi) written summaries of
all non-written Company Plans. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has any commitment (I) to create, incur liability with respect to
or cause to exist, any other employee benefit plan, program or arrangement,
(II) to enter into any contract or agreement to provide compensation or
benefits to any individual or (III) to modify, change or terminate any Company
Plan, other than with respect to a modification, change or termination
required by applicable Law.

(c) Company Plans have been maintained, in all material respects, in
accordance with their terms and with all applicable provisions of ERISA, the
Code and other Law. To the extent any representation in this _Section 3.12_
applies to a Multiemployer Plan, such representation is only made to the
extent of the knowledge of the Company.

(d) Company Plans intended to qualify under Section 401 or other tax-favored
treatment under of Subchapter B of Chapter 1 of Subtitle A of the Code are so
qualified, and any trusts intended to be exempt from federal income taxation
under the Code are so exempt and such Company Plans have received a favorable
determination letter from the IRS to that effect. Nothing has occurred with
respect to the operation or terms of the Company Plans referred to in this
subsection that could cause the loss of such qualification or exemption, or
the imposition of any material liability, penalty or tax under ERISA or the
Code.

(e) All contributions required to have been made by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (without regard to any waivers granted under Section 412 of the
Code), have been timely made, and no accumulated funding deficiencies exist in
any of the Company Plans subject to Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the
Code. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has incurred any
liability under, arising out of or by operation of Title IV of  



 

21  ERISA (other than liability for premiums to the Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation arising in the ordinary course), including any liability in
connection with (i) the termination or reorganization of any employee benefit
plan subject to Title IV of ERISA or (ii) the withdrawal from any
Multiemployer Plan, and no fact or event exists that could give rise to any
such liability. Under each Company Plan which is a single employer pension
plan, as of the last day of the most recent plan year ended prior to the
Memorandum Date, the actuarially determined present value of all "benefit
liabilities", within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(16) of ERISA (as
determined on the basis of the actuarial assumptions contained in such Company
Plans most recent actuarial valuation), did not exceed the then current value
of the assets of such Company Plan, and there has been no material change in
the financial condition of such Company Plan since the last day of the most
recent plan year.

(f) There are no pending material actions, claims or lawsuits arising from or
relating to the Company Plans (other than routine benefit claims), nor does
Company have any knowledge of facts that could form the basis for any such
material claim or lawsuit. 

(g) Except as set forth in _Section 3.12(g) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule_ , neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will (i) result in any
payment becoming due to any employee, (ii) increase any benefits otherwise
payable under any Company Plan, (iii) result in the acceleration of the time
of payment or vesting of any such benefits under any Company Plan, (iv)
require any contributions or payments to fund any obligations under any
Company Plan or (v) limit or restrict the right of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or, after the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby, the Parent, to merge, amend or terminate any of the Company Plans.

(h) Any individual who performs services for the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (other than through a Contract with an organization other than
such individual) and who is not treated as an employee of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries for U.S. federal income tax purposes by the Company is not
an employee for such purposes.

(i) Except as set forth on _Section 3.12(i) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule_, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to a
collective bargaining or other labor union Contract applicable to Persons
employed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (each a " _Company
Collective Bargaining Agreement_ "). As of the Memorandum Date, except as set
forth on _Section 3.12 (i) of the Company Disclosure Schedule_, no collective
bargaining agreement or other labor union contract is being negotiated or
renegotiated the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to persons
employed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and there are no
organizational campaigns, petitions or other unionization activities seeking
recognition of a collective bargaining unit which could affect the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries.

(j) Except as set forth in _Section 3.12(j) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule_, there are no (i) strikes, work stoppages, slowdowns, lockouts or
arbitrations, (ii) material grievances or other labor disputes pending or, to
the knowledge of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, threatened against
or involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries  



 

22  involving any employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (iii)
complaints, charges or claims against the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened that
could be brought or filed with any Governmental Authority or arbitrator based
on, arising out of, in connection with, or otherwise relating to the
employment or termination of employment or failure to employ by the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, of any individual. Except as set forth in _Section
3.12(j) of the Company Disclosure Schedule_, there are no unfair labor
practice charges pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened by
or on behalf of any employee or former employee of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries.

(k) The Company and its Subsidiaries are in compliance with all Laws relating
to the employment of labor, including all such Law relating to wages, hours,

bargaining, discrimination, civil rights, safety and health, workers
compensation and the collection and payment of withholding and/or social
security taxes and any similar tax, except for immaterial non-compliance.
Except as set forth in _Section 3.12(k) of the Company Disclosure Schedule_,

WARN) with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries within the six
(6) months prior to the Closing.

(l) Except as set forth in  _Section 3.12(l) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule_, none of the Company Plans in effect immediately prior to the

Section 5.2 _No Solicitation_.

(a) During the period beginning on the Memorandum Date and ending on May 20,
2008 (the " _Solicitation Period End Date_ "), the Company and its
Subsidiaries and their respective officers, directors, employees, agents and
representatives, including any investment banker, consultant, attorney or
accountant retained by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(collectively, " _Representatives_ ") shall be permitted to (i) directly or
indirectly solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage the submission of an
Acquisition Proposal and (ii) 



 

38  directly or indirectly participate in discussions or negotiations regarding,
and furnish to any Person information with respect to, and take any other
action to facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal that
constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition
Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that (x) the Company shall not, nor shall
it authorize or permit any of its Representatives to, provide to any Person
any non-public information (other than immaterial non-public information) with
respect to the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any Joint Venture without
first entering into a customary confidentiality agreement (the " _Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement_ ") with such Person that is not less restrictive of
the other party with respect to confidentiality than the Confidentiality
Agreement, dated as of February 16, 2008, between Seller and Buyer (as it may
be amended from time to time, the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ") and
containing a customary standstill and (y) the Company shall promptly notify
Parent when it enters into any such Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement and
provide to Parent any non-public information concerning the Company and its
Subsidiaries that is provided to such Person or its representatives which was
not previously provided to Parent. Notwithstanding anything contained in this
_Section 5.2(a)_ to the contrary, in the event that the date of this
Agreement is later than the Solicitation Period End Date, this _Section
5.2(a)_ shall be of no further force and effect; provided that the
definitions contained in this _Section 5.2(a)_ shall survive and remain
applicable to the Agreement.

(b) From the later of the date hereof and the Solicitation Period End Date
until the earlier of the Closing or the termination of this Agreement pursuant
to _Article III_ , the Company shall, and it shall cause its Subsidiaries
to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated all existing discussions,
negotiations and communications, if any, with any Persons with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause any
such Person (and its agents and advisors) in possession of confidential
information about the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any Joint Venture
that was furnished by or on behalf of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or
any Joint Venture in connection with such proposal to return or destroy all
such information. Except as permitted by _Section 5.2(a)_ and the Memorandum
of Agreement, dated as of April 30, 2008 between the Company and Parent (the "
_Memorandum_ "), the Company agrees that neither it nor any of its
Subsidiaries shall, and that it shall direct the Companys and its
Subsidiaries respective Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (i)
initiate, solicit or knowingly encourage (including by way of furnishing
information or assistance), or induce, or knowingly take any action to
facilitate the making of, any inquiry, offer or proposal which constitutes or
could reasonably be expected to lead to any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) enter
into, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations
with, furnish any non-public information relating to the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or any Joint Venture to, or otherwise cooperate in any way with
any Person (other than Parent or any of its affiliates or representatives)
that is seeking to make, or has made, an Acquisition Proposal, (iii) fail to
make, or withdraw or modify in any manner adverse to Parent, the Company Board
Recommendation, or recommend, adopt or approve, or publicly propose to
recommend, adopt or approve, any Acquisition Proposal (any of the foregoing in
this clause (iii), an " _Adverse Recommendation Change_ "), (iv) grant (other
than to Parent or any of its affiliates or representatives) any waiver or
release under any standstill or similar agreement, or (v) enter into any
letter of intent or similar document or any written understanding or agreement
contemplating or otherwise relating to, or that is intended to or could
reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal (an " _Acquisition
Agreement_ "). The Company shall promptly (and in any  



 

39  event within forty-eight (48) hours) notify Parent if any proposals are
received by, any information is requested from, or any negotiations
or discussions are sought to be initiated or continued with, the Company, any
of its Subsidiaries or any Representative, in each case, in connection with an
Acquisition Proposal or that could reasonably be expected to lead an
Acquisition Proposal, which notice shall identify the name of the Person
making such proposal or request or seeking such negotiations or discussions,
reasonably specify the material terms and conditions thereof (and any
subsequent material changes to such terms and conditions) and include copies
of all correspondence and written materials provided to the Company, any of
its Subsidiaries or any Representative that describe the terms and conditions
of any proposal or request. The Company shall promptly keep Parent reasonably
informed of the status and details of any Acquisition Proposal (including any
changes in the material terms thereof). Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries shall be party to any agreement that limits or prohibits
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries from (A) providing or making available
to Parent and its representatives any information provided or made available
to any other Person pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement or (B)
providing Parent and its representatives with the information required to be
given to it by the Company under this _Section 5.2_.

(c) Notwithstanding _Section 5.2(b)_, following the later of the date hereof
and Solicitation Period End Date but prior to the acceptance and purchase of
any Shares by Purchaser pursuant to the Offer, the Company may, subject to
compliance with this _Section 5.2_, furnish information concerning its, its
Subsidiaries and the Joint Ventures respective businesses, properties or
assets to any Person pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement and
may negotiate and participate in discussions and negotiations with such
Person concerning an Acquisition Proposal if, but only if, prior to furnishing
such information or entering into or participating in such negotiations or
discussions (x) the Board of Directors determines in good faith, after
receiving advice from a nationally recognized investment banking firm and
outside legal counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal is reasonably likely to
be consummated promptly; (y) such Person has on an unsolicited basis (except
for Persons contacted in accordance with _Section 5.2(a)_ and the
Memorandum), and in the absence of any violation of this _Section 5.2_ by the
Company or any of its Representatives, submitted an Acquisition Proposal (i)
which is required to be accepted by the Company pursuant to an existing
contract or (ii) a bona fide written proposal and which is not conditioned
upon obtaining financing to the Company relating to any such transaction
which the Board of Directors determines in good faith, after receiving advice
from a nationally recognized investment banking firm, is or would reasonably
be expected to be, more favorable to the holders of the Shares from a
financial point of view than the Offer and the Merger or, if applicable, any
proposal by Parent to amend the terms of this Agreement taking into account
all the terms and conditions of such proposal and this Agreement (including
the expecting timing and likelihood of consummation, taking into account any
governmental, regulatory and other approval requirements), and (z) in the
reasonable good faith belief of the Company Board of Directors, after
consultation with outside legal counsel to the Company, the failure to
provide such information or access or to engage in such discussions or
negotiations would reasonably be likely to be inconsistent with the Company
Board of Directors exercise of its fiduciary duties to the Companys
stockholders under applicable Law (an Acquisition Proposal which satisfies
clauses (x), (y) and (z) being referred to herein as a " _Superior Proposal_
"). The Company shall promptly, and in any event within twenty-four hours
following receipt of a Superior Proposal and prior to providing any  



 

40  such party with any material non-public information, notify Parent of the
receipt of the same, which notice shall reasonably specify the material terms
and conditions of such Superior Proposal (and any subsequent material changes
to such terms and conditions) and include the name of the Person making such
Superior Proposal and copies of all correspondence and written materials
provided to the Company or any Company Representative that describe any terms
and conditions of any Superior Proposal. The Company shall promptly provide to
Parent any material non-public information regarding the Company or its
Subsidiaries provided to any other Person which was not previously provided
to Parent, such additional information to be provided no later than the date
of provision of such information to such other Person.

(d) Except as set forth herein, neither the Company Board of Directors nor any
committee thereof shall (i) make an Adverse Recommendation Change or (ii)
enter into any agreement with respect to any Acquisition Proposal.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, prior to the time of acceptance for payment
of Shares in the Offer, the Company Board of Directors determines in good
faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that an
Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal, the Company Board of Directors
may make such an Adverse Recommendation Change; _provided that_ , prior to any
such Adverse Recommendation Change, (x) the Company shall have provided Parent
written notice that it intends to make such recommendation change,
identifying the reasons therefor, and (y) within a period of three Business
Days following the delivery of the notice referred to in clause (x) above,
Parent shall not have proposed adjustments to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement such that the failure to make an Adverse Recommendation Change
would not be inconsistent with the Company Board of Directors exercise of its
fiduciary duties to the Companys stockholders under applicable Law. Any such
Adverse Recommendation Change shall not change the approval of the Company
Board of Directors for purposes of causing any state takeover statute or other
state Law to be applicable to the Transactions (including each of the Offer
and the Merger).

(e) The Company may terminate this Agreement and enter into an Acquisition
Agreement with respect to an Acquisition Proposal, _provided that_ , prior to
any such termination, (i) the Company Board of Directors has determined in
good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that such
Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal, (ii) the Company shall have
provided Parent written notice that it intends to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this _Section 5.2(e)_, identifying the Superior Proposal then
determined to be more favorable and the parties thereto and delivering to
Parent a copy of the Acquisition Agreement for such Superior Proposal in the
form to be entered into, (iii) within a period of three Business Days
following the delivery of the notice referred to in clause (ii) above, Parent
shall not have proposed adjustments in the terms and conditions of this
Agreement which, after having caused its financial and legal advisors to
negotiate with Parent in good faith such proposed adjustments in the terms
and conditions of this Agreement, the Company Board of Directors determines
in its good faith judgment (after considering the advice of its financial
advisor) to be as favorable to the Companys stockholders as such Superior
Proposal, and (iv) at least three Business Days after the Company has
provided the notice referred to in clause (ii) above, the Company shall have
delivered to Parent a written notice of termination of this Agreement pursuant
to this  _Section 5.2(e)_ (it being understood and agreed that any amendment
to the financial terms or any other material term of such Superior Proposal
shall require a new written notice to Parent pursuant to clause (ii) above and
a new three Business Day period).



 

41 (f) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the
Company Board of Directors from taking and disclosing to its shareholders a
position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act if,
in the good faith judgment of the Company Board of Directors, after
consultation with outside counsel to the Company, the failure to take such
action would be inconsistent with the Company Board of Directors exercise of
its fiduciary duties to the Companys shareholders under applicable Law;
_provided_ , _however_ , that neither the Company nor the Company Board of
Directors shall (i) recommend that the Companys stockholders tender their
Shares in connection with any tender or exchange offer other than as
contemplated by the Offer (or otherwise approve or recommend any
Acquisition Proposal) or (ii) withdraw or modify the Board Recommendation,
unless in the case of each of clauses (i) and (ii) hereof, the requirements of
_Section 5.2(b)_ shall have been satisfied as long as such compliance does
not prevent the Company or the Company Board of Directors from timely taking
and disclosing a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the
Exchange Act.

ARTICLE VI

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

Section 6.1 _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company shall give prompt
notice to Parent of the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event whose
occurrence or non-occurrence, as the case may be, could reasonably be expected
to cause any condition set forth in _Annex I_ to not be satisfied at any time
from the date of this Agreement to the date the Purchaser purchases
Shares pursuant to the Offer. The Company, on the one hand, and Parent, on
the other hand, shall give prompt written notice to the other party of (a) any
notice or other communication from any third party alleging that the consent
of such third party is or may be required in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby or (b) any Material Adverse Effect to the Company. The
Company shall give prompt written notice to Parent, and Parent shall give
prompt written notice to the Company, of (i) the occurrence, or failure to
occur, of any event that would be likely to cause any representation or
warranty made by such party contained in this Agreement to be untrue or
inaccurate in any material respect and (ii) any material failure of the
Company, Parent or Purchaser, as the case may be, or of any officer, director,
employee or agent thereof, to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition
or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no such
notification or failure to notify shall affect the representations, warranties
or covenants of the parties or the conditions to the obligations of the
parties hereunder. The Company and Parent shall, to the extent permitted by
Law, promptly provide the other with copies of all filings made by such party
with any Governmental Entity in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, other than the portions of such
filing that include confidential or proprietary information not directly
related to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 6.2 _Access; Confidentiality_. Subject to applicable Laws relating to
the exchange of information, from the date of this Agreement until the
Effective Time, subject to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, the

and other representatives (including independent consultants) of Parent and
the Purchaser, regular access (including access to the Companys and its
Subsidiaries properties to conduct non-invasive environmental inspections),
during normal business hours to all of its officers, employees, agents,
properties, books, contracts and records and, during such period, the Company
shall furnish promptly to Parent and the Purchaser (a) a copy of each report,
schedule, registration statement and other document filed by it pursuant to
the requirements of federal securities laws and (b) all other information
concerning its business, properties and personnel as Parent or the Purchaser
may reasonably request other than the portion of any minutes regarding the
deliberations of the Company Board of Directors (or any Committee thereof) in
connection with entering into this Agreement or pursuing other strategic
alternatives and any materials provided to the Company Board of Directors in
connection therewith. From the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time,
the Company further shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, afford to the
officers, employees and counsel of Parent and the Purchaser reasonable access
to the officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries for purposes
of negotiating new or amended employment agreements between such executive
officers and the Surviving Corporation to be effective at the Effective Time.
Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Purchaser will hold any
information obtained pursuant to this _Section 6.2_ in accordance with the
terms of the Confidentiality Agreement. No investigation pursuant to this
_Section 6.2_ shall affect any representation or warranty made by the parties
hereunder.

Section 6.3 _Publicity_. Each of Parent and the Company shall consult with the
other regarding their initial press releases with respect to the execution of
this Agreement. Thereafter, so long as this Agreement is in effect, neither
the Company nor Parent, nor any of their respective affiliates, shall issue
any press release or other announcement with respect to the Transactions or
this Agreement without the prior consent of the other party (such consent not
to be unreasonably withheld), except as such press release or other
announcement may be required by Law or the rules of a national securities
exchange or trading market, in which case the party required to make the
release or announcement shall use its reasonable best efforts to provide the
other party with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such
release or announcement in advance of its issuance. 

Section 6.4 _Insurance and Indemnification_. (a) The Bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to
indemnification than are set forth in the By-laws of the Company as of the
date hereof, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise
modified for a period of six years from the Effective Time in any manner that
would affect adversely the rights of individuals, who were directors,
officers, employees or agents of the Company or its Subsidiaries at or prior
to the Effective Time, unless such modification shall be required by Law.

(b) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall maintain the Companys and its
Subsidiaries existing officers and directors liability insurance (" _D andO
Insurance_") for a period of not less than six years after the Effective Time;
provided, however, that Parent may substitute therefor policies of
substantially equivalent coverage and amounts containing terms no less
favorable to such former directors or officers; provided, further, that if the
existing DandO Insurance expires or is terminated or cancelled during such
period, then Parent or the Surviving  



 

43  Corporation shall obtain substantially similar DandO Insurance; provided
further, however, that in no event shall Parent or Purchaser be required to
pay annual premiums for insurance under this _Section 6.4(b)_ in excess of
250% of the current annual premiums paid by the Company for such insurance.

Section 6.5 _Further Action; Reasonable Best Efforts_.

the Purchaser and the Company agree to use their respective reasonable best
efforts to (i) make promptly (and in any event within ten (10) Business Days
after execution of this Agreement) its respective filings, and thereafter
make any other required submissions, under the HSR Act and the antitrust or
competition Laws of applicable European Union and other foreign jurisdictions
with respect to the Transactions, (ii) make promptly (and in any event within
ten (10) Business Days), any filings that may be required pursuant to Exon-
Florio and (iii) take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause
to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws
and regulations to consummate and make effective the Transactions as promptly
as practicable including, but not limited to, using their respective
reasonable best efforts to obtain any requisite approvals, consents,
authorizations, orders, exemptions or waivers by any third Person or
Governmental Entity in connection with the Transactions and to fulfill the
conditions to the Offer and the Merger. If at any time after the Effective
Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes
of this Agreement, the proper officers and directors of each party hereto
shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to take all such action.

(b) Each of the parties hereto agrees to cooperate and use all reasonable
efforts to vigorously contest and resist any action, including
administrative or judicial action, and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or
overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order (whether temporary,
preliminary or permanent) that is in effect and that restricts, prevents or
prohibits consummation of the Transactions, including, without limitation, by
vigorously pursuing all available avenues of administrative and judicial
appeal.

(c) In no event shall Parent or Purchaser be obligated pursuant to this
_Section 6.5_ to divest or hold separate any assets or to take or commit to
take any action that which would be reasonably likely to (i) adversely impact
the benefits expected to be derived by Parent, as determined by Parent, as a
result of the Transactions or (ii) impose material limitations on Parents
ownership or operation (or that of any of Parents Subsidiaries or affiliates)
of all or a material portion of the Companys or its Subsidiaries respective
business or assets, including Parents exercise of rights of full ownership of
the Shares purchased by Purchaser in the Offer on all stockholder matters.

Section 6.6 _State Takeover Laws_. If any state takeover statute becomes or is
deemed to become applicable to the Company or the Transactions, then the
Company Board of Directors shall take all actions necessary to render such
statutes inapplicable to the foregoing.

Section 6.7 _Stockholder Litigation_. The Company shall give Parent the
opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any stockholder
litigation against the Company  



 

44  and/or its directors or executive officers relating to the Transactions,
whether commenced prior to or after the execution and delivery of this
Agreement. The Company agrees that it shall not settle or offer to settle any
litigation commenced prior to or after the date of this Agreement against the
Company or any of its directors or executive officers by any stockholder of
the Company relating to this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger, any other
transaction contemplated hereby or otherwise, without the prior written
consent of Parent, not to be unreasonably held, delayed or conditioned.

Section 6.8 _Financial Information_. During the period prior to the Effective
Time, the Company shall promptly provide to Parent consolidated monthly
financial statements and its complete monthly internal financial reporting
package upon completion.

Section 6.9 _Company SEC Documents Filed After The Date Of This Agreement_.
From the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time, the Company shall use
reasonable efforts to timely file with the SEC all Company SEC Documents
required to be filed by it under the Exchange Act or the Securities Act. As
of its filing date, or if amended after the date of this Agreement, as of the
date of the last such amendment, each such Company SEC Document shall fully
comply with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the
Securities Act, as the case may be in all material respects. As of its filing
date or, if amended after the date of this Agreement, as of the date of the
last such amendment, each such Company SEC Document filed pursuant to the
Exchange Act shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading. Each Company SEC Document that is a
registration statement, as amended or supplemented, if applicable, filed after
the date of this Agreement pursuant to the Securities Act, as of the date such
registration statement or amendment became effective after the date of this
Agreement, shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order
to make the statements made in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading. All of the Financial Statements included in the
Company SEC Documents filed after the date of this Agreement (i) shall comply
in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements and with
the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, (ii)
shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis during
the periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto and
except, in the case of the unaudited interim statements, as may be permitted
under Form 10-Q of the Exchange Act) and (iii) shall fairly present in all
material respects the financial position and the results of operations and
cash flows (subject, in the case of unaudited interim financial statements,
to normal and recurring year-end adjustments) of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as of the times and for the periods referred to therein.

Section 6.10 _Approval of Compensation Arrangements_. If the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, after the date hereof in accordance with the provisions of
this Agreement, enters into, adopts, amends, modifies or terminates any
employment compensation, severance and other employment benefit plan of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, including the Company Plans (collectively, the
"  _Arrangements_ ") applicable to certain holders of Company common stock
and other securities of the Company (the " _Covered Securityholders_ "), all
such amounts payable under such Arrangements shall (i) be paid or granted as
compensation for past services  



 

45  performed, future services to be performed, or future services to be
refrained from performing, by the Covered Securityholders (and matters
incidental thereto) and (ii) shall not be calculated based on the number of
Shares tendered or to be tendered into the Offer by the applicable Covered
Securityholder. Moreover, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries
to, take all actions necessary so that, prior to the expiration date of the
Offer (as such date may be extended in accordance with this Agreement): (i)
the adoption, approval, amendment or modification of each such Arrangement
shall be approved as an employment compensation, severance or other employee
benefit arrangement solely by independent directors of the Company in
accordance with the requirements of Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act
and the instructions thereto and (ii) the "safe harbor" provided pursuant to
Rule 14d-10(d)(2) is otherwise applicable thereto as a result of the taking
prior to the expiration date all necessary actions by the Company Board of
Directors, the Compensation Committee of such Company Board of Directors or
its independent directors.

the date hereof, Parent shall designate an Affiliate to be Purchaser. Upon

Section 9.7 _Jurisdiction_. Each of Parent, the Purchaser and the Company
hereby expressly and irrevocably submits to the exclusive
personal jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the District of
Delaware and to the jurisdiction of any other competent court of the State of
Delaware (collectively, the " _Delaware Courts_ "), preserving, however, all
rights of removal to such federal court under 28 U.S.C. Section 1441, in
connection with all disputes arising out of or in connection with this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and agrees not to commence
any litigation relating thereto except in such courts. Each such party hereby

out of or in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby to which any of them may be entitled by reason of its present or
future domicile. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each such party agrees that

injunctive relief to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of any of the

parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersedes
all other prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among
the parties or any of them with respect to the subject matter hereof and
thereof (provided that the provisions of this Agreement shall supersede any
conflicting provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement). Except as provided
in _Section 6.4_, nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended
to confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies
hereunder.

Section 9.12 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by rule of law or public
policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the Transactions is not affected in any manner adverse to any
party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid,
illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in
good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the
parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the
Transactions are fulfilled to the extent possible.

construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware without giving
effect to the principles of conflicts of law thereof.

Section 9.14 _Assignment_. No Party hereto shall assign its rights or
delegate its obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of the
other Parties hereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) Purchaser may assign
any or all of its rights, interests and obligations hereunder to Parent, one
or more direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiaries of Parent, of a
combination thereof, and (b) Parent may, at any time prior to the Effective
Date, assign this Agreement to a Subsidiary without the prior consent of the
Company if such assignee delivers an instrument in writing confirming that it
is bound by and shall perform all of the obligations of Parent under this
Agreement as if it were an original signatory and provided further that Parent
shall not be relieved of its obligations hereunder. In the event of an
assignment contemplated above, any reference in this Agreement to "Parent"
shall be deemed to include the assignee. Subject to the foregoing, this
Agreement shall inure to the benefit of, be binding upon and be enforceable
by the Parties and their respective successors (including any successor by
reason of amalgamation of any Party) and permitted assigns.

Agreement to be signed by their respective officers thereunto duly authorized
as of the date first written above.
