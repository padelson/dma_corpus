The Merger shall become effective at such time (the " _Effective  Time_ ") as the articles of merger  are duly filed with the Minnesota Secretary of State (or at such later time  as is established by Parent and the Company and set forth in the articles  of merger).

 

 (c)  From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall possess  all the rights, powers, privileges and immunities and be subject to all of  the duties and liabilities, 

 

7   
  
 

restrictions and disabilities of the  Company and Merger Sub, all as provided
under Minnesota Law.

 

 Section  2.02 _Conversion of Shares_.  At the Effective Time,

 

 (a)  except as otherwise provided in _Section  2.04_ , each share of Company Stock outstanding  immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into the right  to receive $[4.05] in cash, without interest (the " _Merger  Consideration_ ");

 

 (b)  each share of Company Stock held by any Subsidiary of the Company or owned  by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time  shall be canceled, and no payment shall be made with respect thereto; and

 

 (c)  each share of common stock of Merger Sub outstanding immediately prior to  the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one share of common  stock of the Surviving Corporation with the same rights, powers and privileges  as the shares so converted and shall constitute the only outstanding shares  of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

 

 Section  2.03 _Surrender and Payment_.

 

 (a)  Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint an agent (the " _Exchange  Agent_ ") for the purpose of exchanging  the (i) certificates representing shares of Company Stock (the " _Certificates_ ")  or (ii) uncertificated shares of Company Stock (the " _Uncertificated  Shares_ "), in each case, for the  aggregate Merger Consideration payable to each holder of shares of Company  Stock. At the Effective Time, Parent shall make available to the Exchange  Agent the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the Certificates  and the Uncertificated Shares. Not later than two Business Days after the  date of Closing, Parent shall send, or shall cause the Exchange Agent to  send, to each holder of shares of Company Stock at the Effective Time a letter  of transmittal and instructions (which shall specify that the delivery shall  be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper delivery  of the Certificates or transfer of the Uncertificated Shares to the Exchange  Agent) for use in such exchange.

 

 (b)  Each holder of shares of Company Stock that have been converted into the  right to receive the Merger Consideration shall be entitled to receive, upon  (i) surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together with a properly  completed letter of transmittal, or (ii) receipt of an "agents  message" by the Exchange Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer  as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a book-entry  transfer of Uncertificated Shares, the Merger Consideration in respect of  the Company Stock represented by such Certificate or Uncertificated Share.  Until so surrendered or transferred, as the case may be, each such Certificate  or Uncertificated Share shall represent after the Effective Time for all  purposes only the right to receive such Merger Consideration.

 

 (c)  If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other  than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the transferred  Uncertificated Share is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment  that (i) either such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise  be in proper form for transfer or such Uncertificated Share shall be properly  transferred and (ii) the Person requesting such payment shall pay to the  Exchange Agent

 

8   
  
 

any transfer or other taxes required  as a result of such payment to a Person
other than the registered holder  of such Certificate or Uncertificated Share
or establish to the satisfaction  of the Exchange Agent that such tax has
been paid or is not payable.

 

 (d)  After the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers  of shares of Company Stock. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or  Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation, they shall  be canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration provided for, and  in accordance with the procedures set forth, in this Article 2.

 

 (e)  Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Exchange  Agent pursuant to _Section 2.03(a)_ that remains unclaimed by the  holders of shares of Company Stock one year after the Effective Time shall  be returned to Parent, upon demand, and any such holder who has not exchanged  shares of Company Stock for the Merger Consideration in accordance with  this _Section 2.03_ prior to that time shall thereafter look only  to Parent for payment of the Merger Consideration, and any dividends and  distributions with respect thereto, in respect of such shares without any  interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall not be liable  to any holder of shares of Company Stock for any amounts paid to a public  official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar  laws. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of shares of Company Stock  two years after the Effective Time (or such earlier date, immediately prior  to such time when the amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property  of any Governmental Authority) shall become, to the extent permitted by  Applicable Law, the property of the Surviving Corporation free and clear  of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 

 (f)  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, amounts payable in respect  of Stock Units pursuant to _Section 2.06_ shall be paid pursuant to  such Section and not pursuant to this _Section 2.03_ , and no deposit  shall be made (or required to be made) with the Exchange Agent by the Company  or Parent pursuant to this _Section 2.03_ in respect of any such payment  pursuant to _Section 2.06_. In addition, the procedures of this _Section  2.03_ in respect of holders of shares of Company Stock shall not apply  to the extent of such holders Stock Units.

 

 Section  2.04 _Dissenting Shares_.  Notwithstanding _Section 2.02_ ,  shares of Company Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time  and held by a holder who has not voted in favor of the Merger or consented  thereto in writing and who has properly exercised dissenters rights  with respect to such shares and becomes entitled to obtain payment for the  value of such shares of Company Stock in accordance with Minnesota Law shall  not be converted into a right to receive the Merger Consideration, unless  such holder subsequently withdraws a demand for payment, fails to comply  fully with the requirements of Minnesota Law or otherwise fails to establish  the right of such holder to be paid the value of such holders shares  under Minnesota Law. Parent shall cause the Company to make all payments  to holders of shares of Company Stock with respect to such demands in accordance  with Minnesota Law and Parent and the Surviving Corporation may direct the  Exchange Agent to pay any such amount from funds deposited with the Exchange  Agent pursuant to _Section 2.03_.  If, after the Effective Time, such holder subsequently withdraws a demand  for payment, fails to comply fully with the requirements of Minnesota Law  or otherwise fails to establish the right of such holder to be paid the value  of such holders shares under Minnesota Law, such shares shall be treated  as if they had been converted as of the Effective Time into a right to receive  the Merger Consideration.

 

9   
  
 

The Company shall give Parent prompt  notice of any notice of intent to
demand fair value for any shares of Company  Stock, withdrawals of such
notices or any other related instruments served  pursuant to Minnesota Law
and received by the Company, and Parent shall have  the right to participate
in all negotiations and proceedings with respect  to such demands. Except
with the prior written consent of Parent, the Company  shall not make any
payment with respect to, offer to settle or settle any  such demands. Each
holder of shares of Company Stock that, pursuant to the  provisions of
Section 320A.473 of Minnesota law, becomes entitled to payment  of the value
of dissenting shares will receive payment therefor after the  value thereof
has been agreed upon or finally determined pursuant to Minnesota  Law. Any
portion of the Merger Consideration deposited with the Exchange  Agent that
would have been payable with respect to such dissenting shares  but was not
paid from such deposited funds as set forth above will be returned  to
Parent.

 

 Section  2.05 _Stock Options_.  At or immediately prior to the Effective Time, each option (a " _Company  Stock Option_ ") to purchase shares  of Company Stock granted under the Stock Option Plan for Replacement of Existing  Options, the Stock Option Plan for Replacement of EEBs, the 1995 Employee  Stock Option Plan, the 1995 Non-Employee Directors Stock Option Plan, the  1999 Stock Incentive Plan or any other employee stock option or compensation  plan or arrangement (each, a " _Company  Option Plan_ ") of the Company outstanding  at the Effective Time, whether or not then vested or exercisable, shall be  canceled, and Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,  pay each holder of any such option at or promptly after the Effective Time  for each such option an amount in cash determined by multiplying (i) the  excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration per share of Company Stock over  the applicable exercise price of such option by (ii) the number of shares  of Company Stock such holder could have purchased (assuming full vesting  of such option) had such holder exercised such option in full immediately  prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall  use its reasonable best efforts to take all actions necessary under each  such Company Option Plan and any agreement relating to each such Company  Stock Option to effect the foregoing treatment of such option.

 

 Section  2.06 _Deferred Units_. At or immediately prior to the Effective Time,  each unit based on Company Stock (a " _Stock Unit_ ") credited  under the 2001 Nonemployee Director Compensation Plan and granted under  the 1999 Stock Incentive Plan outstanding at the Effective Time shall be  canceled, and Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,  pay each holder of any such Stock Unit at or promptly after the Effective  Time for each such Stock Unit an amount in cash equal to Merger Consideration  per share of Company Stock. At the Effective Time, the Company shall terminate  the 2001 Nonemployee Director Compensation Plan and any agreement relating  to each such Stock Unit, and prior to the Effective Time shall use its  reasonable best efforts to take all other actions necessary, to effect  the foregoing treatment of such unit.

 

 Section  2.07 _Withholding Rights_.  Each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct  and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant  to this Article 2 such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with  respect to the making of such payment under any provision of federal, state,  local or foreign tax law. If the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the  case may be, so withholds amounts, such amounts shall be treated for all  purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares  of 

 

10   
  
 

Company Stock, of a Company Stock  Option or a Stock Unit in respect of which
the Surviving Corporation or Parent,  as the case may be, made such deduction
and withholding.

 

 Section  2.08 _Lost Certificates_.  If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making  of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be  lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation,  the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as the Surviving  Corporation may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against  it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will pay, in exchange  for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration  to be paid in respect of the shares of Company Stock represented by such  Certificate, as contemplated by this Article 2.

 

 Section  2.09 _Adjustments_. If, during the period between the date of this  Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares  of Company Stock shall occur, including by reason of any reclassification,  recapitalization, stock split or combination, exchange or readjustment  of shares, or any stock dividend thereon with a record date during such  period (but excluding any change that results from any exercise of Company  Stock Options outstanding as of the date hereof to purchase shares of Company  Stock granted under Company Option Plans), the Merger Consideration shall  be appropriately adjusted; _provided_ that, in the event of such adjustment,  the aggregate amount of Merger Consideration payable pursuant to this Article  2 shall not be adjusted.

 (b)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, but subject to _Section  6.03(c)_ below, the Board of Directors  of the Company, directly or indirectly through advisors, agents or other  intermediaries,

 

31   
  
 

may at any time prior to the Company  Stockholder Meeting (i) engage in
negotiations or discussions with any Third  Party that, subject to the
Companys compliance with _Section_ _6.03(a)_ ,  has made a bona fide
Acquisition Proposal that the Board of Directors of  the Company, acting in
good faith (after consultation with the Companys  outside legal advisor and
financial advisor) has determined to be, or reasonably  believes could be
expected to lead to, a Superior Proposal and (ii) thereafter  furnish to such
Third Party nonpublic information relating to the Company  or any of its
Subsidiaries pursuant to an appropriate confidentiality agreement  and (iii)
following receipt of such Superior Proposal, make an Adverse Recommendation 
Change but, in each case referred to in the foregoing _clauses  (i)_ _through
(iii)_ , only if the Board  of Directors of the Company determines in good
faith by a majority vote (exclusive  of any members of the Board of Directors
that are not independent of the  Third Parties making such Superior
Proposal), after considering advice from  outside legal counsel to the
Company and the financial advisor to the Company,  that the failure to take
such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary  duties under Applicable
Law. The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries  and the advisors,
employees and other agents of the Company and any of its  Subsidiaries to,
cease immediately and cause to be terminated any and all  existing
activities, discussions or negotiations, if any, with any Third  Party
conducted on or prior to the date hereof with respect to any Acquisition 
Proposal.

 

 (c)  The Board of Directors of the Company shall not take any of the actions referred  to in _clauses (i)_ , _(ii)_ and _(iii)_ of _Section  6.03(b)_ unless the Company shall have  delivered to Parent a prior written notice advising Parent that it intends  to take such action, which written notice shall state the material terms  and conditions of the applicable Superior Proposal. The parties hereto agree  that, in the event any such written notice is delivered pursuant hereto,  before the Board of Directors takes any action referred to in _clause  (iii)_ of _Section  6.03(b)_ , Parent shall be provided with  three Business Days from the date of delivery of such notice to make adjustments  to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and the Company shall negotiate  in good faith with respect thereto. In addition, the Company shall notify  Parent as promptly as reasonably practicable, and use its reasonable best  efforts to provide such notice with one Business Day, following receipt by  the Company (or any of its advisors) of any Acquisition Proposal or any written  request for nonpublic information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries  or for access to the business, properties, assets, books or records of the  Company or any of its Subsidiaries by any Third Party that indicates it may  be considering making, or has made, an Acquisition Proposal (including the  identity of such Third Party and the material terms and conditions of any  such Acquisition Proposal, indication or request). The Company shall keep  Parent reasonably informed, on a current basis, of the status and material  details of any such Acquisition Proposal, indication or request (and any  modification or amendment thereof), including of any meeting of its Board  of Directors (or any committee thereof) at which its Board of Directors (or  such committee) is reasonably expected to consider any Acquisition Proposal.

 

 (d)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, after prior written notice to Parent, the  Board of Directors of the Company shall be permitted to take any action necessary  to comply with Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) under the 1934 Act with regard  to an Acquisition Proposal and to make any disclosure to the stockholders  of the Company if, in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of  the Company, after considering the advice of outside counsel, failure so  to disclose would be inconsistent with its obligations under Applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ ,  that the 

 

32   
  
 

fact that a disclosure or other action  may be deemed permissible by virtue
of this sentence does not in and of itself  mean that any such disclosure or
other action constitutes an Adverse Recommendation  Change.

 

 (e)  The Company shall not take any action to exempt any Person from the restrictions  on "business combinations" contained in Section 302A.673 of Minnesota  Law (or any similar provisions) or otherwise cause such restrictions not  to apply unless such actions are taken simultaneously with a termination  of this Agreement in accordance with _Section  10.01(c)(i)_ and _(ii)_ or _Section  10.01(d)_.

 

 Section  6.04 _Access to Information, etc_.  From the date hereof until the Effective Time and subject to Applicable Law  and the Confidentiality Agreement dated as of December 19, 2005, between  the Company and Parent (the " _Confidentiality  Agreement_ ") and _Section  8.06_ of this Agreement, the Company shall (i) give Parent, its counsel,  financial advisors, auditors and other authorized representatives reasonable  access, subject to Parents and the Companys compliance with Applicable  Law, to the offices, properties, books and records of the Company and the  Subsidiaries, (ii) furnish to Parent, its counsel, financial advisors, auditors  and other authorized representatives such financial and operating data and  other information as such Persons may reasonably request and (iii) instruct  the employees, counsel, financial advisors, auditors and other authorized  representatives of the Company and its Subsidiaries to cooperate with all  reasonable requests of Parent in its investigation of the Company and its  Subsidiaries. Any investigation pursuant to this Section shall be conducted  during normal business hours in such manner as not to interfere unreasonably  with the conduct of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries. In  addition, the Company will reasonably cooperate with Parent and Merger Sub  in connection with obtaining the Debt Financing, including participation  in rating agency presentations and obtaining payoff letters, lien releases  and similar instruments and certificates in respect of the Companys  existing debt, as may be reasonably required in connection with obtaining  the Debt Financing.

 

  Section 6.05 _New  York Stock Exchange and SEC Filings_.

 

 (a)  The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the continued trading  and listing of the Company Stock on the New York Stock Exchange during the  term of this Agreement; and

 

 (b)  The Company shall file with the SEC its quarterly report on Form 10-Q for  the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2006 in a form compliant with, and  within the time period required by, the applicable rules and regulations  of the SEC. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the  parties hereto agree that the failure to file such quarterly report in a  form compliant in all material respects with the applicable rules and regulations  of the SEC prior to December 8, 2006 shall constitute a material breach of  this _clause (b)_ for  purposes of _Sections 9.02(a)_ and _10.01(c)(iii)_.

 

 Section  6.06 _Stockholder Litigation_.  The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any stockholder litigation  against the Company and/or its directors relating to the transactions contemplated  by this Agreement, and shall provide Parent with the opportunity to participate  in 

 

33   
  
 

the defense of any such litigation.  The Company shall consult with Parent
before making any payment or settlement  offer prior to the Effective Time
with respect to any such litigation.

  Parent and Merger Sub agree that:

 

 Section  7.01 _Director and Officer Liability_.  Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation, and the Surviving Corporation  hereby agrees, to do the following:

 

 (a)  For six years after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall indemnify  and hold harmless the present and former officers and directors of the Company  (each an " _Indemnified Person_ ") in  respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time  (including acts or omissions in connection with this Agreement and the consummation  of the transactions contemplated hereby) to the fullest extent permitted  by Minnesota Law or any other Applicable Law or provided under the Companys  articles of incorporation and bylaws in effect immediately prior to the Effective  Time; _provided_ that such indemnification  shall be subject to any limitation imposed by such articles or bylaws (as  in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time) or from time to time by  Applicable Law.

 

 (b)  For six years after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall provide  each Indemnified Person with "tail" insurance in respect of acts  or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time covering each such Indemnified  Person currently covered by the Companys officers and directors liability  insurance policy on terms with respect to coverage and amount not materially  less favorable than those of such policy in effect on the date hereof; _provided_ that  if such a policy cannot reasonably be procured for an annual premium of 300%  of the premium paid by the Company in respect of the current year as of the  date of this Agreement, then the Surviving Corporation shall provide insurance  with the greatest coverage and amount reasonably procurable for such a premium.  Without limiting the generality of foregoing (and notwithstanding any other  provision of this Agreement), prior to the Effective Time and with the prior  consent of Parent, the Company shall be entitled to obtain prepaid insurance  policies providing for the coverage contemplated by this Section. If such  prepaid policies are obtained prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall not  cancel such policies or permit such policies to be canceled.

 

 (c)  If the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates  with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving  corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers  or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person,  then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary, proper provision shall  be made prior to such transaction so that the successors and assigns of Parent,  Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume  the obligations set forth in this _Section  7.01_.

 

 (d)  The articles of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall  include provisions for exculpation of director and officer liability and  indemnification on the 

 

34   
  
 

same basis as set forth in the Companys  articles of incorporation and
bylaws in effect immediately prior to the Effective  Time. For six years
after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall  maintain in effect
the provisions in its articles of incorporation and bylaws  providing for
indemnification of Indemnified Persons with respect to the  facts or
circumstances occurring at or prior to the Effective Time to the  fullest
extent permitted from time to time under Minnesota Law, which provisions 
shall not be amended except as required by changes in Applicable Law or
except  to make changes permitted by Applicable Law that would enlarge the
scope  of the Indemnified Persons indemnification rights thereunder.

 

 (e)  The Surviving Corporation shall pay all expenses, including reasonable fees  and expenses of counsel, that an Indemnified Person may incur in enforcing  the indemnity and other obligations provided for in this _Section  7.01_ ; provided, that such Indemnified  Person shall undertake in writing to reimburse the Surviving Corporation  for all amounts paid by Surviving Corporation if a court of competent jurisdiction  determines by a final, nonappealable order, that such Indemnified Person  is not entitled to indemnification.

 

 (f)  The rights of each Indemnified Person under this _Section  7.01_ shall be in addition to any rights  such Person may have under the articles of incorporation or bylaws of the  Company or any of its Subsidiaries, under Minnesota Law or any other Applicable  Law or under any agreement of any Indemnified Person with the Company or  any of its Subsidiaries. All such rights shall survive consummation of the  Merger and are intended to benefit, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified  Person against the Surviving Corporation.

 

  Section 7.02 _Employee  Benefits_.

 

 (a)  Parent shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation)  to, provide each employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (each,  a " _Company_ _Employee_ " and  together, the " _Company Employees_ ")  with base salary or wage rates, an annual cash bonus opportunity and employee  benefits (other than benefits of the type described in _clause  (e)_ below) that are no less than those  provided by Parent or its Subsidiaries to other similarly tenured and positioned  employees of Parent and such Subsidiaries from time to time.

 

 (b)  For six months following the Effective Time, Parent shall provide those Company  Employees identified in or described on _Schedule  7.02(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule  who are employed in the United States with severance payments and benefits  that are no less favorable than those set forth on such _Schedule  7.02(b)_.

 

  (c) [Intentionally Omitted];

 

 (d)  Each Company Employee will receive service credit for all periods of employment  with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any predecessor thereof prior  to the Effective Time for purposes of vesting, eligibility and benefit levels  under any employee benefit plan in which such employee participates after  the Effective Time, to the extent that such service was recognized under  any analogous plan of the Company or its Subsidiaries in effect immediately  prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ that  no such service credit shall be given for 

 

35   
  
 

purposes of benefit accruals under  any defined benefit pension plan or where
such credit would result in a duplication  of benefits.

 

 (e)  Until June 30, 2007, Parent shall maintain in effect all benefit plans of  the Company providing medical, dental, health, pharmaceutical, vision or  other similar benefits for Company Employees. Thereafter, Company Employees  shall be entitled to participate in the benefit plans offered by or on behalf  of Parent, and in effect subsequent to June 30, 2007, providing medical,  dental, health, pharmaceutical, vision or other similar benefits, which participation  shall be on the same basis as other similarly tenured and positioned employees  of Parent and its Subsidiaries from time to time.

 

 (f)  No Company Employee shall have any third party beneficiary rights or rights  to any specific levels of compensation or benefits as a result of the application  of this _Section 7.02_.
