ARTICLE II

_Effect of the Merger on the Capital Stock of the_

_Constituent Corporations; Exchange of Certificates_

SECTION 2.01. _Effect on Capital Stock._ At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of
US BioEnergy Common Stock or any shares of capital stock of Sub:

(a) _Capital Stock of Sub._ Each issued and outstanding share of capital
stock of Sub shall be automatically converted into and become one fully paid
and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation.

(b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and VeraSun-Owned Stock._ Each share of US
BioEnergy Common Stock, that is directly owned by US BioEnergy, Sub or
VeraSun shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to be outstanding, and
no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.



 

3 (c) _Conversion of US BioEnergy Common Stock._ Subject to Section 2.02(e),
each issued and outstanding share (other than shares to be canceled in
accordance with Section 2.01(b)) of US BioEnergy Common Stock shall be
converted into the right to receive 0.810 (the " _Exchange Ratio_ ") fully
paid and nonassessable shares of VeraSun Common Stock (the " _Merger
Consideration_ "). As of the Effective Time, all such shares of US BioEnergy
Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
canceled and shall cease to be outstanding, and each holder of a certificate
that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such shares of US
BioEnergy Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto,
except the right to receive the Merger Consideration, certain dividends or
other distributions in accordance with Section 2.02(c) and cash in lieu of any
fractional share of VeraSun Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration
therefor upon surrender of such certificate in accordance with Section
2.02(e), without interest (or in the case of a lost, stolen or destroyed
certificate, upon delivery of an affidavit (and bond, if required) in the
manner provided in Section 2.02(i)).

(d) _Anti-Dilution Provisions._ In the event VeraSun changes (or establishes a
record date for changing) the number of shares of VeraSun Common Stock issued
and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a result of a stock split,
stock dividend, recapitalization, subdivision, reclassification, combination,
exchange of shares or similar transaction with respect to the outstanding
VeraSun Common Stock and the record date therefor shall be prior to the
Effective Time, the Exchange Ratio shall be proportionately adjusted to
reflect such stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, subdivision,
reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or similar transaction.

SECTION 2.02. _Exchange of Certificates._ (a) _Exchange Agent._ Prior to the
Effective Time, VeraSun shall enter into an exchange agent agreement in form
and substance reasonably satisfactory to US BioEnergy with Wells Fargo Bank,
N.A. or such other bank or trust company as may be designated by VeraSun and
reasonably acceptable to US BioEnergy (the " _Exchange Agent_ "), which shall
provide that VeraSun shall deposit with the Exchange Agent as of the Effective
Time, for the benefit of the holders of shares of US BioEnergy Common Stock,
for exchange in accordance with this Article II, through the Exchange Agent,
certificates representing the Merger Consideration issuable pursuant to
Section 2.01 in exchange for outstanding shares of US BioEnergy Common Stock.
VeraSun shall make available to the Exchange Agent from time to time as
required after the Effective Time cash necessary to pay dividends and other
distributions in accordance with Section 2.02(c) and to make payments in lieu
of any fractional shares of VeraSun Common Stock in accordance with Section
2.02(e). All shares of VeraSun Common Stock, cash, dividends and distributions
deposited with the Exchange Agent pursuant to this Section 2.02(a) shall
hereinafter be referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ ". The Exchange Agent
shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions, deliver the shares of VeraSun
Common Stock and cash contemplated to be issued pursuant to this Section
2.02(a) out of the Exchange Fund. Except as contemplated by Section
2.02(f), the Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose.

(b) _Exchange Procedures._ As soon as reasonably practicable after
the Effective Time, VeraSun shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each
holder of record  



 

4  of a certificate or certificates (the " _Certificates_ ") which immediately
prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of US BioEnergy
Common Stock, whose shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration pursuant to Section 2.01, certain dividends or other
distributions in accordance with Section 2.02(c) and cash in lieu of any
fractional share of VeraSun Common Stock in accordance with Section 2.02(e),
(i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon
delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form
and have such other provisions as VeraSun may reasonably specify) and (ii)
instructions for use in surrendering the Certificates in exchange for
certificates representing the Merger Consideration, certain dividends or
other distributions in accordance with Section 2.02(c) and cash in lieu of any
fractional share of VeraSun Common Stock in accordance with Section 2.02(e).
Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent,
together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other
documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of
such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a
certificate representing that number of whole shares of VeraSun Common Stock
that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of this
Article II, certain dividends or other distributions in accordance
with Section 2.02(c) and cash in lieu of any fractional share of VeraSun
Common Stock in accordance with Section 2.02(e), and the Certificate so
surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of US BioEnergy Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer
records of US BioEnergy, a certificate representing the proper number of
shares of VeraSun Common Stock may be issued to a person other than the person
in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered if such
Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for
transfer and the person requesting such issuance shall pay any transfer or
other taxes required by reason of the issuance of shares of VeraSun
Common Stock to a person other than the registered holder of such Certificate
or establish to the satisfaction of VeraSun that such tax has been paid or is
not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.02(b),
each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger
Consideration that the holder thereof has the right to receive pursuant to the
provisions of this Article II, certain dividends or other distributions in
accordance with Section 2.02(c) and cash in lieu of any fractional share of
VeraSun Common Stock in accordance with Section 2.02(e). No interest shall be
paid or will accrue on any cash payable to holders of Certificates pursuant
to the provisions of this Article II.

(c) _Distributions with Respect to Unsurrendered Certificates._ Whenever a
dividend or other distribution is declared or made after the date hereof with
respect to VeraSun Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time,
such declaration shall include a dividend or other distribution in respect of
all shares of VeraSun Common Stock issuable pursuant to this Agreement. Any
dividends or other distributions with respect to VeraSun Common Stock with a
record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of
any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the shares of VeraSun Common
Stock represented thereby, and any cash payment in lieu of fractional shares
of VeraSun Common Stock shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to Section
2.02(e) only upon the surrender of such Certificate by the holder of record
of such Certificate in  



 

5  accordance with this Article II. Subject to the effect of applicable escheat
or similar laws, following surrender of any such Certificate there shall be
paid to the holder of the certificate representing whole shares of VeraSun
Common Stock, issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) at the time
of such surrender, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a
record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such
whole shares of VeraSun Common Stock and the amount of any cash payable in
lieu of a fractional share of VeraSun Common Stock to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to Section 2.02(e) and (ii) at the appropriate payment
date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after
the Effective Time but prior to such surrender and with a payment date
subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such whole shares of
VeraSun Common Stock.

(d) _No Further Ownership Rights in US BioEnergy Common Stock_. All shares of
VeraSun Common Stock issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates
in accordance with the terms of this Article II (including any cash paid
pursuant to this Article II) shall be deemed to have been issued (and paid) in
full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of US BioEnergy
Common Stock previously represented by such Certificates, subject, however, to
the Surviving Corporations obligation to pay any dividends or make any other
distributions with a record date prior to the Effective Time which may have
been declared or made by US BioEnergy on such shares of US BioEnergy Common
Stock, which remain unpaid at the Effective Time, and there shall be no
further registration of transfers on the share transfer books of
the Surviving Corporation of the shares of US BioEnergy Common Stock which
were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the
Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as
provided in this Article II.

(e) _No Fractional Shares._ (i) No certificates or scrip representing
fractional shares of VeraSun Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender
for exchange of Certificates (or in the case of a lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate, upon delivery of an affidavit (and bond, if required) in
the manner provided in Section 2.02(i)), no dividends or other distributions
of VeraSun shall relate to such fractional share interests and such fractional
share interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights of
a shareholder of VeraSun.

(ii) In lieu of such fractional share interests, VeraSun shall pay to each
holder of a Certificate an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by
multiplying (A) the fractional share interest to which such holder (after
taking into account all shares of US BioEnergy Common Stock formerly
represented by all Certificates surrendered by such holder) would
otherwise be entitled by (B) the average closing price of one share of
VeraSun Common Stock for the ten (10) most recent trading days that VeraSun
Common Stock has traded ending on the trading day one day prior to the
Effective Time, as such price is reported on the NYSE Composite Transaction
Tape (as reported by Bloomberg Financial Markets or such other source as the
parties shall agree in writing).

(f) _Termination of the Exchange Fund._ Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates for twelve months
after  



 

6  the Effective Time shall be delivered to VeraSun, upon demand, and any
holders of the Certificates who have not theretofore complied with
this Article II shall thereafter look only to VeraSun for, and VeraSun shall
remain liable for, payment of their claim for the Merger Consideration, any
dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.02(c) and cash
in lieu of any fractional shares payable pursuant to Section 2.02(e) in
accordance with this Article II.

(g) _No Liability._ None of VeraSun, Sub, US BioEnergy, the Surviving
Corporation or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of
any shares of VeraSun Common Stock, cash, dividends or other distributions
from the Exchange Fund properly delivered to a public official pursuant to
any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. If any Certificate
shall not have been surrendered prior to four years after the Effective Time
(or immediately prior to such earlier date on which any Merger Consideration
(and any dividends or other distributions payable with respect thereto
pursuant to Section 2.02(c) and cash in lieu of any fractional shares payable
with respect thereto pursuant to Section 2.02(e)) would otherwise escheat
to or become the property of any Governmental Entity), any such Merger
Consideration (and any dividends or other distributions payable with respect
thereto pursuant to Section 2.02(c) and cash in lieu of any fractional shares
payable with respect thereto pursuant to Section 2.02(e)) shall, to the
extent permitted by applicable law, become the property of VeraSun, free and
clear of all claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto.

(h) _Investment of Exchange Fund._ The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash
included in the Exchange Fund in investment-grade securities, as directed by
VeraSun, on a daily basis; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such investment or
loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to former shareholders of US
BioEnergy after the Effective Time pursuant to this Article II. Any interest
and other income resulting from such investments shall become part of the
Exchange Fund, and any amounts in excess of the amounts payable pursuant to
this Article II shall be paid to VeraSun.

(i) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates._ If any Certificate shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact
by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and,
if required by VeraSun, the posting by such person of a bond in such
reasonable amount as VeraSun may direct as indemnity against any claim that
may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent
shall deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the
Merger Consideration, any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to
Section 2.02(c) and cash in lieu of any fractional shares payable pursuant to
Section 2.02(e), in each case pursuant to this Article II.

(j) _Withholding Rights._  VeraSun, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange
Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Certificates
such amounts as VeraSun, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign tax law. To the
extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate
taxing authority by VeraSun, the Surviving Corporation or the  



 

7  Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Certificates in respect
of which such deduction and withholding was made by VeraSun, the Surviving
Corporation or the Exchange Agent.

(k) _Uncertificated Shares_. In the case of outstanding shares of US
BioEnergy Common Stock that are not represented by Certificates, the parties
shall make such adjustments to this Section 2.02 as are necessary or
appropriate to implement the same purpose and effect that this Section 2.02
has with respect to shares of US BioEnergy Common Stock that are represented
by Certificates.

ARTICLE III

_Representations and Warranties_

SECTION 3.01. _Representations and Warranties of US BioEnergy._ Except (i) as
disclosed in the US BioEnergy SEC Documents filed by US BioEnergy with, or
furnished by US BioEnergy to, the SEC and publicly available prior to the
date of this Agreement (the " _US BioEnergy Filed SEC Documents_ ") other than
(x) risk factor disclosure contained in any US BioEnergy Filed SEC Documents
under the headings "Risk Factors", "Forward Looking Statements" or any
similar sections and (y) any disclosure of risks that are predictive, forward
looking or primarily cautionary in nature or (ii) as set forth in the
disclosure schedule (with specific reference to the particular Section or
subsection of this Agreement to which the information set forth in such
disclosure schedule relates; _provided_ , _however_ , that any information set
forth in one section of the US BioEnergy Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed
to apply to each other Section or subsection thereof to which its relevance is
readily apparent on its face) delivered by US BioEnergy to VeraSun prior to
the execution of this Agreement (the " _US BioEnergy Disclosure Schedule_ "),
US BioEnergy represents and warrants to VeraSun as follows:

(a) _Organization, Standing and Corporate Power._  Each of US BioEnergy and
its Subsidiaries is a corporation or other legal entity duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction in
which it is organized and has the requisite corporate or other power
and authority, as the case may be, to carry on its business as now being
conducted. Each of US BioEnergy and its Subsidiaries is duly qualified or
licensed to do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which
the nature of its business or the ownership, leasing or operation of its
properties makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except for those
jurisdictions in which the failure to be so qualified or licensed or to be in
good standing, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and is not
reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on US BioEnergy. US
BioEnergy has made available to VeraSun prior to the execution of this
Agreement complete and correct copies of its Second Amended and Restated
Articles of Incorporation and Second Amended and Restated By-laws, as amended
to the date of this Agreement, and the comparable charter and organizational
documents of each Subsidiary of US BioEnergy, in each case as amended to the
date of this Agreement. 



 

8 (b) _Subsidiaries._ Section 3.01(b) of the US BioEnergy Disclosure Schedule
sets forth a true and complete list of each of US BioEnergys Subsidiaries as
of the date of this Agreement. All the outstanding shares of capital stock of,
or other equity interests in, each Subsidiary of US BioEnergy have been
validly issued and are fully paid and nonassessable and are owned directly or
indirectly by US BioEnergy, free and clear of all pledges, claims, liens,
charges, encumbrances, security interests and other matters affecting title of
any kind or nature whatsoever (collectively, " _Liens_ ") and free of any
restriction on the right to vote, sell or otherwise dispose of such capital
stock or other ownership interests. Except for the capital stock or other
ownership interests of its Subsidiaries, as of the date of this Agreement, US
BioEnergy does not beneficially own directly or indirectly any material
capital stock, membership interest, partnership interest, joint venture

as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to
make the certifications of the chief executive officer and chief financial
officer of US BioEnergy required under the Exchange Act with respect to such
reports. Prior to the date of this Agreement, US BioEnergys outside auditors
and the audit committee of the Board of Directors of US BioEnergy have not

and no circumstances exist that could result in US BioEnergy or any of its
Subsidiaries becoming obligated to provide any such benefits, except in each
case for benefits that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and are
not reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on US BioEnergy.

(iv) None of the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the obtaining of
the shareholder approval or the consummation of the Merger or any
other transaction contemplated by this Agreement (alone or in conjunction
with any other event, including any termination of employment on or following
the Effective Time) will (A) entitle any current or former director, officer,
employee or independent contractor of US BioEnergy or any of its Subsidiaries
to any material compensation or benefit, (B) materially accelerate the time of
payment or vesting, or trigger any payment or funding, of any compensation or
benefits or trigger any other material obligation under any US BioEnergy
Benefit Plan or US BioEnergy Benefit Agreement or (C) result in any material
breach or violation of, default under or limit US BioEnergys right to amend,
modify or terminate any US BioEnergy Benefit Plan or US BioEnergy Benefit
Agreement.

(v) No amount or other entitlement that could be received as a result of
the transactions contemplated hereby (alone or in conjunction with any other
event) by any "disqualified individual" (as defined in Section 280G(c) of the
Code) with respect to US BioEnergy will constitute an "excess
parachute payment" (as defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code). No
director, officer, employee or independent contractor of US BioEnergy or any
of its Subsidiaries is entitled to receive any gross-up or additional payment
by reason of the tax required by Section 409A or 4999 of the Code being
imposed on such person.



 

18 (m) _Taxes._ (i) Each of US BioEnergy and its Subsidiaries and each US
BioEnergy Consolidated Group has filed or has caused to be filed all material
tax returns and reports required to be filed by it and all such returns and
reports are complete and correct in all material respects, or requests for
extensions to file such returns or reports have been timely filed, granted
and have not expired, except to the extent that such failures to file, to be
complete or correct or to have extensions granted that remain in effect,
individually or in the aggregate, have not had and are not reasonably likely
to have a Material Adverse Effect on US BioEnergy. US BioEnergy, each of its
Subsidiaries and each US BioEnergy Consolidated Group has paid or caused to be
paid (or US BioEnergy has paid on its behalf) all material taxes due
and owing, and the most recent financial statements contained in the US
BioEnergy Filed SEC Documents reflect an adequate reserve for all material
taxes payable by US BioEnergy and its Subsidiaries for all taxable periods and
portions thereof accrued through the date of such financial statements.

(ii) No deficiencies, audit examinations, refund litigation, proposed
adjustments or matters in controversy for any taxes have been proposed,
asserted or assessed in writing against US BioEnergy or any of its
Subsidiaries or any US BioEnergy Consolidated Group that are not adequately
reserved for, except for deficiencies, audit examinations, refund litigation,
proposed adjustments or matters in controversy that, individually or in the
aggregate, have not had and are not reasonably likely to have a Material
Adverse Effect on US BioEnergy. The Federal income tax returns prior to the
date set forth in Section 3.01(m)(ii) of the US BioEnergy Disclosure Schedule
of US BioEnergy and its Subsidiaries consolidated in such returns have closed
by virtue of the applicable statute of limitations. All assessments for taxes
due and owing by US BioEnergy, any of its Subsidiaries or any US BioEnergy
Consolidated Group with respect to completed and settled examinations or
concluded litigation have been paid.

(iii) Neither US BioEnergy nor any of its Subsidiaries has taken or agreed to
take any action or, after consultation with counsel, knows of any
fact, agreement, plan or other circumstance that is reasonably likely to
prevent the Merger from qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code.

(iv) No deduction of any amount that would otherwise be deductible with
respect to tax periods ending on or before the Effective Time will be
disallowed under Section 162(m) of the Code, except any disallowances under
Section 162(m) of the Code that, alone or with other such disallowances, have
not had and are not reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on US
BioEnergy. 

(v) Neither US BioEnergy nor any of its Subsidiaries has constituted either a
"distributing corporation" or a "controlled corporation" in a distribution of
stock qualifying for tax-free treatment under Section 355 of the Code (x) in
the two years prior to the date of this Agreement or (y) in a distribution
which would otherwise constitute part of a "plan" or "series of related
transactions" (within the meaning of Section 355(e) of the Code) in
conjunction with the Merger.



 

19 (vi) To the Knowledge of US BioEnergy, no shareholder of US BioEnergy is a
foreign person who held more than 5% of the US BioEnergy stock at some time
during the shorter of the periods described in Section 897(c)(1)(A)(ii) of the
Code.

(vii) Neither US BioEnergy nor any of its Subsidiaries has any material
"deferred intercompany gains" (as defined in Treas. Reg. Section 1.1502-13).

(viii) Section 3.01(m)(viii) of the US BioEnergy Disclosure Schedule sets
forth a complete schedule of each US BioEnergy Consolidated Group of which US
BioEnergy is or has been a member during the last six years. Such schedule
sets forth the names of all members of each such US BioEnergy Consolidated
Group and the periods during which US BioEnergy or any of its Subsidiaries is
or has been a member.

(ix) As used in this Agreement (1) "taxes" shall include all (x) Federal,
state, local or foreign income, property, sales, excise and other taxes or
similar governmental charges, including any interest, penalties or additions
with respect thereto, (y) liability for the payment of any amounts of the type
described in clause (x) as a result of being a member of an affiliated,
consolidated, combined or unitary group, and (z) liability for the payment of
any amounts as a result of being party to any tax sharing agreement or as a
result of any express or implied obligation to indemnify any other person
with respect to the payment of any amounts of the type described in clause (x)
or (y) and (2) " _US BioEnergy Consolidated Group_ " means any affiliated
group within the meaning of Section 1504(a) of the Code, in which US
BioEnergy (or any Subsidiary of US BioEnergy) is or has ever been a member or
any group of corporations with which US BioEnergy files, has filed or is or
was required to file an affiliated, consolidated, combined, unitary
or aggregate tax return.

(x) As of the date of this Agreement, assuming all other conditions to Closing
have been satisfied, other than as a result of a material change in
applicable laws or facts after the date of this Agreement, US BioEnergy
expects to be able to deliver to Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP,
counsel to US BioEnergy, and Cravath, Swaine and Moore LLP, counsel to VeraSun,
letters acceptable to them and customary for transactions of this type setting
forth factual statements and representations as may be necessary for Skadden,
Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP and Cravath, Swaine and Moore LLP to render the
opinions contemplated in Sections 6.02(c) and 6.03(c).

(n) _Voting Requirements._ Assuming the accuracy of the representations and
warranties of VeraSun contained in Section 3.02(p) and that VeraSun was not
otherwise an "interested shareholder" as defined in Section 47-33-3 of the
SDBCA during the past four years, (i) a number of votes cast within the
voting group favoring approval of this Agreement, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement that exceeds the number of votes
cast opposing such matters at a meeting of the shareholders of US BioEnergy
at which a quorum consisting of at least a majority of the outstanding shares
of US BioEnergy Common Stock exists (the " _US BioEnergy Shareholder Approval_
") is the only vote or approval of the holders of any class or series of US
BioEnergys capital stock necessary to approve, in accordance with US
BioEnergys Second Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation and Section
47-  



 

20  1A-1104 of the SDBCA, this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) except as set forth in clause (i) of
this sentence, the affirmative vote or consent of the holders of any class or
series of capital stock of US BioEnergy or its Subsidiaries is not necessary
to consummate any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the
US BioEnergy Shareholders Agreement.

(o) _State Takeover Statutes._ The Board of Directors of US BioEnergy
(including the disinterested directors thereof) has approved the terms of
this Agreement and the US BioEnergy Shareholders Agreement and the
consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the US BioEnergy Shareholders Agreement and assuming the
accuracy of the representations and warranties of VeraSun contained in Section
3.02(p) and that VeraSun was not otherwise an "interested shareholder" as
defined in Section 47-33-3 of the SDBCA during the past four years, such
approval constitutes approval of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the US BioEnergy Shareholders Agreement by
the Board of Directors of US BioEnergy under the provisions of Section
47-33-17 of the SDBCA and represents all the action necessary to ensure that
the restrictions on "business combinations" (as defined in such Section
47-33-3) contained in Section 47-33-17 do not apply to VeraSun in connection
with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
the US BioEnergy Shareholders Agreement. To the Knowledge of US BioEnergy, no
other state takeover statute or similar statute or regulation is applicable to
this Agreement, the US BioEnergy Shareholders Agreement, the Merger or the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the US BioEnergy
Shareholders Agreement.

(p) _Ownership of VeraSun Stock._ Neither US BioEnergy nor any Subsidiary of
US BioEnergy beneficially owns, or has beneficially owned in the past four
years, any shares of VeraSun Common Stock or any other class or series
of VeraSuns capital stock.

(q) _Brokers._ No broker, investment banker, financial advisor or other
person, other than UBS Securities LLC, the fees, commissions and expenses of
which will be paid by US BioEnergy, is entitled to any brokers, finders,
financial advisors or other similar fee or commission, or the reimbursement
of expenses, in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the VeraSun Shareholders Agreement based upon arrangements made
by or on behalf of US BioEnergy. US BioEnergy has furnished to VeraSun true

or expenses are payable and all indemnification and other agreements related
to the engagement of the persons to whom such fees, commissions or expenses
are payable.

(r) _Opinion of Financial Advisor._ US BioEnergy has received the opinion of
UBS Securities LLC, dated the date of this Agreement, to the effect that, as

shareholders of US BioEnergy, a signed copy of which has been or promptly will
be delivered to VeraSun for informational purposes only.



 

21 (s) _Intellectual Property._ (i)US BioEnergy and its Subsidiaries own, or are
validly licensed or otherwise have the right to use, all patents, patent
rights, trademarks, trade secrets, trade names, service marks, copyrights and
other proprietary intellectual property rights and computer programs (the "
_Intellectual Property Rights_ ") which are material to the conduct of the
business of US BioEnergy and its Subsidiaries, except where the failure to own
or license such Intellectual Property Rights, individually or in the
aggregate, has not had and is not reasonably likely to have a Material
Adverse Effect on US BioEnergy.

(ii) To the Knowledge of US BioEnergy, neither US BioEnergy nor any of its
Subsidiaries has, infringed upon, misappropriated or come into conflict with
any Intellectual Property Rights of any other person, except for such
infringements, misappropriations or conflicts that, individually or in the
aggregate, have not had and are not reasonably likely to have a Material
Adverse Effect on US BioEnergy. Neither US BioEnergy nor any of its
Subsidiaries has received any written charge, complaint, claim, demand or
notice alleging any such infringement, misappropriation or other conflict
(including any claim that US BioEnergy or any such Subsidiary must license or
refrain from using any Intellectual Property Rights or other proprietary
information of any other person) which has not been settled or otherwise
fully resolved or is not reasonably likely to result in material liability to
US BioEnergy. To US BioEnergys Knowledge, no other person has infringed upon,
misappropriated or otherwise violated any Intellectual Property Rights of
US BioEnergy or any of its Subsidiaries, except for such infringements,
misappropriations or other conflicts that, individually or in the aggregate,
have not had and are not reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect
on US BioEnergy. 

(t) _Title to Properties._ (i) US BioEnergy or its Subsidiaries have good and
marketable title to the real property reflected in the financial statements
of US BioEnergy included in the US BioEnergy Filed SEC Documents as being
owned by US BioEnergy (whether wholly owned or with a joint venture partner)
(the " _US BioEnergy Owned Real Estate_ "), free and clear of any Liens,
other than Permitted Liens. With respect to each parcel of US BioEnergy Owned
Real Estate, (1) neither US BioEnergy nor any Subsidiary of US BioEnergy has
leased or otherwise granted to anyone the right to use or occupy such parcel
of US BioEnergy Owned Real Estate or any material portion thereof, (2) there
are no outstanding options, rights of first offer or rights of first refusal
to purchase any such parcel of US BioEnergy Owned Real Estate or any
material portion thereof or interest therein, (3) as of the date of this

other proceeding in eminent domain, pending or threatened, affecting any
parcel of US BioEnergy Owned Real Estate or any material portion thereof or
interest therein.

(ii) US BioEnergy has heretofore made available to VeraSun true and complete
copies of all leases under which US BioEnergy or any of its Subsidiaries
holds any material leasehold property, including any real property reflected
in the financial  



 

22  statements of US BioEnergy included in the US BioEnergy Filed SEC Documents
as being leased by US BioEnergy (such leases, the " _US BioEnergy
Material Leases_ "). Each of the US BioEnergy Material Leases is in full
force and effect and constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of US
BioEnergy or the applicable Subsidiary. Neither US BioEnergy nor any of its
Subsidiaries is in default under any US BioEnergy Material Lease, nor has any

Subsidiaries has granted to any person the right of use or occupancy of any
material portion of any parcel of property held by US BioEnergy or any of its
Subsidiaries under a US BioEnergy Material Lease.

VeraSun and its Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed to do business and
is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its business
or the ownership, leasing or operation of its properties makes
such qualification or licensing necessary, except for those jurisdictions in
which the failure to be so qualified or licensed or to be in good standing,
individually or in the aggregate, has not had and is not reasonably likely to
have a Material Adverse Effect on VeraSun. VeraSun has made available to US
BioEnergy prior to the execution of this Agreement complete and correct copies
of its Amended Articles of Incorporation and Amended By-laws, as amended to
the date of this Agreement, and the comparable charter and organizational
documents of each Subsidiary of VeraSun, in each case as amended to the date

constitute the legal, valid and binding obligations of VeraSun, enforceable
against VeraSun in accordance with their respective terms, subject to
bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, moratorium, reorganization or
similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally and the availability
of equitable remedies (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered
in a proceeding in equity or at law). The execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the US BioEnergy Shareholders Agreement do not, and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the US
BioEnergy Shareholders Agreement and compliance with the provisions hereof
and thereof will not, conflict with, or result in any violation of, or default
(with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise to a

loss of a benefit under, or result in the creation of any Lien upon any of
the properties or other assets of VeraSun or any of its Subsidiaries under,

2006 (such documents, together with any documents filed during such period by
VeraSun with the SEC on a voluntary basis on Current Reports on Form 8-K,
collectively, the " _VeraSun SEC Documents_ "). As of their respective dates,
the VeraSun SEC Documents complied in all material respects with the  



 

26  requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and SOX, in each case
to the extent applicable to such VeraSun SEC Documents, and none of the
VeraSun SEC Documents when filed (and, in the case of any registration
statement under the Securities Act, at the time it was declared effective)
contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. Except to the extent that information contained in any VeraSun
SEC Document has been revised, amended, supplemented or superseded by a later
filed VeraSun SEC Document, none of the VeraSun SEC Documents contains any
untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements

Documents comply as to form, as of their respective dates of filing with the
SEC, in all material respects with the Accounting Rules, have been prepared
in accordance with GAAP (except, in the case of unaudited statements, as

basis during the periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes
thereto) and fairly present in all material respects the consolidated
financial position of VeraSun and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of the

connection with this Agreement or the US BioEnergy Shareholders Agreement or
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the US BioEnergy
Shareholders Agreement or (iii) incurred since September 30, 2007, in the
ordinary course of business, neither VeraSun nor any of its Subsidiaries has
any liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether accrued, absolute,
contingent or otherwise) that, individually or in the aggregate, have had or
are reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on VeraSun.

(ii) Each of the principal executive officer of VeraSun and the principal
financial officer of VeraSun (or each former principal executive officer

under the Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906 of SOX with respect to VeraSun
SEC Documents, and the statements contained in such certifications are true
and accurate. For purposes of this Agreement, "principal executive officer"
and "principal financial officer" shall have the meanings given to such terms
in SOX. Neither VeraSun nor any of its Subsidiaries has outstanding, or has
arranged any outstanding, "extensions of credit" to directors or executive
officers within the meaning of Section 402 of SOX.

(iii) VeraSuns "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined in Rules
13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) are reasonably designed to
ensure that all information (both financial and non-financial) required to be
disclosed by VeraSun in the reports that it files or submits under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the rules and  



 

27  forms of the SEC, and that all such information is accumulated and
communicated to VeraSuns management as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications of the
chief executive officer and chief financial officer of VeraSun required under
the Exchange Act with respect to such reports. Prior to the date of this
Agreement, VeraSuns outside auditors and the audit committee of the Board of
Directors of VeraSun have not been advised of (A) any significant deficiencies
or material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over
financial reporting which could reasonably be expected to adversely affect
VeraSuns ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
information or (B) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management or other employees who have a significant role in VeraSuns
internal control over financial reporting. Since December 31, 2006, any
material change in internal control over financial reporting required to be
disclosed in any VeraSun SEC Document has been so disclosed.

(iv) None of VeraSuns Subsidiaries is, or has at any time since June 1, 2006,
been, subject to the reporting requirements of Sections 13(a) or 15(d) of the
Exchange Act.

(f) _Information Supplied._ None of the information supplied or to be supplied
by VeraSun specifically for inclusion or incorporation by reference in (i)
the Form S-4 will, at the time the Form S-4 becomes effective under the
Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make
the statements therein not misleading or (ii) the Joint Proxy Statement will,
at the date it is first mailed to VeraSuns shareholders and US BioEnergys
shareholders or at the time of the VeraSun Shareholders Meeting or the US
BioEnergy Shareholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. The Form S-4 and the
Joint Proxy Statement will comply as to form in all material respects with the
requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, as applicable.
No representation or warranty is made by VeraSun with respect to statements
made or incorporated by reference in the Form S-4 and the Joint Proxy
Statement based on information supplied by US BioEnergy specifically for
inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy
Statement, as the case may be.

(g) _Absence of Certain Changes or Events._ Except for liabilities incurred
in connection with or expressly permitted by this Agreement and the US
BioEnergy Shareholders Agreement, since December 31, 2006, there has not been
any Material Adverse Change in VeraSun. Except as contemplated by
the Agreement or the US BioEnergy Shareholders Agreement, from December 31,
2006 through the date of this Agreement, VeraSun and its Subsidiaries have
conducted their business only in the ordinary course of business, and since
such date through the date of this Agreement there has not been (1) any
declaration, setting aside or payment of any dividend or other distribution
(whether in cash, stock or property) with respect to any of VeraSuns capital
stock, (2) any split, combination or reclassification of any of VeraSuns
capital stock or any issuance or the authorization of any issuance of any
other securities in respect of, in lieu of or in substitution for shares of
VeraSuns capital stock, (3) (A) any granting by  



 

28  VeraSun or any of its Subsidiaries to any current or former director,
executive officer, other employee or independent contractor of VeraSun or
its Subsidiaries of any material increase in compensation, bonus or other
benefits, except for normal increases in cash compensation in the ordinary
course of business or as was required under any employment agreements in
effect as of the date of the most recent audited financial statements
included in the VeraSun Filed SEC Documents, (B) any granting by VeraSun or
any of its Subsidiaries to any such current or former director, executive
officer, employee or independent contractor of any material increase in
change in control, severance or termination pay, (C) any adoption,
termination, entry by VeraSun or any of its Subsidiaries into, or any material
amendments of, any VeraSun Benefit Plan or VeraSun Benefit Agreement or (D)
any material amendment to, or material modification of, any VeraSun Stock
Award, (4) any damage, destruction or loss, whether or not covered by
insurance, that, individually or in the aggregate, has had or is reasonably
likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on VeraSun, (5) except insofar as
may have been required by a change in GAAP, any change in accounting methods,
principles or practices by VeraSun or any of its Subsidiaries materially
affecting the consolidated financial position or results of operations of
VeraSun or (6) any tax election or any settlement or compromise of any income
tax liability that, individually or in the aggregate, is reasonably likely to
adversely affect the tax liability or tax attributes of VeraSun or any of its
Subsidiaries in any material respect or any settlement or compromise of any
material income tax liability. Neither VeraSun nor any of its Subsidiaries is
a party to, or has any commitment to become a party to, any joint venture,
off-balance sheet partnership or any similar Contract or arrangement
(including any Contract relating to any transaction or relationship between or
among VeraSun and any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any
unconsolidated Affiliate, including any structured finance, special purpose
or limited purpose entity or person, on the other hand or any "off-balance
sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K of the SEC)),
where the result, purpose or intended effect of such Contract is to avoid
disclosure of any material transaction involving, or material liabilities of,
VeraSun or any of its Subsidiaries, in VeraSuns or any of its Subsidiarys
financial statements or other VeraSun SEC Documents.

(h) _Litigation._ There is no suit, action, proceeding, claim, grievance,
arbitration or investigation pending or, to the Knowledge of VeraSun or any
of its Subsidiaries, threatened against or affecting VeraSun or any of its
Subsidiaries that, individually or in the aggregate, has had or is reasonably
likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on VeraSun nor is there any
judgment, decree, injunction, rule or order of any Governmental Entity or
arbitrator outstanding against US BioEnergy or any of its Subsidiaries that,
individually or in the aggregate, has had or is reasonably likely to have a
Material Adverse Effect on VeraSun.

(i) _Compliance with Applicable Laws._ VeraSun and its Subsidiaries hold
all material permits, licenses, variances, exemptions, orders, registrations
and approvals of all Governmental Entities (the " _VeraSun Permits_ ") which
are required for them to own, lease or operate their assets and to carry on
their businesses. VeraSun and its Subsidiaries are in compliance in all
material respects with the terms of the VeraSun Permits and all applicable
statutes, laws, ordinances, rules and regulations. No action,  



 

29  demand, requirement or investigation by any Governmental Entity and no suit,
action or proceeding by any person, in each case with respect to VeraSun or
any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties, that,
individually or in the aggregate, has had or is reasonably likely to have a
Material Adverse Effect on VeraSun, is pending or, to the Knowledge of
VeraSun, threatened. VeraSun is, and has been, in compliance in all material
respects with the provisions of SOX applicable to it on or prior to the date
of this Agreement and has implemented such programs and has taken all
reasonable steps necessary to ensure VeraSuns future compliance (not later
than the relevant statutory and regulatory deadlines therefor) with all
provisions of SOX which shall become applicable to VeraSun after the date of
this Agreement. This Section 3.02(i) does not relate to matters with respect
to Environmental Laws, which are the subject of Section 3.02(j), benefit
plans, which are the subject of Section 3.02(l) and Taxes, which are the
subject of Section 3.02(m).

the date of this Agreement, there are no Environmental Claims pending or, to
the Knowledge of VeraSun, threatened against VeraSun or any of its

likely to result in, material liability; and (iv) to the knowledge of
VeraSun, there are have been no events, conditions, actions or omissions that
are reasonably likely to form the basis of an Environmental Claim against
VeraSun or any of its Subsidiaries, except for any such Environmental Claims
that have not resulted in, and are not reasonably likely to result in,
material liability.

(k)  _Contracts._ (i) As of the date of this Agreement, neither VeraSun nor
any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, and none of their respective properties
or other assets is subject to, any Material Contract. None of VeraSun, any of
its Subsidiaries or, to the Knowledge of VeraSun, any other party thereto is
in violation of or in default under (nor does there exist any condition which
upon the passage of time or the giving of notice or both would cause such a
violation of or default by VeraSun or any of its Subsidiaries or, to the
Knowledge of VeraSun, any other party thereto under) any Contract to which it
is a party or by which it or any of its properties or other assets is bound,
except for violations or defaults that, individually or in the aggregate,
have not had and are not reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect.
To the Knowledge of VeraSun, there are no circumstances existing as of the
date of this Agreement that would be reasonably likely to give rise to a
breach or default under any material Contracts relating to the construction of
the VeraSun Plants that are set forth on Section 3.02(k)(i) of the Disclosure
Schedule.

(ii) Section 3.02(k)(ii) of the VeraSun Disclosure Schedule contains a
complete and accurate list, as of the date hereof, of (A) each
Contract restricting or purporting to restrict VeraSuns or any of VeraSuns
Subsidiaries ability to compete in any line of business, geographic market or
customer segment, (B) each material Contract relating to development,
manufacture, marketing or distribution of the products and services of
VeraSun or any of its Subsidiaries and any products licensed by VeraSun or

VeraSun or any of its Subsidiaries of any product on an exclusive
or requirements basis or the purchase by VeraSun or any of its Subsidiaries
of any product on an exclusive or output basis, and (D) (x) any Contract,
transaction or commercial relationship currently in effect, or which was
effective at any time after December 31, 2006, between VeraSun and any
present or former manager or officer thereof or any member of such managers
or officers family, or any person controlled by such officer or manager or
his or her family (other than any employment agreements entered into in the
ordinary course of business), and (y) any other Contract, transaction or
relationship that would be required to be disclosed pursuant to Item 404 of
Regulation S-K of the SEC in an Annual Report on Form 10-K.

(iii) Prior to the date of this Agreement, VeraSun has made available to US
BioEnergy complete and accurate copies of any Contract (or complete and
accurate descriptions of any transaction or relationship) required to be
disclosed on Section 3.02(k)(i) or Section 3.02(k)(ii) of the VeraSun
Disclosure Schedule.

(l) _ERISA; Employee Benefit Plans._ (i) Section 3.02(l)(i)(A) of the VeraSun
Disclosure Schedule sets forth a complete and accurate list of each (i)
pension plan (as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA) or post-retirement or
employment health or medical plan, program, policy or arrangement, (ii) bonus,
incentive or deferred compensation or equity or equity-based
compensation plan, program, policy or arrangement , (iii) severance, change
in control, retention or termination plan, program, policy or arrangement or
(iv) other material compensation or benefit plan, program, policy or
arrangement, in each case, sponsored, maintained, contributed to or required

other person or entity that, together with VeraSun, is treated as a single
employer under Section 414 of the Code (each, a " _VeraSun Commonly
Controlled Entity_ ") for the benefit of any current or former director,
officer, employee or independent contractor of VeraSun or any of its
Subsidiaries, in each case other than the VeraSun Benefit Agreements (defined
below) (each, a " _VeraSun Benefit Plan_ "). Section 3.02(l)(i)(B) of VeraSun
Disclosure Schedule sets forth a complete and accurate list of each
employment, consulting, incentive or deferred compensation, material equity
or material equity-based compensation, severance, change in control,
retention, termination or other material contract between VeraSun or any of
its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any current or former director,
officer, employee or independent contractor of VeraSun or any of its
Subsidiaries, on the other hand (each, a " _VeraSun Benefit Agreement_ ").
With respect to each VeraSun Benefit Plan and VeraSun Benefit Agreement,
VeraSun has made available to US BioEnergy complete and accurate copies of
(A) such VeraSun Benefit Plan or VeraSun Benefit Agreement, including any
amendment thereto, (B) each trust, insurance, annuity or other funding
contract related thereto, (C) the most recent financial statements and
actuarial or other valuation reports prepared with respect thereto and (D) the
two most recent annual reports on Form 5500 required to be filed with the IRS

(ii) Each VeraSun Benefit Plan and VeraSun Benefit Agreement (and any related
trust or other funding vehicle) has been administered in accordance with its
terms and is in compliance with ERISA, the Code and all other applicable Laws,
except for any  



 

31  failures to do so that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and
are not reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on VeraSun. Each
of VeraSun and its Subsidiaries is in compliance with ERISA, the Code and all
other Laws applicable to VeraSun Benefit Plans and VeraSun Benefit Agreements,
except for any noncompliance that, individually or in the aggregate, has not
had and is not reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on
VeraSun. None of VeraSun or any of its Subsidiaries has received notice of
and, to the Knowledge of VeraSun, there are no investigations by any
Governmental Entity with respect to or termination proceedings or other
claims, suits or proceedings (except routine claims for benefits payable in
the ordinary course) against or involving any VeraSun Benefit Plan or VeraSun
Benefit Agreement, except for any investigations, claims, suits
or proceedings that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and are
not reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on VeraSun.

(iii) Neither VeraSun, nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any VeraSun Commonly
Controlled Entity has sponsored, maintained, contributed to or been required
to maintain or contribute to, or has any actual or contingent material
liability under, any VeraSun Benefit Plan that is subject to Section 302 or
Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code or is otherwise a defined benefit
plan. No VeraSun Benefit Plan or VeraSun Benefit Agreement provides health,
medical or other welfare benefits after retirement or other termination of
employment (other than for continuation coverage required under Section
4980(B)(f) of the Code or similar legal requirement) and no circumstances
exist that could result in VeraSun or any of its Subsidiaries becoming
obligated to provide any such benefits, except in each case for benefits that,
individually or in the aggregate, have not had and are not reasonably likely
to have a Material Adverse Effect on VeraSun.

(iv) None of the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the obtaining of
the shareholder approval or the consummation of the Merger or any
other transaction contemplated by this Agreement (alone or in conjunction
with any other event, including any termination of employment on or following
the Effective Time) will (A) entitle any current or former director, officer,
employee or independent contractor of VeraSun or any of its Subsidiaries to
any material compensation or benefit, (B) materially accelerate the time of
payment or vesting, or trigger any payment or funding, of any compensation or
benefits or trigger any other material obligation under any VeraSun Benefit
Plan or VeraSun Benefit Agreement or (C) result in any material breach or
violation of, default under or limit VeraSuns right to amend, modify or
terminate any VeraSun Benefit Plan or VeraSun Benefit Agreement.

(v) No amount or other entitlement that could be received as a result of the
transactions contemplated hereby (alone or in conjunction with any other
event) by any "disqualified individual" (as defined in Section 280G(c) of the
Code) with respect to VeraSun will constitute an "excess parachute payment"
(as defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code). No director, officer,
employee or independent contractor of VeraSun or any of its Subsidiaries is
entitled to receive any gross-up or additional payment by reason of the tax
required by Section 409A or 4999 of the Code being imposed on such person.

(m) _Taxes._ (i) Each of VeraSun and its Subsidiaries and each VeraSun
Consolidated Group has filed or has caused to be filed all material tax
returns and reports  



 

32  required to be filed by it and all such returns and reports are complete and
correct in all material respects, or requests for extensions to file
such returns or reports have been timely filed, granted and have not expired,
except to the extent that such failures to file, to be complete or correct or
to have extensions granted that remain in effect, individually or in the
aggregate, have not had and are not reasonably likely to have a Material
Adverse Effect on VeraSun. VeraSun, each of its Subsidiaries and each VeraSun
Consolidated Group has paid or caused to be paid (or VeraSun has paid on its
behalf) all material taxes due and owing, and the most recent financial
statements contained in the VeraSun Filed SEC Documents reflect an adequate
reserve for all material taxes payable by VeraSun and its Subsidiaries for all
taxable periods and portions thereof accrued through the date of such
financial statements.

(ii) No deficiencies, audit examinations, refund litigation, proposed
adjustments or matters in controversy for any taxes have been proposed,
asserted or assessed in writing against VeraSun or any of its Subsidiaries or
any VeraSun Consolidated Group that are not adequately reserved for, except
for deficiencies, audit examinations, refund litigation, proposed adjustments
or matters in controversy that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had
and are not reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on VeraSun.
The Federal income tax returns prior to the date set forth in Section
3.02(m)(ii) of the VeraSun Disclosure Schedule of VeraSun and its Subsidiaries
consolidated in such returns have closed by virtue of the applicable statute
of limitations. All assessments for taxes due and owing by VeraSun, any of
its Subsidiaries or any VeraSun Consolidated Group with respect to completed
and settled examinations or concluded litigation have been paid.

(iii) Neither VeraSun nor any of its Subsidiaries has taken or agreed to take
any action or, after consultation with counsel, knows of any fact, agreement,
plan or other circumstance that is reasonably likely to prevent the Merger
from qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of
the Code.

(iv) No deduction of any amount that would otherwise be deductible with
respect to tax periods ending on or before the Effective Time will be
disallowed under Section 162(m) of the Code, except any disallowances under
Section 162(m) of the Code that, alone or with other such disallowances, have
not had and are not reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on
VeraSun.

(v) Section 3.02(m)(v) of the VeraSun Disclosure Schedule sets forth a
complete schedule of each VeraSun Consolidated Group of which VeraSun is or
has been a member during the last six years. Such schedule sets forth the
names of all members of each such VeraSun Consolidated Group and the periods
during which VeraSun or any of its Subsidiaries is or has been a member.

(vi) As used in this Agreement, " _VeraSun Consolidated Group_ " means any
affiliated group within the meaning of Section 1504(a) of the Code, in which
VeraSun (or any Subsidiary of VeraSun) is or has ever been a member or any
group of corporations with which VeraSun files, has filed or is or was
required to file an affiliated, consolidated, combined, unitary or aggregate
tax return.



 

33 (vii) As of the date of this Agreement, assuming all other conditions to
Closing have been satisfied, other than as a result of a material change in
applicable laws or facts after the date of this Agreement, VeraSun and Sub
expect to be able to deliver to Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP,
counsel to US BioEnergy, and Cravath, Swaine and Moore LLP, counsel to VeraSun,
letters acceptable to them and customary for transactions of this type setting
forth factual statements and representations as may be necessary for Skadden,
Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP and Cravath, Swaine and Moore LLP to render the
opinions contemplated in Sections 6.02(c) and 6.03(c)

(viii) Neither VeraSun nor any of its Subsidiaries has any material "deferred
intercompany gains" (as defined in Treas. Reg. Section 1.1502-13).

(n)  _Voting Requirements._ Assuming the accuracy of the representations and
warranties of US BioEnergy contained in Section 3.01(p) and that US BioEnergy
was not otherwise an "interested shareholder" as defined in Section 47-33-3
of the SDBCA during the past four years, (i) (A) a number of votes cast within
the voting group favoring approval of the issuance of VeraSun Common Stock in
connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement that exceeds the number of votes cast opposing such matters at a
meeting of the shareholders of VeraSun at which a quorum consisting of at
least a majority of the outstanding shares of VeraSun Common Stock exists
is the only vote or approval of the holders of any class or series of
VeraSuns capital stock necessary to approve, in accordance with VeraSuns
Articles of Incorporation and Section 47-1A-621.1 of the SDBCA, the issuance
of VeraSun Common Stock in connection with the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (B) the affirmative vote of at
least a majority of all shares of VeraSun Common Stock casting votes (
_provided_ that the total vote cast represents over 50% of the interest of
all of VeraSuns capital stock entitled to vote) is the only vote of the
holders of any class or series of VeraSuns capital stock necessary to
approve, in accordance with the applicable rules of the NYSE, the issuance of
VeraSun Common Stock in connection with the Merger (collectively, the "
_VeraSun Shareholder Approval_ ") and (ii) except as set forth in clause (i)
of this sentence, the affirmative vote or consent of the holders of any class
or series of capital stock of VeraSun or its Subsidiaries is not necessary to
consummate any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the
VeraSun Shareholders Agreement.

(o) _State Takeover Statutes._ The Board of Directors of VeraSun (including
the disinterested directors thereof) has approved the terms of this Agreement
and the VeraSun Shareholders Agreement and the consummation of the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the VeraSun
Shareholders Agreement and, assuming the accuracy of the representations and
warranties of US BioEnergy contained in Section 3.01(p) and that US BioEnergy
was not otherwise an "interested shareholder" as defined in Section 47-33-3 of
the SDBCA during the past four years, such approval constitutes approval of
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
VeraSun Shareholders Agreement by the Board of Directors of VeraSun under the
provisions of Section 47-33-17 of the SDBCA and represents all the action
necessary to ensure that the restrictions on "business combinations" (as
defined in such Section 47-33-3) contained in Section 47-33-17 do not  



 

34  apply to US BioEnergy in connection with the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the VeraSun Shareholders
Agreement. To the Knowledge of VeraSun, no other state takeover statute or
similar statute or regulation is applicable to this Agreement, the VeraSun
Shareholders Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and the VeraSun Shareholders Agreement.

(p) _Ownership of US BioEnergy Stock._ Neither VeraSun nor Sub (nor any other
Subsidiary of VeraSun) beneficially owns, or has beneficially owned in the
past four years, any shares of US BioEnergy Common Stock or any other class or
series of US BioEnergys capital stock.

(q) _Brokers._ No broker, investment banker, financial advisor or other
person, other than Morgan Stanley and Co. Incorporated, the fees, commissions
and expenses of which will be paid by VeraSun, is entitled to any brokers,
finders, financial advisors or other similar fee or commission, or the
reimbursement of expenses, in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and the US BioEnergy Shareholders Agreement based upon
arrangements made by or on behalf of VeraSun. VeraSun has furnished to US
BioEnergy true and complete copies of all agreements under which any such
fees, commissions or expenses are payable and all indemnification and other
agreements related to the engagement of the persons to whom such fees,
commissions or expenses are payable.

(r) _Opinion of Financial Advisor._ VeraSun has received the opinion of Morgan
Stanley and Co. Incorporated, dated the date of this Agreement, to the effect
that, as of such date, the Exchange Ratio is fair to VeraSun from a financial
point of view, a signed copy of which has been or promptly will be delivered
to US BioEnergy for informational purposes only.

(s) _Interim Operations of Sub._ Sub was formed solely for the purpose of
engaging in the transactions contemplated hereby, has engaged in no
other business activities and has conducted its operations only as
contemplated hereby.

(t) _Intellectual Property._ (i) VeraSun and its Subsidiaries own, or are
validly licensed or otherwise have the right to use, all Intellectual Property
Rights which are material to the conduct of the business of VeraSun and its
Subsidiaries, except where the failure to own or license such Intellectual
Property Rights, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and is not
reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on VeraSun.

(ii) To the Knowledge of VeraSun, neither VeraSun nor any of its Subsidiaries
has infringed upon, misappropriated or come into conflict with any
Intellectual Property Rights of any other person, except for
such infringements, misappropriations or conflicts that, individually or in
the aggregate, have not had and are not reasonably likely to have a Material
Adverse Effect on VeraSun. Neither VeraSun nor any of its Subsidiaries has
received any written charge, complaint, claim, demand or notice alleging any
such infringement, misappropriation or other conflict (including any  



 

35  claim that VeraSun or any such Subsidiary must license or refrain from using
any Intellectual Property Rights or other proprietary information of any
other person) which has not been settled or otherwise fully resolved or is
not reasonably likely to result in material liability to VeraSun. To VeraSuns
Knowledge, no other person has infringed upon, misappropriated or otherwise
violated any Intellectual Property Rights of VeraSun or any of its
Subsidiaries, except for such infringements, misappropriations or other
conflicts that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and are not
reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on VeraSun.

(u) _Title to Properties._ (i) VeraSun or its Subsidiaries have good and
marketable title to the real property reflected in the financial statements
of VeraSun included in the VeraSun Filed SEC Documents as being owned by
VeraSun (whether wholly owned or with a joint venture partner) (the " _VeraSun
Owned Real Estate_ "), free and clear of any Liens, other than Permitted
Liens. With respect to each parcel of VeraSun Owned Real Estate, (1) neither
VeraSun nor any Subsidiary of VeraSun has leased or otherwise granted to
anyone the right to use or occupy such parcel of VeraSun Owned Real Estate or
any material portion thereof, (2) there are no outstanding options, rights of
first offer or rights of first refusal to purchase any such parcel of VeraSun
Owned Real Estate or any material portion thereof or interest therein, (3) as
of the date of this Agreement, all improvements and equipment on the VeraSun
Owned Real Estate are in good condition and repair in all material respects
and sufficient for the operation of VeraSuns or its Subsidiarys business
thereat, and (4) to VeraSuns Knowledge, there is no condemnation or other
proceeding in eminent domain, pending or threatened, affecting any parcel of
VeraSun Owned Real Estate or any material portion thereof or interest
therein. 

(ii) VeraSun has heretofore made available to US BioEnergy true and complete
copies of all leases under which VeraSun or any of its Subsidiaries holds any
material leasehold property, including any real property reflected in the
financial statements of US BioEnergy included in the VeraSun Filed SEC
Documents as being leased by VeraSun (such leases, the " _VeraSun
Material Leases_ "). Each of the VeraSun Material Leases is in full force and
effect and constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of VeraSun or the
applicable Subsidiary. Neither VeraSun nor any of its Subsidiaries is in
default under any VeraSun Material Lease, nor has any notice of default been
received by VeraSun or any of its Subsidiaries, except for any such default or
notice of default that, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and is
not reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect. There are no leases,
subleases, licenses, concessions or other agreements, written or oral,
pursuant to which VeraSun or any of its Subsidiaries has granted to any person
the right of use or occupancy of any material portion of any parcel of
property held by VeraSun or any of its Subsidiaries under a VeraSun Material
Lease.

BioEnergy Takeover Proposal that the Board of Directors of US BioEnergy
reasonably determines (after consultation with outside counsel and a financial
advisor of nationally recognized reputation) constitutes or is reasonably
likely to lead to a US BioEnergy Superior Proposal, and which US BioEnergy
Takeover Proposal was not solicited after the date of this Agreement and was
made after the date of this Agreement and did not otherwise result from a
breach of this Section 4.02(a), US BioEnergy may, subject to compliance with
Section 4.02(c), (x) furnish information with respect to US BioEnergy and its
Subsidiaries to the person making such US BioEnergy Takeover Proposal (and

less restrictive to such person than the confidentiality provisions of the
Confidentiality Agreement, _provided_ that all such information
has previously been provided to VeraSun or is provided to VeraSun prior to or
substantially concurrent with the time it is provided to such person, and (y)
participate in discussions or negotiations with the person making such US
BioEnergy Takeover Proposal (and its Representatives) regarding such US
BioEnergy Takeover Proposal.

The term " _US BioEnergy Takeover Proposal_ " means any inquiry, proposal or
offer from any person relating to, or that could reasonably be expected to
lead to, any direct or indirect acquisition or purchase, in one transaction or
a series of transactions, of assets (including equity securities of any
Subsidiary of US BioEnergy) or businesses that constitute 15% or more of the
revenues, net income or assets of US BioEnergy and its Subsidiaries, taken as
a whole, or 15% or more of any class of equity securities of US BioEnergy,
any tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result in any
person beneficially owning 15% or more of any class of equity securities of US
BioEnergy, or any merger, consolidation, business
combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution, joint venture,
binding share exchange or similar transaction involving US BioEnergy or any of
its Subsidiaries pursuant to which any person or the shareholders of any
person would own 15% or more of any class of equity securities of US
BioEnergy or of any resulting parent company of US BioEnergy (or of any
resulting entity in the case of a "parent to parent" transaction), in each
case other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

in a merger) or all or substantially all the assets of US BioEnergy, which the
Board of Directors of US BioEnergy reasonably determines (after consultation
with a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) to be (i) more
favorable to the shareholders of US BioEnergy from a financial point of view
than the Merger (taking into account all the terms and conditions of such
proposal and this Agreement (including any changes to the financial terms of
this Agreement proposed by VeraSun in response to such offer or otherwise))

financial, legal, regulatory and other aspects of such proposal.

constituting or related to, or that is intended to or could reasonably be
expected to lead to, any US BioEnergy Takeover Proposal (other than a
confidentiality agreement referred to in Section 4.02(a)) (a " _US BioEnergy
Acquisition Agreement_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior
to obtaining the US BioEnergy Shareholder Approval and subject to Section
4.02(c), the Board of Directors of US BioEnergy may, in response to a US

reasonably determines (after consultation with outside counsel and a
financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) constitutes a US
BioEnergy Superior Proposal and that was unsolicited and made after the date
of this Agreement and that did not otherwise result from a breach of this
Section 4.02, cause US BioEnergy to terminate this Agreement and concurrently
with or after such termination enter into a US BioEnergy Acquisition Agreement
in respect of such US BioEnergy Superior Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that US BioEnergy shall not be entitled to exercise its right to terminate
this Agreement pursuant hereto until after the fifth Business Day following

US BioEnergy intends to take such action and specifying the reasons therefor,
including the terms and conditions of any US BioEnergy Superior Proposal that
is the basis of the proposed action by the Board of Directors (it being
understood and agreed that any amendment to the financial terms or any other
material term of such US BioEnergy Superior Proposal shall require a new
Notice of US BioEnergy Superior Proposal and a  



 

45  new five Business Day period). In determining whether to cause US BioEnergy
to so terminate this Agreement, the Board of Directors of US BioEnergy shall
take into account any changes to the financial terms of this Agreement
proposed by VeraSun in response to a Notice of US BioEnergy Superior Proposal
or otherwise.

(c) In addition to the obligations of US BioEnergy set forth in paragraphs (a)
and (b) of this Section 4.02, US BioEnergy shall promptly advise VeraSun
orally and in writing of any US BioEnergy Takeover Proposal, the material
terms and conditions of any such US BioEnergy Takeover Proposal (including any
changes thereto) and the identity of the person making any such US BioEnergy
Takeover Proposal. US BioEnergy shall (x) keep VeraSun fully informed in all
material respects of the status and details (including any change to the terms
thereof) of any US BioEnergy Takeover Proposal and (y) provide to VeraSun as
soon as practicable after receipt or delivery thereof copies of
all correspondence and other written material sent or provided to US
BioEnergy or any of its Subsidiaries from any person that describes any of the
terms or conditions of any US BioEnergy Takeover Proposal.

(d) Nothing contained in this Section 4.02 shall prohibit US BioEnergy from
(x) taking and disclosing to its shareholders a position contemplated by Rule
14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act or a statement required under Rule 14a-9 under
the Exchange Act or (y) making any disclosure to the shareholders of US
BioEnergy that is required by applicable law; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that
in no event shall US BioEnergy or its Board of Directors or any committee
thereof take, or agree or resolve to take, any action prohibited by Section
4.02(b) (it being understood that any accurate disclosure of
factual information to the shareholders of US BioEnergy that is required to
be made to such shareholders under applicable federal securities laws shall
not be considered a modification prohibited by clause (i)(A) of Section
4.02(b)).

this Agreement, VeraSun shall not, nor shall it authorize or permit any of
its Subsidiaries to, nor shall it authorize or permit any of their respective
directors, officers or employees or any Representatives retained by it or any
of its Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly through another person, (i)
solicit, initiate or encourage, or take any other action designed to, or which

any VeraSun Takeover Proposal or (ii) enter into, continue or
otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or
furnish to any person any information with respect to, or otherwise cooperate
in any way with, any VeraSun Takeover Proposal. Without limiting the
foregoing, it is agreed that any violation of the restrictions set forth in
the preceding sentence by any Representative of VeraSun or any of its
Subsidiaries shall be a breach of this Section 4.03(a) by VeraSun. VeraSun
shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, immediately cease and cause to be
terminated all existing discussions or negotiations with any person conducted
heretofore with respect to any VeraSun Takeover Proposal and request the
prompt return or destruction of all confidential information
previously furnished. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to
obtaining the VeraSun Shareholder Approval, in response to a bona fide written
VeraSun Takeover Proposal that the Board of Directors of VeraSun reasonably
determines (after consultation with outside counsel and a financial advisor
of nationally  



 

46  recognized reputation) constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a
VeraSun Superior Proposal, and which VeraSun Takeover Proposal was not
solicited after the date of this Agreement and was made after the date of
this Agreement and did not otherwise result from a breach of this Section
4.03(a), VeraSun may, subject to compliance with Section 4.03(c), (x) furnish

the confidentiality provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement, _provided_
that all such information has previously been provided to US BioEnergy or is
provided to US BioEnergy prior to or substantially concurrent with the time it
is provided to such person, and (y) participate in discussions or
negotiations with the person making such VeraSun Takeover Proposal (and its
Representatives) regarding such VeraSun Takeover Proposal.

involving VeraSun or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to which any person or
the shareholders of any person would own 15% or more of any class of equity

a merger) or all or substantially all the assets of VeraSun, which the Board
of Directors of VeraSun reasonably determines (after consultation with a
financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) to be (i) more
favorable to the shareholders of VeraSun from a financial point of view than
the Merger (taking into account all the terms and conditions of such proposal
and this Agreement (including any changes to the financial terms of this
Agreement proposed by US BioEnergy in response to such offer or otherwise))
and (ii) reasonably capable of being completed, taking into account all
financial, legal, regulatory and other aspects of such proposal.

Directors or  



 

47  any such committee thereof of this Agreement, the Merger or the other

VeraSun or any of its Subsidiaries to execute or enter into, any letter of

agreement or other similar Contract constituting or related to, or that is
intended to or could reasonably be expected to lead to, any VeraSun Takeover
Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to in Section
4.03(a)) (a " _VeraSun Acquisition Agreement_ "). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, at any time prior to obtaining the VeraSun Shareholder Approval and
subject to Section 4.03(c), the Board of Directors of VeraSun may, in
response to a VeraSun Takeover Proposal that the Board of Directors of VeraSun
reasonably determines (after consultation with outside counsel and a financial
advisor of nationally recognized reputation) constitutes a VeraSun Superior
Proposal and that was unsolicited and made after the date of this Agreement
and that did not otherwise result from a breach of this Section 4.03, cause
VeraSun to terminate this Agreement and concurrently with or after such
termination enter into a VeraSun Acquisition Agreement in respect of such
VeraSun Superior Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that VeraSun shall not be
entitled to exercise its right to terminate this Agreement pursuant hereto
until after the fifth Business Day following US BioEnergys receipt of

action by the Board of Directors (it being understood and agreed that any

48  under the Exchange Act or a statement required under Rule 14a-9 under the

is required by applicable law; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall
VeraSun or its Board of Directors or any committee thereof take, or agree or
resolve to take, any action prohibited by Section 4.03(b) (it

such documents would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit

of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party
which discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties
hereto and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information

50 SECTION 5.02. _Access to Information; Confidentiality._ Subject to the
existing confidentiality agreement dated as of October 24, 2007 (the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ "), between VeraSun and US BioEnergy, upon
reasonable notice, each of VeraSun and US BioEnergy shall, and shall cause
each of its respective Subsidiaries to, afford to the other party and to the
officers, employees, accountants, counsel, financial advisors and other
representatives of such other party, reasonable access during normal business
hours during the period prior to the Effective Time to all their respective
properties, books, contracts, commitments, personnel and records and, during
such period, each of VeraSun and US BioEnergy shall, and shall cause each of
its respective Subsidiaries to, furnish promptly to the other party (a)
a copy of each report, schedule, registration statement and other document
filed or received by it during such period pursuant to the requirements of
Federal or state securities laws and (b) all other information concerning its
business, properties and personnel as such other party may reasonably
request. Neither VeraSun nor US BioEnergy shall be required to provide access
to or disclose information where such access or disclosure would contravene
any applicable law, rule, regulation, order or decree or would result in a
waiver of the attorney-client privilege or the protection afforded attorney
work-product. VeraSun and US BioEnergy shall use reasonable best efforts to
obtain from third parties any consents or waivers of confidentiality
restrictions with respect to any such information requested to be provided by
it. No review pursuant to this Section 5.02 shall have an effect for the
purpose of determining the accuracy of any representation or warranty given
by either party hereto to the other party hereto or the satisfaction of any
closing condition. Each of VeraSun and US BioEnergy will hold, and will cause
its respective officers, employees, accountants, counsel, financial advisors
and other representatives and Affiliates to hold, any nonpublic information
in accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.

SECTION 5.03. _Reasonable Best Efforts._ (a) Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of the parties agrees to use its
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to
do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in
doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make
effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Shareholders
Agreements, including using reasonable best efforts to accomplish the
following: (i) the taking of all reasonable acts necessary to cause the
conditions to Closing to be satisfied as promptly as practicable, (ii) the
obtaining of all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents and
approvals from Governmental Entities and the making of all necessary
registrations and filings (including filings with Governmental Entities,
if any) and the taking of all reasonable steps as may be necessary to obtain
an approval or waiver from, or to avoid an action or proceeding by any
Governmental Entity, (iii) the obtaining of all necessary consents, approvals
or waivers from third parties, (iv) the defending of any lawsuits or other
legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this
Agreement or any of the Shareholders Agreements or the consummation of the
Merger or the other transactions contemplated by, and to fully carry out the
purposes of, this Agreement and the Shareholders Agreements, including seeking
to have any stay or temporary restraining order entered by any court or other
Governmental Entity vacated or reversed and (v) the execution and delivery of
any  



 

51  additional instruments necessary to consummate the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by, and to fully carry out the purposes of, this
Agreement and the Shareholders Agreements.

(b) In connection with and without limiting the foregoing, each party shall
use its reasonable best efforts to furnish to each other all information
required for any filing, form, declaration, notification, registration and
notice, other than confidential or proprietary information not directly
related to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and to keep the
other party reasonably informed with respect to the status of each clearance,
approval or waiver sought from a Governmental Entity in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the material communications
between such party and such Governmental Entity. Each party shall without
limitation: (1) promptly notify the other of, and if in writing, furnish the
other with copies of (or, in the case of oral communications, advise the
other of) any communications from or with any Governmental Entity with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (2) permit the
other to review and discuss in advance, and consider in good faith the views
of the other in connection with, any proposed written or any oral
communication with any such Governmental Entity, (3) not participate in any
meeting or have any communication with any such Governmental Entity unless it
has given the other an opportunity to consult with it in advance and to the
extent permitted by such Governmental Entity gives the other the opportunity
to attend and participate therein, (4) furnish the other with copies of all
filings and communications between it and any such Governmental Entity with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (5) furnish
the other with such necessary information and reasonable assistance as the
other may reasonably request in connection with its preparation of
necessary filings or submissions of information to any such Governmental
Entity. Such materials and the information contained therein shall be given
only to the outside legal counsel of the other and will not be disclosed by
such outside counsel to employees, officers, or directors of their client
unless express permission is obtained in advance from the disclosing party or
its legal counsel.

(c) In connection with and without limiting the foregoing, US BioEnergy and
its Board of Directors and VeraSun and its Board of Directors shall each use
their respective reasonable best efforts to: (1) take all action necessary
to ensure that no state takeover statute or similar statute or regulation is
or becomes applicable to this Agreement or any of the Shareholders Agreements
or the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or any of the Shareholders Agreements and (2) if any state takeover statute
or similar statute becomes applicable to this Agreement, any of the
Shareholders Agreements, the Merger or any other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or any of the Shareholders Agreements, take all action
necessary to ensure that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and the Shareholders Agreements may be consummated as promptly
as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and the
Shareholders Agreements and otherwise to minimize the effect of such statute
or regulation on this Agreement, the Shareholders Agreements, the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Shareholders Agreements. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to require
VeraSun or US BioEnergy to agree to, or proffer to, divest or hold separate
any assets or  



 

52  any portion of any business of VeraSun, US BioEnergy or any of their
respective Subsidiaries that is material to the business, financial condition
or results of operations, of VeraSun, US BioEnergy and their respective
Subsidiaries (after giving effect to the Merger), taken as a whole. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of US BioEnergy and VeraSun
shall give the other party the opportunity to participate in the defense of
any litigation against US BioEnergy or VeraSun, as applicable, and/or its
directors relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Shareholders Agreements.

SECTION 5.04. _US BioEnergy Equity Plans and Awards._ (a) As of the Effective
Time, all outstanding US BioEnergy Stock Options, whether vested or unvested,
shall be converted into an option to acquire, on the same terms and conditions
as were applicable under such US BioEnergy Stock Option, the number of shares
of VeraSun Common Stock (rounded down to the nearest whole share) determined
by multiplying the number of shares of US BioEnergy Common Stock subject to
such US BioEnergy Stock Option by the Exchange Ratio, at a price per share of
VeraSun Common Stock equal to (A) the per share exercise price for the shares
of US BioEnergy Common Stock otherwise purchasable pursuant to such US
BioEnergy Stock Option divided by (B) the Exchange Ratio (each, as so
adjusted, an " _Adjusted Option_ "); _provided_ that such exercise price shall
be rounded up to the nearest whole cent.

(b) At the Effective Time, each US BioEnergy Restricted Stock Award then
outstanding shall be converted, on the same terms and conditions as were
applicable under such US BioEnergy Restricted Stock Award, into an award of
VeraSun Common Stock (rounded down to the nearest whole share) determined by
multiplying the number of shares of US BioEnergy Common Stock subject to such
US BioEnergy Restricted Stock Award by the Exchange Ratio (each, as so
adjusted, an " _Adjusted Restricted Stock Award_ ").

(c) The adjustments provided herein with respect to any US BioEnergy Stock
Options to which Section 421(a) of the Code applies shall be and are intended
to be effected in a manner which is consistent with Section 424(a) of the
Code.

(d) Prior to the Effective Time, VeraSun shall take all necessary actions for
the conversion of US BioEnergy Stock Options and US BioEnergy Restricted
Stock Awards, including the reservation, issuance and listing of VeraSun
Common Stock in a number at least equal to the number of shares of VeraSun
Common Stock that will be subject to the Adjusted Options and Adjusted
Restricted Stock Awards.

(e) Immediately following the Effective Time, VeraSun shall prepare and file
with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-8 (or another appropriate
form) registering a number of shares of VeraSun Common Stock equal to the
number of shares subject to the Adjusted Options and Adjusted Restricted Stock
Awards. Such registration statement shall be kept effective (and the current
status of the prospectus or prospectuses required thereby shall be maintained)
at least for so long as any Adjusted Options, Adjusted Restricted Stock Awards
or any unsettled awards granted under US BioEnergy Stock Plans after the
Effective Time may remain outstanding.



 

53 (f) The Board of Directors of US BioEnergy (or, if appropriate, any committee
administering the US BioEnergy ESPP) shall take such actions with respect to
the US BioEnergy ESPP as are necessary to provide that (i) participation in
the US BioEnergy ESPP shall be limited to those employees who were
participants on the date of this Agreement, (ii) such participants may not
increase their payroll deduction elections or purchase elections from those in
effect on the date of this Agreement, (iii) there shall not be any additional
"Grant Dates" (as defined in the US BioEnergy ESPP) or new offering periods
commencing following the date of this Agreement under the US BioEnergy ESPP,
(iv) each offering period in progress under the US BioEnergy ESPP on the date
of this Agreement (each, an " _ESPP Offering Period_ ") shall end immediately
prior to the Effective Time or, if earlier, on the last day of such ESPP
Offering Period, and each participant under the US BioEnergy ESPP possessing
purchase rights for such ESPP Offering Period shall be permitted to purchase,
to the extent such purchase is funded through payroll deductions made under
the US BioEnergy ESPP, the number of shares of US BioEnergy Common Stock
contemplated by such purchase rights and (v) following the purchase of US
BioEnergy Common Stock with respect to such ESPP Offering Periods, the US
BioEnergy ESPP shall terminate.

SECTION 5.05.  _Employee Benefit Plans; Existing Agreements._ (a) During the
one-year period following the Effective Time (the " _Transition Period_ "),
VeraSun shall cause the Surviving Corporation to either maintain the benefit
programs (other than equity-based arrangements) provided by US BioEnergy and
its Subsidiaries before the Effective Time or replace all or any such programs
with programs maintained for similarly situated employees of VeraSun;
_provided_ that the aggregate level of benefits (other than equity-based
arrangements) provided during the Transition Period shall be no less favorable
than the aggregate level of benefits (other than equity-based arrangements)
provided by US BioEnergy and its Subsidiaries before the Effective Time. To
the extent that any plan of VeraSun or any of its Affiliates (a " _VeraSun
Plan_ ") becomes applicable to any employee or former employee of US BioEnergy
or its Subsidiaries, VeraSun shall grant, or cause to be granted, to such
employees or former employees credit for their service with US BioEnergy and
its Subsidiaries (and any of their predecessors) for the purpose of
determining eligibility to participate and nonforfeitability of benefits
under such VeraSun Plan and for purposes of benefit accrual under vacation and
severance pay plans (but only to the extent such service was credited under
similar plans of US BioEnergy and its Subsidiaries and would not result in
a duplication of benefits).

(b) With respect to any welfare benefit plan of VeraSun or its Affiliates made
available to individuals who immediately prior to the Closing Date were
employees of US BioEnergy or any of its Subsidiaries, VeraSun shall, or shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, waive any waiting periods, pre-existing
condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements to the extent such
provisions were inapplicable immediately before such plan was made available
and provide that any expenses incurred on or before the date such plan was
made available by any such individual or such individuals covered dependents
shall be taken into account for purposes of satisfying applicable deductible,
coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket provisions.



 

54 SECTION 5.06. _Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance._ (a) VeraSun and
Sub agree that all rights to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities
for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (and rights
for advancement of expenses) now existing in favor of the current or former
directors or officers of US BioEnergy or its Subsidiaries as provided in
their respective certificates of incorporation or by-laws (or comparable
organizational documents) and any indemnification or other agreements of US
BioEnergy as in effect on the date of this Agreement shall be assumed by the
Surviving Corporation in the Merger, without further action, as of the
Effective Time and shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force
and effect in accordance with their terms.

(b) In the event that VeraSun or the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into
any other person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity
of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all its properties and assets to any person, then, and in each
such case, VeraSun shall cause proper provision to be made so that the
successors and assigns of VeraSun or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable,
assume the obligations of VeraSun or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable,
set forth in this Section 5.06 In the event that VeraSun takes any action to
materially impair the financial ability of the Surviving Corporation to
satisfy the obligations referred to in Section 5.06, VeraSun will either
guarantee such obligations or take such other action to insure that the
ability of the Surviving Corporation to satisfy such obligations will not be
diminished in any material respect.

(c) For six years from and after the Effective Time, VeraSun shall maintain
in effect US BioEnergys current directors and officers liability insurance
covering acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time covering each
person currently covered by US BioEnergys directors and officers liability
insurance policy on terms with respect to such coverage and amounts no less
favorable than those of such policy in effect on the date of this Agreement; 
_provided_ that VeraSun may substitute therefor policies of VeraSun or its
subsidiaries containing terms with respect to coverage and amount no less
favorable to such directors or officers; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no
event shall VeraSun be required to pay annual premiums for insurance under
this Section 5.06(c) in excess of 250% of the amount of the annual premiums
paid by US BioEnergy in 2006 as set forth in Section 5.06(c) of the US
BioEnergy Disclosure Schedule; _provided_ that VeraSun shall nevertheless be
obligated to provide such coverage as may be obtained for such 250% amount.
Alternatively, at US BioEnergys option, prior to the Effective Time, US
BioEnergy may purchase a six-year prepaid "tail" policy on terms and
conditions providing substantially equivalent benefits as US BioEnergys
current directors and officers liability insurance with respect to matters
arising on or before the Effective Time, covering without limitation the
transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event
shall any such policy require payment of annual premiums for such insurance in
excess of 250% of the amount of the annual premiums paid by US BioEnergy in
2006 as set forth in Section 5.06(c) of the US BioEnergy Disclosure Schedule.
If such "tail" prepaid policy has been obtained in accordance with this
Section 5.06(c), VeraSun shall cause such policy to be maintained in full
force and effect, for its full term, and cause all obligations thereunder to
be honored by it and the Surviving Corporation, and no other party shall have
any further obligation to purchase or pay for insurance hereunder.



 

55 (d) The provisions of this Section 5.06 (i) are intended to be for the benefit
of, and will be enforceable by, each indemnified party, his or her heirs and
his or her representatives and (ii) are in addition to, and not in
substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any
such person may have by contract or otherwise. VeraSun will pay (as incurred)
all out-of-pocket expenses, including reasonable fees and expenses of counsel,
that a current or former director or officer of US BioEnergy may incur in
enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided for in this Section
5.06.

SECTION 5.07. _Fees and Expenses._ (a) Except as provided in this Section
5.07, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Merger, this
Agreement, the Shareholders Agreements and the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby shall be paid by the party incurring such fees or expenses,
whether or not the Merger is consummated, except that each of VeraSun and US
BioEnergy shall bear and pay one-half of (1) the costs and expenses incurred
in connection with the filing, printing and mailing of the Form S-4 and the
Joint Proxy Statement (including SEC filing fees) and (2) the filing fees for
the premerger notification and report forms under the HSR Act.

BioEnergy Shareholder Approval, a US BioEnergy Takeover Proposal shall have
been made to US BioEnergy or shall have been made directly to the
shareholders of US BioEnergy generally or shall have otherwise become publicly
known or any person shall have publicly announced an intention (whether or not
conditional) to make a US BioEnergy Takeover Proposal, (B) thereafter this
Agreement is terminated by either VeraSun or US BioEnergy pursuant to Section
7.01(b)(i) (but only if a vote to obtain the US BioEnergy Shareholder Approval
or the US BioEnergy Shareholders Meeting has not been held) or Section
7.01(b)(iii) and (C) within 12 months after such termination, US BioEnergy
enters into a definitive Contract to consummate, or consummates, the

payment required by clause (i) above, the date of termination of this
Agreement and (y) in the case of a payment required by clause (ii) above, the
date of the first to occur of the events referred to in clause (ii)(C). For
purposes of clause (ii)(C) of the immediately preceding sentence only, the
term "US BioEnergy Takeover Proposal" shall have the meaning assigned to such
term in Section 4.02(a) except that all references to "15%" therein shall be
deemed to be references to "35%".

(c) In the event that (i) this Agreement is terminated by VeraSun pursuant to
Section 7.01(h) or (ii) (A) prior to the obtaining of the VeraSun Shareholder
Approval, a VeraSun Takeover Proposal shall have been made to VeraSun or shall
have been made directly to the shareholders of VeraSun generally or shall have
otherwise become publicly known or any person shall have publicly announced
an intention (whether or not  



 

56  conditional) to make a VeraSun Takeover Proposal, (B) thereafter this
Agreement is terminated by either VeraSun or US BioEnergy pursuant to Section
7.01(b)(i) (but only if a vote to obtain the VeraSun Shareholder Approval or
the VeraSun Shareholders Meeting has not been held) or Section 7.01(b)(ii)

Agreement, and that, without these agreements, VeraSun would not enter into
this Agreement; accordingly, if US BioEnergy fails promptly to pay the amount
due pursuant to Section 5.07(b), and, in order to obtain such payment, VeraSun

SECTION 5.08. _Public Announcements._ Promptly after the date of this
Agreement, VeraSun and US BioEnergy will develop a joint communications plan
and, except as required by law, each party hereto shall use its reasonable
best efforts to ensure that all press releases and other public statements

which they are entitled at law or in equity. In addition, each of the parties
irrevocably agrees that any legal action or proceeding arising out of or
related to this Agreement or for recognition and enforcement of any judgment
in respect hereof brought by any other party hereto or its successors or
assigns may be brought and determined in the United States District Court for
the Southern District of New York, or if such court does not have subject
matter jurisdiction, the state courts of New York located in New York County,
and each of the parties hereby irrevocably submits to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts for itself and with respect to its
property, unconditionally, with regard to any such action or proceeding
arising out of or relating to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby (and agrees not to commence any action, suit or proceeding relating
thereto except in such courts). Each of the parties agrees further to accept
service of process in any manner permitted by such court. Each of the parties
hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, and agrees not to assert, by
way of motion or as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any action or
proceeding arising out of or related to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, (a) any claim that it is not personally subject to the
jurisdiction of the above-named court for any reason other than the failure
lawfully to serve process, (b) that it or its property is exempt or immune
from jurisdiction of such court or from any legal process commenced in such
court (whether through service of notice, attachment prior to
judgment, attachment in aid  



 

69  of execution of judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise) and (c) to the
fullest extent permitted by law, that (i) the suit, action or proceeding in
such court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (ii) the venue of such suit,
action or proceeding is improper, or (iii) this Agreement, or the subject
matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by such court. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, each of the parties hereto agrees that each of the other parties
shall have the right to bring any action or proceeding for enforcement of a
judgment entered by the United States District Court for the Southern District
of New York or if such court does not have subject matter jurisdiction, the
state courts of New York located in New York County, or in any other court or
jurisdiction.

SECTION 8.10. _Waiver of Jury Trial._ Each party hereto hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any
right it may have to a trial by jury in respect of any suit, action or other
proceeding arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby. Each party hereto (a) certifies that no representative, agent or
attorney of any other party has represented, expressly or otherwise,
that such party would not, in the event of any action, suit or proceeding,
seek to enforce the foregoing waiver and (b) acknowledges that it and the
other parties hereto have been induced to enter into this Agreement, by, among
other things, the mutual waiver and certifications in this Section 8.10.

SECTION 8.11. _Severability._ If any term or other provision of
this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule
of law or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement
shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect. Upon such determination
that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being
enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this
Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as
possible to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law in an acceptable
manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to
the extent possible.

SECTION 8.12. _Absence of Presumption._ The parties hereto have participated
jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement and, in the event of
ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement
shall be construed as if drafted jointly by such parties and no presumption
or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of
the authorship of any of the provisions of this Agreement.
