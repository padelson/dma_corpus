then, at Parents option and in Parents sole discretion, the Merger
Consideration in respect of such shares shall either be (i) paid to the

Agent** ") in the Merger.

Company Common Stock.  Any cash deposited with the Paying Agent shall

3      
   



  

(c) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall
cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record (as of the Effective
Time) of a certificate or certificates (the " **Certificates** ") which
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock whose shares were converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 1.6(a), (i) a letter of
transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates to the Paying Agent and shall be in such form and have such
other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for
use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for payment of
the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of Certificates for cancellation to
the Paying Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by
Parent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly
executed in accordance with the instructions thereto and such other documents
as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such
Certificates shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger
Consideration (after taking into account all Certificates surrendered by such
holder) to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 1.6(a), and the
Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled except as set forth
in Section 1.8. Until so surrendered, outstanding Certificates will be
deemed from and after the Effective Time, for all corporate purposes, to
evidence the ownership of the right to receive the Merger Consideration
attributable to such.

  

(d) _Transfers of Ownership_. If any portion of the Merger Consideration is
to be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered
Certificates are registered, it will be a condition of payment thereof that
the Certificates so surrendered will be properly endorsed and otherwise in
proper form for transfer and that the persons requesting such payment will
have paid to Parent or any agent designated by it any transfer or other Taxes
(as defined in Section 2.7) required by reason of the payment of the Merger
Consideration in any name other than that of the registered holder of the
Certificates surrendered, or established to the satisfaction of Parent or any
agent designated by it that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

  

(e) _Required Withholding_. Each of the Paying Agent and the
Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
consideration payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement to
any holder or former holder of Company Common Stock such amounts as may be
required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under the Internal Revenue Code
of 1986, as amended (the " **Code** ") or under any provision of state,
local or foreign Tax law or under any other applicable Legal Requirement. To
the extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld, the amount of
such consideration shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as
having been paid to the person to whom such consideration would otherwise
have been paid.

  

(f) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section
1.7, none of the Paying Agent, the Surviving Corporation or any party hereto
shall be liable to a holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any amount
properly paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar law.

  

(g) _Investment of Paying Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest the
Merger Fund as directed by Parent on a daily basis; provided that no such
investment or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable or the timing of
payments to Company stockholders pursuant to

  

4      
   



  

this Article I. Any interest and other income resulting from such investment
shall become a part of the Merger Fund, and any amounts in excess of the
amounts payable to Company stockholders pursuant to this Article I shall
promptly be paid to Parent.

  

(h) _Termination of Merger Fund_. Any portion of the Merger Fund which
remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates six (6) months after the
Effective Time shall, at the request on the instruction of the Surviving
Corporation, be delivered to the Surviving Corporation, and any holders of
the Certificates who have not surrendered such Certificates in compliance
with this Section 1.7 shall after such delivery to the Surviving Corporation
look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of the Merger
Consideration pursuant to Section 1.6(a). Any such portion of the Merger
Fund remaining unclaimed by holders of shares of Company Common Stock
immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or
become property of any Governmental Entity shall, to the extent permitted
by law, become the property of Parent free and clear of any claims or
interest of any person previously entitled thereto.

  

1.8 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding Section 1.6, Shares outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who has not
voted in favor of the Merger or consented thereto in writing and who has
demanded appraisal for such Shares in accordance with the DGCL ("
**Dissenting Shares** ") shall not be converted into a right to receive the
Merger Consideration, unless such holder fails to perfect or withdraws or
otherwise loses its rights to appraisal or it is determined that such holder
does not have appraisal rights in accordance with the DGCL. If after the
Effective Time such holder fails to perfect or withdraws or loses its right
to appraisal, or if it is determined that such holder does not have an
appraisal right, such Shares shall be treated as if they had been converted
as of the Effective Time into the right to receive in exchange for each Share
the Merger Consideration. The Company shall give Parent and Merger Sub prompt
notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of Shares, and
Parent and Merger Sub shall have the right to participate in all negotiations
and proceedings with respect to such demands except as required by applicable
law. The Company shall not, except with prior written consent of Parent and
Merger Sub, make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle,
any such demands.

  

1.9 _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. All cash paid
upon the surrender for payment of shares of Company Common Stock
in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been issued in
full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Common
Stock, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the records
of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock which were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.  If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for
any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article
I.

  

1.10 _Lost,Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact
by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and,
if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a
bond, in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Paying Agent shall pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate,

  

5      
   



  

the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the Shares represented by
such Certificate, as contemplated by this Article I.

  

1.11 _Further Action_. At and after the Effective Time, the officers and
directors of Parent and the Surviving Corporation will be authorized to
execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company and Merger Sub,
any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to take and do, in
the name and on behalf of the Company and Merger Sub, any other actions and
things to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the
Surviving Corporation any and all right, title and interest in, to and under
any of the rights, properties or assets acquired or to be acquired by the

it shall use all reasonable efforts to cause its and its
subsidiaries employees, agents and representatives (including any investment
banker, attorney or accountant retained by it or any of its subsidiaries) not
to (and shall not authorize any of them to) directly or indirectly: (i)
solicit, initiate, intentionally encourage, take any action to, facilitate
or intentionally induce any inquiry with respect to, or the making,
submission or announcement of, any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) enter into or
participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any
person any nonpublic information (or afford access to the business,
properties, assets, books or records of the Company or its subsidiaries) with

contained in Section 4.1(x), grant any waiver or release under any standstill
or similar agreement with respect to any equity securities of the Company or
its subsidiaries. The Company and its subsidiaries will each immediately
cease any and all existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any
third parties conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal.

  

(b) _Notification of Unsolicited Acquisition Proposals_.

  

(i) As promptly as practicable (and in any event within 24 hours) after
receipt of any Acquisition Proposal or any expression by any person of an
intention to make an Acquisition Proposal or any request for nonpublic
information or inquiry which it reasonably believes may lead to an
Acquisition Proposal or for a waiver or release under any "standstill" or
similar agreement, the Company shall provide Parent with oral and written
notice of the material terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal,
indication, request or inquiry, and the identity of the person or group
making any such Acquisition Proposal, indication, request or inquiry. The
Company shall provide Parent as promptly as practicable notice (which may be
oral) setting forth all such information as is reasonably necessary to keep
Parent informed on a current basis of the status and details (including
material amendments or proposed material amendments) of any such Acquisition
Proposal, indication, request or inquiry.

  

36      
   



  

(ii) The Company shall provide Parent with forty-eight (48) hours prior
notice (or such lesser prior notice as is provided to the members of its
Board of Directors) of any meeting of its Board of Directors at which its
Board of Directors is reasonably expected to consider any Acquisition
Proposal.

  

(c) _Superior Offers_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
Section 4.2(a), if the Company receives an unsolicited, bona fide written
Acquisition Proposal that includes an indication of value in excess of the
Merger Consideration and that the Company Board of Directors has in good
faith concluded (following the receipt of the advice of its outside legal
counsel and its financial advisor), is from a person reasonably capable of
consummating such Acquisition Proposal and is or is reasonably likely
to result in, a Superior Offer, it may then take the following actions:

  

(i) Furnish nonpublic information to the third party making such Acquisition
Proposal, request or inquiry provided that (A) (1) concurrently with
furnishing any such nonpublic information to such party, it gives Parent
notice of its intention to furnish nonpublic information and (2) it receives
from the third party an executed confidentiality agreement containing
customary limitations on the use and disclosure of all nonpublic written and
oral information furnished to such third party on its behalf, the terms of
which (x) shall not include any provision calling for any exclusive right to
negotiate with such party or having the effect of prohibiting the Company
from satisfying its obligations hereunder, and (y) shall, in all material
respects, be no less favorable to the Company than the Confidentiality
Agreement between the Company and Parent, dated as of November 2002, as
amended on December 19, 2002 (the " **Confidentiality Agreement** ") and (B)
contemporaneously with furnishing any such nonpublic information to such
third party, it furnishes such nonpublic information to Parent (to the extent
such nonpublic information has not been previously so furnished); and

  

(ii) Engage in negotiations with the third party with respect to the
Acquisition Proposal, provided that concurrently with entering into
negotiations with such third party, it gives Parent notice of its intention
to enter into negotiations with such third party.

  

(d) _Changes of Recommendation_. In response to the receipt of a
Superior Offer, the Company Board of Directors may withhold, withdraw, amend
or modify its recommendation in favor of this Agreement and the Merger, and,
in the case of a Superior Offer that is a tender or exchange offer made
directly to its stockholders, may recommend that its stockholders accept the
tender or exchange offer (any of the foregoing actions, whether by the
Company Board of Directors or a committee thereof, a " **Change
of Recommendation** "), if all of the following conditions in clauses (i)
through (iv) are met:

  

(i) The Company Stockholders Meeting has not occurred;

  

(ii) The Company delivers to Parent, no later than concurrently with the
Change of Recommendation, written notice (a " **Change of Recommendation
Notice** ") of the Change of Recommendation, which notice shall state the
material terms and conditions of the Superior Offer and the identity of the
person or group making the Superior Offer;

  

37      
   



  

(iii) The Company Board of Directors has concluded in good faith, after
receipt of advice of its outside legal counsel, that, in light of such
Superior Offer, the failure of the Company Board of Directors to effect a
Change of Recommendation is reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its
fiduciary obligations to its stockholders under applicable law; and

  

(iv) The Company shall not have breached in any material respect any of the
restrictions set forth in this Section 4.2.

  

For a period of five (5) business days after delivering the Change
of Recommendation Notice, the Company shall provide Parent a
reasonable opportunity to make adjustments in the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, and negotiate in good faith with respect thereto.

  



  

(e) _Continuing Obligation to Call, Hold and Convene Company Stockholders 
Meeting; No Other Vote_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, unless this Agreement shall be terminated in accordance
with its terms, (i) the Company shall be obligated to call, give notice of,
convene and hold the Company Stockholders Meeting regardless of the
commencement, disclosure, announcement or submission to it of any Acquisition
Proposal, or of any Change of Recommendation, and (ii) the Company shall not
submit to the vote of its stockholders any Acquisition Proposal, or propose
to do so.

  

(f) _Compliance with Tender Offer Rules_. Nothing contained in
this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or its Board of Directors from
taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rules
14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act.

  

(g) _Certain Definitions_. For purposes of this Agreement, the following
terms shall have the following meanings:

  

(i) " **Acquisition Proposal** " shall mean any offer or proposal (whether or
not subject to due diligence), relating to any transaction or series of
related transactions involving: (A) any acquisition by any person or "
**group** " (as defined under Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules
and regulations thereunder) of more than a fifteen percent (15%) interest in
the total outstanding voting securities of the Company or any tender offer
or exchange offer that if consummated would result in any person or
group beneficially owning fifteen percent (15%) or more of the total
outstanding voting securities of the Company or any merger, consolidation,
business combination or similar transaction involving the Company or, (B) any
sale, lease (other than in the ordinary course of business), exchange,
transfer, license (other than in the ordinary course of business),
acquisition by a third party of more than fifteen percent (15%) of the assets
of the Company (including its subsidiaries taken as a whole) ( _provided_ ,
_however_ , the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby shall not be
deemed an Acquisition Proposal in any case); and

  

(ii) " **Superior Offer** " shall mean an unsolicited, bona fide written
offer made by a third party to acquire, directly or indirectly, pursuant to a
tender offer, exchange offer, merger, consolidation or other business
combination, all or substantially all of the assets of the Company or a
majority of the total outstanding voting securities of the Company on
terms that the Company Board of Directors reasonably determined, in good
faith (following the receipt of

  

38      
   



  

advice of its outside legal counsel and its financial adviser), (x) provides
consideration to stockholders of the Company that is more favorable, from a
financial point of view, than the Merger Consideration, (y) is not subject to

(b) _Reasonable Efforts_. Subject to the express provisions of Section 4.2
and Section 5.2 hereof and upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth herein, each of the parties agrees to use all reasonable efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and
to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things
necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most
expeditious manner practicable, the Merger and the transactions contemplated
hereby, including using all reasonable efforts to accomplish the following:
(i) the taking of all reasonable acts necessary to cause the conditions
precedent set forth in Article VI to be satisfied, (ii) the obtaining of all
necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents, approvals, orders and
authorizations from Governmental Entities and the making of all necessary
registrations, declarations and filings (including registrations,
declarations and filings with Governmental Entities, if any) and the taking
of all reasonable steps as may be necessary to avoid any suit, claim, action,
investigation or proceeding by any Governmental Entity, (iii) the obtaining
of all Necessary Consents, and (iv) the execution or delivery of any
additional instruments necessary to consummate the

  

41      
   



  

transactions and to carry out fully the purposes of, this Agreement. In
connection with and without limiting the foregoing, the Company and its Board
of Directors shall, if any takeover statute or similar Legal Requirement is
or becomes applicable to the Merger, this Agreement or any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, use all reasonable efforts
to ensure that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the
terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of
such Legal Requirement on the Merger, this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby.

  

(c) _Limitation on Divestiture and Litigation_. Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, nothing contained in this Agreement shall be
deemed to require Parent or the Company or any subsidiary or
affiliate thereof to (i) litigate or agree to litigate against any
Governmental Entity or (ii) take or agree to take any Action of Divestiture
(as defined below). For purposes of this Agreement, an " **Action of
Divestiture** " shall mean (i) making proposals, executing or carrying out
agreements or submitting to Legal Requirements providing for the license,
sale or other disposition or holding separate (through the establishment of a
trust or otherwise) of any assets or categories of assets that are material
to Parent, the Company or any of their respective subsidiaries or the holding
separate of Company capital stock or imposing or seeking to impose any
limitation on the ability of Parent, the Company or any of their respective
subsidiaries, to conduct their respective businesses or own such assets or to
acquire, hold or exercise full rights of ownership of the Companys business
or (ii) otherwise taking any step to avoid or eliminate any impediment
which may be asserted under any Legal Requirement governing competition,
monopolies or restrictive trade practices.

  

5.6 _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company shall give prompt notice
to Parent and Merger Sub of any representation or warranty made by it
contained in this Agreement becoming untrue or inaccurate, or any failure of
the Company to comply with or satisfy in any respect any covenant, condition
or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement, in
each case, such that the conditions set forth in Section 6.3(a) or 6.3(b)
would not be satisfied; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such notification
shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the
Company or the conditions to the obligations of the Parent or Merger Sub
under this Agreement.  Parent and Merger Sub shall give prompt notice to the
Company of any representation or warranty made by either of them contained in
this Agreement becoming untrue or inaccurate, or any failure of either of
Parent or Merger Sub to comply with or satisfy in any respect any covenant,
condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under this
Agreement, in each case, such that the conditions set forth in Section 6.2(a)
or 6.2(b) would not be satisfied; provided, however, that no such
notification shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants
or agreements of Parent or Merger Sub or the conditions to the obligations of
the Company under this Agreement.

  

5.7 _Company Option Plans; Employee Stock Purchase Plan_.

  

(a) Unless Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agree otherwise, Parent, Merger
Sub and the Company shall take all actions necessary to provide that, each
outstanding option to purchase shares of Company Common Stock (each, a "
**Company Option** ," and collectively, the " **Company Options** ") granted
under the Company Option Plans and Non-Plan Option Agreements that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not

  

42      
   



  

then exercisable or vested, shall be assumed by Parent as of the Effective
Time. For purposes of the foregoing, the " **Company Option Plans** "
shall mean those plans set forth on Section 5.7 of the Company
Disclosure Letter. As of the Effective Time, each such Company Option shall
cease to represent a right to acquire shares of Company Common Stock and
shall be converted automatically into an option to purchase shares of Parent
Common Stock in an amount, at an exercise price and subject to such terms and
conditions determined as provided below. Each Company Option so assumed by
Parent shall be subject to, and exercisable and vested upon, the same terms
and conditions as under the applicable Company Option Plan or Non-Plan Option
Agreement and the applicable option and other related agreements issued
thereunder, except that each assumed Company Option shall be exercisable for,
and represent the right to acquire, shares of Parent Common Stock, the number
of shares of Parent Common Stock (rounded down to the nearest whole share)
determined by multiplying the number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to such Company Option by a fraction (the " **Option Exchange Ratio**
"), the numerator of which is the Merger Consideration and the denominator of
which is the average closing price of Parent Common Stock on the Nasdaq
National Market over the ten trading days immediately preceding (but not
including) the date on which the Effective Time occurs, at an exercise price
per share of Parent Common Stock (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal
to (A) the per share exercise price for the shares of Company Common Stock
otherwise purchasable pursuant to such Company Option divided by (B) the
Option Exchange Ratio. If and to the extent necessary or required by the terms
of the Company Option Plans or Non-Plan Option Agreement or pursuant to the
terms of any Company Option granted thereunder, the Company shall use all
reasonable efforts to obtain the consent of each holder of outstanding
Company Options to effectuate the foregoing assumption of such Company
Options. The Company agrees that each of the Company Option Plans or Non-Plan
Option Agreement and related agreements shall be amended, to the extent
necessary, to reflect the transactions contemplated herein. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Board of Directors of Parent, or an appropriate committee
of non-employee directors thereof, shall adopt a resolution consistent with
the interpretative guidance of the SEC so that the assumption of the Company
Options held by Company Insiders (as defined below) shall be an exempt
transaction for purposes of Section 16 of the 1934 Act by any officer or
director of Company who may become a covered person of Parent for purposes of
Section 16 of the 1934 Act (a " **Company Insider** ").

  

(b) The conversion of Company Options provided for in Section 5.7(a), with
respect to any options which are intended to be "incentive stock options" (as
defined in Section 422 of the Code) shall be effected in a manner consistent
with Section 424(a) of the Code.

  

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, (i) the Company Board of Directors shall
pursuant to Section 19 of the Companys 1998 Employee Stock Purchase Plan
(the " **ESPP** "), shorten the Purchase Periods (as defined in the ESPP)
then in progress by setting a new Exercise Date (as defined in the ESPP) that
is prior to the Effective Time (the " **New Exercise Date** ") and notifying
all participants in the ESPP of such New Exercise Date at least ten (10)
business days prior to the New Exercise Date, and each participants option
under the ESPP shall be exercised automatically on the New Exercise Date,
unless prior to such date such participant has withdrawn from the Offering
Period, and any Offering Periods (as defined in the ESPP) then in progress
shall end on the New Exercise Date, and (ii) the Company Board of Directors
shall take all steps necessary to terminate the ESPP prior to the Effective
Time.

  

43      
   



  

(d) With respect to matters described in Section 5.7, the Company will use
all reasonable efforts to consult with Parent (and consider in good faith the
advice of Parent) prior to sending any notices or other communication
materials to its employees.

  

(e) Parent shall provide, or cause its Subsidiaries or the Surviving
Corporation, as applicable, to provide each person who is employed by Parent,
its subsidiaries or the Surviving Corporation on or after the Effective Time,
and who was employed by the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time,
employee benefits (other than equity-based benefits) that are substantially
comparable in the aggregate to the employee benefits provided to similarly-
situated active employees of Parent, its Subsidiaries or the Surviving
Corporation.

  

(f) As of the Effective Time, Parent will, or will cause the Surviving
Corporation to, honor the severance payments and benefits payable under (i)
the plans and agreements set forth in Section 2.12(c) of the Company
Disclosure Letter with respect to employees of the Company as of the date
hereof and on the terms of such plans and agreements as in effect on the date
hereof, or (ii) such severance plans and agreements that may be entered into
before the Effective Time with the written consent of Parent; _provided_ that
nothing herein shall preclude Parent from modifying any such plan or
agreement to the extent consistent with this Section 5.7(f) or with the
consent of the participant.  Parent acknowledges and agrees that the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will constitute the
"change of control" of the Company for purposes of the plans and agreements
set forth in Section 2.12(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter, as applicable,
and agrees to honor the provisions under such plans and agreements relating
to a change of control.

  

5.8 _Form S-8_. Parent agrees to file with the SEC as soon as practicable but
no later than 20 days following the Effective Time a registration statement
on Form S-8 under the Securities Act covering, to the extent applicable, the
shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued upon the exercise of Company
Options assumed by Parent.  Parent agrees to cause shares of Parent Common
Stock to be issued upon exercise of Company Options assumed by Parent to be
authorized for listing on the national securities exchange on which the
Parent Common Stock is listed.

  

5.9 _Company Rights Agreement_. Except as set forth in Section 2.16, the
Company shall not redeem the Company Rights or amend or modify (including by
delay of the "Distribution Date" thereunder) or terminate the Company Rights
Agreement prior to the Effective Time unless, and only to the extent that it
is required to do so by order of a court of competent jurisdiction.

  

5.10 _Subsequent Financial Statements_. To the extent reasonably
practicable, the Company shall consult with Parent prior to making publicly
available its financial results for any period after the date of this
Agreement and prior to filing any Company SEC Documents after the date of
this Agreement, it being understood that Parent shall have no liability
by reason of such consultation.

  

5.11 _Conveyance Taxes_. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall cooperate in
the preparation, execution and filing of all returns, questionnaires,
applications or other documents regarding any real property transfer or
gains, sales, use, transfer, value added, stock transfer or

  

44      
   



  

stamp taxes, any transfer, recording, registration or other fees or any
similar taxes which become payable in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement that are required or permitted to be filed on
or before the Effective Time.

  

5.12 _Indemnification_.

  

(a) For a period of 6 years after the Effective Time, Parent will or will
cause the Surviving Corporation to fulfill and honor in all respects the
obligations of Company pursuant to any indemnification agreements between the
Company and its directors and officers as of the Effective Time (the "
**Indemnified Parties** ") and any indemnification provisions under the
Companys certificate of incorporation or bylaws as in effect on the date
hereof. The certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the surviving
Corporation will contain provisions with respect to exculpation and
indemnification that are at least as favorable to the Indemnified Parties as
those contained in the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Company
as in effect on the date hereof, which provisions will not be amended,
repealed or otherwise modified for a period of 6 years from the Effective
Time in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of
individuals who, immediately prior to the Effective Time, were directors or
officers of the Company, unless such modification is required by law;
_provided_ that the Surviving Corporation may reincorporate in another U.S.
state that prohibits indemnification on terms as favorable as Delawares so
long as the Surviving Corporation provides for the maximum allowable
indemnification in its certificate of incorporation and bylaws and so long as
Parent provides supplemental contractual indemnification such that the
indemnification provided by such certificate of incorporation and bylaws and
such contractual provisions is equivalent to the level of indemnification
provided to such directors and officers as of the date of this Agreement.

  

(b) For a period of 6 years after the Effective Time, Parent will or will
cause the Surviving Corporation to use its commercially reasonable efforts to
maintain in effect, if available, directors and officers liability
insurance covering those persons who are currently covered by Companys
directors and officers liability insurance policy on terms comparable to
those applicable to the current directors and officers of Company; _provided_
, _however_ , that in no event will the Surviving Corporation be required to
expend in excess of 150% of the annual premium currently paid by Company for
such coverage (the " **Current Annual Premium Amount** ") (but shall in any
event provide and maintain such coverage as is available for such 150% of
such annual premium). The Current Annual Premium Amount is set forth in
Section 5.12 of the Company Disclosure Letter.

  

(c) This Section 5.12 shall survive the consummation of the Merger, is
intended to benefit the Company, the Surviving Corporation and each
indemnified party, shall be binding on all successors and assigns of the
Surviving Corporation and Parent, and shall be enforceable by the Indemnified
Parties.

  

5.13 _Silicon Valley Bank Facility_. Upon the request of Parent, the
Company agrees to discuss in good faith with Parent the potential repayment
of obligations pursuant to the Companys credit agreement with Silicon
Valley Bank, and the discharge of the security interests and liens
associated therewith, prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ that (i) the
Company shall not be required to take any action that in its judgment would
impair its liquidity or its ability to

  

45      
   



  

operate its business and (ii) Parent will be responsible for all out-of-
pocket expenses associated with any such repayment by the Company.

(c) by either the Company or Parent if a Governmental Entity shall have
issued an order, decree or ruling or taken any other action (including the
failure to have taken an action), in any case having the effect of
permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the Merger, which
order, decree, ruling or other action is final and nonappealable;

  

(d) by either the Company or Parent if the required approval of the

adjournment thereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that the right to terminate
this Agreement under this Section 7.1(d) shall not be available to the
Company where the failure to obtain the Company stockholder approval shall

(f) by the Company, upon a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement on the part of Parent set forth in this Agreement, or if any
representation or warranty of Parent shall have become untrue, in either case
such that the conditions set forth in Section 6.2(a) or Section 6.2(b) would
not be satisfied as of the time of such breach or as of the time such
representation or warranty shall have become untrue, _provided_ , that if
such inaccuracy in Parents representations and warranties or breach by
Parent is curable by Parent prior to the End Date through the exercise of
reasonable efforts, then the Company may not terminate this Agreement under
this Section 7.1(f) prior to 30 days following the receipt of written notice
from

  

48      
   



  

the Company to Parent of such breach, provided that Parent continues to

case such that the conditions set forth in Section 6.3(a) or Section 6.3(b)
would not be satisfied as of the time of such breach or as of the time such
representation or warranty shall have become untrue, _provided_ , that if
such inaccuracy in the Companys representations and warranties or breach by
the Company is curable by the Company prior to the End Date through the
exercise of reasonable efforts, then Parent may not terminate this Agreement

notice from Parent to the Company of such breach, provided that the Company
continues to exercise all reasonable efforts to cure such breach through such
30 day period (it being understood that Parent may not terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this paragraph (g) if it shall have materially breached
this Agreement or if such breach by the Company is cured within such 30 day
period); and

  

(h) by the Company, if, prior to the adoption and approval of this Agreement
and approval of the Merger by the required vote of the stockholders of the
Company, the Company Board of Directors has provided written notice to Parent
that the Company intends to enter into a binding written agreement for a
Superior Offer (with such termination becoming effective upon the Company
entering into such binding written agreement); provided, however, that (i)
the Company shall have complied with Section 4.2 in all material respects;
(ii) the Company shall have delivered to Parent a Change in Recommendation
Notice with respect to such Superior Offer and such Change of Recommendation
Notice complies with the requirements of Section 4.2(d); (iii) Parent does
not make, within 72 hours after receipt of the Companys written notice
pursuant to this Section 7.1(h), an offer that the Company Board of Directors
shall have reasonably concluded in good faith (following consultation with
its financial advisor and outside counsel) is at least as favorable to the
stockholders of the Company as such Superior Offer; (iv) the Company Board of
Directors shall have received an opinion from each of TWP and an additional

accordance with Section 7.3(b) concurrently with entering into such binding
written agreement.

shall have amended or modified in a manner adverse to Parent its
recommendation in favor of, the adoption and approval of the Agreement or the
approval of the Merger, (ii) it shall have failed to include in the Proxy

requests in

  

49      
   



  

writing that such recommendation be reaffirmed following the public
announcement of any Acquisition Proposal, (iv) its Board of Directors or any
committee thereof shall have approved or recommended any Acquisition
Proposal, (v) a tender or exchange offer relating to its securities shall
have been commenced by a person unaffiliated with Parent and the Company

exchange offer, or (vi) the Company shall have delivered a Change of
Recommendation Notice.

  

7.2 _Notice of Termination; Effect of Termination_. Any termination of this
Agreement under Section 7.1 above will be effective immediately upon the

provided in Section 7.1, this Agreement shall be of no further force or
effect, except (i) as set forth in Section 5.3(a), this Section 7.2, Section
7.3 and Article VIII, each of which shall survive the termination of this
Agreement and (ii) nothing herein shall relieve any party from liability for

termination of this Agreement in accordance with their terms.

  

7.3 _Fees and Expenses_.

  

(a) _General_. Except as set forth in this Section 7.3, all fees and expenses

the Company shall promptly, but in no event later than two business days
after the date of such termination (except as provided in Section 7.1(h)),
pay Parent a fee equal to eleven million two hundred thousand dollars

_provided_ , that in the case of termination under Section 7.1(b) or 7.1(d):
(A) such payment shall be made only if following the date hereof and prior to

Acquisition Proposal with respect to the Company and within 12 months
following the termination of this Agreement an Acquisition of the Company is
consummated; _provided_ , _further,_  that in the case of a termination under
Section 7.1(d), the consideration in any

of the Company.

  

(ii) _Interest and Costs; Other Remedies_. The Company acknowledges that the

reference is made in this Agreement to sections, such reference shall be to a
section of this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The words "include,"
"includes" and "including" when used herein shall be deemed in each case to
be followed by the words "without limitation." The table of contents and

(e) For purposes of this Agreement, the term " **Material Adverse Effect**
" when used in connection with an entity, means any change, event,
circumstance or occurrence that has a material adverse effect on the
business, assets (including intangible assets), financial condition or
results of operations of such entity taken as a whole with its subsidiaries;
_provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall any change, event,

account in determining whether there has been or will be, a Material Adverse
Effect on any entity: (A) any action required or expressly contemplated to be
taken or prohibited from being taken pursuant to this Agreement, (B) any
matters referred to in Schedule 8.3, (C) the announcement or pendency of the

which such entity operates (which changes do not disproportionately affect
such entity).

  

(f) For purposes of this Agreement, the term " **person** " shall mean
any individual, corporation (including any non-profit corporation),
general partnership, limited partnership, limited liability partnership,
joint venture, estate, trust, company (including any limited liability

Directors or other

  

53      
   



  

governing body of such corporation or other legal entity. Reference to the
subsidiaries of an entity shall be deemed to include all direct and indirect
subsidiaries of such entity.

  

8.4 _Counterparts_.  This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, and by facsimile, all of which shall be considered one and the
same agreement and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have
been signed by each of the parties and delivered to the other party, it being
understood that all parties need not sign the same counterpart.

  

8.5 _Entire Agreement; Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement and the
documents and instruments and other agreements among the parties hereto as
contemplated by or referred to herein, including the Company
Disclosure Letter and the Parent Disclosure Letter (a) constitute the entire
agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and
supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral,
among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, it being
understood that the provisions of this Agreement shall supersede any
conflicting provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement, and (b) are not
intended to confer upon any other person any rights or remedies hereunder,
except as specifically provided in Section 5.12.

  

8.6 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement or the application
thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to be
illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement will continue
in full force and effect and the application of such provision to other
persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as reasonably to effect the
intent of the parties hereto. The parties further agree to replace such void
or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid and enforceable
provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business
and other purposes of such void or unenforceable provision.

  

8.7 _Other Remedies; Specific Performance_. Except as otherwise provided
herein, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party will be
deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred
hereby, or by law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party of
any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy. The
parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur if any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the
parties shall be entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof in any court of the United States or any state having
jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at law or in equity.

  

8.8 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the laws
that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of law
thereof. In addition, each of the parties hereto (a) consents to submit
itself to the personal jurisdiction of any federal court located in the State
of Delaware or any Delaware state court in the event any dispute arises out
of this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
(b) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal
jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such court
and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection
that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any suit,
action or proceeding in any such court or that any suit, action or proceeding
brought in any

  

54      
   



  

such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum and (c) except as
expressly provided in Section 8.7, agrees that it will not bring any action
relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement in any court other than a federal or state court sitting in the
State of Delaware. Process may be served on any party anywhere in the world,
whether within or without the jurisdiction of any such court. Without
limiting the foregoing, each party agrees that service of process on such
party as provided in Section 8.2 shall be deemed effective service of process
on such party.

  

8.9 _Rules of Construction_. The parties hereto agree that they have been
represented by counsel during the negotiation and execution of this Agreement
and, therefore, waive the application of any law, regulation, holding or rule
of construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other document
will be construed against the party drafting such agreement or document.

  

8.10 _Assignment_. This Agreement shall not be assigned by any of the parties
hereto (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written
consent of the other parties, except that Merger Sub may assign, in its sole
discretion and without the consent of any other party, any or all of its
rights, interests and obligations hereunder to (i) Parent, (ii) to Parent and
one or more direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries of Parent, or (iii)
to one or more direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries of Parent.
 Subject to the preceding sentence, but without relieving any party hereto
of any obligation hereunder, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to
the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties and their
respective successors and assigns.

  

8.11 _No Waiver; Remedies Cumulative_. No failure or delay on the part of
any party hereto in the exercise of any right hereunder will impair such
right or be construed to be a waiver of, or acquiescence in, any breach of
any representation, warranty or agreement herein, nor will any single or
partial exercise of any such right preclude other or further exercise thereof
or of any other right. All rights and remedies existing under this Agreement
are cumulative to, and not exclusive to, and not exclusive of, any rights or
remedies otherwise available.

  

8.12 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF PARENT, THE COMPANY AND MERGER SUB
HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION,
PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE)
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY OR THE ACTIONS OF PARENT, THE COMPANY OR MERGER SUB IN
THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT HEREOF.
