Exchange_ ").

the Purchaser shall convert from a Republic of Marshall Islands corporation
to a Delaware corporation, whether by reincorporation, statutory conversion,

Security Holders collectively shall be entitled to receive from the
Purchaser, in the aggregate, a number of Purchaser Securities with an

Per Share Price, divided by (y) the Redemption Price, as may be reduced by

and (B) a number of Transferred Sponsor Warrants to which such holder is
entitled to receive, in accordance with _Section 1.10(f)_ (the total portion

---|---|--- 

 



    



  

1.10 _Effect of Merger on Company Securities._ At the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of any Party or the
holders of any Company Securities or the holders of any shares of capital
stock of the Purchaser or Merger Sub:

  



  

(a) _Company Stock_. Subject to clause (b) below, all shares of Company Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (after giving
effect to the Company Preferred Stock Exchange) will automatically be
cancelled and cease to exist in exchange for the right to receive the
Stockholder Merger Consideration, with each Company Stockholder being entitled
to receive its portion of the Stockholder Merger Consideration, including the
Transferred Sponsor Warrants in accordance with _Section 1.9_ ,
without interest, upon delivery of the Transmittal Documents in accordance
with _Section 1.11_. As of the Effective Time, each Company Stockholder shall
cease to have any other rights in and to the Company or the Surviving
Corporation.

  



  

(b) _Treasury Stock_. Notwithstanding clause (a) above or any other provision
of this Agreement to the contrary, at the Effective Time, if there are any
Company Securities that are owned by the Company as treasury shares or any
Company Securities owned by any direct or indirect Subsidiary of the Company
immediately prior to the Effective Time, such Company Securities shall be
canceled and shall cease to exist without any conversion thereof or payment
therefor.

  



  

(c) [RESERVED]

  



  

(d) _Company Warrants_. Each outstanding Company Warrant shall be cancelled,
retired and terminated and cease to represent a right to acquire shares of
Company Stock and each holder thereof shall instead have the right to receive
from the Purchaser a new warrant for shares of Purchaser Common Stock (each,
a " _Replacement Purchaser Warrant_ "). Each Replacement Purchaser
Warrant shall have, and be subject to, substantially the same terms and
conditions set forth in the Company Warrants, except that: (i) the number of
shares of Purchaser Common Stock which can be purchased with each Replacement
Purchaser Warrant shall equal a number of shares equal to (as rounded down to
the nearest whole number) the product of (A) the number of shares of Company
Common Stock (with any Company Preferred Stock treated on an as-converted to
Company Common Stock basis) which the Company Warrant had the right to
acquire immediately prior to the Effective Time, multiplied by (B) the
Conversion Ratio; and (ii) the exercise price for each Replacement Purchaser
Warrant shall be equal to (as rounded up to the nearest whole cent) the
quotient of (A) the exercise price of the Company Warrant (in U.S. Dollars),
divided by (B) the Conversion Ratio. The Purchaser shall take all corporate
action necessary to reserve for future issuance, and shall maintain such
reservation for so long as any of the Replacement Purchaser Warrants remain
outstanding, a sufficient number of shares of Purchaser Common Stock for
delivery upon the exercise of such Replacement Purchaser Warrants.

  



  

(e) _Company Options_. Each outstanding Company Option (whether vested or
unvested) shall be assumed by Purchaser and automatically converted into an
option for shares of Purchaser Common Stock (each, an " _Assumed Option_ ").
Subject to the subsequent sentence, each Assumed Option will be subject to
the terms and conditions set forth in the Company Equity Plan (except any
references therein to the Company or Company Common Stock will instead mean
the Purchaser and Purchaser Common Stock, respectively). Each Assumed Option
shall: (i) have the right to acquire a number of shares of Purchaser Common
Stock equal to(as rounded down to the nearest whole number) the product of
(A) the number of shares of Company Common Stock (with any Company Preferred
Stock treated on an as-converted to Company Common Stock basis) which the
Company Option had the right to acquire immediately prior to the
Effective Time, multiplied by (B) the Conversion Ratio; (ii) have an exercise
price equal to (as rounded up to the nearest whole cent) the quotient of (A)
the exercise price of the Company Option (in U.S. Dollars), divided by (B) the
Conversion Ratio; and (iii) be subject to the same vesting schedule as the
applicable Company Option. The Purchaser shall take all corporate action
necessary to reserve for future issuance, and shall maintain such reservation
for so long as any of the Assumed Options remain outstanding, a sufficient
number of shares of Purchaser Common Stock for delivery upon the exercise of
such Assumed Option. From and after the Closing, the Company and the
Purchaser shall not issue any new awards under the Company Equity Plan.

  



   

 | 4| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(f) _Sponsor Warrants_. In addition to the right to receive shares of
Purchaser Common Stock, each holder of Company Stock shall be entitled to
elect to receive such holder's Pro Rata Share of up to an aggregate of 929,890
Purchaser Private Warrants (the " _Transferred Sponsor Warrants_ "), pursuant
to the following procedures (such procedures, the " _Sponsor Warrant Election_
"):

  



  

(i) At least two (2) Business Days prior to the Company Special Meeting, the
holders of Company Stock shall make an election on such holder's Letter of
Transmittal as to (A) the number of Purchaser Private Warrants that such
holder wishes to elect to receive, which number shall be no more than such
holder's Pro Rata Share of the total number of Transferred Sponsor Warrants,
and (B) in case that there are any Transferred Sponsor Warrants that other
holders of Company Stock elect not to receive (the " _Under-
subscribed Sponsor Warrants_ "), whether such holder wishes to receive its
Pro Rata Share of the Under-subscribed Sponsor Warrants and whether there is
any limit to the number of Under-subscribed Sponsor Warrants that it wishes to
elect to receive.

  



  

(ii) For each Transferred Sponsor Warrant that a Company Stockholder wishes
to elect to receive, the Company Shareholder shall exchange for such
Transferred Sponsor Warrant a number of the Purchaser Common Stock that it was
otherwise entitled to receive as Stockholder Merger Consideration, at a ratio
equal to $0.50 divided by the Redemption Price.

  



  

(iii) Prior to the Effective Time, Purchaser shall purchase from the Sponsors
the aggregate number of Transferred Sponsor Warrants elected to receive by
all holders of Company Stock, and in consideration for such purchase shall
issue to the Sponsors a promissory note in the amount equal to (x) fifty
cents ($0.50) multiplied by (y) the number of Transferred Sponsor Warrants,
which promissory note shall be repayable upon the Closing.

  



  

(iv) The Sponsor Warrant Election shall only be valid for any Letters of
Transmittal received by the Exchange Agent at least two (2) Business Days
prior to the Company Special Meeting.

  



  

(v) Any Transferred Sponsor Warrants received by Company Stockholders shall
be subject to the transfer restrictions applicable to the Sponsors under
Section 7(b) of the letter agreement, dated August 18, 2016, by and between
the Purchaser and the Sponsors (a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 10.3 to
the Purchaser's Form 8-K filed with the SEC on August 24, 2016) as permitted
transferees of the Sponsors.

  



  

(g) Any other Company Convertible Security other than a Company Warrant or
Company Option, if not exercised or converted prior to the Effective Time,
shall be cancelled, retired and terminated and cease to represent a right to
acquire, be exchanged for or convert into shares of Company Stock.

  



  

1.11 _Surrender of Company Securities and Disbursement of Merger
Consideration_.

  



  

(a) Promptly after the date of this Agreement, the Purchaser shall appoint
Continental Stock Transfer and Trust Company or another agent reasonably
acceptable to the Company (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for the purpose of
exchanging the certificates representing Company Stock (" _Company
Certificates_ "). At or prior to the Effective Time, the Purchaser shall
deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent the Stockholder
Merger Consideration and the Transferred Sponsor Warrants that have been
purchased from the Sponsor pursuant to _Section 1.10(f)_. Promptly after the
date hereof, the Purchaser shall send, or shall cause the Exchange Agent to
send, to each Company Stockholder, a letter of transmittal for use in such
exchange, in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit C_ (a " _Letter of
Transmittal_ ") (which shall specify that the delivery of Company
Certificates in respect of the Stockholder Merger Consideration shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper delivery of
the Company Certificates to the Exchange Agent (or a Lost Certificate
Affidavit)) for use in such exchange and for making the Sponsor Warrant
Election.

  



   

 | 5| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) Each Company Stockholder shall be entitled to receive its portion of the
Stockholder Merger Consideration in respect of the Company Stock represented
by the Company Certificate(s) (excluding any Company Securities described in
_Section 1.10(b)_ ) and Transferred Sponsor Warrants, as soon as reasonably
practicable after the Effective Time, but subject to the delivery to the
Exchange Agent of the following items (collectively, the " _Transmittal
Documents_ "): (i) the Company Certificate(s) for its Company Stock (or a
Lost Certificate Affidavit), together with a properly completed and duly
executed Letter of Transmittal and such other documents as may be reasonably
requested by the Exchange Agent or the Purchaser; and (ii) if such Company
Stockholder is a Significant Stockholder, a duly executed counterpart to the
lock-up agreement with the Purchaser, effective as of the Effective Time,
substantially in the form attached as _Exhibit D-1_ hereto (each a " _Lock-Up
Agreement_ "). Until so surrendered, each Company Certificate shall represent
after the Effective Time for all purposes only the right to receive such
portion of the Stockholder Merger Consideration attributable to such Company
Certificate.

  



  

(c) If any portion of the Stockholder Merger Consideration is to be delivered
or issued to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered
Company Certificate is registered immediately prior to the Effective Time, it
shall be a condition to such delivery that (i) the transfer of such Company
Stock shall have been permitted in accordance with the terms of the Company's
Organizational Documents and any stockholders agreement with respect to the
Company, each as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) such
Company Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper
form for transfer and, (iii) the recipient of such portion of the Stockholder
Merger Consideration, or the Person in whose name such portion of the
Stockholder Merger Consideration is delivered or issued, shall have already
executed and delivered counterparts to the Lock-Up Agreement (if the
transferor was a Significant Stockholder), and such other Transmittal
Documents as are reasonably deemed necessary by the Exchange Agent or
Purchaser and (iv) the Person requesting such delivery shall pay to the
Exchange Agent any transfer or other Taxes required as a result of such
delivery to a Person other than the registered holder of such Company
Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such
Tax has been paid or is not payable.

  



  

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in the event
that any Company Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, in
lieu of delivery of a Company Certificate to the Exchange Agent, the Company
Stockholder may instead deliver to the Exchange Agent an affidavit of lost
certificate and, if reasonably required by the Exchange Agent, indemnity of
loss in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Purchaser (a " _Lost
Certificate Affidavit_ "), which at the reasonable discretion of the
Purchaser may include a requirement that the owner of such lost, stolen or
destroyed Company Certificate deliver a bond in such customary amount as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or the Surviving
Corporation with respect to the shares of Company Stock represented by the
Company Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed. Any
Lost Certificate Affidavit properly delivered in accordance with this
_Section 1.11(d)_ shall be treated as a Company Certificate for all purposes
of this Agreement.

  



  

(e) After the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of
transfers of Company Stock. If, after the Effective Time,
Company Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation, the
Purchaser or the Exchange Agent, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the
applicable portion of the Stockholder Merger Consideration provided for, and
in accordance with the procedures set forth in this _Section 1.11_. No
dividends or other distributions declared or made after the date of this
Agreement with respect to Purchaser Common Stock with a record date after the
Effective Time will be paid to the holders of any Company Certificates that
have not yet been surrendered with respect to the Purchaser Common Stock to be
issued upon surrender thereof until the holders of record of such Company
Certificates shall surrender such certificates (or provide a Lost Certificate
Affidavit), if applicable, and provide the other Transmittal Documents.
Subject to applicable Law, following surrender of any such Company
Certificates (or delivery of a Lost Certificate Affidavit), if applicable,
and delivery of the other Transmittal Documents, Purchaser shall
promptly deliver to the record holders thereof, without interest, the
certificates representing the Purchaser Common Stock issued in
exchange therefor and the amount of any such dividends or other distributions
with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to
such Purchaser Common Stock.

(f) All securities issued upon the surrender of Company Securities in
accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been issued in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Company Securities. Any portion
of the Stockholder Merger Consideration made available to the Exchange Agent
pursuant to _Section 1.11(a)_ that remains unclaimed by Company Stockholders
two (2) years after the Effective Time shall be returned to the Purchaser,
upon demand, and any such Company Stockholder who has not exchanged its
Company Stock for the applicable portion of the Stockholder Merger
Consideration (including the Transferred Sponsor Warrants) in accordance with
this _Section 1.11_ prior to that time shall thereafter look only to the
Purchaser for payment of the portion of the Stockholder Merger Consideration
(including the Transferred Sponsor Warrants) in respect of such shares of
Company Stock without any interest thereon (but with any dividends paid with
respect thereto). Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Surviving
Corporation, the Purchaser or any Party hereto shall be liable to any Person
for any amount properly paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

  



  

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no fraction of
a share of Purchaser Common Stock will be issued by virtue of the Merger or
the transactions contemplated hereby, and each Person who would otherwise be
entitled to a fraction of a share of Purchaser Common Stock (after
aggregating all fractional shares of Purchaser Common Stock that otherwise
would be received by such holder) shall instead have the number of shares of
Purchaser Common Stock issued to such Person rounded down in the aggregate to
the nearest whole share of Purchaser Common Stock.

  



  

1.12 _Effect of Transaction on Merger Sub Stock_. At the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of any Party or the
holders of any Company Securities or the holders of any shares of capital
stock of the Purchaser or Merger Sub, each share of Merger Sub Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into an
equal number of shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation, with the
same rights, powers and privileges as the shares so converted and shall
constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving
Corporation.

  



  

1.13 _Closing Calculations_. Not later than the second (2nd) Business Day
prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to the Purchaser a
statement signed by the Company's chief executive officer (the " _Closing
Statement_ ") setting forth a good faith calculation of the Company's
estimate of the Closing Net Cash and the resulting Merger Consideration, in
reasonable detail including for each component thereof, along with the amount
owed to each creditor of any of the Target Companies, and bank statements and
other evidence reasonably necessary to confirm such calculations. Promptly
upon delivering the Closing Statement to the Purchaser, the Company will meet
with the Purchaser to review and discuss the Closing Statement and the
Company will consider in good faith the Purchaser's comments to the Closing
Statement and make any appropriate adjustments to the Closing Statement prior
to the Closing, which adjusted Closing Statement, as mutually approved by the
Company and the Purchaser, shall thereafter become the Closing Statement for
all purposes of this Agreement. The Closing Statement and the
determinations contained therein shall be prepared in accordance with the
Accounting Principles and otherwise in accordance with this Agreement.

Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full
right, title and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges,
powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub, the officers and
directors of the Company and Merger Sub are fully authorized in the name of
their respective corporations or otherwise to take, and will take, all
such lawful and necessary action, so long as such action is not inconsistent
with this Agreement.

Securities Act, the Exchange Act and SOX, as the case may be, and the rules

such financial statements, all in accordance with (i) GAAP methodologies
applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods involved and (ii)
Regulation S-X or Regulation S-K, as applicable (except as may be indicated in

Governmental Authority, nor are any such Orders pending. The Purchaser holds
all Permits necessary to lawfully conduct its business as presently
conducted, and to own, lease and operate its assets and properties, all of

individual to severance pay, unemployment compensation or other benefits or
compensation; (ii) accelerate the time of payment or vesting, or increase the
amount of any compensation due, or in respect of, any individual; or (iii)

and effect (except as such enforcement may be limited by the Enforceability
Exceptions); (iii) the Purchaser is not in breach or default in any material
respect, and no event has occurred that with the passage of time or giving of

party, under such Purchaser Material Contract; and (iv) to the Knowledge of
the Purchaser, no other party to any Purchaser Material Contract is in breach
or default in any material respect, and no event has occurred that with the

case that are owned by a Target Company or in which a Target Company is the
owner, applicant or assignee; and (ii) " _Company IP Licenses_ " means all
Intellectual Property licenses, sublicenses and other agreements, under which
a Target Company is a licensee or otherwise is authorized to use or practice
any material Intellectual Property (other than "shrink wrap," "click wrap,"
and "off the shelf" software agreements and other agreements for Software
commercially available on reasonable terms to the public generally with
license, maintenance, support and other fees of less than $20,000 per year
(collectively, " _Off-the-Shelf Software_ ")) of a third Person.

  



  

(b) The Company IP Licenses include all of the licenses, granted to the
Target Companies for any material Intellectual Property necessary to operate
the Target Companies as presently conducted. To the Knowledge of the Company,
except where the Company or any Target Company, as applicable, may have
intentionally abandoned or let expire any registration or application for the
following, all registrations for Copyrights, Patents, Trademarks and Internet
Assets that are owned by any Target Company are valid and in force, and all
pending applications by any Target Company to register any Copyrights, Patents
and Trademarks are in good standing and have not been challenged by any third
Person. No Target Company is party to any Contract that requires a Target
Company to assign to any Person all of its rights in any Intellectual
Property developed by a Target Company under such Contract and material
to that Target Company's business.

(c) No Action is pending or, to the Company's Knowledge, threatened against a
Target Company that challenges the validity, enforceability, ownership, or
right to use, sell, license or sublicense any Intellectual Property currently
owned by the Target Companies. Except as set forth in _Schedule 4.13(c)_ , no
Target Company has received any written or, to the Knowledge of the Company,
oral notice or claim asserting or suggesting that any infringement,
misappropriation, violation, dilution or unauthorized use by such Target
Company of the Intellectual Property of any other Person is or may be
occurring or has or may have occurred, as a consequence of the business
activities of any Target Company, nor to the Knowledge of the company is there
a reasonable basis therefor. There are no Orders to which any Target Company
is a party or is otherwise bound that (i) restrict the rights of a Target
Company to use, transfer, license or enforce any Intellectual Property owned
by a Target Company, or (ii) grant any third Person any right with respect to
any Intellectual Property owned by a Target Company. To the Knowledge of the
Company, no Target Company is currently infringing, or has, in the past,
infringed, misappropriated or violated any Intellectual Property of any other
Person in any material respect in connection with the ownership, use or
license of any Intellectual Property owned or purported to be owned by a
Target Company or, to the Knowledge of the Company, otherwise in connection
with the conduct of the respective businesses of the Target Companies. To the
Company's Knowledge, no third party is infringing upon, has misappropriated or
is otherwise violating any Intellectual Property owned by any Target Company
(" _Company IP_ ") in any material respect.

  



  

(d) All employees and independent contractors of a Target Company have
assigned to the Target Companies ownership of all Company IP arising from the
services performed for a Target Company by such Persons. No current or former
officers, employees or independent contractors of a Target Company have
claimed any ownership interest in any Intellectual Property currently owned by
a Target Company. To the Knowledge of the Company, there has been no
violation by a Target Company's employees or subcontractors of such Target
Company's policies or practices related to protection of Company IP or any
confidentiality or nondisclosure Contract relating to the
Intellectual Property owned by a Target Company. To the Company's Knowledge,
none of the employees of any Target Company is obligated under any Contract,
or subject to any Order, that would materially interfere with the use of such
employee's efforts to promote the interests of the Target Companies, or that
would materially conflict with the business of any Target Company as
presently conducted. Each Target Company has taken reasonable security
measures in order to protect the secrecy, confidentiality and value of the
material Company IP.

  



  

(e) To the Knowledge of the Company, no Person has obtained unauthorized
access to third party information and data in the possession of a Target
Company, nor has there been any other material compromise of the security,
confidentiality or integrity of such information or data. Each Target Company
has materially complied with all applicable Laws relating to privacy, personal
data protection, and the collection, processing and use of personal
information and its own privacy policies and guidelines. To the Knowledge of
the Company, the operation of the business of the Target Companies has not
and does not violate, in any material respect, any right to privacy or
publicity of any third person, or constitute unfair competition or trade
practices under applicable Law.

or caused to be paid, collected or withheld Taxes required to be paid,

assets, other than Permitted Liens.

  



  

(e) Each Target Company has collected or withheld all Taxes currently

expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. No Target
Company is a party to or bound by any Tax indemnity agreement, Tax sharing
agreement or Tax allocation agreement or similar agreement, arrangement or
practice (excluding commercial agreements entered into in the ordinary course
of business the primary purpose of which was not the sharing of Taxes) with
respect to Taxes (including advance pricing agreement, closing agreement or
other agreement relating to Taxes with any Governmental Authority) that will

circumstance, that would reasonably be expected to prevent the Merger from
qualifying as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Code. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Company makes no
representation or warranty related to (i) the amount, value or condition of
any Tax asset or attribute (e.g. net operating loss carry-forward or Tax

Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates to utilize such Tax asset or

 | 36| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement,
the Parties shall cooperate in all respects with each other and use (and
shall cause their respective Affiliates to use) their respective commercially
reasonable efforts to prepare and file with Governmental Authorities requests
for approval of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and shall use

whether prior to the Closing or after the Closing, each Party shall arrange
for Representatives of such Party to be present for such hearing or meeting.
If any objections are asserted with respect to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement under any applicable Law or if any Action is instituted (or
threatened to be instituted) by any applicable Governmental Authority or any

5.10 _Tax Matters_. Each of the Parties shall use its reasonable best efforts
to cause the Merger to qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code. None of the Parties shall (and each of the Parties
shall cause their respective Subsidiaries not to) take any action, or fail to
take any action, that could reasonably be expected to cause the Merger to
fail to qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of
the Code. The Parties intend to report and, except to the extent otherwise
required by Law, shall report, for federal income tax purposes, the Merger as
a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. After

its counsel that there is a material risk that the Merger will not qualify as
a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code pursuant
to the business combination set forth in _Section 1.1_ , the Purchaser shall
alter the structure of the business combination between Merger Sub and the
Company contemplated by this Agreement by consummating a second-step merger
of the Surviving Corporation into a limited liability company wholly-owned by
Purchaser that is disregarded as an entity for federal tax purposes, in
accordance with Delaware law, immediately following the Merger (such second-
step merger, the " _Second Merger_ "); _provided_ , that if such Second
Merger occurs, (i) the Merger and the Second Merger shall be treated as one
integrated transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes and (ii)
references to the Company or the Surviving Corporation (in each case, after
the effective time of the Second Merger) and all other provisions of this
Agreement shall be interpreted mutatis mutandis to take into account the
change in structure of the business combination.

  



  

5.11 _Further Assurances_. The Parties hereto shall further cooperate with
each other and use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to take
or cause to be taken all actions, and do or cause to be done all things,
necessary, proper or advisable on their part under this Agreement and
applicable Laws to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
as soon as reasonably practicable, including preparing and filing as soon as
practicable all documentation to effect all necessary notices, reports and
other filings.

(a) The Purchaser and the Company acknowledge that the Purchaser has elected
to extend the date by which the Purchaser must consummate its initial
Business Combination from February 24, 2018 to May 24, 2018 (the " _Initial
Extension_ "). The Purchaser and the Company acknowledge that in order to
finance the Initial Extension, the Company has loaned to the
Purchaser $201,268 as a non-interest bearing loan (the " _Extension Loan_ "),
repayable upon the earlier of the consummation of the Purchaser's Business
Combination or liquidation (subject to _Section 8.1_ ).

  



  

(b) If either the Company or the Purchaser reasonably believes that the
Closing may not occur by May 24, 2018, but that the parties are reasonably
capable of causing the Closing to occur prior to August 24, 2018, then the
Purchaser may, and at the request of the Company, the Purchaser shall, seek
the approval of the Purchaser's stockholders to extend the deadline for the
Purchaser to consummate its initial Business Combination beyond the Initial
Extension (the " _Second Extension_ ") to a date no earlier than August 24,
2018 (or such earlier date as the Company and the Purchaser may otherwise
agree, and which may be structured as multiple monthly or other periodic
extensions at the election of the Purchaser without the requirement to seek
additional Purchaser stockholder approval), and shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain such approval. The Company hereby agrees that
the Company shall, in order to finance such Second Extension, lend to the
Purchaser fifty percent (50%) of the costs and expenses of such Second
Extension (including the amount of any additional deposits to the Trust
Account that the Purchaser has agreed to make, and in the event that the
Second Extension is structured as multiple monthly or other
periodic extensions at the election of the Purchaser, the Company shall make
multiple loans as required by the Purchaser to finance any such periodic
extensions) as a non-interest bearing loan (any such individual or collective
loans, " _Second Extension Loan_ "), repayable upon the earlier of the
consummation of the Purchaser's Business Combination or liquidation (subject
to _Section 8.1_ ).

  



  

5.13 _The Registration Statement_.

  



  

(a) As promptly as practicable after the date hereof, the Purchaser shall
prepare with the reasonable assistance of the Company, and file with the SEC
a registration statement on Form S-4 (as amended or supplemented from time to
time, and including the Proxy Statement contained therein, the "
_Registration Statement_ ") in connection with the registration under the
Securities Act of the Purchaser Common Stock to be issued under this Agreement
as the Merger Consideration, which Registration Statement will also contain a
proxy statement (as amended, the " _Proxy Statement_ ") for the purpose
of (x) soliciting proxies from Purchaser stockholders for the matters to be
acted upon at the Purchaser Special Meeting and providing the Public
Stockholders an opportunity in accordance with the Purchaser's Organizational
Documents and the IPO Prospectus to have their Purchaser Common Stock
redeemed (the " _Redemption_ ") in conjunction with the stockholder vote on
the Purchaser Stockholder Approval Matters and (y) soliciting proxies from
holders of Company Stock for the matters to be acted upon at the Company
Special Meeting.

equal to five percent (5.0%) of the aggregate number of shares of Purchaser
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately after the Closing (giving
effect to the Redemption), and for purposes of clarification, such five
percent (5.0%) share reserve shall not include the number of shares of
Purchaser Common Stock that are subject to the Assumed Options, (iv) the
adoption and approval of an employee stock purchase plan in a form and
substance reasonably acceptable to the Purchaser and the Company (the "
_ESPP_ "), (v) the appointment, and designation of classes, of the members of

committees thereof, in each case in accordance with _Section 5.17_ hereof,

the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the approvals described
in foregoing clauses (i) through (vi), collectively, the " _Purchaser
Stockholder Approval Matters_ "), and (vii) the adjournment of the Purchaser
Special Meeting, if necessary or desirable in the reasonable determination of
Purchaser. If on the date for which the Purchaser Special Meeting is

transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the approvals described in
foregoing clauses (i) through (ii), collectively, the " _Company
Stockholder Approval Matters_ "), and (iii) the adjournment of the Company
Special Meeting, if necessary or desirable in the reasonable determination of
Company. If on the date for which the Company Special Meeting is scheduled,
the Company has not received proxies representing a sufficient number of
shares to obtain the Required Company Stockholder Approval, whether or not a
quorum is present, the Company may, and shall do so if requested by
Purchaser, make one or more successive postponements or adjournments of the
Company Special Meeting. If a Company Board Recommendation Change is made,
Purchaser shall take all actions necessary to amend the
Registration Statement to disclose such Company Board Recommendation Change.

in any material respect or as otherwise required by applicable
Laws. Purchaser shall amend or supplement the Registration Statement and
cause the Registration Statement, as so amended or supplemented, to be filed
with the SEC and to be disseminated to Purchaser stockholders, in each case as

board of directors shall (x) recommend that the Company's stockholders adopt
this Agreement and approve the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby in accordance with the applicable provisions of the DGCL (the "
_Company Board Recommendation_ ") and (y) include the Company
Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement, and (B) neither the Company's
board of directors nor any committee thereof shall (i) fail to make,
withdraw, amend, modify or qualify the Company Board Recommendation, or
publicly propose to withhold, withdraw, amend, modify or qualify the Company
Board Recommendation, (ii) approve, endorse, adopt or recommend, or publicly
propose to approve, endorse, adopt or recommend, an Acquisition Proposal, or
(iii) fail to include the Company Board Recommendation in the Proxy
Statement (the actions or inactions referred to in the preceding clauses (i),
(ii), and (iii) being referred to herein as a " _Company Board Recommendation
Change_ ").

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the
Company's board of directors may effect a Company Board Recommendation Change
at any time prior to obtaining the Required Company Stockholder Approval in
the event that:

  



  

(i) the Company's board of directors has received a bona fide written
Acquisition Proposal after the date of this Agreement that was not solicited
in violation of _Section 5.6_ and determines in good faith (after consultation
with its financial advisor and its outside legal counsel) that such
Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal (which determination and any
notice to Purchaser thereof shall not constitute a Company Board
Recommendation Change) or an Intervening Event has occurred;

  



  

(ii) prior to effecting such Company Board Recommendation Change, the
Company's board of directors shall have given Purchaser at least five (5)
Business Days' notice of its intention to effect a Company Board
Recommendation Change pursuant to _Section 5.14(b)(i) _ (the " _Change of
Recommendation Notice Period_ ");

  



  

(iii) if requested by Purchaser, during the Change of Recommendation Notice
Period, the Company shall have met and negotiated in good faith with
Purchaser regarding modifications to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement to obviate the need for a Company Board Recommendation Change;

  



  

(iv) prior to the end of the Change of Recommendation Notice Period,
including any extensions thereto, Purchaser shall not have made a counter-
offer or proposal in writing and in a manner that, if accepted by the
Company, would form a binding contract, that the Company's board of directors
determines (after consultation with its financial advisor and its outside
legal counsel) obviates the need for a Company Board Recommendation Change;
and

  



  

(v) the Company's board of directors determines (after consultation with its
outside legal counsel and after considering any counter-offer or proposal
made by Purchaser pursuant to this _Section 5.14(b)_ ) that, in light of such
Superior Proposal or Intervening Event, the failure to effect a Company Board
Recommendation Change would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties.

the Company a reasonable amount of time prior to such filing deadline)). The
Parties shall mutually agree upon and, as promptly as practicable after the
Closing (but in any event within four (4) Business Days thereafter), issue a
press release announcing the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (the " _Closing Press Release_ "). Promptly after the issuance
of the Closing Press Release, the Purchaser shall file a current report on
Form 8-K (the " _Closing Filing_ ") with the Closing Press Release and a
description of the Closing as required by Federal Securities Laws. In
connection with the preparation of the Signing Press Release, the Signing

this _Section 5.16(b)_ and (B) in the event that such protective Order
or other remedy is not obtained, or the Company waives compliance with this
_Section 5.16_ (b), furnish only that portion of such Company Confidential

director, officer, member, trustee or fiduciary of another corporation,

enterprise at the request of the Company, Purchaser or Merger Sub (the " _D
andO Indemnified Parties_") as provided in their respective Organizational
Documents or under any indemnification, employment or other similar
agreements between any DandO Indemnified Party and the Company, Purchaser or
Merger Sub, in each case as in effect on the date of this Agreement, shall
survive the Merger and continue in full force and effect. For a period of six
(6) years commencing at the Effective Time, the Purchaser shall cause the

contain provisions no less favorable with respect to exculpation and
indemnification of and advancement of expenses to DandO Indemnified Parties
than are set forth as of the date of this Agreement in the
Organizational Documents of Purchaser and the Company, respectively, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, and during such six-year period such
provision shall not be repealed, amended or otherwise modified in any manner
except as required by applicable Law. The provisions of this _Section 5.18_
shall survive the consummation of the Merger and are intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the DandO Indemnified Parties

recycling of Purchaser's public securities and any Backstop Financing sought
by the Purchaser in order to retain such cash and cash equivalents, including

Article VIII 
  _WAIVERS AND RELEASES_

  



  

8.1 _Waiver of Claims Against Trust_. Reference is made to the IPO
Prospectus. The Company represents and warrants that it has read the IPO
Prospectus and understands that Purchaser has established the Trust Account
containing the proceeds of the IPO and overallotment shares acquired by the
Purchaser's underwriters (including interest accrued from time to time
thereon) for the benefit of Purchaser's public stockholders (including
overallotment shares acquired by Purchaser's underwriters) (the "
_Public Stockholders_ ") and that, except as otherwise described in the IPO
Prospectus, Purchaser may disburse monies from the Trust Account only: (a) to
the Public Stockholders in the event they elect to redeem their Purchaser
Common Stock in connection with the consummation of its initial business
combination (as such term is used in the IPO Prospectus) ("
_Business Combination_ ") or in connection with an extension of the deadline
to consummate a Business Combination, (b) to the Public Stockholders if the
Purchaser fails to consummate a Business Combination within twelve (12) months
(or up to twenty (21) months if extended pursuant to the terms of the
Purchaser Organizational Documents) after the closing of the IPO, (c) with
respect to any interest earned on the amounts held in the Trust Account, as
necessary to pay any taxes and for working capital purposes, and (d) to the
Purchaser after or concurrently with the consummation of its Business
Combination. For and in consideration of Purchaser entering into this
Agreement and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the Company hereby agrees on
behalf of itself and its Affiliates that, notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, neither the Company nor its Affiliates does now
or shall at any time hereafter have any right, title, interest or claim of
any kind in or to any monies in the Trust Account or distributions therefrom,
or make any claim against the Trust Account (including any distributions
therefrom), regardless of whether such claim arises as a result of, in
connection with or relating in any way to, this Agreement or any proposed or
actual business relationship between the Purchaser or its Representatives, on
the one hand, and the Company or its Representatives, on the other hand, this
Agreement or any other matter, and regardless of whether such claim arises
based on contract, tort, equity or any other theory of legal liability (any
and all such claims are collectively referred to hereafter as the " _Released
Claims_ "). The Company on behalf of itself and its Affiliates hereby
irrevocably waives any Released Claims that the Company or its Affiliates may
have against the Trust Account (including any distributions therefrom) now or
in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts
or agreements with Purchaser or its Representatives and will not seek
recourse against the Trust Account (including any distributions therefrom)
for any reason whatsoever (including for an alleged breach of this Agreement
or any other agreement with Purchaser or its Affiliates). The Company agrees
and acknowledges that such irrevocable waiver is material to this Agreement
and specifically relied upon by the Purchaser and its Affiliates to induce
Purchaser to enter in this Agreement, and the Company further intends and
understands such waiver to be valid, binding and enforceable against the
Company and each of its Affiliates under applicable Law. To the extent the
Company or any of its Affiliates commences any action or proceeding based
upon, in connection with, relating to or arising out of any matter relating
to the Purchaser or its Representatives, which proceeding seeks, in whole or
in part, monetary relief against the Purchaser or its Representatives, the
Company hereby acknowledges and agrees the Company's and its Affiliates' sole
remedy shall be against funds held outside of the Trust Account and that such
claim shall not permit any the Company or its Affiliates (or any Person
claiming on any of their behalves or in lieu of them) to have any claim
against the Trust Account (including any distributions therefrom) or any
amounts contained therein. In the event that the Company or any of its
Affiliates commences Action based upon, in connection with, relating to or
arising out of any matter relating to the Purchaser or its Representatives
which proceeding seeks, in whole or in part, relief against the Trust Account
(including any distributions therefrom) or the Public Stockholders, whether
in the form of money damages or injunctive relief, the Purchaser and its
Representatives, as applicable, shall be entitled to recover from the
Company, its Affiliates, and the Company Stockholders, the associated
legal fees and costs in connection with any such Action, in the event the
Purchaser or its Representatives, as applicable, prevails in such Action. For
the avoidance of doubt, each Sponsor shall be deemed to be an Affiliate of the
Purchaser prior to the Closing. This _Section 8.1_ shall survive termination
of this Agreement for any reason.

subject to the Dispute, which arbitrator shall be a commercial lawyer with
substantial experience arbitrating disputes under acquisition agreements. The
arbitrator shall accept his or her appointment and begin the arbitration
process promptly (but in any event within five (5) Business Days) after his or
her nomination and acceptance by the parties subject to the Dispute. The
proceedings shall be streamlined and efficient. The arbitrator shall decide
the Dispute in accordance with the substantive law of the state of New York.
Time is of the essence. Each party shall submit a proposal for resolution of
the Dispute to the arbitrator within twenty (20) days after confirmation of
the appointment of the arbitrator. The arbitrator shall have the power to
order any party to do, or to refrain from doing, anything consistent with this
Agreement, the Ancillary Documents and applicable Law, including to perform
its contractual obligation(s); _provided_ , that the arbitrator shall be
limited to ordering pursuant to the foregoing power (and, for the avoidance of
doubt, shall order) the relevant party (or parties, as applicable) to comply
with only one or the other of the proposals. The arbitrator's award shall be
in writing and shall include a reasonable explanation of the arbitrator's
reason(s) for selecting one or the other proposal. The seat of arbitration

necessary to render the same valid, legal and enforceable, and the validity,
legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions hereof shall not in
any way be affected or impaired thereby nor shall the validity, legality or
enforceability of such provision be affected thereby in any
other jurisdiction. Upon such determination that any term or other provision
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the Parties will
substitute for any invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision a suitable and
equitable provision that carries out, so far as may be valid, legal and
enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid, illegal or unenforceable
provision.
