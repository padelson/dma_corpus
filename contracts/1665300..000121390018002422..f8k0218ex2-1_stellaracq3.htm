of Claims Against Trust</U>. Reference is made to the IPO Prospectus. The Company represents and warrants that it has read the
IPO Prospectus and understands that Purchaser has established the Trust Account containing the proceeds of the IPO and overallotment
shares acquired by the Purchaser&rsquo;s underwriters (including interest accrued from time to time thereon) for the benefit of
Purchaser&rsquo;s public stockholders (including overallotment shares acquired by Purchaser&rsquo;s underwriters) (the &ldquo;<B><I>Public
Stockholders</I></B>&rdquo;) and that, except as otherwise described in the IPO Prospectus, Purchaser may disburse monies from
the Trust Account only: (a) to the Public Stockholders in the event they elect to redeem their Purchaser Common Stock in connection
with the consummation of its initial business combination (as such term is used in the IPO Prospectus) (&ldquo;<B><I>Business
Combination</I></B>&rdquo;) or in connection with an extension of the deadline to consummate a Business Combination, (b) to the
Public Stockholders if the Purchaser fails to consummate a Business Combination within twelve (12) months (or up to twenty (21)
months if extended pursuant to the terms of the Purchaser Organizational Documents) after the closing of the IPO, (c) with respect
to any interest earned on the amounts held in the Trust Account, as necessary to pay any taxes and for working capital purposes,
and (d) to the Purchaser after or concurrently with the consummation of its Business Combination. For and in consideration of
Purchaser entering into this Agreement and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is
hereby acknowledged, the Company hereby agrees on behalf of itself and its Affiliates that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement, neither the Company nor its Affiliates does now or shall at any time hereafter have any right, title, interest
or claim of any kind in or to any monies in the Trust Account or distributions therefrom, or make any claim against the Trust
Account (including any distributions therefrom), regardless of whether such claim arises as a result of, in connection with or
relating in any way to, this Agreement or any proposed or actual business relationship between the Purchaser or its Representatives,
on the one hand, and the Company or its Representatives, on the other hand, this Agreement or any other matter, and regardless
of whether such claim arises based on contract, tort, equity&nbsp;or any other theory of legal liability (any and all such claims
are collectively referred to hereafter as the &ldquo;<B><I>Released Claims</I></B>&rdquo;). The Company on behalf of itself and
its Affiliates hereby irrevocably waives any Released Claims that the Company or its Affiliates may have against the Trust Account
(including any distributions therefrom) now or in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or
agreements with Purchaser or its Representatives and will not seek recourse against the Trust Account (including any distributions
therefrom) for any reason whatsoever (including for an alleged breach of this Agreement or any other agreement with Purchaser
or its Affiliates). The Company agrees and acknowledges that such irrevocable waiver is material to this Agreement and specifically
relied upon by the Purchaser and its Affiliates to induce Purchaser to enter in this Agreement, and the Company further intends
and understands such waiver to be valid, binding and enforceable against the Company and each of its Affiliates under applicable
Law. To the extent the Company or any of its Affiliates commences any action or proceeding based upon, in connection with, relating
to or arising out of any matter relating to the Purchaser or its Representatives, which proceeding seeks, in whole or in part,
monetary relief against the Purchaser or its Representatives, the Company hereby acknowledges and agrees the Company&rsquo;s and
its Affiliates&rsquo; sole remedy shall be against funds held outside of the Trust Account and that such claim shall not permit
any the Company or its Affiliates (or any Person claiming on any of their behalves or in lieu of them) to have any claim against
the Trust Account (including any distributions therefrom) or any amounts contained therein. In the event that the Company or any
of its Affiliates commences Action based upon, in connection with, relating to or arising out of any matter relating to the Purchaser
or its Representatives which proceeding seeks, in whole or in part, relief against the Trust Account (including any distributions
therefrom) or the Public Stockholders, whether in the form of money damages or injunctive relief, the Purchaser and its Representatives,
as applicable, shall be entitled to recover from the Company, its Affiliates, and the Company Stockholders, the associated legal
fees and costs in connection with any such Action, in the event the Purchaser or its Representatives, as applicable, prevails
in such Action. For the avoidance of doubt, each Sponsor shall be deemed to be an Affiliate of the Purchaser prior to the Closing.
This <U>Section 8.1</U> shall survive termination of this Agreement for any reason.</FONT></P>

written notice of any Disputes to the other parties subject to such Dispute, which notice must provide a reasonably detailed description
of the matters subject to the Dispute. The parties involved in such Dispute shall seek to resolve the Dispute on an amicable basis
within ten (10) Business Days of the notice of such Dispute being received by such other parties subject to such Dispute (the &ldquo;<B><I>Resolution

if not decided within sixty (60) days after the occurrence of such Dispute, then there shall be no Resolution Period with respect

of the Dispute to the AAA and reasonably acceptable to each party subject to the Dispute, which arbitrator shall be a commercial
lawyer with substantial experience arbitrating disputes under acquisition agreements. The arbitrator shall accept his or her appointment
and begin the arbitration process promptly (but in any event within five (5) Business Days) after his or her nomination and acceptance
by the parties subject to the Dispute. The proceedings shall be streamlined and efficient. The arbitrator shall decide the Dispute
in accordance with the substantive law of the state of New York. Time is of the essence. Each party shall submit a proposal for
resolution of the Dispute to the arbitrator within twenty (20) days after confirmation of the appointment of the arbitrator. The
arbitrator shall have the power to order any party to do, or to refrain from doing, anything consistent with this Agreement, the
Ancillary Documents and applicable Law, including to perform its contractual obligation(s); <I>provided</I>, that the arbitrator
shall be limited to ordering pursuant to the foregoing power (and, for the avoidance of doubt, shall order) the relevant party
(or parties, as applicable) to comply with only one or the other of the proposals. The arbitrator&rsquo;s award shall be in writing
and shall include a reasonable explanation of the arbitrator&rsquo;s reason(s) for selecting one or the other proposal. The seat
of arbitration shall be in New York County, State of New York. The language of the arbitration shall be English.</P>
