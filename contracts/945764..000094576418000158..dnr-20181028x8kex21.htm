ARTICLE I



The Merger

LLC Sub.



(a)On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and
in accordance with the VSCA, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged
with and into the Company and the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub
shall cease, and the Company shall continue as the surviving entity in the
Merger (the "Surviving Corporation") as a wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent.



(b)Immediately following the Effective Time, on the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement and in accordance with the VSCA and the
VLLCA, the Surviving Corporation shall merge with and into LLC Sub, with LLC
Sub continuing as the surviving entity in the LLC Sub Merger as a wholly owned
Subsidiary of Parent. At the time of and immediately after the LLC Sub Merger,
(i) all capital stock of the Surviving Corporation issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the effective time of the LLC Merger shall automatically
be cancelled and extinguished and will cease to exist, and no consideration
will be delivered in exchange therefor, (ii) all of the membership interests
of LLC Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time
shall remain outstanding following the consummation of the LLC Sub Merger and
shall not be affected in any way by the LLC Sub Merger, (iii) Parent shall own
all of the membership interests in LLC Sub and shall be the sole 

member of LLC Sub, and (iv) LLC Sub shall be treated as an entity disregarded
as separate from Parent for U.S. federal income tax purposes.



(c)Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, (A)
at the Effective Time, all of the property, rights, privileges, powers and
franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving
Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger
Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving
Corporation and (B) at the effective time of the LLC Sub Merger, all of the
property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Surviving
Corporation and LLC Sub shall vest in LLC Sub, and all debts, liabilities and
duties of the Surviving Corporation and LLC Sub shall become the debts,
liabilities and duties of LLC Sub.



SECTION 1.02Closing. The closing (the "Closing") of the Merger shall take
place at the offices of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP, 1000
Louisiana, 68th Floor, Houston, Texas 77002 on a date to be mutually agreed
upon by Parent and the Company, which shall be no later than the second
Business Day following the satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by Law)
waiver by the party or parties entitled to the benefits thereof of the
conditions set forth in Article VII (other than those conditions that by their
nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or
(to the extent permitted by Law) waiver of those conditions), or at such other
place, time and date as may be agreed in writing between Parent and the
Company; provided, however, that if the Marketing Period has not ended at the
time of the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VII
(other than those conditions that by their nature or pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement are to be satisfied at or immediately prior to Closing but that
remain capable of satisfaction), then, subject to the continued satisfaction
or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VII at such time, the Closing
shall occur instead on the second Business Day following the final day of the
Marketing Period (provided that Parent may elect in its sole discretion to
terminate the Marketing Period early on no less than two Business Days\'
notice to the Company). The date on which the Closing occurs is referred to in
this Agreement as the "Closing Date."



SECTION 1.03Effective Time.

(a)Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, as soon as practicable on the
Closing Date, the parties shall (i) file with the State Corporation Commission
of the Commonwealth of Virginia (the "SCC") articles of merger relating to the
Merger containing this Agreement attached as an exhibit thereto (the "Articles
of Merger"), executed and acknowledged in accordance with the relevant
provisions of the VSCA, and (ii) make all other filings required under the
VSCA or by the SCC in connection with the Merger. The Merger shall become
effective at the time that the SCC issues its certificate of merger with
respect to the Articles of Merger, or at such later time or date as Parent and
the Company shall agree in writing and specify in the Articles of Merger;
provided, however, that in no event shall such time or date be more than 15
days following the filing of the Articles of Merger with the SCC (the time the
Merger becomes effective being the "Effective Time").



(b)Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, as soon as practicable after
the Effective time, but no later than two Business Days following the
Effective Time, (i) file with the SCC articles of merger relating to the LLC
Sub Merger containing this Agreement attached

by the SCC in connection with the LLC Sub Merger. The LLC Sub Merger shall
become effective at the time that the SCC issues its certificate of merger
with respect to the LLC Sub Articles of Merger, or at such later time or date
as Parent and the Company shall agree in writing and specify in the LLC Sub
Articles of Merger; provided, however, that in no event shall such time or
date be more than 15 days following the filing of the LLC Sub Articles of
Merger with the SCC.



SECTION 1.04Effects. The Merger and the LLC Sub Merger shall have the effects
set forth in this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the VSCA and the
VLLCA.



SECTION 1.05Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws.



(a)At the Effective Time, the articles of incorporation and the bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated to be in the form of the

restated in accordance with their respective terms and applicable Law.



(b)At the effective time of the LLC Sub Merger, the certificate of formation
and the limited liability company agreement of LLC Sub as in effect
immediately prior to the LLC Sub Merger will remain unchanged and will be the
certificate of formation and the limited liability company agreement of LLC
Sub until duly amended in accordance with the terms thereof and applicable
Law.



SECTION 1.06Directors and Officers of Surviving Corporation. The Company shall
use reasonable best efforts to obtain resignations, conditioned and
automatically effective upon the occurrence of the Effective Time, of each of
its directors in office immediately prior to the Effective Time. The parties
shall take all necessary action such that, from and after the Effective Time,
the directors and officers of Merger Sub shall be the directors and officers
of the Surviving Corporation, and such directors and officers shall serve
until their successors have been duly elected or appointed and qualified or
until their death, resignation or removal in accordance with the
Organizational Documents of the Surviving Corporation.



ARTICLE II



Effect on the Capital Stock of the Constituent Entities; Exchange of
Certificates



SECTION 2.01Effect on Capital Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company
or any holder of any capital stock thereof:



(a)Cancelation of Company-Owned Shares; Conversion of Parent-Owned Shares.
Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (each, a
"Company Common Share") that is owned by the Company immediately prior to the
Effective 

Time shall no longer be issued and outstanding and shall automatically be
canceled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in
exchange therefor. Each Company Common Share held by any wholly owned
Subsidiary of Parent (other than Merger Sub) or any wholly owned Subsidiary of
the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be
converted into a number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the Exchange
Ratio.



(b)Conversion of Company Common Shares. Subject to Section 2.03, each Company
Common Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than shares to be canceled or converted in accordance with Section
2.01(a)) shall be converted into and shall thereafter represent the right to
receive, at the election of the holder of such Company Common Shares pursuant
to the procedures set forth in Section 2.02, any of the following forms of
consideration (the "Merger Consideration"):



(i)Mixed Election Shares. Each Company Common Share with respect to which an
election to receive a combination of stock and cash (a "Mixed Election") has
been properly made and has not been properly revoked (each, a "Mixed
Consideration Election Share") shall be converted into the right to receive
the combination (which combination shall hereinafter be referred to as the
"Mixed Consideration") of (A) $25.86 in cash without interest (the "Mixed
Election Cash Consideration") and (B) 12.4000 shares of Parent Common Stock
(the "Mixed Election Stock Exchange Ratio"), subject, in the case of clauses
(A) and (B), to adjustment in accordance with Section 2.01(d).



(ii)Cash Election Shares. Each Company Common Share with respect to which an
election to receive cash (a "Cash Election") has been properly made and has
not been properly revoked (each, a "Cash Election Share") shall be converted
(provided that the Available Cash Election Amount equals or exceeds the Cash
Election Amount) into the right to receive $79.80 in cash without interest
(the "Cash Election Consideration"), subject to adjustment in accordance with
Section 2.01(d); provided, however, that if (A) the product of the number of
Cash Election Shares and the Cash Election Consideration (such product, the
"Cash Election Amount") exceeds (B) (1) $400,000,000 minus (2) the product of
the number of Mixed Consideration Election Shares and the Mixed Election Cash
Consideration (such results of the calculations in this clause (B) being the
"Available Cash Election Amount"), then each Cash Election Share shall be
converted into the right to receive (y) an amount of cash without interest
equal to the product of the Cash Election Consideration and a fraction, the
numerator of which shall be the Available Cash Election Amount and the
denominator of which shall be the Cash Election Amount (such fraction, the
"Cash Fraction") and (z) a number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to
the product of (1) the Exchange Ratio and (2) one (1) minus the Cash Fraction.



(iii)Stock Election Shares. Each Company Common Share with respect to which an
election to receive stock consideration (a "Stock Election") has been properly
made and has not been properly revoked (each, a "Stock Election Share") shall
be converted (provided that the Cash Election Amount equals or exceeds the
Available Cash Election Amount) into the right to receive 18.3454 (the
"Exchange Ratio") shares 

of Parent Common Stock, subject to adjustment in accordance with Section
2.01(d) (the "Stock Election Consideration" and, together with the stock
portion of the Mixed Consideration, the "Stock Consideration"); provided,
however, that if the Available Cash Election Amount exceeds the Cash Election
Amount and the number of No Election Shares is less than the Cash Election
Shortfall Number (as defined below), then each Stock Election Share shall be
converted into the right to receive (A) an amount of cash (without interest)
equal to the Cash Proration Amount divided by the number of Stock Election
Shares and (B) a number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product
of (1) the Exchange Ratio and (2) a fraction, the numerator of which shall be
the Cash Election Consideration minus the amount calculated in clause (A)
above and the denominator of which shall be the Cash Election Consideration.
The "Cash Proration Amount" means an amount equal to (a) the Cash Election
Shortfall Amount (as defined below) minus (b) the product of the number of No
Election Shares and the Cash Election Consideration. For the avoidance of
doubt, if the Available Cash Election Amount exceeds the Cash Election Amount
but the number of No Election Shares is greater than or equal to the Cash
Election Shortfall Number, each Stock Election Share shall be converted into
the right to receive the Stock Election Consideration.



(iv)No Election Shares. If the Cash Election Amount equals or exceeds the
Available Cash Election Amount, then each No Election Share shall be converted
into the right to receive the Stock Election Consideration. If the Available
Cash Election Amount exceeds the Cash Election Amount (the amount by which the
Available Cash Election Amount exceeds the Cash Election Amount is referred to
herein as the "Cash Election Shortfall Amount"), then (A) if the number of No
Election Shares is less than or equal to an amount equal to the Cash Election
Shortfall Amount divided by the Cash Election Consideration (such quotient is
referred to herein as the "Cash Election Shortfall Number"), then each No
Election Share shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash Election
Consideration, and (B) if the number of No Election Shares is greater than the
Cash Election Shortfall Number, then each No Election Share shall be converted
into the right to receive (A) an amount of cash (without interest) equal to
the Cash Election Shortfall Amount divided by the number of No Election Shares
and (B) a number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product of (1)
the Exchange Ratio and (2) a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the
Cash Election Consideration minus the amount calculated in clause (A) above
and the denominator of which shall be the Cash Election Consideration.



All such Company Common Shares, when so converted, shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and
each holder of a certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented any such Company Common Shares (each such certificate, a
"Certificate") or Company Common Shares held in direct registration form
("Book-Entry Shares") shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto,
except the right to receive the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration
therefor, and any distributions in accordance with Section 2.03(f), in each
case, without interest.



(c)Conversion of Merger Sub Stock. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01
per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective 

Time shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of
capital stock of the Surviving Corporation. From and after the Effective Time,
all certificates representing the common stock of Merger Sub shall be deemed
for all purposes to represent the number of shares of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation into which they were converted in accordance with the
immediately preceding sentence.



(d)Notwithstanding the foregoing, if between the date of this Agreement and
the Effective Time the outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock or Company
Common Shares shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a
different class, by reason of any stock dividend, recapitalization, split,
reverse split, combination, consolidation, subdivision, reclassification or
exchange of shares, or any similar event shall have occurred (or any record
date occurs with respect to any of the foregoing), then the Merger
Consideration, the number of shares of Parent Common Stock to be delivered in
the Merger, the Mixed Consideration, the Mixed Election Stock Exchange Ratio,
the Cash Election Consideration, the Stock Election Consideration and the
Exchange Ratio, as the case may be, will be appropriately adjusted to provide
to Parent and the holders of Company Common Shares the same economic effect as
contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event; provided, however, that
this sentence shall not be construed to permit Parent or the Company to take
any action with respect to its securities that is prohibited by Section
5.01(a) or 5.01(b), as applicable.



SECTION 2.02Election Procedures.



(a)Election Form. Not less than 30 days prior to the anticipated Effective
Time or on such other date as Parent and the Company mutually agree (the
"Mailing Date"), the Company shall mail an election form and other appropriate
and customary transmittal materials, in such form mutually acceptable to
Parent and the Company (the "Election Form"), to each holder of record of
Company Common Shares (other than shares of Company Common Shares described in
Section 2.01(a)) as of a record date that is five Business Days prior to the
Mailing Date or such other date as mutually agreed to by Parent and the
Company.



(b)Choice of Election. Each Election Form shall permit the holder (or the
beneficial owner through customary documentation and instructions) to specify
(i) the number of Company Common Shares with respect to which such holder
elects to receive the Mixed Consideration, (ii) the number of Company Common
Shares with respect to which such holder elects to receive the Stock Election
Consideration, (iii) the number of Company Common Shares with respect to which
such holder elects to receive the Cash Election Consideration or (iv) that
such holder makes no election with respect to such holder\'s Company Common
Shares. Any Company Common Shares with respect to which the Exchange Agent
does not receive a properly completed Election Form during the period (the
"Election Period") from the Mailing Date to 5:00 p.m., New York time, on the
second Business Day prior to the Effective Time or such other time as mutually
agreed by Parent and the Company (the "Election Deadline") shall be deemed to
be No Election Shares. Parent shall publicly announce the anticipated Election
Deadline at least five Business Days prior to the Election Deadline. If the
Effective Time is delayed to a subsequent date, the Election Deadline shall be
similarly delayed to a subsequent date (which shall be the second Business Day
prior to the Effective Time or such other date as mutually agreed to by Parent
and the Company), and Parent shall promptly announce any such 

delay and, when determined, the rescheduled Election Deadline. For the
purposes of this Agreement, "No Election Share" means each Company Common
Share for which no election to receive Mixed Consideration, Cash Election
Consideration or Stock Election Consideration has been properly made in
accordance with the terms of this Section 2.02 or for which such election has
been properly revoked in accordance with the terms of this Section 2.02.



(c)New Holders. Parent shall make available one or more Election Forms as may
reasonably be requested from time to time by all persons who become holders or
beneficial owners of Company Common Shares during the Election Period, and the
Company shall provide the Exchange Agent all information reasonably necessary
for it to perform its duties as specified herein.



(d)Revocations; Exchange Agent. Any election shall have been properly made
only if the Exchange Agent shall have actually received a properly completed
Election Form during the Election Period. After a Cash Election, a Stock
Election or a Mixed Election has been properly made with respect to any
Company Common Shares, any subsequent transfer of such Company Common Shares
shall automatically revoke such election. Any Election Form may be revoked or
changed by the person submitting it, by written notice received by the
Exchange Agent during the Election Period. In the event an Election Form is
revoked during the Election Period, the Company Common Shares represented by
such Election Form shall be deemed to be No Election Shares, except to the
extent a subsequent election is properly made during the Election Period.
Subject to the terms of this Agreement and of the Election Form, the Exchange
Agent shall have reasonable discretion to determine whether any election,
revocation or change has been properly or timely made and to disregard
immaterial defects in the Election Forms, and any good faith decisions of the
Exchange Agent regarding such matters shall be binding and conclusive. None of
Parent or the Company or the Exchange Agent shall be under any obligation to
notify any person of any defect in an Election Form.



SECTION 2.03Payment for Securities; Exchange.



(a)Exchange Agent. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint a bank or
trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as exchange agent
(the "Exchange Agent") for the exchange of Company Common Shares for Merger
Consideration. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with
the Exchange Agent, in trust for the benefit of the former holders of Company
Common Shares entitled to receive Merger Consideration under Section 2.01(b),
for exchange in accordance with this Article II through the Exchange Agent,
(i) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock issuable to such holders and
(ii) an amount of cash sufficient in order for the Exchange Agent to
distribute the cash amounts described in Section 2.01(b). From time to time as
needed as reasonably determined by Parent, Parent shall deposit with the
Exchange Agent cash sufficient to make payments in lieu of fractional shares
pursuant to Section 2.03(h). All such cash and shares of Parent Common Stock
deposited with the Exchange Agent is hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange
Fund." The Exchange Agent will, pursuant to irrevocable instructions from
Parent and the Company, deliver the Merger Consideration contemplated to be
paid for Company Common Shares pursuant to this Agreement out of the Exchange
Fund. Subject to Section 2.03(k), the Exchange Fund will not be used for any
other purpose. 

(b)Certificates. As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent
shall cause the Exchange Agent to deliver to each record holder, as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time, of Certificates a notice advising
such holder of the effectiveness of the Merger and a form of letter of
transmittal (the "Letter of Transmittal"), which shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to any Certificates shall pass,
only upon delivery of such Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in
customary form and agreed to by Parent and the Company prior to the Effective
Time, together with instructions thereto (in customary form and agreed to by
Parent and the Company prior to the Effective Time).



(c)Non-DTC Book-Entry Shares. As promptly as practicable after the Effective
Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to deliver to each record holder,
as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, of Company Common Shares
represented by Book-Entry Shares not held through the Depository Trust Company
("DTC"), (i) a notice advising such holders of the effectiveness of the
Merger, (ii) a statement reflecting the number of shares of Parent Common
Stock (which shall be in uncertificated book-entry form) representing, in the
aggregate, the whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock, if any, that
such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.01(b) (after taking
into account all Company Common Shares then held by such holder) and (iii) a
check in the amount equal to the aggregate amount of cash that such holder has
the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.01(b) and this Article II,
including cash payable in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock
pursuant to Section 2.03(h).



(d)DTC Book-Entry Shares. With respect to Book-Entry Shares held through DTC,
Parent and the Company shall cooperate to establish procedures with the
Exchange Agent and DTC to ensure that the Exchange Agent will transmit to DTC
or its nominees as soon as reasonably practicable on or after the Closing
Date, upon surrender of Company Common Shares held of record by DTC or its
nominees in accordance with DTC\'s customary surrender procedures, the Merger
Consideration pursuant to Section 2.01(b) and cash in lieu of fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.03(h), in each case, that
DTC has the right to receive pursuant to this Article II.



(e)Merger Consideration Received in Connection with Exchange. After the
Effective Time, upon the surrender of a Certificate for cancelation to the
Exchange Agent together with the Letter of Transmittal, duly completed and
validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other
documents as may reasonably be required pursuant to the instructions
accompanying the Letter of Transmittal, the holder of such Certificate shall
be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (A) the Merger Consideration into
which the Company Common Shares previously represented by such Certificate
have been converted pursuant to Section 2.01(b) and (B) any cash in lieu of
fractional shares which such holder has the right to receive pursuant to
Section 2.03(h). With respect to Book-Entry Shares, after the Effective Time,
payment of the Merger Consideration (including any cash in lieu of fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.03(h)) shall only be made
to the Person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares are registered in the stock
transfer records of the Company as of the Effective Time. In the event of a
transfer of ownership of Company Common Shares that is not registered in the
transfer records of the Company, the proper number of shares of Parent Common
Stock pursuant to Section 2.01(b) and cash in lieu of fractional shares which
the holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.03(h) may be issued
to a transferee if the Certificate 

(or, for Book-Entry Shares, proper evidence of such transfer) representing
such Company Common Shares is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by
all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence
that any applicable stock transfer Taxes have been paid. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this Section 2.03(e), each Certificate shall be deemed at any
time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such
surrender the Merger Consideration which the holder of such Certificates were
entitled to receive pursuant to Section 2.01(b) (and cash in lieu of
fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.03(h)). No interest shall be paid or
shall accrue on the cash payable under this Section 2.03(e) or under Section
2.03(f) or Section 2.03(h).



(f)Treatment of Unexchanged Shares. No dividends or other distributions
declared or made with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock with a record
date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
Certificate with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon
surrender thereof, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares shall be
paid to any such holder pursuant to Section 2.03(h), until the surrender of
such Certificate in accordance with this Article II. Subject to abandoned
property, escheat, Tax or other applicable Law, following surrender of any
such Certificate, there shall be paid to the holder of the shares of Parent
Common Stock issued in exchange therefor (i) at the time of such surrender,
the amount of any cash payable in lieu of a fractional share of Parent Common
Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.03(h) and the
amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time previously paid with respect to such whole shares of Parent
Common Stock and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends
or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior
to such surrender and a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with
respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock.



(g)No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Shares. The shares of Parent
Common Stock issued and cash paid in accordance with the terms of this Article
II upon conversion of any Company Common Shares (including any cash paid
pursuant to Section 2.03(h)) shall be deemed to have been issued and paid in
full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Company Common Shares. From
and after the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of Company
Common Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.
Subject to the last sentence of Section 2.03(j), if, after the Effective Time,
any Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented for transfer to the
Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall
be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article II.



(h)No Fractional Shares. No certificates or scrip representing fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the conversion of Company
Common Shares pursuant to Section 2.01, and such fractional share interests
shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights of a holder of
Parent Common Stock. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement,
each holder of Company Common Shares converted pursuant to the Merger who
would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent
Common Stock (after taking into account all Company Common Shares exchanged by
such holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash in an amount equal to such
fractional amount multiplied by the average of the volume weighted average
price per share of Parent Common 

Stock on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") (as reported by Bloomberg, L.P.
or, if not reported by Bloomberg, L.P., in another authoritative source
mutually selected by Parent and the Company) on each of the five consecutive
trading days ending with the last complete trading day prior to the Closing
Date.



(i)Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including
any interest or other amounts received with respect thereto) that remains
undistributed to the holders of Company Common Shares for six months after the
Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any former
holder of Company Common Shares who has not previously complied with this
Article II shall thereafter look only to Parent for, and Parent shall remain
liable for, payment of its claim for Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of
fractional shares and any dividends and other distributions to which such
holder is entitled pursuant to this Article II.



(j)No Liability. None of Parent, the Company or the Exchange Agent shall be
liable to any Person in respect of any portion of the Exchange Fund delivered
to any Governmental Entity pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate shall not have been surrendered or
transferred prior to the date on which any Merger Consideration in respect
thereof would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental
Entity pursuant to applicable Law, any Merger Consideration in respect of such
Certificate shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the
property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interests of any Person
previously entitled thereto.



(k)Investment of Exchange Fund. The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash in
the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent; provided, that (i) such investments
shall be in (A) short term obligations of the United States with maturities of
no more than 30 days or guaranteed by the United States and backed by the full
faith and credit of the United States, (B) commercial paper obligations of
issuers organized under the Law of a state of the United States of America,
rated A1 or P1 or better by Moody\'s Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and
Poor\'s Corporation, respectively or (C) certificates of deposit, bank
repurchase agreements or banker\'s acceptances of commercial banks with
capital exceeding $1 billion, and (ii) no such investment shall have a
maturity of more than 30 days. Any interest and other income resulting from
such investments shall be paid to Parent; provided, however, that no
investment of the Exchange Fund shall relieve Parent or the Exchange Agent
from promptly making the payments required by this Article II, and following
any losses from any such investment, Parent shall promptly provide additional
cash funds to the Exchange Agent for the benefit of the holders of Company
Common Shares at the Effective Time in the amount of such losses, which
additional funds will be deemed to be part of the Exchange Fund.



(l)Withholding Rights. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, Parent, the Company, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, LLC Sub
and the Exchange Agent (without duplication) shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement
such amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld under the Code or
any similar provisions of state, local or foreign Tax law. Any such amounts so
deducted or withheld shall be paid over to the relevant Governmental Entity by
Parent, the Company, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange
Agent, as the case may be, and such deducted or withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of 

this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such
deduction or withholding was made.



(m)Lost Certificates. If any Certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the
posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable and customary amount as
Parent may direct, as indemnity against any Claim that may be made against it
with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent (or, if subsequent to the
termination of the Exchange Fund and subject to Section 2.03(i), Parent) shall
deliver and pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate,
the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares and any
dividends or other distributions in respect thereof pursuant to this Section
2.03.



SECTION 2.04Further Action. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any
further action is determined by Parent to be necessary or desirable to carry
out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation with
full right, title and possession of and to all rights and property of Merger
Sub and the Company, the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation
and Parent shall be fully authorized (in the name of Merger Sub, in the name
of the Company and otherwise) to take such action. Parent, Merger Sub and the
Surviving Corporation also shall take such further actions as may be necessary
or desirable to ensure that the Exchange Agent sends out the Letters of
Transmittal to the Company Shareholders and issues certificates or evidence of
shares in book-entry form representing shares of Parent Common Stock to such
shareholders in accordance with Section 2.03.



ARTICLE III



Representations and Warranties of Parent and Merger Sub

Parent and Merger Sub jointly and severally represent and warrant to the
Company that the statements contained in this Article III are true and
correct, except (i) as set forth in the Parent Reporting Documents publicly
available and filed with or furnished to the SEC since January 1, 2017 (the
"Filed Parent Reporting Documents") (excluding any disclosures in the Filed
Parent Reporting Documents under the heading "Risk Factors" and in any section
related to forward-looking statements and in any other disclosures that are
similarly predictive or forward-looking in nature (other than any historical
factual information contained within such headings, statements or disclosure))
or (ii) as set forth in the disclosure letter delivered by Parent and Merger
Sub to the Company prior to the execution and delivery by Parent and Merger
Sub of this Agreement (the "Parent Disclosure Letter"). The Parent Disclosure
Letter shall be arranged in numbered and lettered sections corresponding to
the numbered and lettered sections contained in this Article III, and the
disclosure in any section shall be deemed to qualify other sections in this
Article III to the extent (and only to the extent) that it is reasonably
apparent from the face of such disclosure that such disclosure also qualifies
or applies to such other sections. The mere inclusion of an item in the Parent
Disclosure Letter as an exception to a representation or warranty is not
deemed an admission that such item represents a material exception or material
fact, event or circumstance or that such item has had or would reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse
Effect. 

SECTION 3.01Organization, Standing and Power. Each of Parent and each of
Parent\'s Subsidiaries (the "Parent Subsidiaries") is duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction in which it
is organized (in the case of good standing, to the extent such jurisdiction
recognizes such concept), with all requisite entity power and authority to
own, operate or lease its properties and assets and to carry on its business
as now being conducted except where the failure to be so organized, existing
or in good standing, or to have such power or authority, individually or in
the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a
Parent Material Adverse Effect. Parent and each Parent Subsidiary is duly
qualified or licensed to do business in each jurisdiction where the nature of
its business or the ownership, operation or leasing of its properties and
assets makes such qualification necessary, other than in such jurisdictions
where the failure to be so qualified or licensed, individually or in the
aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect. Parent has made available to the Company, prior to
execution of this Agreement, true and correct copies of the certificate of
incorporation of Parent in effect as of the date of this Agreement (the
"Parent Charter"), the bylaws of Parent in effect as of the date of this
Agreement (the "Parent Bylaws"), the articles of incorporation of Merger Sub
in effect as of the date of this Agreement (the "Merger Sub Charter") and the
bylaws of Merger Sub in effect as of the date of this Agreement (the "Merger
Sub Bylaws"). Neither Parent nor Merger Sub is in material violation of any of
the provisions of such Organizational Documents.



SECTION 3.02Parent Subsidiaries.



(a)All the outstanding shares of capital stock or voting securities of, or
other equity interests in, each Parent Subsidiary have been validly issued and
are fully paid and nonassessable and are (other than qualifying shares and
shares held by natural persons pursuant to requirements of Law of non-U.S.
jurisdictions) wholly owned by Parent, by another Parent Subsidiary or by
Parent and another Parent Subsidiary, free and clear of all pledges, liens,
claims, charges, mortgages, encumbrances and security interests of any kind or
nature whatsoever (collectively, "Liens"), and free of any other restriction
(including any restriction on the right to vote, sell or otherwise dispose of
such capital stock, voting securities or other equity interests), except for
restrictions imposed by applicable securities Laws and, in each case, except
for Permitted Liens. Section 3.02(a) of the Parent Disclosure Letter sets
forth, as of the date of this Agreement, a true and complete list of the
Parent Subsidiaries, together with (i) the jurisdiction of incorporation or
organization, as the case may be, of each Parent Subsidiary, (ii) the type of
and percentage of interest held, directly or indirectly, by Parent in each
Parent Subsidiary and (iii) the names of and the type of and percentage of
interest held by any Person other than Parent or a Parent Subsidiary in each
Parent Subsidiary.



(b)Except for the capital stock and voting securities of, and other equity
interests in, the Parent Subsidiaries, neither Parent nor any Parent
Subsidiary owns, directly or indirectly, any capital stock or voting
securities of, or other equity interests in, or any interest convertible into
or exchangeable or exercisable for, any capital stock or voting securities of,
or other equity interests in, any firm, corporation, partnership, company,
limited liability company, trust, joint venture, association or other entity
other than ordinary course investments in publicly traded securities
constituting one percent or less of a class of outstanding securities of any
entity.

bound (including the Parent Stock Plans). The shares of Parent Common Stock
constituting the Stock Consideration will be, when issued, (A) duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and not subject to,
or issued in violation of, any purchase option, call option, right of first
refusal, preemptive right, subscription right or any similar right under any
provision of the DGCL, the Parent Charter, the Parent Bylaws or any Contract
to which Parent or any Parent Subsidiary is a party or otherwise bound and (B)
issued in compliance with applicable securities Laws. Except as set forth
above in this Section 3.03 or pursuant to this Agreement, there are not
issued, reserved for issuance or outstanding, and there are no outstanding
obligations of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary to issue, deliver or sell, or
cause to be issued, delivered or sold, (x) any capital stock or voting

or any securities of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary convertible into or
exchangeable or exercisable for any capital stock or voting securities of, or
other equity interests in, Parent or any Parent Subsidiary, (y) any warrants,
calls, options or other rights to acquire from Parent or any Parent
Subsidiary, or any other obligation of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary to
issue, deliver or sell, or cause to be issued, delivered or sold, any capital
stock or voting securities of, or other equity interests in, Parent or any
Parent Subsidiary or (z) any rights issued by or other obligations of Parent
or any Parent Subsidiary that are linked in any way to the price of any
capital stock or voting securities of, or other equity interests in, Parent or
any Parent Subsidiary, the value of Parent, any Parent Subsidiary or any part
of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary or any dividends or other distributions
declared or paid on any capital stock or voting securities of, or other equity
interests in, Parent or any Parent 

Subsidiary. Except pursuant to the Parent Stock Plans, there are not any
outstanding obligations of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary to repurchase,
redeem or otherwise acquire any capital stock or voting securities of, or
other equity interests in, Parent or any Parent Subsidiary or any securities,
interests, warrants, calls, options or other rights referred to in clause (x),
(y) or (z) of the immediately preceding sentence. There are no debentures,
bonds, notes or other Indebtedness of Parent having the right to vote (or
convertible into, or exchangeable for, securities having the right to vote) on
any matters on which the Parent Stockholders may vote (collectively, "Parent
Voting Debt"). Neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary is a party to any
voting agreement with respect to the voting of any capital stock or voting
securities of, or other equity interests in, Parent or any Parent Subsidiary.
Except for this Agreement, neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary is a party
to any agreement pursuant to which any Person is entitled to elect, designate
or nominate any director of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary.



(c)The authorized capital stock of Merger Sub consists solely of 100 shares of
common stock, par value $0.01 per share, all of which are validly issued and
outstanding. All of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Merger Sub have
been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid and nonassessable.
All of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Merger Sub is, and as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time will be, owned by Parent or a Parent
Subsidiary. Merger Sub has no outstanding option, warrant, right or any other
agreement pursuant to which any Person other than Parent may acquire any
equity security of Merger Sub. Merger Sub has not conducted any business prior
to the date hereof and has, and prior to the Effective Time, will have, no
assets, liabilities or obligations of any nature other than those incident to
its formation and pursuant to this Agreement and the Transactions, including
the Merger.



SECTION 3.04Authority; Execution and Delivery; Enforceability.



(a)Each of Parent and Merger Sub has all requisite corporate power and
authority to execute and deliver this Agreement, to perform its obligations
hereunder and to consummate the Transactions, including the Merger, subject,
in the case of the Share Issuance and Parent Charter Amendment, to the receipt
of the Parent Stockholder Approval.



(b)The Parent Board has adopted resolutions, by unanimous vote at a meeting

in all material respects. Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has
taken, or agreed, committed, arranged, authorized or entered into any
understanding to take, any action that, if taken after the date of the
Agreement, would (without the Company's prior written consent) have
constituted a breach of any of the covenants set forth in Sections 5.01(a)(i),
(iv), (v), (vi), (x), (xii) or (xiv) (solely as it relates to the foregoing
Sections 5.01(a)(i), (iv), (v), (vi), (x) or (xii)).

material Taxes that are due and payable by it (other than Taxes that are being
contested in good faith by appropriate Proceedings and for which adequate
reserves have been established in accordance with GAAP in the financial
statements included in the Filed Parent Reporting Documents). There is no
outstanding material Claim, assessment or deficiency against Parent or any
Parent Subsidiary for any Tax that has been asserted or threatened in writing
by any Governmental Entity (except for any such Claim, assessment or
deficiency that is being contested in good faith by appropriate Proceedings
and for which adequate reserves have been established in accordance with GAAP
in the financial statements included in the Filed Parent Reporting Documents).
All material withholding Tax requirements imposed on or with respect to Parent
or any of the Parent Subsidiaries have been satisfied in full.



(b)There are no material disputes, audits, examinations, investigations or
Proceedings pending or threatened in writing in respect of any Taxes or Tax
Return of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary. No requests for waivers of the time
to assess any material Taxes are pending or in force.



(c)Other than for Taxes not yet due and payable or that are being contested in
good faith by appropriate Proceedings and for which adequate reserves have
been established in accordance with GAAP in the financial statements included
in the Filed Parent Reporting Documents, there are no Liens with respect to
material Taxes against any of the properties or assets of Parent or any Parent
Subsidiary. No written or, to the Knowledge of Parent, other claim has been
received by Parent or any Parent Subsidiary from a Governmental Entity in a
jurisdiction in which Parent or any Parent Subsidiary does not file Tax
Returns stating that Parent or any Parent Subsidiary is or may be subject to
material taxation by such 

jurisdiction. Neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary is a party to or is
otherwise bound by any material Tax sharing, allocation or indemnification
Contract (other than (i) a Contract exclusively between or among Parent and
wholly owned Parent Subsidiaries or (ii) any Tax sharing, allocation or
indemnification provisions contained in any Contract entered into in the

than Parent or any Parent Subsidiary) under Treasury Regulations § 1.1502-6
(or any similar provision of state, local or foreign Law) or as a transferee
or successor.

party to a transaction that, as of the date of this Agreement, constitutes a
"listed transaction," as defined in Treasury Regulations § 1.6011-4(b)(2).

corporation" or a "controlled corporation" (or a successor thereto) in a
distribution of stock intended to qualify for tax-free treatment under section
355 of the Code (i) in the two years prior to the date of this Agreement or
(ii) as part of a "plan" or "series of related transactions" (within the
meaning of section 355(e) of the Code) in conjunction with the Transactions.



(f)Parent is not an "investment company" within the meaning of section
368(a)(2)(F) of the Code.



(g)After reasonable diligence, neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary is
aware of the existence of any fact, or has taken or agreed to take any action,
that could reasonably be expected to prevent the Integrated Mergers, taken
together, from qualifying as a "reorganization" within the meaning of section
368(a) of the Code.



SECTION 3.10Employee Benefits.



(a)Section 3.10(a) of the Parent Disclosure Letter sets forth a true and
complete list of each material Parent Benefit Plan.



(b)With respect to each material Parent Benefit Plan, Parent has made
available to the Company true and correct copies, to the extent applicable, of
(i) such Parent Benefit Plan, including any material amendment thereto, and if

annuity or other funding Contract related thereto, (iii) the most recent
audited financial statements and actuarial or other valuation reports prepared
with respect thereto, (iv) the two most recent annual reports on Form 5500
required to be filed with the IRS with respect thereto and the two most recent
annual information returns required to be filed with any Governmental Entity
and (v) the most recently received IRS determination letter or opinion.

reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect, each Parent
Benefit Plan (and any related trust or other funding vehicle) has been
maintained in compliance with its terms and applicable Law (including ERISA
and the Code). Each Parent Benefit Plan that is intended to be 

"qualified" within the meaning of section 401(a) of the Code is so qualified
and has received a favorable determination letter from the IRS or is entitled
to rely upon a favorable opinion issued by the IRS, and, except as would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect, there are no circumstances or any events that have
occurred that would reasonably be expected to cause the loss of such
qualification status of any such Parent Benefit Plan. Except as has not had
and would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
have a Parent Material Adverse Effect, there are no pending or, to the
Knowledge of Parent, threatened claims by, on behalf of or against any Parent
Benefit Plan or any trust related thereto that could result in any liability
to Parent or any of the Parent Subsidiaries, and no audit or other Proceeding
by a Governmental Entity is pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened
with respect to any Parent Benefit Plan.



(d)During the previous six years, neither Parent, any of its Subsidiaries nor
any of their respective ERISA Affiliates has maintained, sponsored,
participated in or contributed to (or been obligated to maintain, sponsor,
participate in or contribute to), (i) an employee benefit plan subject to
section 412 of the Code or section 302 or Title IV of ERISA, (ii) a
"multiemployer plan" (as defined in section 3(37) of ERISA), or (iii) a
"multiple employer plan" as defined in section 210 of ERISA or section 413(c)
of the Code. No material liability under section 302 or Title IV of ERISA or
section 412 of the Code has been incurred by Parent that has not been
satisfied in full (other than any liability for premiums to the Pension
Benefit Guaranty Corporation arising in the ordinary course of business, all
of which have been timely paid) and no condition exists that could reasonably
be expected to result in any such material liability to Parent. Parent has not
been required to post any security under ERISA or section 436 of the Code with
respect to any Parent Benefit Plan, and no fact or event exists that could
reasonably be expected to give rise to any such lien or requirement to post
any such security with respect to any Parent Benefit Plan.



(e)Except as has not had and would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect, neither
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries has any liability for providing health,
medical or life insurance or other welfare benefits (whether or not insured)
with respect to any Parent Personnel (or any of their beneficiaries) after
retirement or other termination of employment, other than coverage or benefits
(i) required to be provided under Part 6 of Title I of ERISA, section
4980(B)(f) of the Code or any other applicable Law or (ii) the full cost of
which is borne by such Parent Personnel (or any of their beneficiaries).



(f)None of the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the performance by
either party of its obligations hereunder or the consummation of the
Transactions, including the Merger (alone or in combination with any other
event) will (i) accelerate the time of payment or vesting, or trigger any
payment or funding, of any material compensation or benefit or trigger any
other material obligation under any Parent Benefit Plan, or (ii) result in any
amount failing to be deductible under section 280G of the Code. No Parent
Benefit Plan provides for the gross-up or reimbursement of Taxes under section
4999 of the Code or section 409A of the Code.



(g)The representations and warranties in this Section 3.10 are the sole and
exclusive representations and warranties of Parent relating to Parent Benefit
Plans (including their compliance with any applicable Law) or ERISA, and no
other representation or warranty of 

Parent in this Agreement shall be construed to relate to Parent Benefit Plans
(including their compliance with any applicable Law) or ERISA

aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect, Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries are in compliance
with all applicable Laws relating to labor and employment, including, without
limitation, those relating to labor management relations, wages, hours,
overtime, non-discrimination, non-retaliation, sexual harassment, civil

Knowledge of Parent, no employee of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary is in any
material respect in violation of any term of any employment agreement,
nondisclosure agreement, common law nondisclosure obligation, fiduciary duty,
non-competition agreement, restrictive covenant or other obligation: (i) to
Parent or any Parent Subsidiary or (ii) to a former employer of any such
employee relating (A) to the right of any such employee to be employed by

action or other Proceeding pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened
against Parent or any Parent Subsidiary that, individually or in the
aggregate, has had and would reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material
Adverse Effect, nor is there any Judgment outstanding against or, to the
Knowledge of Parent, written demand or investigation by any Governmental
Entity involving Parent or any Parent Subsidiary or any of their respective
properties or assets that, individually or in the aggregate, has had and would

all applicable Laws and the Parent Permits. To the Knowledge of Parent, except
for matters that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect, as of the
date of this Agreement, there is no demand or investigation by or before any
Governmental Entity pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened
alleging that Parent or any Parent Subsidiary is not in compliance with any
applicable Law or Parent Permit. This Section 3.13 does not relate to Tax
matters or environmental matters, which are the subjects of Section 3.09 and
Section 3.16, respectively.



SECTION 3.14Rights-of-Way. Each of Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries has such
Consents, easements, rights-of-way, Permits and licenses from each Person
(collectively "Rights-of-Way") as are sufficient to conduct its business in
the manner currently conducted, except for such Rights-of-Way the absence of
which have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually
or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Each of Parent and the
Parent Subsidiaries has fulfilled and performed all its material obligations

termination thereof or would result in any impairment of the rights of the
holder of any such Rights-of-Way, except for such violations, revocations,
terminations and impairments that would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. All
pipelines operated by Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries are subject to
Rights-of-Way or are located on real property owned or leased by Parent, and
there are no gaps (including any gap arising as a result of any breach by
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries of the terms of any Rights-of-Way) in the

individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

(a)Except as has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect, and except for property (i) sold or otherwise
disposed of in the ordinary course of business since the date of the reserve
report prepared by DeGolyer and MacNaughton (the "Parent Independent Petroleum
Engineers") relating to Parent interests referred to therein as of December
31, 2017 (the "Parent Reserve Report") or (ii) reflected in the Parent Reserve
Report or in the Filed Parent Reporting Documents as having been sold or
otherwise disposed of, other than sales or dispositions after the date hereof
in accordance with Section 5.01, Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries have good
and defensible title to all Oil and Gas Properties forming the basis for the
reserves reflected in the Parent Reserve Report and in each case as
attributable to interests owned by Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries, free
and clear of all conditions, encroachments, easements, rights of way,
restrictions and Liens, except for Permitted Liens and conditions,
encroachments, easements, rights of way, restrictions or Liens which,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to
materially impair the continued use and operation of the Oil and Gas
Properties to which they relate by Parent and each Parent Subsidiary. For
purposes of the foregoing sentence, "good and defensible title" 

means that title of Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries in and to the Oil and
Gas Properties set forth on the Parent Reserve Report that, as of the Closing
Date, and subject to Permitted Liens (1) entitles Parent (or one or more of
the Parent Subsidiaries, as applicable) to receive (after satisfaction of all
Production Burdens applicable thereto), not less than the net revenue interest
percentage shown for such Oil and Gas Property in the Parent Reserve Report,
except, in each case, (i) any decreases in connection with those operations in
which Parent or a Parent Subsidiary may elect after the date hereof to be a
non-consenting co-owner, and (ii) any decreases resulting from the
establishment or amendment, after the date hereof, of pools or units, and
(iii) decreases required to allow other working interest owners to make up
past underproduction or pipelines to make up past under deliveries, (2) as to
any Well, obligates Parent (or one or more of the Parent Subsidiaries, as

working interest shown for such Well in the Parent Reserve Report, except (i)
increases that are accompanied by at least a proportionate increase in
Parent\'s and the Parent Subsidiaries\' aggregate net revenue interest
therein, and (ii) for increases resulting from contribution requirements with
respect to defaulting or non-consenting co-owners under applicable operating
agreements or Laws that are accompanied by at least a proportionate increase
in Parent's and the Parent Subsidiaries' aggregate net revenue interest
therein and (3) is free and clear of all Liens, conditions, encroachments,
easements, rights of way, restrictions, burdens and/or irregularities which,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to
materially impair the continued use and operation of the Oil and Gas
Properties to which they relate in the conduct of the business of Parent and
each Parent Subsidiary as presently conducted.



(b)Except for any such matters that, individually or in the aggregate, have
not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect, the factual, non-interpretive data supplied to the Parent Independent
Petroleum Engineers, by or on behalf of Parent and its Subsidiaries that was
material to such firm\'s estimates of proved oil and gas reserves attributable
to the Oil and Gas Properties of Parent and its Subsidiaries in connection
with the preparation of the Parent Reserve Report was, as of the time
provided, accurate in all respects. Except for any such matters that,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
Parent Material Adverse Effect, the oil and gas reserve estimates of Parent
set forth in the Parent Reserve Report are derived from reports that have been
prepared by the Parent Independent Petroleum Engineers, and such reserve
estimates fairly reflect, in all respects, the oil and gas reserves of Parent
at the dates indicated therein and are in accordance with SEC guidelines
applicable thereto applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods
involved. Except for changes generally affecting the oil and gas exploration,
development and production industry (including changes in commodity prices)
and normal depletion by production, as of the date of this Agreement there has
been no change in respect of the matters addressed in the Parent Reserve
Report that would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect, (i) all
rentals, shut-ins and similar payments owed to any Person or individual under
(or otherwise with respect to) any Oil and Gas Leases of Parent or any Parent
Subsidiary have been properly and timely paid, (ii) all Production Burdens
with respect to any Oil and Gas Properties owned or held by Parent or any of
the Parent Subsidiaries have been timely and properly paid (in each case,
except such 

Production Burdens (x) as are being currently paid prior to delinquency in the
ordinary course of business or (y) the amount or validity of which is being
contested in good faith by appropriate proceeding and for which appropriate
reserves have been established) and (iii) none of Parent or any of the Parent
Subsidiaries (and, to Parent\'s Knowledge, no third-party operator) has
violated any provision of, or taken or failed to take any act that, with or
without notice, lapse of time, or both, would constitute a default under the
provisions of any Oil and Gas Lease (or entitle the lessor thereunder to
cancel or terminate such Oil and Gas Lease) included in the Oil and Gas
Properties owned or held by Parent or any of the Parent Subsidiaries.



(d)Except as has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect, all
proceeds from the sale of Hydrocarbons produced from the Oil and Gas
Properties of Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries are being received by them in
a timely manner other than awaiting preparation and approval of division order
title opinions for recently drilled Wells.

Return of the Company or any Company Subsidiary. No requests for waivers of
the time to assess any material Taxes are pending or in force.



(c)Other than for Taxes not yet due and payable or that are being contested in
good faith by appropriate Proceedings and for which adequate reserves have
been established in accordance with GAAP in the financial statements included
in the Filed Company Reporting Documents, there are no Liens with respect to
material Taxes against any of the properties or assets of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary. No written or, to the Knowledge of the Company, other
claim has been received by the Company or any Company Subsidiary from a
Governmental Entity in a jurisdiction in which the Company or any Company
Subsidiary does not file Tax Returns stating that the Company or any Company
Subsidiary is or may be subject to material taxation by such jurisdiction.

bound by any material Tax sharing, allocation or indemnification Contract
(other than (i) a Contract exclusively between or among the Company and wholly
owned Company Subsidiaries or (ii) any Tax sharing, allocation or
indemnification provisions contained in any Contract entered into in the
ordinary course of business and not primarily relating to Taxes (e.g., leases,

"distributing corporation" or a "controlled corporation" (or a successor

Agreement or (ii) as part of a "plan" or "series of related transactions"
(within the meaning of section 355(e) of the Code) in conjunction with the
Transactions.



(f)The Company is not an "investment company" within the meaning of section
368(a)(2)(F) of the Code.



(g)After reasonable diligence, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary
is aware of the existence of any fact, or has taken or agreed to take any
action, that 

could reasonably be expected to prevent the Integrated Mergers, taken
together, from qualifying as a "reorganization" within the meaning of section
368(a) of the Code.



SECTION 4.10Employee Benefits.



(a)Section 4.10(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a true and
complete list of each material Company Benefit Plan.

reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, each Company

within the meaning of section 401(a) of the Code is so qualified and has
received a favorable determination letter from the IRS or is entitled to rely
upon a favorable opinion issued by the IRS, and, except as would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect, there are no circumstances or any events that have
occurred that would reasonably be expected to cause the loss of such
qualification status of any such Company Benefit Plan. Except as has not had
and would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
have a Company Material Adverse Effect, there are no pending or, to the
Knowledge of the Company, threatened claims by, on behalf of or against any
Company Benefit Plan or any trust related thereto that could result in any
liability to the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, and no audit or
other Proceeding by a Governmental Entity is pending or, to the Knowledge of
the Company, threatened with respect to any Company Benefit Plan.



(d)During the previous six years, neither the Company, any of its Subsidiaries
nor any of their respective ERISA Affiliates has maintained, sponsored,
participated in or contributed to (or been obligated to maintain, sponsor,

section 412 of the Code or section 302 or Title IV of ERISA, (ii) a
"multiemployer plan" (as defined in section 3(37) of ERISA), or (iii) a

of the Code. No material liability under section 302 or Title IV of ERISA or
section 412 of the Code has been incurred by the Company that has not been
satisfied in full (other than any liability for premiums to the Pension
Benefit Guaranty Corporation arising in the ordinary course of business, all
of which have been timely paid) and no condition exists that could reasonably
be expected to result in any such material liability to the Company. The
Company has not been required to post any security under ERISA or section 436
of the Code with respect to any Company Benefit Plan, and no fact or 

event exists that could reasonably be expected to give rise to any such lien
or requirement to post any such security with respect to any Company Benefit
Plan.



(e)Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries has any liability for providing health, medical or
life insurance or other welfare benefits (whether or not insured) with respect
to any Company Personnel (or any of their beneficiaries) after retirement or
other termination of employment, other than coverage or benefits (i) required
to be provided under Part 6 of Title I of ERISA, section 4980(B)(f) of the
Code or any other applicable Law or (ii) the full cost of which is borne by
such Company Personnel (or any of their beneficiaries).



(f)None of the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the performance by
either party of its obligations hereunder or the consummation of the
Transactions, including the Merger (alone or in combination with any other
event) will (i) accelerate the time of payment or vesting, or trigger any
payment or funding, of any material compensation or benefit or trigger any
other material obligation under any Company Benefit Plan, or (ii) result in
any amount failing to be deductible under section 280G of the Code. No Company
Benefit Plan provides for the gross-up or reimbursement of Taxes under section
4999 of the Code or section 409A of the Code.



(g)The representations and warranties in this Section 4.10 are the sole and
exclusive representations and warranties of the Company relating to Company
Benefit Plans (including their compliance with any applicable Law) or ERISA,
and no other representation or warranty of the Company in this Agreement shall
be construed to relate to Company Benefit Plans (including their compliance
with any applicable Law) or ERISA.

Knowledge of the Company, no employee of the Company or any Company Subsidiary
is in any material respect in violation of any term of any employment
agreement, nondisclosure agreement, common law nondisclosure obligation,
fiduciary duty, non-competition agreement, restrictive covenant or other
obligation: (i) to the Company or any Company Subsidiary or (ii) to a former
employer of any such employee relating (A) to the right of any such employee
to be employed by the Company or any Company Subsidiary or (B) to the

of the Company, except for matters that, individually or in the aggregate,

Adverse Effect, there is no demand or investigation by or before any
Governmental Entity pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened

any applicable Law or Company Permit. This Section 4.13 does not relate to Tax

Section 4.16, respectively.



SECTION 4.14Rights-of-Way. Each of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
has such Rights-of-Way as are sufficient to conduct its business in the manner
currently conducted, except for such Rights-of-Way the absence of which have
not had and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the

Company Subsidiaries (and, to Company\'s Knowledge, no third-party operator)

SECTION 5.02No Solicitation by Parent; Parent Board Recommendation.



(a)From the date hereof until the earlier of the Effective Time or the date of
the termination of this Agreement in accordance with Article VIII, Parent
shall, and shall cause the Parent Subsidiaries and its and their respective
directors, officers, and employees and use its reasonable best efforts to
cause its and their respective Representatives to, (i) immediately cease and
cause to be terminated all discussions or negotiations with any Person
conducted heretofore with respect to any Parent Takeover Proposal or any
inquiry, proposal or offer that could reasonably be expected to lead to a
Parent Takeover Proposal, (ii) promptly (and in any event within 24 hours)
request the prompt return or destruction of all confidential information
previously furnished to any such Person or its Representatives and use
reasonable best efforts to obtain the return or the destruction of such

(b)From the date hereof until the earlier of the Effective Time or the date of

respective directors, officers, and employees and use its reasonable best
efforts to cause its and their respective Representatives not to, directly or
indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate, or knowingly encourage or facilitate
(including by way of furnishing or affording access to any non-public
information) any Parent Takeover Proposal or any inquiry, proposal or offer
that could reasonably be expected to lead to a Parent Takeover Proposal, (ii)
furnish any non-public information regarding Parent or any Parent Subsidiary
or afford access to the business, properties, books or records of Parent or
any Parent Subsidiary to any Person (other than the Company or its directors,

response to any Parent Takeover Proposal or any inquiries, proposals or offers
that could reasonably be expected to lead to a Parent Takeover Proposal, or
(iii) enter into or participate in any discussions or negotiations with any
Person with respect to any Parent Takeover Proposal or any inquiry, proposal
or offer that may reasonably be expected to lead to a Parent Takeover
Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to, but not after,
obtaining the Parent Stockholder Approval, in response to an unsolicited, bona
fide, written, Parent Takeover Proposal made after the date hereof, that did
not result from or arise in connection with a material breach of this Section
5.02 and that the Parent Board determines in good faith (after consultation
with outside counsel and its financial advisor) constitutes or is reasonably
be expected to lead to a Superior Parent Proposal, and that the failure to do
so would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties owed by the Parent Board to
the Parent Stockholders under applicable Law, Parent may (and may authorize
its directors, officers, employees and Representatives to) (x) furnish
information with respect to Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries to the Person
making such Parent Takeover Proposal and its Representatives and financing
sources (provided that all such information has previously been provided to
the Company or is provided to the Company prior to or substantially
concurrently with the time it is provided to such Person) pursuant to a
customary confidentiality agreement that is not less restrictive of such
Person than the Confidentiality Agreement (provided that such confidentiality
agreement shall not be required to prohibit such counterparty from making any
private proposal to the Parent Board) and that does not prohibit Parent from
complying with the provisions of this Section 5.02, including the provision of
any information to the Company in accordance with this Section 5.02 (a "Parent
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement"), and (y) participate in discussions
regarding the terms of such Parent Takeover Proposal and the negotiation of
such terms with, and only with, the Person making such Parent Takeover
Proposal (and such Person\'s Representatives and financing sources). Without
limiting the foregoing, it is agreed that any violation of the restrictions
set forth in this Section 5.02 by any of Parent\'s directors, officers,
employees or Representatives, any Parent Subsidiary or any of their respective
directors, officers, employees or Representatives shall constitute a breach of
this Section 5.02 by Parent.



(c)Parent shall notify the Company orally and in writing if (i) Parent
receives a Parent Takeover Proposal in which the Person making such Parent
Takeover Proposal requests that Parent terminate this Agreement or otherwise
not consummate the Transactions, including the Merger or (ii) Parent
determines to begin providing information or commence discussions or
negotiations concerning a Parent Takeover Proposal pursuant to the penultimate
sentence of Section 5.02(b) (such Parent Takeover Proposals described in
clauses (i) or (ii) being "Disclosable Parent Takeover Proposals"). With
respect to a Disclosable Parent Takeover Proposal described in clause (ii) of
the preceding sentence, Parent shall notify the Company in 

writing prior to providing any such information or commencing any such
discussions or negotiations. Parent shall promptly (and in any event within 24
hours) after its receipt of any Disclosable Parent Takeover Proposal or
information relating to Parent or any Parent Subsidiary in connection with a
Disclosable Parent Takeover Proposal, notify the Company (orally and in
writing) of such Disclosable Parent Takeover Proposal, inquiry or request
(including providing the identity of the Person making or submitting such
Disclosable Parent Takeover Proposal, inquiry or request), and, (i) if it is
in writing, a copy of such Disclosable Parent Takeover Proposal, inquiry or
request and any related draft agreements and (ii) if oral, a reasonably
detailed written summary thereof, including the financial and other terms
thereof, in each case including any modifications thereto. Parent shall keep
the Company informed in all material respects on a prompt basis (and in any
event within 24 hours) with respect to any material development regarding the
status or terms of any such Disclosable Parent Takeover Proposal (including
any change to the terms of any such Disclosable Parent Takeover Proposal) or
inquiry or request. Parent shall provide to the Company as soon as practicable
after receipt or delivery thereof (and in any event within 24 hours) copies of
all correspondence and other written materials sent by or provided to Parent
or its Representatives to or from any Person making a Disclosable Parent
Takeover Proposal, as applicable, with respect to any material development
regarding the status or terms of any such Disclosable Parent Takeover
Proposal.



(d)Except as set forth below, neither the Parent Board nor any committee
thereof shall (i) (A) withdraw (or modify or qualify in any manner adverse to
the Company), or propose publicly to withdraw (or modify or qualify in any
manner adverse to the Company), the Parent Recommendation, (B) fail to include
the Parent Recommendation in the Joint Proxy Statement or (C) adopt, approve,
recommend or declare advisable, or propose publicly to adopt, approve,
recommend or declare advisable, any Parent Takeover Proposal (any action in
this clause (i) being referred to as a "Parent Adverse Recommendation
Change"), (ii) approve, recommend or declare advisable, or propose publicly to
approve, recommend or declare advisable, or allow Parent or any of its
Affiliates to execute or enter into, any Acquisition Agreement (other than a
Parent Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement) constituting a Parent Takeover
Proposal, or requiring Parent to abandon, terminate, delay or fail to
consummate the Transactions, (iii) in the case of a Parent Takeover Proposal
that is structured as a tender offer or exchange offer for outstanding Parent
Common Stock, fail to recommend, in a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on
Schedule 14D-9, against acceptance of such tender offer or exchange offer by
the Parent Stockholders on or prior to ten Business Days after commencement of
such tender offer or exchange offer, or (iv) if a Parent Takeover Proposal
shall have been publicly announced (other than pursuant to the foregoing
clause (iii)) or publicly known (including through media reports and/or market
rumors), fail to publicly reaffirm the Parent Recommendation within five
Business Days after the Company so requests in writing.



(e)Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to, but not after,
obtaining the Parent Stockholder Approval, in response to an unsolicited, bona
fide, written, Parent Takeover Proposal that did not result from or arise in
connection with a breach of this Section 5.02, the Parent Board may make a
Parent Adverse Recommendation Change and/or terminate this Agreement pursuant
to Section 8.01(h); provided, however, that the Parent Board may not make any
such Parent Adverse Recommendation Change unless and until: (i) the Parent
Board determines in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel
and its financial advisor) that such Parent Takeover Proposal is a Superior
Parent Proposal; (ii) the Parent Board 

determines in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) that
the failure to take such action in response to such Superior Parent Proposal
would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties owed by the Parent Board to
the Parent Stockholders under applicable Law; (iii) Parent provides the
Company with written notice of such proposed action and the basis thereof five
Business Days in advance, which notice shall set forth in writing that the
Parent Board intends to take such action, and include a copy of the available
proposed Parent Takeover Proposal (a "Parent Notice of Superior Proposal");
(iv) after giving such Parent Notice of Superior Proposal and prior to
effecting such Parent Adverse Recommendation Change or terminating this
Agreement, Parent negotiates (and causes its officers, employees, financial
advisor and outside legal counsel to negotiate) in good faith with the Company
(to the extent the Company wishes to negotiate) to make such adjustments or
revisions to the terms of this Agreement as would permit the Parent Board not
to effect a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement
in response thereto; and (v) at the end of the five Business Day period, prior
to taking action to effect a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change, the Parent
Board takes into account any adjustments or revisions to the terms of this
Agreement proposed by the Company in writing and any other information offered
by the Company in response to the Parent Notice of Superior Proposal and
determines in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel and
its financial advisor) that the Parent Takeover Proposal remains a Superior
Parent Proposal and that the failure to effect a Parent Adverse Recommendation
Change in response to such Superior Parent Proposal would be inconsistent with
the duties owed by the Parent Board to the Parent Stockholders under
applicable Law; provided, that any amendment to the financial terms or any
other material term of such Superior Parent Proposal shall require a new
Parent Notice of Superior Proposal, except that references to the five
Business Day period above shall be deemed to be references to the longer of
the remaining Business Days in the initial five Business Day period and a new
three Business Day period.



(f)Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, prior to, but
not after, obtaining the Parent Stockholder Approval, in response to a Parent
Intervening Event that did not arise from or in connection with a material
breach of this Agreement by Parent, the Parent Board may make a Parent Adverse
Recommendation Change; provided, however, that the Parent Board may not make
any such Parent Adverse Recommendation Change unless and until: (i) the Parent
Board determines in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel
and its financial advisor) that the failure to effect a Parent Adverse
Recommendation Change in response to such Parent Intervening Event would be
inconsistent with the fiduciary duties owed by the Parent Board to the Parent
Stockholders under applicable Law; (ii) Parent provides the Company with
written notice of such proposed action and the basis thereof five Business
Days in advance, which notice shall set forth in writing that the Parent Board
intends to take such action and includes a reasonable description of the facts
and circumstances of the Parent Intervening Event (a "Parent Notice of
Intervening Event"); (iii) after giving such Parent Notice of Intervening
Event and prior to effecting such Parent Adverse Recommendation Change, Parent
negotiates (and causes its officers, employees, financial advisor and outside
legal counsel to negotiate) in good faith with the Company (to the extent the
Company wishes to negotiate) to make such adjustments or revisions to the
terms of this Agreement as would permit the Parent Board not to effect a
Parent Adverse Recommendation Change in response thereto; and (iv) at the end
of the five Business Day period, prior to taking action to effect a Parent
Adverse Recommendation Change, the Parent Board takes into account any
adjustments or revisions to the terms of this Agreement proposed by the
Company in writing 

and any other information offered by the Company in response to the Parent
Notice of Intervening Event and determines in good faith (after consultation
with outside legal counsel and its financial advisor) that the failure to
effect a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change in response to such Parent
Intervening Event would be inconsistent with the duties owed by the Parent
Board to the Parent Stockholders under applicable Law.



(g)Nothing contained in this Section 5.02 shall prohibit Parent from after
consultation with its outside legal counsel, making such disclosures as the
Parent Board thereof determines in good faith are necessary to comply with
Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act; provided,
however, that if such disclosure has the effect of withdrawing or adversely
modifying or qualifying the Parent Recommendation, such disclosure shall be
deemed to be a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change and the Company shall have
the right to terminate this Agreement as set forth in Section 8.01(f);
provided further, that (i) issuing a "stop-look-and-listen communication"
pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act or taking and
disclosing to Parent stockholders positions required by Rule 14d-9 or Rule
14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act, in each case after the commencement
of a tender offer (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 promulgated under the
Exchange Act), and (ii) issuing a statement in connection with a Parent
Takeover Proposal that does not involve the commencement of a tender offer
(within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act), so long
as the statement includes no more information than would be required for a
"stop-look-and-listen communication" under Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the
Exchange Act if such provision was applicable shall not be deemed to be a
Parent Adverse Recommendation Change.

provision of any information to Parent in accordance with this Section 5.03 (a

shall constitute a breach of this Section 5.03 by the Company.



(c)The Company shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) after its
receipt of any Company Takeover Proposal or any inquiry or request for
discussions or negotiations regarding a Company Takeover Proposal or
information relating to the Company or any Company Subsidiary in connection
with a Company Takeover Proposal, notify Parent (orally and in writing) of
such Company Takeover Proposal, inquiry or request (including providing the
identity of the Person making or submitting such Company Takeover Proposal,
inquiry or request), and, (i) if it is in writing, a copy of such Company
Takeover Proposal, inquiry or request and any related draft agreements and
(ii) if oral, a reasonably detailed written summary thereof, including the
financial and other terms thereof, in each case including any modifications
thereto. The Company shall notify Parent in writing if the Company determines
to begin providing information or to commence discussions or negotiations
concerning a Company Takeover Proposal, prior to providing any such
information or commencing any such discussions 

or negotiations. The Company shall keep Parent informed in all material
respects on a prompt basis (and in any event within 24 hours) with respect to
any material development regarding the status or terms of any such Company
Takeover Proposal (including any change to the terms of any such Company
Takeover Proposal) or inquiry or request. The Company shall provide to Parent
as soon as practicable after receipt or delivery thereof (and in any event
within 24 hours) copies of all correspondence and other written materials sent
by or provided to the Company or its Representatives to or from any Person
making a Company Takeover Proposal, as applicable, with respect to any
material development regarding the status or terms of any such Company
Takeover Proposal.



(d)Except as set forth below, neither the Company Board nor any committee
thereof shall (i) (A) withdraw (or modify or qualify in any manner adverse to
Parent), or propose publicly to withdraw (or modify or qualify in any manner
adverse to Parent), the Company Recommendation, (B) fail to include the
Company Recommendation in the Joint Proxy Statement or (C) adopt, approve,
recommend or declare advisable, or propose publicly to adopt, approve,
recommend or declare advisable, any Company Takeover Proposal (any action in
this clause (i) being referred to as a "Company Adverse Recommendation
Change"), (ii) approve, recommend or declare advisable, or propose publicly to
approve, recommend or declare advisable, or allow the Company or any of its
Affiliates to execute or enter into, any Acquisition Agreement (other than a
Company Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement) constituting or that could
reasonably be expected to lead to a Company Takeover Proposal, or requiring
the Company to abandon, terminate, delay or fail to consummate the
Transactions, (iii) in the case of a Company Takeover Proposal that is
structured as a tender offer or exchange offer for outstanding Company Common
Shares, fail to recommend, in a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on
Schedule 14D-9, against acceptance of such tender offer or exchange offer by
the Company Shareholders on or prior to ten Business Days after commencement
of such tender offer or exchange offer, or (iv) if a Company Takeover Proposal
shall have been publicly announced (other than pursuant to the foregoing
clause (iii)) or publicly known (including through media reports and/or market
rumors), fail to publicly reaffirm the Company Recommendation within five
Business Days after Parent so requests in writing.



(e)Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to, but not after,
obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval, in response to an unsolicited,
bona fide, written, Company Takeover Proposal that did not result from or
arise in connection with a breach of this Section 5.03, the Company Board may
make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change and/or terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Section 8.01(i); provided, however, that the Company Board may not
make any such Company Adverse Recommendation Change or terminate this
Agreement unless and until: (i) the Company Board determines in good faith
(after consultation with outside legal counsel and its financial advisor) that
such Company Takeover Proposal is a Superior Company Proposal; (ii) the
Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with outside legal
counsel) that the failure to take such action in response to such Superior
Company Proposal would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties owed by the
Company Board to the Company Shareholders under applicable Law; (iii) the
Company provides Parent with written notice of such proposed action and the
basis thereof five Business Days in advance, which notice shall set forth in
writing that the Company Board intends to take such action and include a copy
of the available proposed Company Takeover Proposal (a "Company Notice of
Superior Proposal"); (iv) after giving such Company Notice of Superior
Proposal and 

prior to effecting such Company Adverse Recommendation Change or terminating
this Agreement, the Company negotiates (and causes its officers, employees,
financial advisor and outside legal counsel to negotiate) in good faith with
Parent (to the extent Parent wishes to negotiate) to make such adjustments or
revisions to the terms of this Agreement as would permit the Company Board not
to effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement
in response thereto; and (v) at the end of the five Business Day period, prior
to taking action to effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or
terminate this Agreement, the Company Board takes into account any adjustments
or revisions to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent in writing and
any other information offered by Parent in response to the Company Notice of
Superior Proposal and determines in good faith (after consultation with
outside legal counsel and its financial advisor) that the Company Takeover
Proposal remains a Superior Company Proposal and that the failure to effect a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement in response
to such Superior Company Proposal would be inconsistent with the duties owed
by the Company Board to the Company Shareholders under applicable Law;
provided, that any amendment to the financial terms or any other material term
of such Superior Company Proposal shall require a new Company Notice of
Superior Proposal, except that references to the five Business Day period
above shall be deemed to be references to the longer of the remaining Business
Days in the initial five Business Day period and a new three Business Day
period.



(f)Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, prior to, but
not after, obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval, in response to a
Company Intervening Event that did not arise from or in connection with a
material breach of this Agreement by the Company, the Company Board may make a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change; provided, however, that the Company
Board may not make any such Company Adverse Recommendation Change unless and
until: (i) the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with
outside legal counsel and its financial advisor) that the failure to effect a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change in response to such Company Intervening
Event would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties owed by the Company
Board to the Company Shareholders under applicable Law, (ii) the Company
provides Parent with written notice of such proposed action and the basis
thereof five Business Days in advance, which notice shall set forth in writing
that the Company Board intends to take such action and includes a reasonable
description of the facts and circumstances of the Company Intervening Event (a
"Company Notice of Intervening Event"); (iii) after giving such Company Notice
of Intervening Event and prior to effecting such Company Adverse
Recommendation Change, the Company negotiates (and causes its officers,
employees, financial advisor and outside legal counsel to negotiate) in good
faith with Parent (to the extent Parent wishes to negotiate) to make such
adjustments or revisions to the terms of this Agreement as would permit the
Company Board not to effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change in
response thereto; and (iv) at the end of the five Business Day period, prior
to taking action to effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, the
Company Board takes into account any adjustments or revisions to the terms of
this Agreement proposed by Parent in writing and any other information offered
by Parent in response to the Company Notice of Intervening Event and
determines in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel and
its financial advisor) that the failure to effect a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change in response to such Company Intervening Event would be
inconsistent with the duties owed by the Company Board to the Company
Shareholders under applicable Law. 

(g)During the period commencing with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement and continuing until the earlier of the Effective Time and
termination of this Agreement in accordance with Article VIII, the Company
shall not (and it shall cause the Company Subsidiaries not to) terminate,
amend, modify or waive any provision of any confidentiality, "standstill" or
similar agreement to which it or any of the Company Subsidiaries is a party
and shall enforce, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, the
provisions of any such agreement, including by seeking to obtain injunctions
to prevent any breaches of such agreements and to enforce specifically the
terms and provisions thereof; provided, that, prior to, but not after, the
time the Company Shareholder Approval is obtained, if the Company Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel
that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties owed by the Company Board to the Company Shareholders under applicable
Law, the Company may waive any such "standstill" or similar provision solely
to the extent necessary to permit a third party to make a Company Takeover
Proposal, on a confidential basis, to the Company Board; provided, however,
that the Company shall advise Parent prior to taking such action, including
identifying the identity of the third Person who has received such a waiver.
The Company represents and warrants to Parent that it has not taken any action
that (i) would be prohibited by this Section 5.03(g) or (ii) but for the
ability to avoid actions inconsistent with the fiduciary duties owed by the
Company Board to the Company Shareholders under applicable Law, would have
been prohibited by this Section 5.03(g) during the 30 days prior to the date
of this Agreement.



(h)Nothing contained in this Section 5.03 shall prohibit the Company from
after consultation with its outside legal counsel, making such disclosures as
the Company Board thereof determines in good faith are necessary to comply
with Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act; provided,
however, that if such disclosure has the effect of withdrawing or adversely
modifying or qualifying the Company Recommendation, such disclosure shall be
deemed to be a Company Adverse Recommendation Change and Parent shall have the
right to terminate this Agreement as set forth in Section 8.01(e); provided
further, that (i) issuing a "stop-look-and-listen communication" pursuant to
Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act or taking and disclosing to
Company stockholders positions required by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2
promulgated under the Exchange Act, in each case after the commencement of a
tender offer (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 promulgated under the Exchange
Act), and (ii) issuing a statement in connection with a Company Takeover
Proposal that does not involve the commencement of a tender offer (within the
meaning of Rule 14d-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act), so long as the
statement includes no more information than would be required for a "stop-
look-and-listen communication" under Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the
Exchange Act if such provision was applicable shall not be deemed to be a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change.

best efforts to have the Form S-4 declared effective under the Securities Act
as promptly as practicable after such filing. Each of Parent and the Company
shall furnish all information concerning itself and its Affiliates to the
other, and provide such other assistance, as may be reasonably requested in

thereto, each of Parent and the Company (i) shall provide the other an
opportunity to review and comment on such document or response (including the
proposed final version of such document or response), (ii) shall include in
such document or response all comments reasonably proposed by the other and
(iii) shall not file or mail such document or respond to the SEC prior to
receiving the approval of the other, which approval shall not be unreasonably

the other, promptly after receipt of notice thereof, of the time of
effectiveness of the Form S-4, the issuance of any stop order relating thereto
or the suspension of the qualification of the Stock Consideration for offering
or sale in any jurisdiction, and each of Parent and the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to have any such stop order or suspension lifted,
reversed or otherwise terminated. Each of Parent and the Company shall also
take any other action (other than qualifying to do business in any
jurisdiction in which it is not now so qualified) required to be taken under
the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and any applicable foreign or state
securities or "blue sky" Laws in connection with the Merger and the issuance
of the Stock Consideration.

Shareholders. Nothing in this Section 6.01(b) shall limit the obligations of
any party under Section 6.01(a).



(c)If prior to the Effective Time, any event occurs with respect to the
Company or any Company Subsidiary, or any change occurs with respect to other

supplement to, the Joint Proxy Statement or the Form S-4, the Company shall
promptly notify Parent of such event, and Parent and the Company shall

6.01(a).



(d)Parent shall, as soon as reasonably practicable following the date of this
Agreement, establish a record date for, duly call, give notice of, convene and
hold the Parent Stockholders Meeting for the purpose of seeking the Parent
Stockholder Approval. Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to (x)
cause the Joint Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Parent Stockholders and
(y) hold the Parent Stockholders Meeting as soon as reasonably practicable
after the Form S-4 is declared effective under the Securities Act, in each
case in accordance with applicable Law, the Parent Charter and the Parent
Bylaws. Parent shall, through the Parent Board, recommend to its stockholders
that they give the Parent Stockholder Approval, shall include such
recommendation in the Joint Proxy Statement and shall use reasonable best
efforts to solicit the Parent Stockholder Approval (which shall include hiring
a proxy solicitor), except to the extent that the Parent Board has made a
Parent Adverse Recommendation Change as permitted by Section 5.02(e) or
Section 5.02(f). Except as expressly contemplated by the immediately preceding
sentence and subject to Parent\'s right to terminate this Agreement pursuant
to Section 8.01(h), Parent agrees that its obligations pursuant to this
Section 6.01 shall not be affected by the commencement, public proposal,
public disclosure or communication to Parent of any Parent Takeover Proposal
or by the making of any Parent Adverse Recommendation Change by the Parent
Board. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
Parent (i) shall be required to adjourn or postpone the Parent Stockholders
Meeting (A) to the extent necessary to ensure that any required supplement or
amendment to the Joint Proxy Statement is provided to the Parent Stockholders

scheduled, there are insufficient shares of Parent Common Stock represented
(either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct
business at such Parent Stockholders Meeting or (ii) may, and at the
Company\'s request shall, adjourn or postpone the Parent Stockholders Meeting
if, as of the time for which the Parent Stockholders Meeting is scheduled,

however, that unless otherwise agreed to by the parties, the Parent
Stockholders Meeting shall not be adjourned or postponed to a date that is
more than 30 days after the date for which the meeting was previously
scheduled (it being understood that such Parent Stockholders Meeting shall be
adjourned or postponed every time the circumstances described in the foregoing
clauses (i)(A) and (i)(B) exist, and such Parent Stockholders Meeting may be
adjourned or postponed every time the circumstances described in the foregoing
clause (ii) exist); and provided further that the Parent Stockholders Meeting
shall not be adjourned or 

postponed to a date on or after two Business Days prior to the End Date. In
the event that during the five Business Days prior to the date that the Parent
Stockholders Meeting is then scheduled to be held, Parent delivers a notice of
an intent to make a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change, the Company may
direct Parent to postpone the Parent Stockholders Meeting for up to six
Business Days and Parent shall promptly, and in any event no later than the
next Business Day, postpone the Parent Stockholders Meeting in accordance with
the Company\'s direction, subject to Parent\'s right to postpone the Parent
Stockholders Meeting for a longer period pursuant to the immediately preceding
sentence. If requested by the Company, Parent shall promptly provide the
Company with all voting tabulation reports relating to the Parent Stockholders
Meeting that have been prepared by Parent or Parent\'s transfer agent, proxy
solicitor or other Representative.



(e)The Company shall, as soon as reasonably practicable following the date of
this Agreement, establish a record date for, duly call, give notice of,

Charter and the Company Bylaws. The Company shall, through the Company Board,
recommend to its shareholders that they give the Company Shareholder Approval,
shall include such recommendation in the Joint Proxy Statement and shall use
reasonable best efforts to solicit the Company Shareholder Approval (which
shall include hiring a proxy solicitor), except to the extent that the Company
Board has made a Company Adverse Recommendation Change as permitted by Section
5.03(e) or Section 5.02(f). Except as expressly contemplated by the
immediately preceding sentence and subject to the Company\'s right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(i), the Company agrees that
its obligations pursuant to this Section 6.01 shall not be affected by the
commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or communication to the
Company of any Company Takeover Proposal or by the making of any Company
Adverse Recommendation Change by the Company Board. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Company (i) shall be required
to adjourn or postpone the Company Shareholders Meeting (A) to the extent
necessary to ensure that any required supplement or amendment to the Joint
Proxy Statement is provided to the Company Shareholders or (B) if, as of the
time for which the Company Shareholders Meeting is scheduled, there are
insufficient Company Common Shares represented (either in person or by proxy)
to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct business at such Company
Shareholders Meeting or (ii) may, and at Parent\'s request shall, adjourn or
postpone the Company Shareholders Meeting if, as of the time for which the
Company Shareholders Meeting is scheduled, there are insufficient Company
Common Shares represented (either in person or by proxy) to obtain the Company
Shareholder Approval; provided, however, that unless otherwise agreed to by
the parties, the Company Shareholders Meeting shall not be adjourned or
postponed to a date that is more than 30 days after the date for which the

further that the Company Shareholders Meeting shall not be adjourned or
postponed to a date on or after two Business Days prior to the End Date. In
the event that during the five Business Days prior to the date that the
Company Shareholders Meeting is then 

scheduled to be held, the Company delivers a notice of an intent to make a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change, Parent may direct the Company to
postpone the Company Shareholders Meeting for up to six Business Days and the
Company shall promptly, and in any event no later than the next Business Day,
postpone the Company Shareholders Meeting in accordance with Parent\'s
direction, subject to the Company\'s right to postpone the Company
Shareholders Meeting for a longer period pursuant to the immediately preceding
sentence. If requested by Parent, the Company shall promptly provide Parent
with all voting tabulation reports relating to the Company Shareholders
Meeting that have been prepared by the Company or the Company\'s transfer
agent, proxy solicitor or other Representative.



(f)Each of Parent and the Company shall use their reasonable best efforts to
hold the Parent Stockholders Meeting and the Company Shareholders Meeting,
respectively, at the same time and on the same date as the other party.



SECTION 6.02Access to Information; Confidentiality. Subject to applicable Law,
each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall, and shall cause each of its
respective Subsidiaries to, afford to the other parties and to the
Representatives of such other party reasonable access during the period from
the date of this Agreement to the earlier of the Effective Time or the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01, to all their
respective properties, books, contracts, commitments, personnel and records
and, during such period, each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall, and
shall cause each of its respective Subsidiaries to, furnish promptly to the
other party (i) to the extent not publicly available, a copy of each report,
schedule, registration statement and other document filed by it during such
period pursuant to the requirements of securities Laws and (ii) all other
information concerning its business, properties and personnel as such other
party may reasonably request; provided, however, that either party may
withhold (v) prior to the Closing, any valuations of assets and any pricing
assumptions, forward pricing estimates, price decks or pricing studies related
thereto, (w) prior to Closing, personnel records of such party or any of its
Subsidiaries relating to individual performance or evaluation records, medical
histories or other information the disclosure of which would violate
applicable Law or that in such party\'s good faith opinion could subject such
party or any of its Subsidiaries to risk of liability, (x) any document or
information that is subject to the terms of a confidentiality agreement with a
third party (provided that the withholding party shall use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain the required consent of such third party to such access or
disclosure), (y) any document or information subject to any attorney-client
privilege or attorney work product doctrine (provided that the withholding
party shall use its reasonable best efforts to allow for such access or
disclosure (or as much of it as possible) in a manner that does not result in
a loss of attorney-client privilege or attorney work product determination) or
(z) any document or information if, in the judgment of such party, the sharing
of such document or information violates applicable Law; and provided further,
that neither party has the right to undertake any sampling or testing,
including sampling of any environmental media, at any of the properties of the
other party without the express written approval of such party, such approval
being in the sole discretion of such party. All information exchanged pursuant
to this Section 6.02 shall be subject to the confidentiality agreement dated
July 26, 2018 between Parent and the Company (the "Confidentiality
Agreement"); provided, that, prior to the termination of this Agreement,
nothing in Section 14 of the Confidentiality Agreement shall restrict (i)
Parent from taking actions contemplated by this Agreement to consummate the
Transactions, (ii) Parent from complying with its obligations under this
Agreement or (iii) the ability of Parent to propose 

adjustments or revisions to the terms of this Agreement to the Company Board.
From and after the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the Effective
Time and termination of this Agreement in accordance with Article VIII, each
party shall continue to provide access to the other party and its
Representatives to the electronic data room relating to the Transactions
maintained by or on behalf of it to which the other party and its
Representatives were provided access prior to the date of this Agreement.

SECTION 6.03Required Actions.



(a)Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the parties
shall use its reasonable best efforts to consummate and make effective, as
soon as reasonably possible, the Transactions, including the Merger.



(b)Without limiting Section 6.03(a), Parent and the Parent Board and the
Company and the Company Board, as the case may be, shall use their respective
reasonable best efforts to (x) take all action reasonably appropriate to
ensure that no takeover statute or similar statute or regulation is or becomes
applicable to this Agreement, the Merger or any other transaction contemplated
by this Agreement and (y) if any takeover statute or similar statute or
regulation becomes applicable to this Agreement, the Merger or any other
transaction contemplated by this Agreement, take all action reasonably
appropriate to ensure that the Transactions may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement.



(c)Parent shall take reasonable best efforts to obtain the expiration or early
termination of the HSR Act waiting period, including but not limited to (i)
jointly proposing with the Company to negotiate, commit to and effect, by
consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise, the sale, divestiture,
transfer, license, or disposition of, or prohibition or limitation on the
ownership or operation by Parent, the Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries of, any portion of the business, properties or assets of Parent,
the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries, (ii) terminating,
modifying, or assigning existing relationships, contracts, or obligations of
Parent or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates or those relating to any assets,
properties, or businesses to be acquired pursuant to this Agreement, (iii)
changing or modifying any course of conduct regarding future operations of
Parent or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates or the assets, properties, or
businesses to be acquired pursuant to this Agreement, or (iv) otherwise taking
or committing to take any other action that would limit Parent's or its
Subsidiaries' or Affiliates\' freedom of action with respect to, or their
ability to retain, one or more of their respective operations, divisions,
businesses, product lines, customers, assets or rights or interests, or their
freedom of action with respect to the assets, properties, or businesses to be
acquired pursuant to this Agreement (collectively, a "Divestiture Action");
provided that Parent or any Parent Subsidiaries are not obligated to take any
Divestiture Action or other action unless such action is expressly conditioned
upon and is only effective after the Closing of the Merger and such action
would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
material adverse effect on the business, financial condition or operations of
Parent and its Subsidiaries from and after the Effective Time, taken as a
whole. The Company shall agree to take any Divestiture Action requested by
Parent if such actions are only effective after the Effective Time and
conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger. In the event that any
Divestiture Action is proposed by or acceptable to a Governmental Entity,
Parent shall have the right to determine the 

manner in which to implement the requirement of such Governmental Entity;
provided, that in no event shall Parent or the Company (or any of their
respective Subsidiaries or other Affiliates) be required to take or effect any
such action that is not conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger;
provided, further, that Parent shall consult with the Company and give
consideration to the views of the Company on all matters relating to any
possible Divestiture Action.



(d)In addition, if any action or Proceeding is instituted (or threatened)
challenging the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement
as violating any antitrust, competition, foreign investment, trade regulation
or similar Law or if any decree, order, judgment, or injunction (whether
temporary, preliminary, or permanent) is entered, enforced, or attempted to be
entered or enforced by any Governmental Entity that would make the Merger or
any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement illegal or otherwise
delay or prohibit the consummation of the Merger or any other transaction
contemplated by this Agreement, Parent, its Affiliates and Subsidiaries and
the Company, its Affiliates and Subsidiaries, shall use reasonable best
efforts to (subject the limitations set forth in Section 6.03(c)) contest and
defend any such Claim, cause of action, or Proceeding to avoid entry of, or to
have vacated, lifted, reversed, repealed, rescinded, or terminated, any
decree, order, judgment, or injunction (whether temporary, preliminary, or
permanent) that prohibits, prevents, or restricts consummation of the Merger
or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement. Parent shall be
entitled to direct any such action or Proceeding described in this Section
6.03(d); provided, however, that it shall afford the Company a reasonable
opportunity to participate therein.



(e)Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of Parent and the
Company shall:



(i)make or cause to be made, in consultation and cooperation with the other
and as promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement, an
appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act
relating to the Merger;



(ii)use its reasonable best efforts to furnish to the other all assistance,
cooperation and information required for any such registration, declaration,
notice, application or filing and in order to achieve the effects set forth in
Section 6.03(b);



(iii)give the other reasonable prior notice of any such registration,
declaration, notice, application or filing and, to the extent reasonably
practicable, of any communication with any Governmental Entity regarding the
Merger (including with respect to any of the actions referred to in Section
6.03(c) and in this Section 6.03(e)), and permit the other to review and
discuss in advance, and consider in good faith the views of, and secure the
participation of, the other in connection with any such registration,
declaration, notice, filing, application or communication;



(iv)use its reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as practicable
under the circumstances to any inquiries received from any Governmental Entity
or any other authority enforcing applicable antitrust, competition, foreign
investment, trade regulation or similar Laws for additional information or 

documentation in connection with antitrust, competition, foreign investment,
trade regulation or similar matters (including a "second request" under the
HSR Act), and not extend any waiting period under the HSR Act or enter into
any agreement with such Governmental Entities or other authorities not to
consummate any of the Transactions, except with the prior written consent of
the other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed;



(v)unless prohibited by applicable Law or by the applicable Governmental
Entity, (A) to the extent reasonably practicable, not participate in or attend
any meeting, or engage in any substantive conversation with any Governmental
Entity in respect of the Merger (including with respect to any of the actions
referred to in Section 6.03(c) and in this Section 6.03(e)) without the other,
(B) to the extent reasonably practicable, give the other reasonable prior
notice of any such meeting or conversation, (C) in the event one party is

the fullest extent authorized or permitted by applicable Law from and against
any losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs, Indemnification Expenses,

interest, assessments and other charges paid or payable in connection with or
in respect of any thereof) arising out of or in connection with any Claim or

behalf of or advancement to the Indemnified Party of any Indemnification
Expenses incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with enforcing any

of its Subsidiaries and any Claim or Action relating thereto (including with
respect to any acts or omissions occurring in connection with the adoption or
approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions, including
the consideration and approval thereof and the process undertaken in
connection therewith and any Claim or Action relating thereto), and all rights
to indemnification and advancement conferred hereunder continue as to any
Indemnified Party who has ceased to be a director or officer of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries after the date hereof (with respect to acts or
omissions occurring prior to such cessation) and inure to the benefit of such
Indemnified Party\'s heirs, executors and personal and legal representatives.
As used in this Section 6.05: (x) the term "Claim" means any threatened,
asserted, pending or completed action or Proceeding, whether instituted by any
party hereto, any Governmental Entity or any other person, whether civil,
criminal, administrative, investigative or 

other, including any arbitration or other alternative dispute resolution
mechanism ("Action") arising out of or pertaining to matters that relate to
such Indemnified Party\'s duties or service as a director or officer of the
Company or of any of its Subsidiaries or as a trustee of (or in a similar
capacity with) any compensation and benefit plan of any thereof; (y) the term
"Indemnification Expenses" means reasonable attorneys\' fees and all other
reasonable costs, expenses and obligations (including reasonable experts\'
fees, travel expenses, court costs, retainers, transcript fees, duplicating,
printing and binding costs, as well as reasonable telecommunications, postage
and courier charges) paid or incurred in connection with investigating,
defending, being a witness in or participating in (including on appeal), or

by any amendments to or replacements of the VSCA, adopted after the date of
this Agreement that increase the extent to which an entity may indemnify its
directors, officers, trustees, employees, agents, or fiduciaries or persons
serving in any capacity in which any Indemnified Party serves. To the extent
permitted by Law, any amendment, alteration or repeal of the VSCA, that
adversely affects any right of any Indemnified Party will be prospective only
and does not limit or eliminate any such right with respect to any Claim or
Action involving any occurrence or alleged occurrence of any action or
omission to act that took place prior to such amendment or repeal.



(b)In the event that Parent, the Surviving Corporation, LLC Sub or any of
their successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other
Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all
of its properties and assets to any Person, then, Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or LLC Sub, as applicable, shall cause proper provision to be made
so that the successors and assigns of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or LLC
Sub, as applicable, assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.05
contemporaneous with the closing of any such consolidation, merger, transfer
or conveyance.



(c)On or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall purchase a "tail"
directors\' and officers\' liability insurance policy covering the six-year
period from and after the Effective Time for the Company and its current and
former directors and officers who are currently covered by the directors\' and
officers\' liability insurance coverage currently maintained by the Company
from a carrier with the same or better credit rating to the Company\'s current
directors\' and officers\' liability insurance carrier on terms not less
favorable to the insured persons than the directors\' and officers\' liability
insurance coverage currently maintained by the Company as of the date of this
Agreement with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred on
or before the Effective Time, except that in no event shall Parent be required
to pay with respect to such "tail" policy more than 300% of the aggregate
annual premium currently paid by the Company for such insurance (the "Maximum
Amount"). If Parent is unable to obtain the "tail" policy described in the
foregoing sentence as of the Effective Time, Parent shall cause Surviving
Corporation or LLC Sub to provide the current and former directors and
officers of the 

Company and the Company Subsidiaries with an insurance and indemnification
policy (from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the
current insurer) that provides directors\' and officers\' liability insurance
for events, acts and omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time for
an aggregate period of no less than six years from the Effective Time that is
not materially less favorable than the Company\'s existing policy or, if such
coverage is unavailable, the best available coverage; provided, however, that
in no event shall Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to expend
for such policies an aggregate premium amount greater than the Maximum Amount.



(d)The provisions of this Section 6.05 (i) shall survive consummation of the
Merger and the LLC Sub Merger, (ii) are intended to be for the benefit of, and
will be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, his or her heirs, executors

in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification, advancement,
exculpation or contribution that each Indemnified Party may have by contract
or otherwise, including under the terms of the respective Organizational
Documents of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries.



SECTION 6.06Fees and Expenses.

(d)Parent and the Company acknowledge and agree that the agreements contained
in Section 6.06(b) and Section 6.06(c) are an integral part of the
Transactions, and that, without these agreements, neither the Company nor
Parent would enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if Parent fails promptly
to pay the amount due pursuant to Section 6.06(c) or the Company fails
promptly to pay the amount due pursuant to Section 6.06(b) and, in order to
obtain such payment, the Person owed such payment commences a suit, action or
other Proceeding that results in a Judgment in its favor for such payment, the
Person owing such payment shall pay to the Person owed such payment its costs
and expenses (including reasonable attorneys\' fees and expenses) in
connection with such suit, action or other Proceeding, together with interest
on the amount of such payment from the date such payment was required to be
made until the date of payment at the prime rate as published by The Wall
Street Journal in effect on the date such payment was required to be made. In
no event shall either party be obligated to pay more than one Termination Fee
pursuant to this Section 6.06. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, in the event that the Termination Fee becomes due and payable
and is actually paid to Parent or the Company in accordance with this Section
6.06, payment of such Termination Fee, as applicable, shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy of the non-terminating party and its Affiliates against any
other party or such other party\'s Affiliates and other Representatives, for
any loss or damage based upon, arising out of or relating to this Agreement or
the negotiation, execution or performance hereof or the Transactions, except
in the case of fraud or Knowing and Intentional Breach of this Agreement.
Solely for purposes of establishing the basis for the amount thereof, and
without in any way increasing the amount of the Termination Fee, expanding the
circumstances in which the Termination Fee is to be paid or restricting or
modifying the other rights of any party hereunder, in the event of the valid
termination of this Agreement under circumstances in which the Termination Fee
is due and payable pursuant to this Section 6.06 and is actually paid, it is
agreed that such Termination Fee is liquidated damages, and not a penalty, and
the payment thereof in such circumstances is supported by due and sufficient
consideration; provided that no payment of a Termination Fee shall be
considered in lieu of, or a replacement or substitution for, damages incurred
in the event of any fraud or Knowing and Intentional Breach of this Agreement.



SECTION 6.07Certain Tax Matters. For U.S. federal income Tax purposes, it is
intended that (a) the Integrated Mergers, taken together, qualify as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of section 368(a) of the Code, (b) with

the Integrated Mergers to qualify, and will not take (and will use its
reasonable best efforts to prevent any Affiliate of such party from taking)

Mergers from qualifying, as a reorganization under the provisions of section
368(a) of the Code. Parent and the Company will cooperate with one another and
use their respective reasonable best efforts to obtain the opinions of counsel
referred to in Section 7.02(c) and Section 7.03(c). In connection with

executed certificate substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B
(the "Parent Tax Certificate") and (ii) the Company shall deliver to such
counsel a duly executed certificate substantially in the form attached hereto
as Exhibit C (the "Company Tax Certificate"), in each case dated as of the
Closing Date (and, if requested, dated as of the date on which the Form S-4 is
declared effective by the SEC). Parent and the Company shall provide such
other information as reasonably requested by counsel for purposes of rendering
the opinions described in Section 7.02(c) and Section 7.03(c), as applicable.

SECTION 6.08Transaction Litigation. Notwithstanding anything in Section 5.01
of this Agreement to the contrary, in the event any Proceeding by any
Governmental Entity or other Person is commenced or, to the Knowledge of the
Company or Parent, as applicable, threatened, that questions the validity or
legality of the Transactions or seeks damages or injunctive relief in
connection therewith, including stockholder litigation ("Transaction
Litigation"), the Company or Parent, as applicable, shall promptly (and in any
event, within one Business Day) notify the other party orally and in writing
of such Transaction Litigation and shall keep the other party reasonably
informed with respect to the status thereof. The Company or Parent, as
applicable, shall give the other party a reasonable opportunity to participate
in the defense or settlement of any Transaction Litigation at the other
party\'s sole cost and expense and shall consider in good faith the other
party\'s advice with respect to such Transaction Litigation; provided, that
the Company or Parent shall not cease to defend any such Transaction
Litigation without the prior written consent of the other party; provided,
further, that the Company shall not consent to the entry of any judgment,

shall cooperate with Parent in connection with the foregoing, including the
provision of information reasonably requested by Parent in connection
therewith.

than the base salary or wage rate and target incentive compensation
opportunity (including equity-based compensation) in effect for such Company
Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) health, welfare and
retirement benefits that are no less favorable, in the aggregate, than the
health, welfare and retirement benefits provided to such Company Employee
immediately prior to the Effective Time.



(b)For all purposes (including for purposes of eligibility to participate,
vesting and level of benefits, but not for purposes of defined benefit pension
accrual or post-employment retiree medical benefits) with respect to the
benefit plans maintained by Parent or any Parent Subsidiary providing benefits
to any Company Employee after the Closing Date, each Company Employee\'s years
of service with the Company or any Company Subsidiary (or any predecessor
employer of an employee of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, to the
extent service with such predecessor employer is recognized by the Company or
the applicable Company Subsidiary as of the date of this Agreement) prior to
the Effective Time shall be treated as service with Parent or the Parent
Subsidiaries; provided, however, that such service need not be recognized to
the extent (A) that such recognition would result in any duplication of
benefits for the same period of service or (B) not recognized by the Company
or a Company Subsidiary, as applicable, under the applicable Company Benefit

Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries shall use best efforts to (i) cause all
pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such
plans to be waived for each Company Employee and their covered dependents, to
the extent such conditions were inapplicable or waived under the comparable
benefits plans of the Company or any Company Subsidiary in which such Company
Employee participated immediately prior to the Closing Date and (ii) give full
credit for all co-payments, coinsurance, maximum out-of-pocket requirements
and deductibles to the extent satisfied in the plan year in which the

in which Company Employees and their dependents commence participation in the
benefit plans of Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries, if later) as if there had
been a single continuous employer.



(e)This Section 6.14 shall be binding upon and shall inure solely to the
benefit of each of the parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this Section

Time, the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries) any rights or
remedies of any nature whatsoever, (ii) is intended to be, or shall constitute

rights against the Financing Parties or (C) timely consummate the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated hereby. In the event that new commitment

SECTION 9.04Interpretation. When a reference is made in this Agreement to an
Exhibit, an Article or a Section, such reference shall be to an Exhibit, an
Article or a Section of this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The table
of contents, index of defined terms and the headings contained in this

refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this
Agreement unless so limited. The words "this Section," "this subsection" and
words of similar import, refer only to the Sections or subsections hereof in
which such words occur. The term "or" is not exclusive. The word "extent" in
the phrase "to the extent" shall mean the degree to which a subject or other

may be validly taken on or by the next day that is a Business Day. References
to a Person are also to its permitted successors and assigns. Unless otherwise
specifically indicated, all references to "dollars" and "$" will be deemed
references to the lawful money of the United States of America. The
specification of any dollar amount in the representations and warranties or
otherwise in this Agreement or in the Company Disclosure Letter or Parent
Disclosure Letter is not intended and shall not be deemed to be an admission
or acknowledgment of the materiality of such amounts or items, nor shall the
same be used in any dispute or controversy between the parties to determine
whether any obligation, item or matter (whether or not described herein or
included in any schedule) is or is not material for purposes of this
Agreement. Unless the context otherwise requires, all references to a specific
time shall refer to Central time. Each of the parties has participated in the
drafting and negotiation of this Agreement. If an ambiguity or question of
intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement must be construed as if it is
drafted by all the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise
favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of authorship of any of the
provisions of this Agreement. Accordingly, any rule of law or any legal
decision that would require interpretation of any ambiguities in this
Agreement against any party that drafted it is of no application and is hereby
expressly waived.



SECTION 9.05Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any Law or by public
policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic and legal
substance of the Transactions is not affected in any manner 

materially adverse to any party or such party waives its rights under this
Section 9.05 with respect thereto. Upon any determination that any term or
other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being
enforced, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement
so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in
an acceptable manner to the end that Transactions are fulfilled to the extent
possible.

SECTION 9.06Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement, and
shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each
of the parties and delivered (including by facsimile or electronic image scan)
to the other parties.



SECTION 9.07Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries.



(a)This Agreement, taken together with the Parent Disclosure Letter, the
Company Disclosure Letter and the Confidentiality Agreement, (i) constitutes
the entire agreement, and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings,
both written and oral, between the parties with respect to the Transactions
and (ii) except for Section 6.05, is not intended to confer, and does not
confer, upon any Person other than the parties any rights or remedies.



(b)Except for the representations and warranties contained in Article III, the
Company acknowledges that none of Parent, Merger Sub, the Parent Subsidiaries
or any other Person on behalf of Parent makes any other express or implied
representation or warranty in connection with the Transactions. Except for the
representations and warranties contained in Article IV, Parent and Merger Sub
acknowledge that none of the Company, the Company Subsidiaries or any other
Person on behalf of the Company makes any other express or implied
representation or warranty in connection with the Transactions.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Financing Related Parties shall be express
third-party beneficiaries of, and shall be entitled to rely upon, Section
8.03, Section 8.04, this Section 9.07(b), Section 9.08, Section 9.11 and
Section 9.12.



SECTION 9.08Governing Law. This agreement shall be governed by, and construed
in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the laws
that might otherwise govern under any applicable principles of conflicts of
laws of the State of Delaware, except TO THE EXTENT THAT THE VSCA IS
MANDATORILY APPLICABLE TO ANY PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT; PROVIDED THAT,
NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, ALL MATTERS RELATING TO THE INTERPRETATION,
CONSTRUCTION, VALIDITY AND ENFORCEMENT (WHETHER AT LAW OR IN EQUITY, WHETHER
IN CONTRACT, IN TORT, STATUTE OR OTHERWISE) AGAINST ANY FINANCING PARTY IN ANY
WAY RELATING TO THE DEBT LETTERS OR THE PERFORMANCE THEREOF OR THE FINANCINGS
CONTEMPLATED THEREBY, SHALL BE EXCLUSIVELY GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN
ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK. 

SECTION 9.09Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned, in whole or
in part, by operation of Law or otherwise by any of the parties without the
prior written consent of the other parties. Any purported assignment without
such consent shall be void. Subject to the two immediately preceding
sentences, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and
be enforceable by, the parties and their respective successors and permitted
assigns.



SECTION 9.10Specific Enforcement; Consent to Jurisdiction.



(a)The parties acknowledge and agree that irreparable damage would occur in
the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that
monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy therefor.
It is accordingly agreed that, prior to the termination of this Agreement
pursuant to Article VIII, the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the performance of terms and provisions of this Agreement in any court
referred to in clause (i) of the first sentence of Section 9.10(b), without
proof of actual damages (and each party hereby waives any requirement for the
securing or posting of any bond in connection with such remedy), this being in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.
The parties further agree not to assert that a remedy of specific enforcement
is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to Law or inequitable for any reason, nor
to assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy
for any such breach.



(b)Each of the parties (i) consents to submit for itself and its property to
the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware and any appellate court thereof, or, if the Court of Chancery of the
State of Delaware or the Delaware Supreme Court determines that,
notwithstanding section 111 of the DGCL, the Court of Chancery does not have
or should not exercise subject matter jurisdiction over such matter, any
Delaware state court or any federal court located in the State of Delaware and
any appellate court thereof in the event any dispute arises out of this
Agreement, the Merger or any of the other Transactions, (ii) agrees that it
will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or
other request for leave from any such court, (iii) agrees that it will not
bring any action relating to this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other
Transactions in any court other than as provided in clause (i) of this Section
9.10(b), (iv) agrees that service of process or summons by registered mail
addressed to them at their respective addresses provided herein shall be
effective service of process against them for any such Proceeding brought in
any such court, (v) agrees to waive and hereby waives, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law, any objection which any of them may now or
hereafter have to the laying of venue of, and the defense of an inconvenient
forum to the maintenance of, any such Proceeding in any such court, and (vi)
agrees that a final and unappealable judgment in any such Proceeding shall be
conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment
or in any other manner provided by applicable Law.



SECTION 9.11Waiver of Jury Trial. Each party hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any
right it may have to a trial by jury in respect of any suit, action or other
Proceeding arising out of this Agreement, the Merger, any of the other
Transactions, or any claims described in Section 9.12(b). Each 

party (i) certifies that no representative, agent or attorney of any other
party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such party would not, in
the event of any action, suit or other Proceeding, seek to enforce the
foregoing waiver, (ii) understands and has considered the implications of this
waiver, (iii) makes this waiver voluntarily and (iv) acknowledges that it and
the other parties have been induced to enter into this Agreement by, among
other things, the mutual waiver and certifications in this Section 9.11.

SECTION 9.12No Recourse.



(a)Notwithstanding anything that may be expressed or implied in this Agreement
or any related document or agreement, and notwithstanding the fact that any
party may be a partnership or limited liability company, each party, by its
acceptance of the benefits of this Agreement, covenants, agrees and
acknowledges that (i) no Persons other than the parties hereto will have any
obligation hereunder and (ii) no Financing Related Party shall have any
liability or obligation to the parties hereto with respect to this Agreement
or with respect to any claim or cause of action (whether in contract or in
tort, in applicable Law or in equity or otherwise, or granted by statute or
otherwise, whether by or through attempted piercing of the corporate, limited
partnership or limited liability company veil or any other theory or doctrine,
including alter ego or otherwise) that may be based upon, in respect of, arise
under, out or by reason of, be connected with, or relate to: (A) this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereunder, (B) the negotiation,
execution or performance of this Agreement (including any representation or
warranty made in, in connection with, or as an inducement to, this Agreement),
(C) any breach or violation of this Agreement, and (D) any failure of the
transactions contemplated hereunder to be consummated, it being expressly
agreed and acknowledged by the parties hereto that no personal liability or
losses whatsoever shall attach to, be imposed on or otherwise be incurred by
any Financing Related Party, as such, arising under, out of, in connection
with or related to the items in the immediately preceding clauses (A) through
(D). No party to this Agreement or any of their respective Affiliates, or any
of its Affiliates nor any of their respective Representatives, shall (i) have
any rights or claims against any Financing Related Party (solely in their
respective capacities as Financing Parties) in connection with this Agreement
or any other agreement contemplated by, or entered into in connection with,
the acquisitions contemplated by this Agreement or otherwise, including any
commitments by the Financing Related Parties in respect of financing the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) seek to enforce this
Agreement against any Financing Related Party (solely in their respective
capacities as Financing Parties) or (iii) bring any claim or cause of action
against any Financing Related Party (solely in their respective capacities as
Financing Parties) under this Agreement or any other agreement contemplated
by, or entered into in connection with, the acquisitions contemplated by this
Agreement or otherwise, including any commitments by the Financing Parties in
respect of financing the Transactions; provided that nothing in this Section
9.12 shall limit the liability or obligations of the Financing Parties to
Parent (and its successors and assigns) under the Debt Letters. In addition,
in no event will any Financing Related Party be liable for consequential,
special, exemplary, punitive or indirect damages (including any loss of
profits, business or anticipated savings) or damages of a tortious nature in
connection with the Financing.



(b)Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, to the extent
the provisions of Section 9.12(a) are determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction to 

not be enforceable, the parties hereto acknowledge and irrevocably agree (i)
that any Proceeding, whether involving claims in law or in equity, whether in
contract or in tort or otherwise, involving the Financing Related Parties and
relating to the Transactions or any related document or agreement, the
Financing or the performance of services thereunder or related thereto shall
be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of any state or federal court sitting
in the Borough of Manhattan, New York, New York, and any appellate court
thereof and each party hereto submits for itself and its property with respect
to any such Proceeding to the exclusive jurisdiction of such court, (ii) not
to bring or permit any of their Affiliates to bring or support anyone else in
bringing any such Proceeding in any other court, (iii) that service of process
or summons by registered mail addressed to them at their respective addresses
provided herein shall be effective service of process against them for any
such Proceeding brought in any such court, (iv) to waive and hereby waive, to
the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any objection which any of
them may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of, and the defense of
an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of, any such Proceeding in any such
court, (v) that a final and unappealable judgment in any such Proceeding shall
be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the
judgment or in any other manner provided by applicable Law; and (vi) that any
such Proceedings shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the
laws of the State of New York without regard to the conflicts of law rules of
such State that would result in the application of the laws of any other
State.



SECTION 9.13Waiver of Immunity. To the extent that any party has or hereafter
may acquire any immunity from jurisdiction of any court or from any legal
process (whether through service or notice, attachment prior to judgment,
attachment in aid of execution, execution or otherwise) with respect to itself
or its property, each such party hereby irrevocably waives such immunity in
respect of its obligations with respect to this Agreement; provided, however,
that this provision does not, and shall not be deemed to, modify the exclusive
jurisdiction provisions in Section 9.10(b) and Section 9.12(b) of this
Agreement.

("Skadden") pursuant to Section 7.02(c) and Section 7.03(c), respectively, of

2018, by and among Denbury Resources Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Parent"),
Dragon Merger Sub, Inc., a Virginia corporation ("Merger Sub"), DR Sub LLC, a
Virginia limited liability company ("LLC Sub"), and Penn Virginia Corporation,
a Virginia corporation ("Company"), regarding certain U.S. federal income tax
consequences of the Integrated Mergers, you have requested certain
representations from Parent, Merger Sub and LLC Sub. This officer's
certificate (the "Officer's Certificate") is being provided to you in response
to that request. Except as otherwise provided, all "section" references are to

Recognizing and acknowledging that Vinson and Elkins and Skadden will rely on

hereby represents and certifies, on behalf of Parent, Merger Sub and LLC Sub,
that the statements and representations contained herein are true, correct and

The information and facts relating to the Integrated Mergers and all related
transactions (including all representations, warranties, covenants and
undertakings) set forth in the Agreement and the registration statement (File
No. [•]) of Parent on Form S-4, including the joint proxy statement/prospectus
contained therein, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (as
amended through the date hereof, the "Registration Statement"), insofar as
such information relates to (i) Parent, Merger Sub and LLC Sub and (ii) the
plans or intentions of Parent, Merger Sub and LLC Sub, are true, correct and
complete in all material respects. 

 

| 
---|--- 

3\.

|

The Agreement (including exhibits and schedules thereto), the Registration
Statement and the other documents described in the Registration Statement
represent the entire understanding of Parent, Merger Sub, LLC Sub and Company
with respect to the Integrated Mergers, and there are no other written or oral
agreements regarding the Integrated Mergers other than those expressly
referred to in the Agreement, the Registration Statement and the other
documents described in the Registration Statement. The Integrated Mergers will
be consummated solely in compliance with the Agreement, and neither Parent,
Merger Sub nor LLC Sub has any plan or intention to waive or modify, and has
not waived or modified, any of the material terms or conditions in the
Agreement. The Integrated Mergers are being effected for the business reasons
described in the Registration Statement. The Integrated Mergers form part of,
and are being undertaken pursuant to, an integrated overall plan.

The Merger Consideration was arrived at as a result of arm's length
negotiations between the board of directors of Parent and the board of
directors of Company.

At the signing date of the Agreement, the aggregate fair market value of the
Parent common stock provided in the Merger will be at least 45 percent of the
fair market value of the total consideration to be received by the holders of
Company common stock pursuant to the Merger, including, for purposes of this
representation, amounts payable in lieu of fractional shares (such
determination to be calculated using the price $[•] per Parent common stock,
which is the average of the high and low sales prices of Parent common stock

2 For purposes of this Officer's Certificate, a related corporation is a
corporation that either (i) is in a group of corporations where the common
parent owns at least 80% of the voting power and value of the stock of one
member and every other corporation in the group (except the common parent) is
owned at least 80% by vote and value by another corporation in the group or
(ii) has at least 50% of its total voting power or total equity value directly
or indirectly owned by Parent (applying the attribution rules of section 318
of the Code as modified pursuant to section 304(c)(3)(B) of the Code).
Corporations will be treated as related if the relationship described in (i)
or (ii) above exists immediately before or immediately after the acquisition
in question or where the relationship is created in connection with the
Integrated Mergers. 

directly or indirectly through any transaction, agreement or arrangement with
any other person (including by derivative transactions such as equity swaps
which would have the economic effect of an acquisition) redeem or repurchase
any Parent common stock issued to shareholders of Company in the Merger or
make any extraordinary distribution in respect of such Parent common stock.
Additionally, prior to and in connection with the Integrated Mergers, neither
Parent nor any corporation related to Parent has acquired Company common
stock. For purposes of this representation, a corporation that owns an
interest in an entity that is taxed as a partnership or is a disregarded
entity will be treated as owning or acquiring its share of any stock owned or
acquired, as the case may be, by the partnership or disregarded entity and as
having furnished its share of any consideration furnished by the partnership
or disregarded entity to acquire the stock, in each case, in accordance with
its interest in the partnership or disregarded entity. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, consistent with Revenue Ruling 99-58, 1999-2 C.B. 701, Parent may
modify a pre-existing open market stock repurchase program that is effected
through brokers with the repurchases made at the prevailing market price under
the following conditions: (i) after the modification, repurchases will
continue to be made only on the open market through brokers at the prevailing
market price; (ii) neither the program nor the modification was a matter
negotiated with Company or former Company stockholders; (iii) there is no
understanding between Parent and any stockholder of Company that such
stockholder's ownership of Parent common stock received in the Merger will be
transitory; (iv) Parent does not know the identity of a seller of Parent
common stock; (v) a former Company stockholder who received Parent common
stock in the Merger and subsequently sold such stock would not know, to the
knowledge of Parent, whether Parent was the buyer, and Parent will use its
best efforts to ensure that such Company stockholders would not know whether
Parent was the buyer; (vi) without regard to the repurchase program, a market
exists for the Parent common stock issued to the former Company stockholders
in the Merger and there will be sales of Parent common stock on such open
market; and (vii) the number of shares repurchased will not exceed the total
number of shares of Parent common stock issued and outstanding prior to the
Integrated Mergers or the number of shares of Parent common stock received by
Company stockholders in the Merger.



| 
---|--- 

7\.

|

There is no understanding between Parent or any person related to Parent, on
the one hand, and Company, any person related to Company or any of their
respective stockholders, on the other hand, that any Company stockholder's
ownership of Parent common stock issued in the Merger would be transitory. 

 

| 
---|--- 

8\.

|

In connection with the Integrated Mergers, no dividends or distributions will
be made to the former Company shareholders by Parent other than regular,
normal dividends or distributions made to all holders of Parent common stock. 

 

| 
---|--- 

9\.

|

Parent has no plan or intention (i) to merge LLC Sub with or into another
corporation or entity (other than Parent or an entity that is disregarded as
separate from Parent for U.S. federal income tax purposes); (ii) to sell,
transfer or otherwise dispose of the membership 

interests of LLC Sub; or (iii) to cause LLC Sub to sell, distribute, transfer
or otherwise dispose of any of its assets following the Integrated Mergers
(except for dispositions of such assets (a) made in the ordinary course of
business and/or (b) transfers permitted by Treasury Regulations section
1.368-2(k)).



| 
---|--- 

10\.

|

Except as otherwise provided in Section 6.06 of the Agreement, Parent, Merger
Sub, LLC Sub, Company, and the stockholders of Company will each pay their
respective expenses, if any, incurred in connection with the Integrated
Mergers. 

 

| 
---|--- 

11\.

|

There is no intercorporate indebtedness existing between Parent or any of its
subsidiaries (including Merger Sub and LLC Sub), on the one hand, and Company
or any of its subsidiaries, on the other hand, that was issued, acquired or
will be settled at a discount. 

 

| 
---|--- 

12\.

|

Following the Integrated Mergers, Parent (or a member of its "qualified group"
as defined in Treasury Regulations section 1.368-1(d)(4)(ii)) will continue
the "historic business" of Company or use a "significant portion" of Company's
"historic business assets" in a business, in each case as such terms are used
in Treasury Regulations section 1.368-1(d). 

 

| 
---|--- 

13\.

|

Neither Parent nor Merger Sub is an "investment company," as defined in
sections 368(a)(2)(F)(iii) and (iv) (i.e., a regulated investment company, a
real estate investment trust, or a corporation 50 percent or more of the value
of whose total assets (excluding cash and cash equivalents) are stock and
securities and 80 percent or more of whose total assets are assets held for
investment). In making the 50 percent and 80 percent determinations, (i) stock
and securities in any subsidiary corporation shall be disregarded and the
parent corporation shall be deemed to own its ratable share of the
subsidiary's assets, and (ii) a corporation shall be considered to be a
subsidiary if the parent owns 50 percent or more of the combined voting power
of all classes of stock entitled to vote, or 50 percent or more of the total
value of shares of all classes of stock outstanding.

---|--- 

14\.

|

None of Parent, Merger Sub or LLC Sub is, or will be at the Effective Time,
under the jurisdiction of a court in a "title 11 or similar case" within the
meaning of section 368(a)(3)(A). 

 

| 
---|--- 

15\.

|

Immediately after the Integrated Mergers, the aggregate fair market value of
the assets of Company will equal or exceed the sum of its liabilities, plus
(without duplication) the amount of liabilities, if any, to which such assets
are subject. 

 

| 
---|--- 

16\.

|

Merger Sub will have no liabilities assumed by Company and will not transfer
to Company any assets subject to liabilities in the Merger. To the knowledge
of Parent, the liabilities of Company to be assumed by LLC Sub and the
liabilities to which the transferred assets of Company are subject have been
incurred by Company in the ordinary course of business. 

 

| 
---|--- 

17\.

|

The payment of cash, if any, in lieu of fractional shares of Parent common
stock represents a mere mechanical rounding off solely for the purpose of
avoiding the expense and inconvenience to Parent of issuing fractional shares
and does not represent separately bargained-for consideration. The total cash
consideration that will be paid in the Merger 

to Company stockholders instead of issuing fractional shares of Parent common
stock will not exceed one percent of the total consideration that will be
issued in the Merger to Company stockholders in exchange for their shares of
Company common stock. The fractional share interests of each Company
stockholder will be aggregated, and no Company stockholder, with the possible
exception of stockholders whose holdings are in multiple accounts or with
multiple brokers, will receive cash in lieu of fractional shares in an amount
equal to or greater than the value of one full share of Parent common stock.



| 
---|--- 

18\.

|

None of the compensation received (or to be received) by any stockholder-
employee of Company will be separate consideration for, or allocable to, any
Company common stock held by such stockholder-employee; none of the shares of
Parent common stock received in the Merger by any stockholder-employees was
(or will be) separate consideration for, or allocable to, any employment
agreement; and the compensation paid (or to be paid) to any stockholder-
employees of Company was (or will be) for services actually rendered or to be
rendered and was (or will be) commensurate with amounts paid to third parties
bargaining at arm's-length for similar services. 

 

| 
---|--- 

19\.

|

Merger Sub and LLC Sub are entities newly-formed for purposes of participating
in the Integrated Mergers, and, at no time prior to the Effective Time, have
Merger Sub or LLC Sub owned any assets (other than nominal assets contributed
upon formation), incurred any indebtedness for money borrowed, issued equity
to any person other than Parent or engaged in any trade or business activities
or operations. 

 

| 
---|--- 

20\.

|

Merger Sub and LLC Sub are, and at all times through the effective time of the
LLC Sub Merger and immediately following the effective time of the LLC Sub
Merger will be, direct, wholly-owned subsidiaries of Parent. 

 

| 
---|--- 

21\.

|

LLC Sub is, and at all times through the effective time of the LLC Sub Merger
and immediately following the effective time of the LLC Sub Merger will be,
disregarded as separate from Parent for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
Neither Parent nor LLC Sub will file an election pursuant to Treasury
Regulations section 301.7701-3 to cause LLC Sub to be treated as other than an
entity disregarded as separate from Parent for U.S. federal income tax
purposes. In addition, Parent has no plan or intention to take any other
action (or cause LLC Sub to take any other action) that would cause LLC Sub to
be treated as other than an entity disregarded as separate from Parent for
U.S. federal income tax purposes. 

 

| 
---|--- 

22\.

|

No equity interests in Merger Sub or LLC Sub will be issued pursuant to the
Integrated Mergers. 

 

| 
---|--- 

23\.

|

There will be no dissenter or appraisal rights in connection with the
Integrated Mergers under the VSCA or the VLLCA. 

 

| 
---|--- 

24\.

|

Parent will not (and will cause its Affiliates, including, after the Merger,
Company, not to) take any position on any U.S. federal, state or local income
or franchise tax return, or take any other tax reporting position, that is
inconsistent with the treatment of the Integrated Mergers, taken together, as
a single integrated transaction qualifying as a 

reorganization within the meaning of section 368(a) and the Treasury
Regulations promulgated thereunder, except to the extent required by a
"determination" (as defined in section 1313(a)(1) or any comparable provision
of applicable state or local income or franchise tax law).



The undersigned acknowledges that the Opinions will be (i) based on the
accuracy of the facts, representations, and covenants set forth herein, all of
which will be assumed to be true, correct and complete without regard to any
qualification as to knowledge or belief, on the accuracy of the Form S-4 and
on the accuracy of the facts, representations, and covenants and the
satisfaction of the covenants and obligations contained in the Agreement and
the other documents related thereto and (ii) subject to certain limitations
and qualifications, including that they may not be relied upon if any such
facts, representations, or covenants are not accurate or if any such covenants
or obligations are not satisfied.

The undersigned recognizes that the Opinions will not address any tax
consequences of the Integrated Mergers or any action taken in connection
therewith except as expressly set forth in the Opinions.

The undersigned hereby undertakes to promptly and timely inform Vinson and
Elkins and Skadden if the undersigned should have reason to believe that any
of the facts, representations, or covenants herein become untrue, incorrect or
incomplete.

Ladies and Gentlemen:



In connection with the opinions (the "Opinions") to be delivered by Vinson and
Elkins LLP ("Vinson and Elkins") and Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP
("Skadden") pursuant to Section 7.02(c) and Section 7.03(c), respectively, of
the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Agreement")1 dated as of October 28,
2018, by and among Denbury Resources, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Parent"),
Dragon Merger Sub Inc., a Virginia corporation ("Merger Sub"), DR Sub LLC, a
Virginia limited liability company ("LLC Sub"), and Penn Virginia Corporation,
a Virginia corporation (the "Company"), regarding certain U.S. federal income
tax consequences of the Integrated Mergers, you have requested certain
representations from the Company. This officer's certificate (the "Officer's
Certificate") is being provided to you in response to that request. Except as
otherwise provided, all "section" references are to the Internal Revenue Code
of 1986, as amended (the "Code") and all "Treasury Regulations section"
references are to the Treasury regulations promulgated under the Code.

Recognizing and acknowledging that Vinson and Elkins and Skadden will rely on
the representations and statements set forth in this Officer's Certificate in
delivering their respective Opinions, and that such Opinions will be based
upon an assumption that all of the representations and statements set forth
herein are true, accurate, and complete without regard to any qualification as
to knowledge, belief, or otherwise, the undersigned, an officer of the
Company, hereby represents and certifies, on behalf of the Company, that the
statements and representations contained herein are true, correct and complete
in all respects as of the date hereof, and will be true, correct and complete
in all respects through the subsequent periods specified herein (except that,
with respect to any facts or statements regarding Parent, Merger Sub and LLC
Sub, whether or not such facts or statements are qualified by knowledge, the
undersigned hereby certifies and represents on behalf of the Company only that
the undersigned is not aware that such facts or statements are not true,
correct, or complete):

| 
---|--- 

1\.

|

The undersigned is authorized to make all of the representations set forth
herein on behalf of the Company. The undersigned is familiar with the matters
set forth herein and has 

 

































1 Terms used herein shall have the meanings ascribed to them in, and shall be
interpreted in accordance with, the applicable U.S. federal income tax law and
regulations. All capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the
meaning specified, either directly or by reference, in the Agreement. 

made such investigations of factual matters as the undersigned has deemed
reasonably necessary for the purpose of making the representations and
statements herein.



| 
---|--- 

2\.

|

The information and facts relating to the Integrated Mergers and all related
transactions (including all representations, warranties, covenants and
undertakings) set forth in the Agreement and the registration statement (File
No. [•]) of Parent on Form S-4, including the joint proxy statement/prospectus
contained therein, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (as
amended through the date hereof, the "Registration Statement"), insofar as
such information relates to (i) the Company and (ii) the plans or intentions
of the Company, are true, correct and complete in all material respects. 

 

| 
---|--- 

3\.

|

The Agreement (including exhibits and schedules thereto), the Registration
Statement and the other documents described in the Registration Statement
represent the entire understanding of Parent, Merger Sub, LLC Sub and the
Company with respect to the Integrated Mergers, and there are no other written
or oral agreements regarding the Integrated Mergers other than those expressly
referred to in the Agreement, the Registration Statement and the other
documents described in the Registration Statement. The Integrated Mergers will
be consummated solely in compliance with the Agreement, and the Company has no
plan or intention to waive or modify, and has not waived or modified, any of
the material terms or conditions in the Agreement. The Integrated Mergers are
being effected for the business reasons described in the Registration
Statement. The Integrated Mergers form part of, and are being undertaken
pursuant to, an integrated overall plan. 

 

| 
---|--- 

4\.

|

The Merger Consideration was arrived at as a result of arm's length
negotiations between the board of directors of Parent and the board of
directors of the Company. 

 

| 
---|--- 

5\.

|

At the signing date of the Agreement, the aggregate fair market value of the
Parent common stock provided in the Merger will be at least 45 percent of the
fair market value of the total consideration to be received by the holders of
Company common stock pursuant to the Merger, including, for purposes of this
representation, amounts payable in lieu of fractional shares (such
determination to be calculated using the price $[•] per Parent common stock,
which is the average of the high and low sales prices of Parent common stock
on [•]). 

 

| 
---|--- 

6\.

|

None of the Company, any corporation related to the Company,2 and any person
acting as an intermediary for the Company or a related person has redeemed or
acquired, nor 

 













































2 For purposes of this Officer's Certificate, a related corporation is a
corporation that either (i) is in a group of corporations where the common
parent owns at least 80% of the voting power and value of the stock of one
member and every other corporation in the group (except the common parent) is
owned at least 80% by vote and value by another corporation in the group or
(ii) has at least 50% of its total voting power or total equity value directly
or indirectly owned by Company (applying the attribution rules of section 318
of the Code as modified pursuant to section 304(c)(3)(B) of the Code).
Corporations will be treated as related if the relationship described in (i)
or (ii) above exists immediately before or immediately after the acquisition
in question or where the relationship is created in connection with the
Integrated Mergers. 

will it redeem or acquire, any Company common stock, directly or indirectly.
The Company has not made, and in connection with or in contemplation of the
Integrated Mergers or otherwise as part of a plan of which the Integrated
Mergers are a part will not cause to be made, directly or indirectly, any
distributions on its stock (other than dividends made in the ordinary course
of business). For purposes of this representation, a corporation that owns an
interest in an entity that is taxed as a partnership or disregarded entity
will be treated as owning or acquiring its share of any stock owned or
acquired, as the case may be, by the partnership or disregarded entity and as
having furnished its share of any consideration furnished by the partnership
or disregarded entity to acquire the stock, in each case, in accordance with
its interest in the partnership or disregarded entity.



| 
---|--- 

7\.

|

To the knowledge of the Company, there is no plan or intention on the part of
stockholders of the Company to sell, exchange or otherwise transfer ownership
of (including by derivative transactions such as an equity swap which would
have the economic effect of a transfer of ownership) any Parent common stock
received in the Merger to Parent, or any corporation related to Parent,
directly or indirectly (including through third parties in connection with a
plan to so transfer ownership), other than fractional shares of Parent common
stock for which holders of Company common stock receive cash in the Merger.
For purposes of this representation, a corporation that owns an interest in an
entity that is taxed as a partnership or is a disregarded entity will be
treated as owning or acquiring its share of any stock owned or acquired, as
the case may be, by the partnership or disregarded entity and as having
furnished its share of any consideration furnished by the partnership or
disregarded entity to acquire the stock, in each case, in accordance with its
interest in the partnership. Notwithstanding the foregoing, consistent with
Revenue Ruling 99-58, 1999-2 C.B. 701, Parent may modify a pre-existing open
market stock repurchase program that is effected through brokers with the
repurchases made at the prevailing market price under the following
conditions: (i) after the modification, repurchases will continue to be made
only on the open market through brokers at the prevailing market price; (ii)
neither the program nor the modification was a matter negotiated with the
Company or former Company stockholders; (iii) there is no understanding
between Parent and any stockholder of the Company that such stockholder's
ownership of Parent common stock received in the Merger will be transitory;
(iv) Parent does not know the identity of a seller of Parent common stock; (v)
a former Company stockholder who received Parent common stock in the Merger
and subsequently sold such stock would not know, to the knowledge of Parent,
whether Parent was the buyer, and Parent will use its best efforts to ensure
that such Company stockholders would not know whether Parent was the buyer;
(vi) without regard to the repurchase program, a market exists for the Parent
common stock issued to the former Company stockholders in the Merger and there
will be sales of Parent common stock on such open market; and (vii) the number
of shares repurchased will not exceed the total number of shares of Parent
common stock issued and outstanding prior to the Integrated Mergers or the
number of shares of Parent common stock received by Company stockholders in
the Merger. 

 

| 
---|--- 

8\.

|

There is no understanding between the Company or any person related to the
Company (or, to the knowledge of the Company, any of their respective
stockholders), on the one hand, and Parent or any person related to Parent, on
the other hand, that any Company 

stockholder's ownership of Parent common stock issued in the Merger would be
transitory.



| 
---|--- 

9\.

|

Except as otherwise provided in Section 6.06 of the Agreement, Parent, Merger
Sub, LLC Sub, the Company, and the stockholders of the Company will each pay
their respective expenses, if any, incurred in connection with the Integrated
Mergers. 

 

| 
---|--- 

10\.

|

There is no intercorporate indebtedness existing between Parent or any of its
subsidiaries (including Merger Sub and LLC Sub), on the one hand, and the
Company or any of its subsidiaries, on the other hand, that was issued,
acquired or will be settled at a discount. 

 

| 
---|--- 

11\.

|

In connection with the Integrated Mergers, any outstanding warrants, options,
convertible securities or any type of right pursuant to which any person could
acquire Company common stock will be cancelled, converted or assumed by Parent
in accordance with the Agreement. 

 

| 
---|--- 

12\.

|

The Company conducts a "historic business" for purposes of Treasury
Regulations section 1.368-1(d), and no assets of the Company have been sold,
transferred, or otherwise disposed of that would prevent Parent or a member of
its "qualified group" (as defined in Treasury Regulations section
1.368-1(d)(4)(ii)) from continuing such "historic business" or from using a
"significant portion" of the Company's "historic business assets" in a
business (in each case as such terms are used in Treasury Regulations section
1.368-1(d)) following the Integrated Mergers. 

 

| 
---|--- 

13\.

|

The Company is not an "investment company," as defined in sections
368(a)(2)(F)(iii) and (iv) (i.e., a regulated investment company, a real
estate investment trust, or a corporation 50 percent or more of the value of
whose total assets (excluding cash and cash equivalents) are stock and
securities and 80 percent or more of whose total assets are assets held for
investment). In making the 50 percent and 80 percent determinations, (i) stock
and securities in any subsidiary corporation shall be disregarded and the
parent corporation shall be deemed to own its ratable share of the
subsidiary's assets, and (ii) a corporation shall be considered to be a
subsidiary if the parent owns 50 percent or more of the combined voting power
of all classes of stock entitled to vote, or 50 percent or more of the total
value of shares of all classes of stock outstanding. 

 

| 
---|--- 

14\.

|

The Integrated Mergers are not occurring pursuant to a plan of reorganization
approved by a court in a "title 11 or similar case" within the meaning of
section 368(a)(3)(A). 

 

| 
---|--- 

15\.

|

The liabilities of the Company to be assumed by LLC Sub and the liabilities to
which the transferred assets of the Company are subject have been incurred by
the Company in the ordinary course of business. 

 

| 
---|--- 

16\.

|

On the date of the Merger, the aggregate fair market value of the assets of
the Company will equal or exceed the sum of its liabilities, plus (without
duplication) the amount of liabilities, if any, to which such assets are
subject. 

 

| 
---|--- 

17\.

|

No Company subsidiary owns, or has owned, any shares of Company common stock. 

| 
---|--- 

18\.

|

The Company has no (and, at the time of the Merger, will not have any) issued
and outstanding stock (or any other interest treated as stock for U.S. federal
income tax purposes) other than Company common stock. 

 

| 
---|--- 

19\.

|

All of the Company's currently outstanding financial positions that it has
ever treated as debt for U.S. federal income tax purposes (by deducting
interest or otherwise) are properly classified as debt rather than as equity
for such purposes and have not been treated as other than debt for any other
purpose. 

 

| 
---|--- 

20\.

|

The payment of cash, if any, in lieu of fractional shares of Parent common
stock represents a mere mechanical rounding off solely for the purpose of
avoiding the expense and inconvenience to Parent of issuing fractional shares
and does not represent separately bargained-for consideration. The total cash
consideration that will be paid in the Merger to Company stockholders instead
of issuing fractional shares of Parent common stock will not exceed one
percent of the total consideration that will be issued in the Merger to
Company stockholders in exchange for their shares of Company common stock. The
fractional share interests of each Company stockholder will be aggregated, and
no Company stockholder, with the possible exception of stockholders whose
holdings are in multiple accounts or with multiple brokers, will receive cash
in lieu of fractional shares in an amount equal to or greater than the value
of one full share of Parent common stock. 

 

| 
---|--- 

21\.

|

None of the compensation received (or to be received) by any stockholder-
employee of the Company will be separate consideration for, or allocable to,
any Company common stock held by such stockholder-employee; none of the shares
of Parent common stock received in the Merger by any stockholder-employees was
(or will be) separate consideration for, or allocable to, any employment
agreement; and the compensation paid (or to be paid) to any stockholder-
employees of the Company was (or will be) for services actually rendered or to
be rendered and was (or will be) commensurate with amounts paid to third
parties bargaining at arm's-length for similar services. 

 

| 
---|--- 

22\.

|

There will be no dissenter or appraisal rights in connection with the
Integrated Mergers under the VSCA or the VLLCA. 

 

| 
---|--- 

23\.

|

The Company will not (and will cause its Affiliates not to), prior to the
Effective Time, take any position on any U.S. federal, state or local income
or franchise tax return, or take any other tax reporting position, that is
inconsistent with the treatment of the Integrated Mergers, taken together, as
a single integrated transaction qualifying as a reorganization within the
meaning of section 368(a) and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder,
except to the extent required by a "determination" (as defined in section
1313(a)(1) or any comparable provision of applicable state or local income or
franchise tax law). 

 

The undersigned acknowledges that the Opinions will be (i) based on the
accuracy of the facts, representations, and covenants set forth herein, all of
which will be assumed to be true, correct and complete without regard to any
qualification as to knowledge or belief, on the accuracy of the Form S-4 and
on the accuracy of the facts, representations, and covenants and the
satisfaction of the covenants and obligations contained in the Agreement and
the other 

documents related thereto and (ii) subject to certain limitations and
qualifications including that they may not be relied upon if any such facts,
representations, or covenants are not accurate or if any such covenants or
obligations are not satisfied.

The undersigned recognizes that the Opinions will not address any tax
consequences of the Integrated Mergers or any action taken in connection
therewith except as expressly set forth in the Opinions.

The undersigned hereby undertakes to promptly and timely inform Vinson and
Elkins and Skadden if the undersigned should have reason to believe that any
of the facts, representations, or covenants herein become untrue, incorrect or
incomplete.
