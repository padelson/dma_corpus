No interest shall be paid or accrued on any Merger Consideration, any cash in

evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock
transfer Taxes have been paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by  _Section
2.04(a)_ and this _Section 3.01_, each Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall

Certificate or Book-Entry Share is entitled to receive pursuant to _Section
3.01(e)_ and any dividends or other distributions with respect to the Parent

(c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares of Parent Common
Stock_. No dividends or other distributions declared or made with a record
date after the Effective Time with respect to the Parent Common Stock shall be
paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Share until
the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall surrender such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share in accordance with _Section 3.01(b)_. Subject

(d) _No Further Rights in Company Common Stock_. The Merger Consideration paid
in accordance with the terms of this  _Article III_ (including any cash paid
pursuant to _Section 3.01(c)_ or _Section 3.01(e)_) upon conversion of any

pertaining to such Shares. 

(e) _No Fractional Shares_. No fractional shares of Parent Common Stock or
book-entry credit of the same shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange
of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, and such fractional share interests will
not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a stockholder
of Parent. Each holder of a fractional share interest (after 

 



19  taking into account all fractional share interests held by such holder)
shall receive, in lieu thereof, an amount in cash (without interest, rounded
down to the nearest whole cent and subject to the amount of any withholding
Taxes as contemplated in _Section 3.01(i)_) equal to the product obtained by

shares or other like change with respect to Parent Common Stock or Company
Common Stock with a record date occurring on or after the date hereof and
prior to the Effective Time.

(including proceeds of any investment thereof) that remains undistributed to
the holders of Shares on the date that is one (1) year after the Effective
Time shall be delivered to Parent or its designee, upon demand, and any
holders of Shares who have not theretofore complied with this _Article III_
shall thereafter look only to Parent as a general creditor for the Merger
Consideration to which they are entitled pursuant to _Section 2.04(a)_, any
cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which they are
entitled pursuant to _Section 3.01(e)_ and any dividends or other
distributions with respect to the Parent Common Stock to which they are
entitled pursuant to  _Section 3.01(c)_.

(h) _No Liability_. None of the Exchange Agent, Parent or the Surviving
Corporation shall be liable to any holder of Shares for any Merger
Consideration from the Exchange Fund (or dividends or distributions with
respect to Parent Common Stock) or other cash delivered to a public official
pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Any portion of
the Exchange Fund remaining unclaimed by holders of Shares as of a date which
is immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to
or become property of any Governmental Authority shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, become the property of Parent free and clear of
any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

(i)  _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Surviving Corporation, the Exchange
Agent, Parent and Merger Sub shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement in respect of Shares such
amount as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of
such payment under the Code, the rules or regulations promulgated thereunder,
any provision of applicable state, local or foreign Tax Law or any other Law;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that if Parent determines that any amount is
required by Law to be deducted or withheld with respect to the making of such
payment, or that any Tax forms are necessary to establish that no such
deduction or withholding is required, Parent shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to notify the holder of any Shares subject to deduction or
withholding at least three (3) Business Days prior to any such deduction or
withholding (or as soon as practicable thereafter if Parent makes such
determination within the 5-day period prior to the Closing Date). To the
extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the applicable
Governmental Authority, such withheld amounts shall be treated for purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Shares in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made.



 



20 (j) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as
Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it
with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange
for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration with
respect to the Shares formerly represented by such Certificate to which the
holder thereof is entitled pursuant to _Section 2.04(a)_, any cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which the holder thereof is
entitled pursuant to _Section 3.01(e)_ and any dividends or other
distributions with respect to the Parent Common Stock to which the holder
thereof is entitled pursuant to _Section 3.01(c)_.

and exchanged solely for the Merger Consideration with respect to the Shares
formerly represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares to which the
holders thereof are entitled pursuant to _Section 2.04(a)_, any cash in lieu
of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which the holders of such
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are entitled pursuant to _Section 3.01(e)_
and any dividends or other distributions with respect to the Parent Common
Stock to which the holders of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are
entitled pursuant to _Section 3.01(c)_.

interest), if any, subject to applicable withholding of Taxes, equal to the
product obtained by multiplying (x) the aggregate number of shares of Company
Common Stock that were issuable upon exercise of such Company Stock Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time, by (y) the value of the Merger
Consideration (with the Share Consideration valued based on the closing price
of a share of Parent Common Stock as of the trading day immediately preceding
the Closing Date) less the per share exercise price of such Company Stock
Option (it being understood and agreed that such exercise price shall
not actually be paid to the Company by the holder of a Company Stock Option).
For the avoidance of doubt, if the exercise price payable upon exercise of a
Company

Common Stock as of the trading day immediately preceding the Closing Date),
such Company Stock Option shall be cancelled for no consideration.

and for each share of Company Restricted Stock, a holder thereof shall be
entitled to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with _Section
2.04(a)_ of this Agreement, subject to applicable withholding of Taxes (which

Time and each holder of a Company RSU shall be paid at or promptly after the
Effective Time, the Merger Consideration multiplied by the number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to such cancelled Company RSU, subject to
applicable withholding of Taxes (which shall be deducted ratably from the
Cash Consideration and the Share Consideration); _provided_ , that, with
respect to any Company RSU that constitutes nonqualified deferred compensation
subject to Section 409A of the Code and that is not permitted to be paid at
or promptly after the Effective Time without triggering a Tax or penalty under
Section 409A of the Code, such payment shall be made at the earliest time
permitted that will not trigger a Tax or penalty under Section 409A of the
Code.

Section 3.06 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary and to the extent available under the DGCL, any Shares
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that are held by a holder
(a " _Dissenting Stockholder_ ") who has neither voted in favor of the

Shares_ ") in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL shall not be converted
into, or represent the right to receive, the Merger Consideration. Such
Dissenting Stockholders shall be entitled to receive payment of the appraised
value of Dissenting Shares held by them in accordance with the provisions of
Section 262 of the DGCL, except that all Dissenting Shares held by
stockholders who have failed to perfect or who effectively have withdrawn or
lost their rights to appraisal of such Dissenting Shares pursuant to Section
262 of the DGCL shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into, and
represent only the right to receive, the Merger Consideration in the manner
provided in _Section 2.04_ and this _Article III_ and shall no longer be
Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
_Section 3.06_, if the Merger is rescinded or abandoned, then the right of
any stockholder to be paid the fair value of such stockholders Dissenting
Shares

 



22  pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL shall cease. The Company shall give
Parent and Merger Sub prompt notice of any written demands for appraisal,
attempted withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments served
pursuant to applicable Law received by the Company relating to stockholders
rights of appraisal. The Company shall give Parent and Merger Sub the
opportunity to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings
with respect to demands for appraisal. The Company shall not, except with the

any unconsolidated affiliate, on the other hand), including any structured
finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or Person, or any "off-
balance sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K under

unaudited interim financial statements of the Company included therein).

possession of all Parent Permits, except where the failure to possess, or the
suspension or cancellation of, any of the Parent Permits would not have a
Parent Material Adverse Effect. No suspension or cancellation of any of the

forms, reports, statements, schedules and other documents required to be filed
by it with the SEC since January 1, 2014 (the " _Parent SEC Reports_ "). The
Parent SEC Reports (i) at the time they were filed and, if amended, as of the

thereunder, and (ii) did not, at the time they were filed, and, if amended, as
of the date of such amendment, contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
in order to make the statements made therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. No Subsidiary of
Parent is required to file any form, report, statement, schedule or
other document with the SEC.



 



43 (b) Each of the consolidated financial statements (including, in each case,

each fairly presents, in all material respects, the consolidated financial
position, results of operations and cash flows of Parent and its consolidated

designed to ensure that material information relating to Parent, including its
consolidated Subsidiaries, is in all material respects made known to the
principal executive officer and the principal financial and
accounting officer of Parent by others within those entities. Based on
Parents managements most recently completed evaluation of Parents internal

fraud that involves management or other employees who have a significant role
in Parents internal control over financial reporting.

or relationship between or among Parent and any of its Subsidiaries, on the
one hand, and any unconsolidated affiliate, on the other hand), including any
structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or Person, or
any "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation
S-K under the Securities Act), where the result, purpose or

 



44  effect of such contract, agreement or arrangement is to avoid disclosure of
any material transaction involving, or material liabilities of, Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries in the Parent SEC Reports (including any audited
financial statements and unaudited interim financial statements of Parent
included therein).

such provision then in effect.

 

Section 5.09 _Absence of Litigation_. As of the date of this Agreement, there
is no Action pending or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened in writing

officer of Parent in such capacity as director or officer), before
any Governmental Authority that, if adversely determined against Parent or
its applicable Subsidiary, would be, or would reasonably be expected to be,
material to Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. As of the date of
this Agreement, neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any property

or any of its Subsidiaries has any obligation or (C) that are maintained,
contributed to or sponsored by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries for the
benefit of any current or former Service Provider, and (ii) all material
contracts, arrangements or understandings between Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries and any current or former Service Provider that provide for
compensation or benefits, or the acceleration of the vesting or payment of
compensation or benefits, to any current or former Service Provider arising

any provision of any existing standstill or confidentiality agreement to
which it or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, and the Company shall, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries to, enforce the provisions of any such agreement;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Company may grant a waiver of, and shall
not be obligated to enforce, any such provision (i) to the extent required to
permit a party to submit a Company Acquisition Proposal and (ii) if the
Company Board (or any committee thereof) has determined in good faith, after

_provided_ that, notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may grant a
waiver, amendment or release under any confidentiality or standstill

(or any committee thereof) so long as (x) the Company Board has determined in
good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) that the failure to
grant such waiver would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law and (y) the Company promptly (and, in any event, within 24
hours) notifies Parent of any such waiver, amendment or release; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval,
nothing contained in this _Section 7.03_ shall prevent the Company or the
Company Board (or any committee thereof) from furnishing information to, or
engaging in discussions, communications or negotiations with, any Person that
made a bona fide Company Acquisition Proposal, which Company Acquisition
Proposal did not result from a breach (or deemed breach in accordance with

such action referred to in clause (ii) above, (A) the Company Board (1)
determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside advisors) that
such Company Acquisition Proposal is, or would reasonably be expected to
result in, a Company Superior Proposal, and (2) determines in good faith

66  determination), and (C) the Company receives from such Person an executed
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement. The Company shall deliver to Parent a
copy of any executed Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement promptly (and, in
any event, within 24 hours) following its execution. The Company shall provide

this sub-clause (ii), if made orally, and if the Company reasonably believes
that such oral Company Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, offer, proposal or
request is likely to result in such Person making a Company
Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, offer, proposal or request in writing, a
reasonably detailed description of such Company Acquisition Proposal, inquiry,

concerning a Company Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall promptly (and,
in any event, within 48 hours) following a determination by the Company Board
(or any committee thereof) that a Company Acquisition Proposal is a Company
Superior Proposal, notify Parent of such determination.

 

 __(d) Except as expressly set forth in _Section 7.03(e)_, neither the
Company nor the Company Board, as applicable, shall, and neither shall
publicly propose to: (i) withhold, withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to
Parent, the Company Recommendation; (ii) approve or recommend any Company
Acquisition Proposal; (iii) enter into any Acquisition Agreement; or (iv)
refrain from recommending against (and reaffirming the Company Recommendation)
any Company Acquisition Proposal that is a tender offer or exchange offer

action, other than those set forth in the preceding clause (iii), a " _Change
in the Company Recommendation_ "). __



 



67 (e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, prior to the
receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company Board may effect a
Change in the Company Recommendation, and, in the case of clause (i) of this
_Section 7.03(e)_, and so long as the Company has not committed an
intentional breach (or deemed intentional breach in accordance with _Section
7.03(h)_) of this _Section 7.03_ that would have an adverse impact on the
ability of Parent to propose or negotiate any amendments or modifications to
this Agreement pursuant to this  _Section 7.03(e)_, terminate this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 9.01(d)(iv)_ in order to concurrently with such
termination enter into an Acquisition Agreement with respect to a Company
Superior Proposal, if (i) the Company receives an unsolicited, written
Company Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board determines in good faith
(after consultation with its outside advisors) is a Company Superior Proposal
and determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal
counsel) that its failure to take such actions would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law or (ii) a Company Intervening Event
occurs and as a result thereof the Company Board determines in good
faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that the failure to
effect a Change in the Company Recommendation would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ that

 

(A) prior to effecting such Change in the Company Recommendation with respect
to a Company Superior Proposal or, so long as the Company has not committed
an intentional breach (or deemed intentional breach in accordance with
_Section 7.03(h)_) of this _Section 7.03_ that would have an adverse impact
on the ability of Parent to propose or negotiate any amendments or
modifications to this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 7.03(e)_,
terminating this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.01(d)(iv)_, (w) the Company
has notified Parent in writing that it intends to effect a Change in the
Company Recommendation or, so long as the Company has not committed an
intentional breach (or deemed intentional breach in accordance with _Section

ability of Parent to propose or negotiate any amendments or modifications to
this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 7.03(e)_, terminate this Agreement

summary of the material terms and conditions of such Company Superior
Proposal, which shall include (at a minimum) all of the information that is
specified in _Section 7.03(c)_, (y) if requested to do so by Parent, for
a period of four (4) calendar days following delivery of such notice, the
Company shall have discussed and negotiated in good faith, and shall have made
the Representatives of the Company available to discuss and negotiate in good
faith, with Parent and its Representatives, any bona fide proposed
modifications to the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and (z) no
earlier than the end of such four (4) calendar day period, the Company Board
(after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor),
shall have determined in good faith, after considering the terms of any
proposed amendment or modification to this Agreement proposed by Parent during
such four (4) calendar day period, that such Company Superior Proposal still
constitutes a Company Superior Proposal and that the failure to make a Change
in the Company Recommendation or, so long as the Company has not committed an
intentional breach (or deemed intentional breach in accordance with _Section
7.03(h)_) of this _Section 7.03_ that would have an adverse impact on the
ability of Parent to propose or negotiate any amendments or modifications to
this Agreement pursuant to this  _Section 7.03(e)_, to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.01(d)(iv)_ in connection therewith would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law (it being
understood and agreed that any change to the financial or

 



68  other material terms of a proposal that was previously the subject of a
notice hereunder shall require a new notice to Parent as provided above, but
with respect to any such subsequent notices references herein to a "four (4)
calendar day period" shall be deemed to be references to a "two (2) calendar
day period"); and

 

(B) prior to effecting such Change in the Company Recommendation with respect
to a Company Intervening Event, (x) the Company has notified Parent in
writing that it intends to effect such Change in the Company Recommendation,
describing in reasonable detail the reasons for such Change in the Company
Recommendation, (y) if requested to do so by Parent, for a period of four (4)
calendar days following delivery of such notice, the Company shall have
discussed and negotiated in good faith, and shall have made the
Representatives of the Company available to discuss and negotiate in good
faith, with Parent and its Representatives any bona fide proposed
modifications to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and (z) no earlier
than the end of such four (4) calendar day period, the Company Board shall
have determined in good faith, after considering the terms of any proposed
amendment or modification to this Agreement proposed by Parent during such
four (4) calendar day period, that the failure to effect a Change in the
Company Recommendation would still be inconsistent with the Company Boards
fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

(f) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Company or the
Company Board from issuing a "stop, look and listen" communication pursuant to
Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act or complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule
14e-2 under the Exchange Act with respect to a Company Acquisition Proposal
or from making any disclosure to the Companys stockholders if the Company
Board determines (after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that its
failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law;  _provided_ that any Change in the Company Recommendation may
only be made in accordance with _Section 7.03(e)_. For the avoidance of
doubt, a factually accurate public statement that describes the Companys
receipt of a Company Acquisition Proposal and the operation of this Agreement
with respect thereto (without including a reaffirmation) shall not be deemed a
Change in the Company Recommendation.

(y) more than 20% of any class of equity securities, or securities
convertible into or exchangeable for equity securities, of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries; (B) any tender offer or exchange offer, as defined
pursuant to the Exchange Act, that if consummated would result, directly or
indirectly, in any Person or group (or the shareholders of any Person or
group) beneficially owning 20% or more of any class of equity securities, or
securities convertible into or exchangeable for equity securities, of _ _

 



69  the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; or (C) any merger, consolidation,
business combination, share exchange, recapitalization, liquidation,
dissolution or other similar transaction involving the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries that would result in any Person or group (or the shareholders of
any Person or group) beneficially owning, directly or indirectly, more than
20% of any class of equity securities, or securities convertible into or
exchangeable for equity securities, of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or 20% of the voting power of the surviving entity in a merger involving the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the resulting direct or indirect parent
of the Company, such Subsidiary or such surviving entity (or any securities
convertible into, or exchangeable for, securities representing such voting
power). Whenever the term "group" is used in this Agreement, it shall have
the definition set forth in Rule 13d-3 of the Exchange Act.

__(ii) " _Company Superior Proposal_ " means any bona fide written Company

Proposal did not result from a breach (or deemed breach pursuant to _Section
7.03(h)_) of this _Section 7.03_, that (A) is on terms that the Company
Board determines in good faith (after receiving the advice of its financial
advisor and outside legal counsel and after taking into account all the terms
and conditions of the Company Acquisition Proposal) are more favorable to the
Companys stockholders from a financial point of view than the Merger and the
transactions contemplated thereby (taking into account any proposed amendment
or modification proposed by Parent pursuant to  _Section 7.03(e)(A)_) and
(B) the Company Board determines (after receiving the advice of its financial
advisor and outside legal counsel) is reasonably capable of being consummated
in accordance with its terms, taking into account all financial, regulatory,
legal, timing and other aspects (including certainty of closing, certainty of
financing and the identity of the Person making the Company Acquisition
Proposal) of such proposal. __

 

(h) It is understood that for all purposes of this Agreement, in the event
that any Representative of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries takes any
action which, if taken by the Company, would constitute a breach of this
_Section 7.03_, such action shall be deemed to be a breach of this _Section
7.03_ by the Company.

 

Section 7.04 _No Solicitation of Transactions by Parent_. (a) Parent shall,
and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and shall instruct (and use its
reasonable best efforts to cause) the Representatives of Parent to,

to, enforce the provisions of any such agreement;  _provided_ , _however_ ,
that Parent may grant a waiver of, and shall not be obligated to enforce, any
such provision (i) to the extent required to permit a party to submit a Parent
Acquisition Proposal and (ii) if the Parent Board (or any committee thereof)
has determined in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel,
that the failure to grant such waiver would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under applicable Law. Parent represents and warrants that as of the
date of this Agreement: (x) neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries or
Representatives are currently engaged in any discussions, communications or
negotiations with respect to any Parent Acquisition Proposal, (y) no Person
has indicated to Parent that it is considering making a proposal that
constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to constitute, a Parent
Acquisition Proposal and (z) no Person has entered into, or is in discussions

inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law and (y) Parent
promptly (and, in any event, within 24 hours) notifies the Company of any such
waiver, amendment or release; _provided_ , _however_ , that, prior to the
receipt of the Parent Stockholder Approval, nothing contained in this _Section
7.04_ shall prevent Parent or the Parent Board (or any committee thereof) from
furnishing information to, or engaging in discussions, communications or
negotiations with, any Person that made a bona fide Parent Acquisition
Proposal, which Parent Acquisition Proposal did not result from a breach (or

honor in accordance with their terms, all contracts, agreements and plans of
the Company and its Subsidiaries as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time that are applicable to any current or former employees or

and its Subsidiaries to provide each Service Provider of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries that continues to provide services to the Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or their respective Subsidiaries immediately following

comparable in the aggregate to the employee benefits provided to
such Continuing Service Provider immediately prior to the Effective Time.
Employees of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company shall receive credit
for purposes of eligibility to participate and vesting (but not for benefit
accruals) under any employee benefit plan, program or arrangement established
or maintained by the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries for
service accrued or deemed accrued prior to the Effective Time with the Company
or any Subsidiary of the Company;  _provided_ , _however_ , that such
crediting of service shall not operate to duplicate any benefit or the funding
of any such benefit. In addition, Parent shall waive, or cause to be waived,
any limitations on benefits relating to any pre-existing conditions to the
extent such conditions are covered immediately prior to the Effective Time
under the applicable Company Plans and to the same extent such limitations are
waived under any comparable plan of Parent or its Subsidiaries and use
reasonable best efforts to recognize, for purposes of annual deductible and
out-of-pocket limits under its medical and dental plans, deductible and out-
of-pocket expenses paid by employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries in

is effected in accordance with the terms of such Company Plan.

Section 7.07  _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_. (a)
Parent agrees that all rights to indemnification, advancement or reimbursement
of expenses and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring
at or prior to the Effective Time now existing in favor of the current or
former directors, officers or employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries as
provided in their respective certificates of incorporation or bylaws (or
equivalent organizational documents) and any indemnification or other similar
agreements of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, in each case as in
effect on the date of this Agreement and which the Company has furnished to
Parent prior to the date of this Agreement, shall continue in full force and
effect in accordance with their terms. The certificate of incorporation and
bylaws or other equivalent organizational documents of the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries (to the extent the Company has furnished
such organizational documents to Parent prior to the date of this Agreement)
shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification,
advancement and reimbursement of expenses and exculpation from liabilities
with respect to facts or circumstances occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time than are set forth in the certificate of incorporation and bylaws or
equivalent organizational documents of the Company and its Subsidiaries (to
the extent the Company has furnished such organizational documents to Parent
prior to the date of this Agreement) as in effect on the date of this
Agreement, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise
modified for a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time in any manner
that would affect adversely the rights thereunder of individuals who, at or
prior to the Effective Time, were directors, officers, employees, fiduciaries
or agents of the Company, unless such modification shall be required by Law.
From and after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law (including to the fullest extent authorized or permitted by any
amendments to or replacements of the DGCL adopted after the date of this
Agreement that increase the extent to which a corporation may indemnify its
officers and directors), the Surviving Corporation agrees that it will
indemnify and hold harmless each individual who is, as of the date of this
Agreement, or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director or officer
of the Company or who is as of the date of this Agreement, or who thereafter
commences prior to the Effective Time, serving at the request of the Company
as a director or officer of another Person, against all claims, losses,
liabilities, damages, judgments, inquiries, fines, amounts paid in settlement
and fees, costs and expenses, including attorneys fees and disbursements
incurred in connection with any actual or threatened Action, whether civil,
criminal, administrative, regulatory or investigative (including with respect
to matters existing or occurring or alleged to occur at or prior to the
Effective Time (including this Agreement and the transactions and actions
contemplated hereby)), arising out of or pertaining to the fact that such
individual is or was an officer or director of the Company or is or was
serving at the request of the Company as a director or officer of another
Person, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time.
In the event of any such Action, (x) each such individual will be entitled to
advancement of expenses incurred in the defense of any such Action in
accordance with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation and (y) the Surviving Corporation shall reasonably cooperate in
the defense of any such matter.

 



77 (b) The Company shall, in consultation with Parent, purchase a "tail" policy,
which (i) has an effective term of six (6) years from the Effective Time (and
provides coverage until such later date as of which any Action commenced
during such six (6) year period shall have been finally disposed of), (ii)
covers each Person covered by the Companys directors and officers
insurance and/or fiduciary liability insurance policy in effect on the date of
this Agreement or at the Effective Time for actions and omissions occurring
prior to the Effective Time, and (iii) provides coverage in an amount not
less than the Companys existing coverage and contains other terms and
conditions that are no less favorable to the Persons covered by such policies
maintained by the Company than those of the Companys directors and
officers insurance and/or fiduciary liability insurance policy in effect on
the date of this Agreement with respect to claims arising from facts or events
that occurred on or before the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the amount paid by the Company in respect of any one policy year shall not be
in excess of 300% of the annual premiums currently paid by the Company for
such insurance. The Surviving Corporation shall maintain such policies in
full force and effect, for their full respective terms, and continue to honor
its respective obligations thereunder.

 

(c) In the event that Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, in each case, proper provision
shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in
this _Section 7.07_.

 

(d) The provisions of this _Section 7.07_ (i) shall survive consummation of
the Merger, (ii) are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be
enforceable by, each indemnified or insured party, his or her heirs and his or
her Representatives, and (iii) are in addition to, and not in substitution
for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such Person
may have by contract or otherwise.

Section 7.08 _Notification of Certain Matters_. (a) The Company shall
give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to the
Company, of (i) the occurrence, or non-occurrence, of any event which would
reasonably be expected to cause, in the case of the Company, any condition
set forth in _Section 8.02_ not to be satisfied, or in the case of Parent,
any condition set forth in _Section 8.03_ not to be satisfied, at any time
from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time and (ii) any failure of
the Company, Parent or Merger Sub, as the case may be, to materially comply
with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or
satisfied by it under this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
delivery of any notice or the failure to provide such notice pursuant to this
_Section 7.08_ shall not (A) limit or otherwise affect the respective rights,
obligations, representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the
parties or the conditions to the obligations of the parties under this
Agreement, or (B) be deemed to amend or supplement the Company Disclosure
Schedule or the Parent Disclosure Schedule or constitute an exception to any
representation or warranty.

(b) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give
prompt notice to the Company, of (i) any notice or other communication from
any Governmental Authority or the NYSE (or any other securities market) in
connection with the Transactions or from any Person alleging in writing that
the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the
Transactions and (ii) any Action commenced or, to its knowledge, threatened in
writing, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting it or any of its
Subsidiaries, in each case, which relates to the consummation of the
Transactions.

 



 



78 Section 7.09 _Reasonable Best Efforts; Further Action_. (a) Each party
hereto shall use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
appropriate action, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable under applicable Law or otherwise to consummate and make
effective the Transactions, including (i) using reasonable best efforts to
obtain, or cause to be obtained, all permits, consents, approvals,
authorizations, qualifications and Orders of all Governmental Authorities and
officials that may be or become necessary for the performance of the
obligations of such party hereto pursuant to this Agreement and the
consummation of the Transactions, (ii) cooperating fully with the other
parties in promptly seeking to obtain all such permits, consents,
approvals, authorizations, qualifications and Orders, (iii) providing such
other information to any Governmental Authority as such Governmental Authority
may lawfully request in connection herewith, and (iv) using reasonable best
efforts to obtain such other consents, approvals or waivers from third
parties that are (A) necessary to consummate the Transactions or (B) as
otherwise reasonably determined by Parent and the Company after the date of
this Agreement; _provided_ that neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries shall pay any consideration or make any agreements or commitments
in connection with any such necessary consents, approvals or waivers without
the prior written consent of Parent; and _provided_   _further_ that Parent
and the Company acknowledge that, other than those consents, approvals, non-
disapprovals, orders and other authorizations of any Governmental Authority
set forth on Section 8.01(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedule and/or
Section 8.01(d) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule, or that are otherwise
expressly contemplated by _Article VIII_, no consents, approvals or waivers
from any Person shall be a condition to the obligations of the Company,
Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the Merger. Upon the terms and subject to
the conditions of this Agreement each party hereto agrees to make an
appropriate filing, if necessary, pursuant to the HSR Act as promptly as
reasonably practicable, but in any event no later than ten Business Days
following the date of this Agreement, and to supply as promptly as reasonably
practicable to the appropriate Governmental Authorities any additional
information and documentary material that may be requested pursuant to the
HSR Act. Each party hereto agrees to make as promptly as reasonably
practicable after the date of this Agreement its respective filings and
notifications, if any, under any other applicable foreign, federal or state
antitrust, competition or fair trade Laws, and to supply as promptly as
reasonably practicable to the appropriate Governmental Authorities any
additional information and documentary material that may be requested pursuant
to such Laws. Each party will promptly notify the other of any notice from
any Person or Governmental Authority alleging that the consent of such Person
is or may be required in connection with the Transactions.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in no event
will Parent or Merger Sub be obligated to take any action, including entering
into any consent decree, hold separate orders or other arrangements, that (i)
requires the divestiture of any assets of any of the Company, Parent or Merger
Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries, (ii) limits Parents freedom of
action with respect to, or its ability to retain, the Company and its
Subsidiaries or any portion thereof or any of Parents or its Affiliates
other assets or businesses, or (iii) in Parents reasonable judgment, would
be expected to have a material adverse impact on any of its businesses, or the
businesses to be acquired by it pursuant to this Agreement, either

 



79  individually or in the aggregate; _provided_ , _however_ , that, if
necessary to obtain any consent, approval, non-disapproval, order and other
authorization of any Governmental Authority set forth on Section 8.01(d) of
the Company Disclosure Schedule or Section 8.01(d) of the Parent Disclosure
Schedule, Parent shall agree to propose, negotiate, offer to commit and effect
(and if such offer is accepted, commit to and effect), by consent decree,
hold separate order, or otherwise, the sale, divestiture, disposition of, or
any limitation on, the assets or businesses or products or product lines of
the Company and its Subsidiaries that, individually or in the aggregate,
generated total worldwide revenues of up to $150,000,000 for the twelve (12)
month period ended September 30, 2016. If requested by Parent, the Company
will agree to and take any action contemplated by this  _Section 7.09(b)_,
provided that the effectiveness of such action is conditioned upon the
Closing.

(c) Subject to  _Section 7.09(b)_, each of the parties hereto agrees to
cooperate and use reasonable best efforts to contest and resist any Action,
including any administrative or judicial Action, and to have vacated, lifted,
reversed or overturned any Order (whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent) that is in effect and that restricts, prevents or prohibits
consummation of the Transactions, including by pursuing all available avenues
of administrative and judicial appeal. Parent shall be entitled to direct, in
consultation with the Company, the defense of the Transactions in any
antitrust investigation or litigation by, or negotiations with, any
Governmental Authority or other Person relating to the Merger or regulatory
filings under applicable Law.

(d) Each party shall promptly notify the others of any material communication
it receives from any Governmental Authority relating to any filings, or
submissions under the HSR Act or other applicable foreign, federal or state
antitrust, competition or fair trade Laws. The Company agrees to provide
promptly to Parent and Merger Sub all necessary information and assistance as
any Governmental Authority may from time to time require in connection with
the obtaining of the relevant approvals, consents or expiration of waiting
periods in relation to these filings. The Company shall promptly provide
all reasonable assistance and cooperation to allow Parent and Merger Sub to
prepare and submit any filings, or submissions under the HSR Act or other
applicable foreign, federal or state antitrust, competition or fair trade
Laws, including providing to Parent and Merger Sub any information that
Parent and Merger Sub may from time to time require for the purpose of any
filing, notification, application or request for further information made in
respect of any such filing. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, Parent, after prior consultation with the
Company, shall have the principal responsibility for devising and implementing
the strategy for obtaining any necessary antitrust, competition or
investment review clearances, and shall take the lead in all meetings and
communications with any Governmental Authority in connection with obtaining
any necessary antitrust, competition or investment review clearances. Neither
Parent nor Company shall agree to participate in any substantive meeting,
telephone call or discussion with any Governmental Authority in respect of any
filings, investigation (including any settlement of an investigation), or
other inquiry related to the Transactions unless it consults with the other
party in advance and, unless prohibited by such Governmental Authority, gives
the other party the opportunity to attend and participate at such meeting,
telephone call or discussion.

share acquisition," "interested stockholder" or other anti-takeover Law

respective Board of Directors shall grant such approvals and take such
actions as are necessary so that the transactions contemplated hereby may be
consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and
otherwise act to render such Law or Laws inapplicable to the foregoing.

Affiliates or Representatives arising out of or relating to this Agreement or
the Transactions or by any other Person seeking to enjoin or otherwise
prohibit or make illegal the consummation of the Transactions, in each case,
whether commenced prior to or after the date of this Agreement. Without
limiting the preceding sentence, the Company shall give Parent the right to
review and comment on all material filings or responses to be made by the
Company in connection with any such Action, and the right to consult on
the settlement with respect to such Action, and the Company will in good
faith take such comments into account, and, no such settlement shall be agreed
to without Parents prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed). The Company shall promptly notify Parent of any such
Action and shall keep Parent reasonably and promptly informed with respect to
the status thereof.

 

Section 7.14 _Public Announcements_. The initial press release relating to
this Agreement shall be a joint press release the text of which has been

press release referred to in the preceding sentence or any other release or
public statement previously issued or made in accordance with this _Section
7.14_ or (b) public disclosure is required by applicable Law or the
requirements of the NYSE, in which case the issuing party shall use
reasonable efforts to consult with the other party before issuing any press
release or making any such public statements, except with respect to the
matters described in, and subject to the requirements of,  _Section 7.03_,
_Section 7.04_, _Section 9.01_ and _Section 9.03_ or in connection with any
dispute between the parties hereto regarding this Agreement; _provided_ that,

Stock (including derivative securities with respect to Parent Common Stock)
resulting from the Transactions by each officer or director who is or will be

with respect to Parent or the Company, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act.

Section 7.18 _Dividends_. After the date of this Agreement, each of Parent

_provided_ that the aggregate amount of any such dividend is not in excess of
$0.0925 per Share.

Section 7.19 _Financing; Cooperation_. (a) Parent shall use its reasonable
best efforts to obtain the Financing on or prior to the Closing Date on the
terms and conditions described in the Commitment Letter. Parent shall not
amend, modify, waive the terms of, or replace, the Commitment Letter or
reduce the aggregate amount of the Financing available under the Commitment
Letter (other than through the issuance of securities in lieu of the bridge
facility contemplated by the Commitment Letter) without the prior written
consent of the Company, unless such amendment, modification, waiver or
replacement or reduction would not (i) reduce the aggregate amount of the
Financing below the amount required to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including by changing the amount of fees to
be

 



82  paid or original issue discount of the Financing), except to the extent (A)
replacement commitments for indebtedness to be incurred by Parent after the
date hereof are then made available in order to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or (B) the representations set forth in
_Section 5.24(a)_ would be true after giving effect to such reduction;
_provided_ that the terms and conditions of such replacement commitments
(including with respect to conditionality) shall be no less favorable, in the
aggregate, to Parent than those contained in the Commitment Letter; or (ii)
impose new, additional or more expansive conditions precedent, or otherwise
amend, modify or expand any conditions precedent, to the receipt of the
Financing, in each case, in a manner that would reasonably be expected to (x)
materially delay or prevent the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement; or (y) adversely impact in any material respect the
ability of Parent to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or enforce its rights under the Commitment Letter; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Parent may amend the Commitment Letter without the prior
written consent of the Company to add additional financing sources, lenders,
lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities.
References in this Agreement to the Financing shall include the financing
contemplated by the Commitment Letter as amended or modified in compliance
with this _Section 7.19_ and references to the Commitment Letter shall
include such document as amended or modified in compliance with this 
_Section 7.19_.

(b) Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in effect the
Commitment Letter until the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, other than any reduction in the amount of the Financing
available under the Commitment Letter through the issuance of securities in
lieu of the bridge facility contemplated by the Commitment Letter; (ii)
satisfy on a timely basis all conditions within the control of Parent to
obtaining the Financing, including delivery of all information required by
items 4 and 10 of Exhibit C of the Commitment Letter, and (iii) negotiate and
enter into definitive agreements with respect to the Financing (" _Financing
Agreements_ ") on the terms and conditions contained in the Commitment Letter
(including any "market flex" provisions related thereto). Parent shall keep
the Company reasonably informed with respect to all material activity
concerning the status of the Financing and shall give the Company notice of
any material change with respect to such Financing as promptly
as practicable. Parent shall give the Company reasonably prompt notice of (A)
any material breach by any party to the Commitment Letter of which Parent
becomes aware to the extent such breach would reasonably be expected to impair
or materially delay the Closing or result in insufficient financing to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and (B) any
termination of the Commitment Letter (or the Financing Documents) or the
receipt of any notice of termination, breach or default under the Commitment
Letter (or the Financing Documents). In the event that all conditions in the
Commitment Letter have been satisfied or, upon funding will be satisfied, and
Parent is otherwise required under the terms of this Agreement to consummate
the Merger, Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to (1) consummate the
Financing and (2) enforce its rights under the Commitment Letter (or the
Financing Documents); _provided_ that, notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, Parent shall have no obligation hereunder to threaten or
initiate any Action against any of the Financing Sources or any other party to
the Commitment Letter or to the Financing Agreements. If any portion of
the Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated in
the Commitment Letter, Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to arrange and
obtain alternative debt financing from alternative sources in an amount
sufficient to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the
" _Alternative Financing_ "); _provided_ that the terms and

 



83  conditions of such Alternative Financing (including with respect to
conditionality, structure, covenants and pricing) shall be no less favorable,
in the aggregate, to Parent than those contained in the Commitment Letter.
For the purposes of this Agreement, (x) the term "Commitment Letter" shall be
deemed to include any commitment letter or similar agreement with respect to
any Alternative Financing arranged in compliance with this _Section 7.19_
(and any Commitment Letter remaining in effect at the time in question); and

or bylaws of the Company or any of the provisions of the certificate of
incorporation or bylaws (or equivalent organizational documents) of a
Subsidiary of the Company or any Law or result in the breach of any contract
if the consequences of the breach of such Law or contract would be material

whole, (2) to pay any commitment or similar fee or reimburse any expenses
incurred by Parent in connection with the Financing or, if applicable, the
Alternative Financing, (3) to execute and deliver any definitive agreements
with respect to the Financing prior to the Closing Date (other than any

to take any action in its capacity as a shareholder, member, partner or member
of the board of directors of any of the Company or its Subsidiaries to
authorize or approve the Financing; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
foregoing clauses (3) and (4) of this sentence and clause (A) of the proviso
in the immediately preceding sentence shall not apply to customary
resolutions, representation letters, officers certificates, supplemental
indentures (which do not result in the creation or assumption of any
additional obligations by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the
Effective Time) and similar documents required to be executed in connection
with the closing of a debt financing into escrow on customary terms so long as
such documents are not released from escrow or become effective prior to the
Closing Date. The Company consents to the reasonable use of the Companys
logos in connection with any Financing in a manner customary for such
financing transactions; _provided_ , that such logos are used solely in
a manner that is not intended, or reasonably likely, to harm or disparage the
Company or the reputation or goodwill of the Company or any of its Affiliates.
Parent shall, promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company for
all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs (including reasonable
attorneys fees) incurred by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (other

_Section 7.19_, and indemnify the Company for any and all liabilities,
losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards, judgments and
penalties suffered or incurred by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
arising therefrom, in each case other than to the extent any of the foregoing

or material breach of this Agreement by, the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or (y) arises from or relates to information provided by or
on behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for use in connection with
the Financing or, if applicable, the Alternative Financing. None of the
representations, warranties or covenants of the Company set forth in this
Agreement shall be deemed to apply to, or deemed breached or violated by, any
of the actions taken by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries at the express
request of Parent set forth in this  _Section 7.19_.

the availability of the Financing constitute a condition precedent to
Closing.

each case, whether or not such Company Acquisition Proposal is the same
Company Acquisition Proposal described in clause (B) above); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that for purposes of this _Section 9.03(a)(ii)_, all references
to 20% in the definition of "Company Acquisition Proposal" shall be replaced
with references to 50%; 

then, in any such event, the Company shall pay to Parent promptly (but in any
event no later than two Business Days) after (x) Parent terminates this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.01(c)(ii)_, or (y) the earlier of the date
the Company enters into an Acquisition Agreement or the date a Company
Acquisition Proposal referred to in _Section 9.03(a)(ii)(C)_ is consummated,
the Termination Fee, which amount shall be payable in cash in immediately
available funds.

(b) The Company agrees that if the Company or Parent shall terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.01(b)(iii)(A)_ or _Section 9.01(c)(i)_, the
Company shall reimburse Parent and Merger Sub for all of their Expenses, up to
a maximum of $15,000,000, in the aggregate (not later than two Business Days
after submission by Parent of statements therefor). In the event Parent
becomes entitled to receive a Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 9.03(a)_
after the payment to Parent or Merger Sub of any Expenses under this _Section
9.03(b)_, the amount of the Termination Fee payable shall be reduced by any
Expenses previously reimbursed pursuant to the preceding sentence.

 



 



93 (c) Parent agrees that:

 

(i) if the Company or Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section
9.01(b)(i)_ or  _Section 9.01(b)(ii)_, or if the Company terminates this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.01(d)(ii)_ (provided that, in the case of a
termination pursuant to clause (E) thereof, only if Parent shall have
committed an intentional breach) or _Section 9.01(d)(iii)_; or

(ii) if (A) Parent or the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 9.01(b)(i)_ (without the Parent Stockholder Approval having been
obtained) or the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section
9.01(d)(i)_, (B) prior to the termination of this Agreement, a Parent
Acquisition Proposal shall have been publicly announced or shall have become
publicly known and not withdrawn, and (C) on or prior to the date that is 12
months after the date of such termination, Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
enters into, or submits to the stockholders of Parent for adoption, an
Acquisition Agreement with respect to any Parent Acquisition Proposal (which
Parent Acquisition Proposal is ultimately consummated) or consummates any
Parent Acquisition Proposal (in each case, whether or not such Parent
Acquisition Proposal is the same Parent Acquisition Proposal described in
clause (B) above); _provided_ , _however_ , that for purposes of this 
_Section 9.03(c)(ii)_, all references to 20% in the definition of "Parent
Acquisition Proposal" shall be replaced with references to 50%;

 

then, in any such event, Parent shall pay to the Company promptly (but in any
event no later than two Business Days) after (A) the Company terminates this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.01(d)(ii)_ (other than in connection with a
Parent Superior Proposal), the Termination Fee, (B) the Company terminates
this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.01(d)(ii)_ (in connection with a
Parent Superior Proposal), the Parent Termination Fee, (C) the Company or
Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.01(b)(i)_ (and at
such time, all of the conditions set forth in _Section 8.01_,  _Section
8.02_ and _Section 8.03_ have been satisfied (or, with respect to the
conditions that by their terms must be satisfied at the Closing, would have
been so satisfied if the Closing would have occurred) other than
the conditions set forth in _Section 8.01(d)_) or _Section 9.01(b)(ii)_ (to
the extent such Restraint arises under the HSR Act or other applicable
foreign, federal or state antitrust, competition or fair trade Laws as
specified in Section 8.01(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedule or Section
8.01(d) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule), or the Company terminates this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.01(d)(iii)_, the Enhanced Termination Fee,
or (D) the earlier of the date Parent enters into an Acquisition Agreement or
the date a Parent Acquisition Proposal referred to in _Section
9.03(c)(ii)(C)_ is consummated, the Parent Termination Fee, which amount shall
be payable in cash in immediately available funds.

(d) Parent agrees that if Parent or the Company shall terminate this Agreement
pursuant to  _Section 9.01(b)(iii)(B)_ or _Section 9.01(d)(i)_, Parent
shall reimburse the Company for all of its Expenses, up to a maximum of
$15,000,000, in the aggregate (not later than two Business Days after
submission by the Company of statements therefor). In the event

 



94  the Company becomes entitled to receive a Termination Fee, Parent
Termination Fee or Enhanced Termination Fee, as applicable, pursuant to
_Section 9.03(c)_ after the payment to the Company of any Expenses under
this _Section 9.03(d)_, the amount of the Termination Fee, Parent Termination
Fee or Enhanced Termination Fee payable shall be reduced by any Expenses
previously reimbursed pursuant to the preceding sentence. 

(e) Except as set forth in this _Section 9.03_ and _Section 7.19_, all
Expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions
shall be paid by the party incurring such Expenses, whether or not the Merger
or any other Transaction is consummated, except that the Company and Parent
shall each pay one-half of all Expenses relating to printing, filing and
mailing the Registration Statement and the Joint Proxy Statement and all SEC
and other regulatory filing fees incurred in connection with the Registration
Statement and the Joint Proxy Statement. Parent shall be responsible for
paying the filing fee for the Notification and Report Forms filed under HSR
Act and all other filing fees for filings under other applicable foreign,
federal or state antitrust, competition or fair trade Laws.

 

(f) The Company and Parent acknowledge that the agreements contained in this
_Section 9.03_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. In the event that the Company or Parent shall fail to pay the
Termination Fee, Parent Termination Fee or Enhanced Termination Fee, as
applicable, or the Company or Parent shall fail to pay any Expenses when due,
the term "Expenses" shall be deemed to include the costs and expenses
actually incurred or accrued by Parent and Merger Sub or the Company, as the
case may be (including fees and expenses of counsel) in connection with the
collection under and enforcement of this _Section 9.03_, together with
interest on such unpaid Termination Fee, Parent Termination Fee or Enhanced
Termination Fee, as applicable, and Expenses, commencing on the date that the
Termination Fee, Parent Termination Fee or Enhanced Termination Fee, as
applicable, or such Expenses became due, at a rate of interest equal to the
prime lending rate as published in the Wall Street Journal in effect on the
date such payment was required to be made. Payment of the fees and expenses
described in this _Section 9.03_ shall not be in lieu of any damages incurred
in the event of fraud or intentional breach of this Agreement. For the
avoidance of doubt, in the event this Agreement is terminated by a party for
any reason at a time when the other party would have had the right to
terminate this Agreement, such other party shall be entitled to receipt of any
Expenses and/or Termination Fee, Parent Termination Fee or Enhanced
Termination Fee (or portion thereof), as applicable, that would have been (or
would have subsequently become) payable had such other party terminated this
Agreement at such time. In no event shall the Company or Parent be required to
pay the Termination Fee, Parent Termination Fee or Enhanced Termination Fee,
as applicable, or any Expenses in connection with the termination of this
Agreement more than once.

(g) The payment by the Company to Parent or its designees of the Termination
Fee and any Expenses pursuant to this _Section 9.03_ shall, subject always to
_Section 9.02(a)(ii)_, _Section 9.02(c)_ and  _Section 9.03(f)_, in
circumstances in which the Termination Fee and Expenses are owed to Parent, be
the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent for any loss suffered by Parent or
Merger Sub as a result of the failure of the Transactions to be consummated
to the extent paid and upon such payment in accordance with this _Section
9.03_, subject always to _Section 9.02(a)(ii)_, _Section 9.02(c)_ and
_Section 9.03(f)_, the Company shall not have any further liability or
obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the

 



95  Transactions, except as set forth in _Section 9.02(a)(ii)_. The payment by
Parent to the Company or its designees of the Termination Fee, Parent
Termination Fee or Enhanced Termination Fee, as applicable, and any Expenses
pursuant to this _Section 9.03_ shall, subject always to _Section
9.02(a)(ii)_, _Section 9.02(b)_ and _Section 9.03(f)_, in circumstances in
which the Termination Fee, Parent Termination Fee or Enhanced Termination
Fee, as applicable, and Expenses are owed to the Company, be the sole and
exclusive remedy of the Company for any loss suffered by the Company as a
result of the failure of the Transactions to be consummated to the extent
paid and upon such payment in accordance with this _Section 9.03_, subject
always to _Section 9.02(a)(ii)_, _Section 9.02(b)_ and _Section 9.03(f)_,
Parent and Merger Sub shall not have any further liability or obligation
relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the Transactions, except as
set forth in _Section 9.02(a)(ii)_.

 

(h) In the event (i) (A) Parent is unable to obtain the Financing, after
having complied in all material respects with its obligations under _Section
7.19_, (B) the Registration Statement is not declared effective by the SEC,
after Parent shall have complied in all material respects with its obligations
under _Section 7.01_ and applicable Law or (C) the Joint Proxy Statement is
not declared effective by the SEC, after Parent shall have complied in all
material respects with its obligations under _Section 7.01_ and applicable
Law, (ii) in each case, the cause of the foregoing is the failure by an
auditor of the Company to provide, with respect to any historical financial
statements of the Company required in connection with the Financing as
contemplated by _Section 7.19_ or required to be included in the
Registration Statement or Joint Proxy Statement as required by _Section 7.01_
and applicable Law, any consents to the inclusion of any such historical
financial statements of the Company or any audit opinions in respect thereof
by such auditor in the Registration Statement, the Joint Proxy Statement or
any prospectus or offering memorandum or similar documents for any portion of
the Financing as required by _Section 7.19_, or to provide any comfort
letters that may be required in connection the Financing as required by
_Section 7.19_, in all cases of this clause (ii), as a result of the matters
contemplated in _Section 7.16_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule and (iii)
this Agreement is terminated (other than a termination pursuant to (1)
_Section 9.01(b)(i)_ in circumstances where the conditions set forth in
_Section 8.01(c)_ (to the extent such Restraint arises under the HSR Act or
other applicable foreign, federal or state antitrust, competition or fair
trade Laws as specified on Section 8.01(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedule
or Section 8.01(d) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule) or _Section 8.01(d)_
have not been satisfied or (2) _Section 9.01(b)(ii)_) pursuant to a
subsection of _Section 9.01_ in circumstances where Parent is obligated to
pay the Company the Termination Fee or the Enhanced Termination Fee pursuant
to this  _Section 9.03_, then, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, including other subsections of this _Section 9.03_, in each
case, Parent shall have no obligation to pay such Termination Fee or
Enhanced Termination Fee and the parties shall have no further rights or
obligations under this Agreement, except as set forth in _Section 9.02_.

 

Section 9.04 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto
by action taken by or on behalf of their respective Boards of Directors at
any time prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that, after
either the Company Stockholder Approval or the Parent Stockholder Approval has
been obtained, no amendment may be made that would reduce the amount or
change the type of consideration into which each Share shall be converted upon
consummation of the Merger or that would otherwise require the approval of the
stockholders of the Company or the stockholders of Parent, as applicable,
under applicable Law

 



96  or in accordance with the rules of any relevant stock exchange, without such
approval having been obtained. This Agreement may not be amended except by an
instrument in writing signed by each of the parties hereto. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, _Section 9.02_, this _Section
9.04_, _Section 10.07_, _Section 10.08_, _Section 10.10_ and _Section
10.11_ may not be amended, supplemented, waived or otherwise modified in a
manner adverse to the Financing Sources without the prior written consent of
the adversely affected Financing Sources.

 

Section 9.05 _Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, any party
hereto may (a) extend the time for the performance of any obligation or other
act of any other party hereto, (b) waive any breach of or inaccuracy in the
representations and warranties of any other party contained in this Agreement
or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) subject to the proviso
in the first sentence of _Section 9.04_ and to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, waive compliance with any agreement of any other party or any
condition to its own obligations contained in this Agreement. Any
such extension or waiver shall be valid if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed by the party or parties to be bound thereby. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, no failure or delay by the Company or Parent or Merger Sub in
exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall
any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or future exercise
of any other right hereunder.

performance of this Agreement against the Financing Sources.

its Affiliates or against any party or any of its Affiliates) shall be heard

ARTICLE II

 

REGISTRATION RIGHTS

 

Section 2.1 _Demand Registration._

 

(a) At any time following the Restricted Period, the Shareholder may, by
providing written notice (a " _Demand Registration Request_ ") to the
Company, request to sell all or a portion of the Registrable Securities
Beneficially Owned by the Shareholder pursuant to a Registration Statement in
the manner specified in such notice, __provided__ that the aggregate market
value of such Registrable Securities so requested to be sold, as measured by
the market price of such Registrable Securities on the date of the Demand
Registration Request, shall not be less than $100 million (a "
_Demand Registration_ "). Each Demand Registration Request shall specify the
number of Registrable Securities intended to be offered and sold pursuant to
the Demand Registration and the intended method of disposition thereof,
including whether the registration requested is for an underwritten offering.
A Demand Registration shall be effected by way of a Registration Statement on
Form S-3 or any similar short-form registration to the extent the Company is
permitted to use such form at such time (or to the extent the Company is not
permitted to use such form, on Form S-1 or a similar long-form registration).
The Company

 



3  may, after consultation with the Shareholder, comply with a Demand
Registration Request by, at the Companys option, (x) filing a Registration
Statement (including a Shelf Registration Statement) which will be used to
offer the Registrable Securities and/or (y) providing a prospectus supplement
for an already effective Registration Statement. If the Company is then ASR
Eligible, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause
the Registration Statement to be an ASRS containing a Prospectus naming the
Shareholder as the selling shareholder and registering the offering and sale
of the Registrable Securities by the Shareholder on a delayed or continuous
basis pursuant to Rule 415 (an " _ASRS Resale Shelf Registration Statement_
"). The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause any
Registration Statement (or prospectus supplement, as applicable) relating to
a Demand Registration (xx) to be filed with the SEC as promptly as reasonably
practicable following the receipt of the Demand Registration Request, and in
no event more than twenty (20) Business Days after receipt of a
Demand Registration Request (or such longer period agreed to by the
Shareholder), (yy) to be declared effective by the SEC or otherwise become
effective under the Securities Act as promptly as reasonably practicable after
the filing thereof and (zz) to remain continuously effective during the
Effectiveness Period.

(b) The Shareholder shall have the right to request up to a total of two (2)
Demand Registrations in any twelve (12)-month period pursuant to this _Section
2.1_; provided, that such obligation shall be deemed satisfied (and such
request shall count as one Demand Registration Request for the Shareholder)
only when a Registration Statement shall have become effective and (x) if the
method of disposition thereof is a firm commitment Public Offering, at least
50% of such Registrable Securities requested to be sold, after giving
effect to any Underwriter Cutback (described in _Section 2.1(e)_), shall
have been sold pursuant thereto, and (y) in any other case, such Registration
Statement shall have remained effective for the Effectiveness Period. The
Shareholder may revoke a request for a Demand Registration by notifying the
Company prior to the effective date of the applicable Registration Statement
or the filing of any prospectus supplement with respect to any particular
underwritten offering;  _ _provided__ that such request shall count as one of
the Shareholders requests for a Demand Registration unless the Shareholder
(i) provides such notice of revocation (A) except with respect to Underwritten
Block Trades, within three (3) Business Days after requesting such Demand
Registration, or (B) pursuant to _Section 2.4(c)_ as a result of a Notice of
Suspension, or (ii) reimburses the Company for all reasonable and
documented out-of-pocket expenses (including Registration Expenses) actually
incurred by the Company relating to such Demand Registration.

(c) The Company shall (i) prepare, (ii) file with the SEC and (iii) use
commercially reasonable efforts to have effective starting one hundred eighty
(180) days from the date of this Agreement, a Shelf Registration Statement on
Form S-3 or such other form as the Company is then eligible to use (such
Shelf Registration Statement shall be an ASRS to the extent that the Company
is then ASR Eligible) (or, at its option, after consultation with the
Shareholder, provide a prospectus supplement for an already effective Shelf
Registration Statement) with respect to the registration under the Securities
Act of the resale of up to [ ]1 Shares (the " _Transaction Shelf Registration
Statement_ ") (such Transaction Shelf Registration



 



   1  |

_Note to Draft_ : The Transaction Shelf Registration Statement will include
the Shares issued at Closing.  

---|--- 
 



4  Statement shall include a prospectus sufficient to permit the resale of all
such Shares by the Shareholder). The Company shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to keep the Transaction Shelf Registration Statement
continuously effective for the Effectiveness Period, including by filing
subsequent registration statements, if necessary, subject to the Securities
Act and the provisions of _Section 2.4_. For a period of two (2) years
following the Closing Date, any Shares which have been registered on the
Transaction Shelf Registration Statement may be included in any underwritten
offering conducted by the Company upon the proper exercise of a demand or
piggyback right hereunder pursuant to and in accordance with _Section 2.1_
or _Section 2.2_, as applicable, subject to compliance with the notice and
cutback procedures contained herein.

 

(d) If a Demand Registration is a Public Offering, the Shareholder shall have
the right to select the investment banking firm(s) to act as the managing
underwriter(s) (subject to the consent of the Company, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed) and counsel for the Shareholder in
connection with such offering (including in any underwritten offering under a
Shelf Registration Statement or any Underwritten Block Trade).

(e) For the first two (2) years following the date of this Agreement, in no
event shall any Person (other than the Company with respect to a primary
offering of its equity securities) be entitled to include any equity
securities of the Company in any offering requested pursuant to this _Section
2.1_ without the prior written consent of the Shareholder, such consent not
to be unreasonably withheld after consultation with its advisors. In the event
the managing underwriter shall be of the opinion that the number of such
securities, when taken together with the Registrable Securities requested to
be included in a Public Offering pursuant to a Demand Registration Request,
alone or taken together with the equity securities of the Company to be
included therein, would adversely affect the marketing of such
offering (including the price at which the securities of the Company may be
sold), then the number of securities of the Company to be included in such
underwritten offering will be reduced (an " _Underwriter Cutback_ "), with the
securities of the Company to be included in such offering based on the
following priority: (x) first, the number of Shares requested to be included
on behalf of the Shareholder up to the number that, in the opinion of the
managing underwriter, would not adversely affect the marketing of the
offering (including the price at which the Shares may be sold); and (y)
second, in addition to the Shares included pursuant to the preceding clause
(x), the number of the equity securities of the Company elected to be
included by the Company (whether for the Companys own account or for the
account of any other holder of equity security of the Company consented by the
Shareholder to participate in the offering) up to the number that, in the
opinion of the managing underwriter, would not adversely affect the marketing
of the offering (including the price at which the securities of the Company
(including the Shares) may be sold).

 

(f) Notwithstanding any other provision of this _Article II_, but subject to
_Section 2.4_, if the Shareholder wishes to effect a Demand Registration
through an underwritten block trade or similar transaction or other
transaction with a one-day or less marketing period, including overnight
bought deals (collectively, an " _Underwritten Block Trade_ "), pursuant to a
Shelf Registration Statement (either through filing an ASRS or through a take-
down from an already effective Shelf Registration Statement), then
notwithstanding any other time periods in this _Article II_, the
Shareholder shall notify the Company of the Underwritten Block Trade five (5)
Business Days prior to the date such Underwritten Block Trade is to commence.
As

 



5  expeditiously as possible, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to facilitate such Underwritten Block Trade (which may price as early
as five (5) Business Days after the date it commences). The Shareholder shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to work with the Company and the
underwriters prior to making such request (including by disclosing the maximum
number of Shares proposed to be the subject of such Underwritten Block Trade)
in order to facilitate preparation of the Registration Statement (including
filing of an ASRS), Prospectus and other offering documentation related to the
Underwritten Block Trade and any related due diligence and
comfort procedures.

(g) Notwithstanding anything else in this agreement, the Company shall have no
obligation to facilitate a Public Offering of Registrable Securities
initiated by the Shareholder except pursuant to, and subject to the
limitations contained in, this _Section 2.1_, _Section 2.2_, and in
accordance with _Section 2.6_.

 

(h) The Company hereby represents that, as of the date hereof, it is a "well-
known seasoned issuer" (having the meaning given thereto pursuant to Rule 405
promulgated under the Securities Act) and eligible to use Form S-3.

Section 2.2 _Piggyback Registration._  

(a) If the Company at any time following the Closing Date proposes to file a
registration statement or conduct a securities offering, including an
Underwritten Block Trade, off an already filed Shelf Registration Statement
using a prospectus supplement (such registration statement or prospectus
supplement, a " _Primary Registration Statement_ ") for the primary sale of
any equity securities of the Company (except with respect to registration
statements on Form S-4, Form S-8 or another form not available for registering
the Registrable Securities for sale to the public), it will give prompt
written notice thereof to the Shareholder of its intention to do so (such
notice to be given not less than five (5) Business Days (or, in the case of
Underwritten Block Trades, three (3) Business Days) prior to the anticipated
filing date of the Primary Registration Statement). The Shareholder, to the
extent it still holds any Registrable Securities, shall within five (5)
Business Days (or, in the case of Underwritten Block Trades, three (3)
Business Days) of receipt of such notice indicate to the Company if it wishes
to participate in the offering contemplated by the Primary Registration
Statement and, if so, the number of Registrable Securities it wishes to offer
and sell. The Company will use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause
the Registrable Securities as to which inclusion shall have been so requested
to be included in the Primary Registration Statement. The Shareholder shall be
entitled to sell the Registrable Securities included in a Primary
Registration Statement in accordance with the method of distribution requested
by it; __provided__ that, if the Primary Registration Statement relates to an
underwritten offering, then (i) the Company shall be entitled to select the
underwriters in its sole discretion and (ii) the Shareholder must sell all
Registrable Securities included on the Primary Registration Statement in such
underwritten offering pursuant to an underwriting agreement containing terms
and conditions that are customary for secondary offerings. In the event that
an Underwriter Cutback is required in the view of the managing underwriter,
then the securities of the Company to be included in such underwritten
offering will be based on the following priority: (x) first, the number of
securities that the Company seeks to include in the offering, up to the number
that, in the opinion of the managing underwriter, would not adversely affect
the marketing of the offering (including the price at which such securities
of

 



6  the Company may be sold); (y) second, in addition to the securities of the
Company included pursuant to the preceding clause (x), (A) for the first two
(2) years following the date of this Agreement, the number of Registrable
Securities requested to be included by the Shareholder, and (B) after the date
that is two (2) years following the date of this Agreement, the number of the
securities of the Company requested to be included by the Shareholder and any
other Person(s) who has (have) elected to include securities pursuant to
written agreements with the Company, in each case, up to the number that, in
the opinion of the managing underwriter, would not adversely affect the
marketing of the offering (including the price at which the securities
(including the Registrable Securities) may be sold), and (z) third, in
addition to securities of the Company included pursuant to the
preceding clause (x) and the Registrable Securities of the Shareholder and
the securities of any other Person included pursuant to the preceding clause
(y), the number of securities of the Company requested to be included by any
other Person(s) in the offering with the permission of the Company, up to the
number that, in the opinion of the managing underwriter, would not adversely
affect the marketing of the offering (including the price at which the
securities of the Company may be sold). The Underwriter Cutbacks described in
the immediately preceding clause (y)(B) shall be allocated pro rata among the
participating Persons, including the Shareholder, on the basis of the number
of securities, including Registrable Securities, requested to be included in
such registration by such Persons. The Company may withdraw a Primary
Registration Statement prior to its being declared effective without incurring
any liability to the Shareholder and shall not be required to keep a Primary
Registration Statement effective for longer than the period contemplated by
the intended manner of distribution for the securities of the Company to be
sold by the Company as described in the Prospectus included in the Primary
Registration Statement. The Shareholder may, at least two (2) Business Days
prior to the effective date of a Primary Registration Statement or the filing
of any prospectus supplement with respect to any particular underwritten
offering, as applicable, withdraw any Registrable Securities that it had
sought to have included therein, without any liability to the Company or
requirement to reimburse for any out-of-pocket expenses of the Company. No
registration of Registrable Securities pursuant to this _Section 2.2_ shall
relieve the Company of its obligations to effect registrations pursuant to
_Section 2.1_.

(b) If the Company at any time following the Closing Date proposes to file a
registration statement or conduct an offering of any of its securities off an
already filed Shelf Registration Statement using a prospectus supplement (such
registration statement or prospectus supplement, a " _Secondary Registration
Statement_ ") for the secondary sale of its equity securities under the
Securities Act on behalf of one or more holders of equity securities of the
Company other than the Shareholder (the " _Requesting Third Party
Shareholders_ "), the Company will give prompt written notice to the
Shareholder of its intention to do so (such notice to be given not less than
five (5) Business Days (or, in the case of Underwritten Block Trades, three
(3) Business Days) prior to the anticipated filing date of the Secondary
Registration Statement). The Shareholder, to the extent it still holds
Registrable Securities, shall within five (5) Business Days (or, in the case
of Underwritten Block Trades, three (3) Business Days) of receipt of such
notice indicate to the Company if it wants to participate in the offering
contemplated by the Secondary Registration Statement and, if so, the number
of Registrable Securities it wishes to offer and sell. The Company will use
its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Registrable Securities as to
which inclusion shall have been so requested to be included in the Secondary
Registration Statement. The Shareholder shall be entitled to sell the
Registrable Securities included in a Secondary Registration Statement in
accordance with the method of distribution requested by it;

 



7   _ _provided__ that, if the Secondary Registration Statement relates to a
Public Offering, then (i) the Requesting Third Party Shareholders (or the
Company) shall be entitled to select the underwriters and (ii) the
Shareholder must sell all Registrable Securities included on the Secondary
Registration Statement in such Public Offering pursuant to an underwriting
agreement on the same terms and conditions as those applicable to the
Requesting Third Party Shareholders. In the event that an Underwriter Cutback
is required in the view of the managing underwriter, then the securities to be
included in such Public Offering will be based on the following priority: (x)
first, the number of the securities of the Company that the Requesting Third
Party Shareholders seek to include, up to the number that, in the opinion of
the managing underwriter, would not adversely affect the marketing of the
offering (including the price at which such securities may be sold); (y)
second, in addition to the securities included pursuant to the preceding
clause (x), (A) for the first two (2) years following the date of this
Agreement, the number of Registrable Securities requested to be included by
or on behalf of the Shareholder, and (B) after the date that is two (2) years
following the date of this Agreement, the number of the securities of the
Company requested to be included by the Shareholder and any other Person(s)
who has (have) elected to include securities pursuant to written agreements
with the Company, in each case, up to the number that, in the opinion of the
managing underwriter, would not adversely affect the marketing of the
offering (including the price at which the securities (including the
Registrable Securities) may be sold); (z) third, in addition to the securities
included pursuant to the preceding clauses (x) and (y), the number
of securities sought to be included by other Persons permitted to participate
in such underwritten offering, up to the number that, in the opinion of the
managing underwriter, would not adversely affect the marketing of the offering
(including the price at which the securities may be sold). The Underwriter
Cutbacks described in the immediately preceding clause (y)(B) shall be
allocated pro rata among the participating Persons, including the Shareholder,
on the basis of the number of securities (including Registrable Securities)
requested to be included in such registration by such Persons. Requesting
Third Party Shareholders or the Company may withdraw a Secondary Registration
Statement prior to its being declared effective without incurring any
liability to the Shareholder, and the Company shall not be required to keep a
Secondary Registration Statement effective for longer than the period
contemplated by the intended manner of distribution for the sale of
the securities by the Requesting Third Party Shareholders as described in the
Prospectus included in the Secondary Registration Statement. The Shareholder
may, at least two (2) Business Days prior to the effective date of a Secondary
Registration Statement or the filing of any prospectus supplement with
respect to any particular underwritten offering, as applicable, withdraw any
Registrable Securities that it had sought to have included therein, without
any liability to the Company or any other Person or requirement to reimburse
for any out-of-pocket expenses of the Company.

Section 2.3 _Expenses_. Except as specifically provided herein, all
Registration Expenses incurred in connection with the registration or offering
and sale of the Registrable Securities shall be borne by the Company and all
Selling Expenses shall be borne by the Shareholder.

 



8 Section 2.4 _Suspensions._

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
Company shall be entitled, by providing written notice (a " _Notice of
Suspension_ ") to the Shareholder, to delay the filing or effectiveness of a
Registration Statement or require the Shareholder to suspend the use of the
Prospectus for sales of Registrable Securities under an
effective Registration Statement for a reasonable period of time not to
exceed sixty (60) consecutive days or ninety (90) days in the aggregate in any
twelve (12)-month period (a " _Suspension Period_ ") if the Company Board
(or the executive committee thereof) determines in good faith that such
filing, effectiveness or use would (i) require the public disclosure of
material non-public information concerning any material transaction or
negotiations involving the Company that would interfere with such material
transaction or negotiations or (ii) otherwise materially interfere with
material financing plans, acquisition activities or business activities of the
Company; __provided__ , that if at the time of receipt of such notice by the
Shareholder, the Shareholder shall have sold all or a portion of the
Registrable Securities (or have signed a firm commitment underwriting
agreement with respect to the sale of such Registrable Securities) pursuant
to an effective Registration Statement and the reason for the Suspension
Period is not of a nature that would require a post-effective amendment to the
Registration Statement, then, _provided_ that the Shareholder has given the
Company at least two (2) Business Days notice prior to entering into such
sale, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to take such
action as to eliminate any restriction imposed by federal securities Laws by
the time such Registrable Securities are scheduled to be delivered.
Immediately upon receipt of a Suspension Notice, the Shareholder shall
discontinue the disposition of Registrable Securities under an effective
Registration Statement and Prospectus relating thereto until the Suspension
Period is terminated.

(b) The Company agrees to promptly notify in writing the Shareholder, to the
extent it still holds Registrable Securities, of the termination of a
Suspension Period. After the expiration of any Suspension Period in the case
of an effective Registration Statement, and without the need for any further
request from the Shareholder, the Company shall, as promptly as reasonably
practicable, prepare a post-effective amendment or supplement to such
Registration Statement, the relevant Prospectus, or any document incorporated
therein by reference, or file any other required document so that, as
thereafter delivered to purchasers of the Registrable Securities included
therein, the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, as applicable, will not
include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

(c) If a Suspension Period occurs during the Effectiveness Period for a
Registration Statement, such Effectiveness Period shall be extended for a
number of days equal to the total number of days during which the distribution
of Registrable Securities is suspended under this _Section 2.4_. If the
Company notifies the Shareholder of a Suspension Period with respect to a
Registration Statement requested pursuant to _Section 2.1_ (including a
Demand Registration Request) that has not yet been filed or declared
effective, (x) the Shareholder may by notice to the Company withdraw such
request without such request counting as a Demand Registration Request and (y)
the Shareholder will not be obligated to reimburse the Company for any of its
out-of-pocket expenses, including Registration Expenses.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
Company may delay the filing or effectiveness of a Registration Statement or
require the Shareholder to suspend the use of the Prospectus for sale of
Registrable Securities under an 

 



9  effective Registration Statement: (i) during any of the Companys recurring
quarterly earnings blackout periods, determined in accordance with such policy
as the Company shall generally maintain and communicate to the Shareholder
from time to time, and any such blackout period shall be deemed to constitute
a Suspension Period hereunder but shall not be subject to, and shall not count
against, the time periods in  _Section 2.4(a)_ or be subject to _Section
2.4(c)_; and (ii) if, in the good faith determination of the Company, it is
not feasible for the Company to proceed with the registration or offering
because (x) audited financial statements of the Company, or (y) audited
financial statements of any acquired company or pro forma financial statements
that are required by the Securities Act to be included in any related
registration statement or prospectus are then unavailable, until such time as
such financial statements are prepared or obtained by the Company, and any
delay or suspension shall be treated as a Suspension Period hereunder, except
that it shall not be subject to, and shall not count against, the time
periods in _Section 2.4(a)_ or be subject to _Section 2.4(c)_; __provided__
that, with respect to clause (y), the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to prepare or obtain the relevant acquired company or pro forma
financial statements as quickly as reasonably practicable; and __provided__ ,
__further__ , that in no event will more than forty (40) days of the period
from which such financial statements are required to be filed pursuant to
Item 9.01 of Form 8-K be excluded from the time periods in _Section 2.4(a)_
or be subject to _Section 2.4(c)_.

 

Section 2.5 _Lock-Up Obligations_. To the extent reasonably requested by a
managing underwriter, if any, of any underwritten Public Offering (including
any Underwritten Block Trade) of the equity securities of the Company, the
Shareholder and, if such offering is pursuant to _Section 2.1_ or _Section
2.2_, the Company, each hereby severally agree, (i) not to (A) offer for
sale, sell, pledge, or otherwise dispose of (or enter into any transaction
that is designed to, or could be expected to, result in the disposition by any
Person at any time in the future of) any shares of common stock of the
Company or any other form of Capital Stock (collectively, the " _Restricted
Stock_ ") (other than, in the case of the Company, the grant of equity awards
with respect to, or the issuance of shares of Capital Stock under, any of the
Companys bona fide equity incentive plans in existence at the start of the
lock-up period specified in this _Section 2.5_), (B) enter into any swap or
other derivatives transaction that transfers to another Person, in whole or
in part, any of the economic benefits or risks of ownership of Restricted
Stock, whether any such transaction described in clause (A) above or this
clause (B) is to be settled by delivery of Restricted Stock or other
securities, in cash or otherwise, or (C) publicly disclose the intention to
do any of the foregoing, in each case, for a period specified by such managing
underwriter or co-managing underwriter but no more than the ten (10) days
prior to and the sixty (60) days (or ninety (90) days if reasonably requested
by the managing underwriters) following the pricing date of the Public
Offering of such securities.

 

Section 2.6 _Registration Procedures_. Whenever the Shareholder requests that
any Registrable Securities be registered pursuant to  _Section 2.1_ or
_Section 2.2_, subject to the provisions of those Sections, the Company will
use its commercially reasonable efforts to effect the registration and the
offer and sale of such Registrable Securities in accordance with the intended
method of disposition thereof as soon as reasonably practicable, and shall, in
connection with any such request, other than during any Suspension Period, use
commercially reasonable efforts to:

 



10 (a) prepare and promptly file with the SEC a Registration Statement (or a
prospectus supplement, as applicable) with respect to such securities and use

than the Effectiveness Period) and at least three (3) Business Days (or, with
regard to any Underwritten Block Trade, as soon as reasonably practicable)
before filing a Registration Statement or Prospectus or any amendments or
supplements thereto (but, for the avoidance of doubt, not any documents
incorporated by reference therein), or any related free writing prospectus,
furnish to the Shareholder and the underwriter(s), if any, copies of all such
documents proposed to be filed, and provide the Shareholder with the

with respect to the disposition of all Registrable Securities covered by such

to Rule 424 under the Securities Act in accordance with the Shareholders
intended method of disposition set forth in such Registration Statement for

charge, such number of copies of the Registration Statement, each amendment
and supplement thereto, the Prospectus included therein (including each

each free writing prospectus as such Persons reasonably may request in order
to facilitate the public sale or other disposition of the Registrable
Securities covered by such Registration Statement;

 

(d) use its commercially reasonable efforts to register or qualify the
Registrable Securities covered by such Registration Statement under

necessary or advisable to enable the Shareholder to consummate the
disposition in such jurisdictions of the Registrable Securities Beneficially
Owned by it; __provided__ , __however__ , that the Company shall not for any
such purpose be required to qualify generally to transact business as a
foreign corporation in any jurisdiction where it is not so qualified or to
consent to general service of process in any such jurisdiction;

 

(e) promptly notify the Shareholder and each managing underwriter, if any: (i)
when the Registration Statement, any pre-effective amendment, the Prospectus
or any prospectus supplement related thereto, any post-effective amendment to

Registration Statement or the Prospectus related thereto or for
additional information, including

 



11  copies of any and all transmittal letters and other correspondence with the
SEC and all correspondence (including comment letters and a copy of the
Companys draft responses thereto), from the SEC to the Company relating to
such Registration Statement or any Prospectus or any amendment or supplement

of any jurisdiction or the initiation of any proceeding for such purpose.

 

(f) if at any time (A) any event or development shall occur or condition shall
exist as a result of which the Disclosure Package, as then amended or
supplemented, would include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
the light of the circumstances existing when the Disclosure Package is
delivered to a purchaser, not misleading, or (B) it is necessary to amend or
supplement the Disclosure Package to comply with Law, the Company will
promptly notify the Shareholder and each managing underwriter, if any, and
promptly prepare and file with the SEC (to the extent required) and furnish
to the Shareholder and each underwriter, if any, such amendments or
supplements to the Disclosure Package as may be necessary so that the
statements in the Disclosure Package, as so amended or supplemented, will

delivered to a purchaser, be misleading, or so that the Disclosure Package
will comply with Law;

 

(g) use its commercially reasonable efforts to make generally available to its

(j) provide a transfer agent and registrar for all such Registrable Securities

agreements (including underwriting agreements in customary form) and take all
such other customary actions as the Shareholder reasonably requests in order
to expedite or facilitate the disposition of such Registrable Securities,
(ii) use commercially reasonable efforts, subject to the Companys reasonable
business needs, upon reasonable advance notice and without unduly interfering
with the Companys business, to have members of its management participate in

confidential materials shall execute a confidentiality agreement on customary
terms if reasonably requested by the Company and (ii) the Company may in its
sole discretion restrict access to competitively sensitive or legally
privileged documents or information;

 

(m) use its commercially reasonable efforts to prevent the issuance of any
stop order or other suspension of effectiveness of a Registration Statement,
or the suspension of the qualification of any of the Registrable Securities
for sale in any jurisdiction and, if such an order or suspension is issued, to
use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the withdrawal of such order
or suspension at the earliest possible moment and to notify the Shareholder
of the issuance of such order and the resolution thereof or its receipt of
actual notice of the initiation or threat of any proceeding for such purpose;

 

(n) otherwise use its commercially reasonable efforts to comply with the

all securities of the Company purchased by it and (x) 180 days after the
pricing of such offering, and the period of distribution of Registrable
Securities pursuant to a Registration Statement for any other manner of

(y) the sale of all Registrable Securities covered thereby and (z) ninety (90)
days after the effective date thereof (such period, including any extension

Section 2.8 _Indemnification._

 

(a) _Indemnification Rights_.

 

(i) In the event of any registration or other offer and sale of any securities
of the Company under the Securities Act pursuant to this _Article II_, the
Company shall indemnify and hold harmless the Shareholder and each Person, if
any, that controls the Shareholder within the meaning of Section 15 of the
Securities Act (each a " _controlling person_ "), their respective officers,
directors, employees, stockholders, general and limited partners, members,
Representatives and Affiliates, and each controlling person of each Affiliate
of any of the foregoing Persons (each, a " _Shareholder Registration Rights
Indemnitee_ "), to the fullest extent lawful, from and against any and all
Damages arising out of or based upon (A) any untrue statement of material fact
(or alleged untrue statement of a material fact) contained in any Disclosure
Package, any Registration Statement, any Prospectus (including any preliminary
Prospectus), any Free Writing Prospectus, or in any amendment or supplement
thereto or (B) any omission or alleged omission to state therein any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading; __provided__ that the Company shall not be liable to
a Shareholder Registration Rights Indemnitee to the extent that any such
Damages are

 



14  arising out of or based upon any untrue statement or omission (or alleged
untrue statement or omission) made in such Disclosure Package, Registration
Statement, Prospectus (including any preliminary Prospectus), Free Writing
Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, in reliance upon and in
conformity with written information about the Shareholder furnished to the
Company by or on behalf of the Shareholder expressly for use therein. This
indemnity agreement shall be in addition to any liability which the Company
may otherwise have. Such indemnity and reimbursement of expenses shall remain
in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf
of any Shareholder Registration Rights Indemnitee and shall survive the
transfer of securities by the Shareholder.

(ii) The Shareholder shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company and each
of its officers who execute any of the Companys filings with the SEC pursuant
to the Exchange Act or the Securities Act, its directors, employees,
stockholders, and each Person, if any, that controls the Company and each
Affiliate of any of the foregoing Persons (each, a " _Company Registration
Rights Indemnitee_ "), to the fullest extent lawful, from and against any and
all Damages arising out of or based upon (A) any untrue statement of material
fact (or alleged untrue statement of a material fact) contained in any
Disclosure Package, any Registration Statement, any Prospectus (including any
preliminary Prospectus), any Free Writing Prospectus or in any amendment or
supplement thereto or (B) any omission (or alleged omission) to state therein
any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, in each case, to the extent that such untrue statement or
omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information
furnished to the Company by or on behalf of the Shareholder expressly for use
therein; __provided__ , __however__ , that in no event shall the obligations
of the Shareholder hereunder exceed the net proceeds received by it from the
sale of its Registrable Securities related to the matter in which Damages are
sought. Such indemnity and reimbursement of expenses shall remain in full
force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of a
Company Registration Rights Indemnitee and shall survive the Transfer of such
securities by the Shareholder.

(iii) If the indemnification provided for in _Section 2.8(a)(i)_ or _Section
2.8(a)(ii)_ is unavailable to a Shareholder Registration Rights Indemnitee or
a Company Registration Rights Indemnitee, as applicable, with respect to any
Damages referred to therein or is unenforceable or insufficient to hold a
Shareholder Registration Rights Indemnitee or Company Registration Rights
Indemnitee, as applicable, harmless as contemplated therein, then the Company
or the Shareholder, as applicable, in lieu of indemnifying such Shareholder
Registration Rights Indemnitee or Company Registration Rights Indemnitee, as
applicable, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Shareholder
Registration Rights Indemnitee or Company Registration Rights Indemnitee, as
applicable, as a result of such Damages in such proportion as is appropriate
to reflect the relative fault of such Shareholder Registration Rights
Indemnitee or Company Registration Rights Indemnitee, as applicable, on the
one hand, and the Company or the Shareholder, as applicable, on the other
hand, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such
Damages as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative
fault of the Company or the Shareholder, as applicable, on 

 



15  the one hand, and of a Shareholder Registration Rights Indemnitee or Company
Registration Rights Indemnitee, as applicable, on the other hand, shall be
determined by reference to, among other factors, whether the untrue or
alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to
state a material fact relates to information supplied by or on behalf of the
Company or the Shareholder, as applicable, and the parties relative intent,
knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such
statement or omission; the Company and the Shareholder agree that it would not
be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this  _Section
2.8(a)(iii)_ were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of
allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred
to in this _Section 2.8(a)(iii)_. No Shareholder Registration Rights
Indemnitee or Company Registration Rights Indemnitee guilty of fraudulent
misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act)
shall be entitled to contribution from the Company or the Shareholder, as
applicable, if the Company or the Shareholder, as applicable, was not guilty
of such fraudulent misrepresentation. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, in no event shall the liability of the Shareholder pursuant to
this  _Section 2.8(a)(iii)_ be greater in amount than the amount of net
proceeds received by it from the sale of such Registrable Securities related
to the matter in which indemnification or contribution for Damages are sought.

 

(b) _Notice of Reg Rights Claim_.

 

(i) As used in this Agreement, the term " _Reg Rights Claim_ " means a claim
for indemnification or contribution by or on behalf of any Company
Registration Rights Indemnitee or Shareholder Registration Rights Indemnitee,
as the case may be, for Damages under _Section 2.8(a)_ (such Person making a
Reg Rights Claim, a " _Reg Rights Indemnified Person_ "). The Company (for
its own Damages or for the Damages incurred by any other Company Registration
Rights Indemnitee) or the Shareholder (for its own Damages or for the Damages
incurred by any other Shareholder Registration Rights Indemnitee), as
applicable, shall give notice of a Reg Rights Claim under this Agreement
pursuant to a written notice of such Reg Rights Claim executed by the Company
or the Shareholder, as applicable (a " _Notice of Reg Rights Claim_ "), and
delivered to the Company or the Shareholder, as applicable (such receiving
party, the " _Reg Rights Indemnifying Person_ "), promptly after such Reg
Rights Indemnified Person becomes aware of the existence of any potential
claim by such Reg Rights Indemnified Person for indemnification arising out of
or resulting from any item indemnified pursuant to the terms of _Section
2.8(a)(i)_ or _Section 2.8(a)(ii)_; __provided__ that the failure to timely
give such notice shall not limit or reduce the Reg Rights Indemnified Persons
right to indemnification hereunder unless (and then only to the extent that)
the Reg Rights Indemnifying Persons defense of such Reg Rights Claim is
materially and adversely prejudiced thereby.

(ii) Each Notice of Reg Rights Claim shall: (A) state the aggregate amount
(where practicable) that the Reg Rights Indemnified Person has incurred or
paid in Damages arising from such Reg Rights Claim (which amount may include
the amount of Damages claimed by a third party in an action (a " _Third-Party
Reg Rights Claim_ ") brought against such Reg Rights Indemnified Person based
on alleged facts, which if

 



16  true, would give rise to liability for Damages to such Reg Rights
Indemnified Person); and (B) contain a brief description, in reasonable detail
(to the extent reasonably available to the Reg Rights Indemnified Person) of
the facts, circumstances or events giving rise to the alleged Damages based on
the Reg Rights Indemnified Persons good faith belief and knowledge thereof,
including the identity and address of any third party claimant (to the extent
reasonably available to the Reg Rights Indemnified Person).

(c) _Defense of Third-Party Reg Rights Claims_. 

(i) Subject to the provisions hereof, the applicable Reg Rights Indemnifying
Person shall have the right (at its own expense) to elect to defend and
assume control of the defense of any Third-Party Reg Rights Claim on behalf of
a Reg Rights Indemnified Person, utilizing legal counsel reasonably acceptable
to such Reg Rights Indemnified Person. In the event such election is made,
the Reg Rights Indemnified Person (unless itself controlling the Third-Party
Reg Rights Claim in accordance with this _Section 2.8(c)_) may participate,
through counsel of its own choice and, except as provided herein, at its own
expense, in the defense of any Third-Party Reg Rights Claim. The reasonable
and documented costs and expenses incurred by the Reg Rights Indemnifying
Person in connection with such defense (including reasonable attorneys fees,
other professionals and experts fees and court or arbitration costs) shall
be paid by the Reg Rights Indemnifying Person.

 

(ii) A Reg Rights Indemnifying Person shall not be entitled to assume control
of such defense, and the applicable Reg Rights Indemnified Person may assume
the control and defense thereof, at the sole expense of the applicable Reg
Rights Indemnifying Person, if (A) the Reg Rights Claim relates to, or arises
in connection with, any criminal or governmental proceeding, action,
indictment, allegation or investigation, (B) the Reg Rights Claim seeks an
injunction against the Reg Rights Indemnified Person, to the extent that such
defense relates to the claim for such injunction, (C) a conflict of
interest between the Reg Rights Indemnifying Person and the Reg Rights
Indemnified Person exists with respect to the Reg Rights Claim or the Reg
Rights Indemnifying Person and the Reg Rights Indemnified Person have one or
more conflicting defenses, in the reasonable view of their respective
counsel, or (D) the Reg Rights Indemnifying Person has elected to have the Reg
Rights Indemnified Person defend, or assume the control and defense of, a
Third-Party Reg Rights Claim in accordance with this  _Section 2.8(c)_;
__provided__ that in no event shall the Reg Rights Indemnifying Person be
liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate counsel for all Reg
Rights Indemnified Persons, which counsel shall be selected by the
Shareholder (in the case of the Shareholder Registration Rights Indemnitees)
or by the Company (in the case of the Company Registration Rights
Indemnitees).

 

(iii) Any party controlling the defense of any Third-Party Reg Rights Claim
pursuant hereto shall: (A) conduct the defense of such Third-Party Reg Rights
Claim with reasonable diligence and keep the other parties reasonably informed
of material developments in the Third-Party Reg Rights Claim at all stages
thereof (including by promptly providing the other parties with copies of
material legal documents filed or received in connection therewith) and (B)
permit the other parties and

 



17  their counsel to confer on the conduct of the defense thereof. The parties
not controlling the defense will render to the party controlling the defense
such assistance as may be reasonably required in order to insure the proper
and adequate defense thereof and shall furnish such records, information and
testimony and attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials
and appeals as may be reasonably requested by the party controlling the
defense in connection therewith. The Reg Rights Indemnifying Person shall
reimburse the parties not controlling the defense for any reasonable and
documented costs and expenses incurred in connection with providing
such assistance. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
no Party shall be required to disclose any information to the other Party or
its Representatives, if doing so would be reasonably expected to violate any
Law to which such Party is subject or could jeopardize (in the reasonable
discretion of the disclosing Party) any attorney-client privilege available
with respect to such information.

 

(iv) If the Reg Rights Indemnifying Person controls the defense of and defends
any Third-Party Reg Rights Claim under this  _Section 2.8(c)_, the Reg
Rights Indemnifying Person shall have the right to effect a settlement of such
Third-Party Reg Rights Claim on the Reg Rights Indemnified Persons behalf and
without the consent of the Reg Rights Indemnified Person; __provided__ that
(A) such settlement shall not involve any injunctive relief binding upon the
Reg Rights Indemnified Person or any of its Affiliates, and (B) such
settlement expressly and unconditionally releases the Reg Rights Indemnified
Person and the other applicable Reg Rights Indemnified Persons (that is, each
of the Company Registration Rights Indemnitees, if the Reg Rights Indemnified
Person is a Company Registration Rights Indemnitee, and each of
the Shareholder Registration Rights Indemnitees, if the Reg Rights
Indemnified Person is a Shareholder Registration Rights Indemnitee) from any
and all liabilities with respect to such Third-Party Reg Rights Claim, with
prejudice. If the Reg Rights Indemnified Person controls the defense of and
defends any Third-Party Reg Rights Claim under this _Section 2.8(c)_, the Reg
Rights Indemnified Person shall have the right to effect a settlement of such
Third-Party Reg Rights Claim only with the consent of the Reg Rights
Indemnifying Person (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed). No settlement by the Reg Rights Indemnified Person of
such Third-Party Reg Rights Claim effected in accordance with this _Section
2.8(c)_ shall limit or reduce the right of any Reg Rights Indemnified Person
to indemnity hereunder for all Damages they may incur arising out of or
resulting from the Third-Party Reg Rights Claim, to the extent such
Damages are indemnifiable hereunder. As used in this _Section 2.8(c)(iv)_,
the term "settlement" refers to any consensual resolution of the claim in
question, including by consent decree or by permitting any judgment or other
resolution of a claim to occur without disputing the same, and the term
"settle" has a corresponding meaning.

Section 2.9 _Free Writing Prospectuses_. Except for a Prospectus relating to
Registrable Securities included in a Registration Statement, an "issuer free
writing prospectus" (as defined in Rule 433 under the Securities Act) prepared
by the Company or other materials prepared by Company, the Shareholder
represents and agrees that it (a) will not make any offer relating to the

without the prior written consent of the Company and, in connection with any
Public Offering, the underwriters.

its Registrable Securities as the Company may reasonably request or as may be
required by Law for use in connection with a Registration Statement or
Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) and all information
required to be disclosed in order to make the information the Shareholder
previously furnished to the Company not contain a material misstatement of
fact or necessary to cause such Registration Statement or Prospectus (or
amendment or supplement thereto) not to omit a material fact with respect to
the Shareholder necessary in order to make the statements therein not
misleading;

(b) complying with (i) the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, (ii) all

in any material respect or that requires the making of any changes in a
Registration Statement, Prospectus, issuer free writing prospectus or other
Free Writing Prospectus so that, in such regard, it will not contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary to make the statements not misleading;

Section 2.11 _Rule 144 Reporting_. With a view to making available to the
Shareholder the benefits of certain rules and regulations of the SEC which
may permit the sale of the Registrable Securities to the public without
registration, the Company agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to
make and keep available adequate current public information, as defined in
Rule 144(c), including all periodic and annual reports and other documents
(other than Form 8-K reports) required of the Company under Sections 13 or
15(d) of the Exchange Act, and so long as the Shareholder Beneficially Owns
any Registrable Securities or securities

 



19  convertible into or exercisable for Registrable Securities, furnish to the
Shareholder forthwith upon request (and all of the following shall be deemed
furnished if available on the SECs EDGAR system): a written statement by the
Company as to its compliance with the reporting requirements of Rule 144, and
of the Exchange Act; a copy of the most recent annual or quarterly report of

allowing it to sell any Registrable Securities without registration.

 

Section 2.12 _Termination of Registration Rights_. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained herein, the registration rights granted under this

other rights or obligations under this Agreement) in connection with a
Transfer of all or a portion of its Registrable Securities to such Person;
__provided__ that (a) the Shareholder shall have the sole power to exercise
the rights granted to the Shareholder under this  _Article II_ on behalf of
any such Transferee Shareholder, and the Company shall not be obligated to
take any action with respect to any Registrable Securities of any such
Transferee Shareholder except upon notice and instructions by
the Shareholder, (b) any notice or other communication by the Company to the
Shareholder with respect to the matters governed by this _Article II_ shall
be deemed notice to a Transferee Shareholder with respect to any
Registrable Securities held by such Transferee Shareholder, (c) no such
Transfer shall increase the aggregate number of Demand Registrations that may
be made under _Section 2.1_ by the Shareholder on behalf of itself or any
such Transferee Shareholder to more than two (2) Demand Registrations in any
twelve (12)-month period, (d) for purposes of this _Article II_, including,
without limitation, any priority of inclusion or Underwriter Cutback, but not
for purposes of determining whether the securities held by any Transferee
Shareholder are Registrable Securities, all Registrable Securities held by
such Transferee Shareholder shall be deemed held by the Shareholder, and (e)
such Transferee Shareholder executes a joinder to this Agreement (a "
_Joinder_ "), in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Company,
pursuant to which (x) such Transferee Shareholder shall, following the
applicable Transfer, become responsible for all obligations applicable to the
Shareholder under this _Article II_ with respect to the Registrable
Securities Transferred to such Transferee Shareholder and (y) the Company
shall acknowledge the rights of the Shareholder Transferee under this
_Article II_. If the Shareholder Transfers only a portion of its Registrable
Securities, the Shareholder shall retain all rights and obligations under this
Agreement with respect to the portion of the Registrable Securities that it
continues to hold following such Transfer.

ARTICLE III

 

PREEMPTIVE RIGHTS

 

Section 3.1 _General_. From the Closing Date until the Expiration Date, the
Company shall not issue any New Securities to any Person, except in
compliance with the provisions of this _Article III_.

 



20 Section 3.2 _Timing and Procedure_. Prior to the consummation of the issuance
of New Securities, the Company shall send a written notice thereof (a "
_Participation Notice_ ") to the Shareholder. The Participation Notice shall
include:

 

(a) the principal terms of the proposed issuance, including (i) the number and
kind of New Securities to be included in the issuance, (ii) the price per
security of the New Securities, (iii) the percentage equal to the number of
Shares immediately prior to the issuance of the New Securities divided by the
aggregate number of the shares of common stock of the Company then issued and
outstanding (the " _Participation Percentage_ "), and (iv) the name of each
Person to whom the New Securities are proposed to be issued (each a "
_Prospective Subscriber_ "); __provided__ that, if the consideration to be
paid by the Prospective Subscriber for the New Securities contains non-cash
consideration, then the Participation Notice shall also specify the fair
market value (as reasonably determined by the Company Board) of such non-cash
consideration; and

(b) an offer by the Company to issue to the Shareholder such portion (not in
any event to exceed the Shareholders Participation Percentage) of the New
Securities to be included in the issuance as may be requested by the
Shareholder (the " _Preemptive Rights Shares_ "), at the same price and
otherwise on the same terms and conditions as the issuance to each of the
Prospective Subscribers; __provided__ that, if consideration to be paid by the
Prospective Subscriber for the New Securities contains non-cash consideration,
then such offer shall give the Shareholder the option to pay, in lieu of
delivery of such non-cash consideration, cash in the amount of the fair market
value (as reasonably determined by the Company Board) of such non-cash
consideration; and __provided__ ,  _ _further__ , that, if the issuance of
the Preemptive Rights Shares to the Shareholder would require approval of the
stockholders of the Company pursuant to the NYSE Rule, such offer and any
issuance of the Preemptive Rights Shares shall be conditioned on such
stockholder approval being obtained (it being agreed that the Company shall
not issue New Securities to any Person if such stockholder approval is not
obtained).

 

Section 3.3 _Exercise of Rights_. If the Shareholder desires to accept the
offer contained in the Participation Notice, it shall send an irrevocable
commitment (each a " _Participation Commitment_ ") to the Company within ten
(10) Business Days after the date of delivery of the Participation Notice
specifying the amount or proportion of the Preemptive Rights Shares (not in
any event to exceed the Shareholders Participation Percentage) which it
desires to be issued. If the Shareholder has not so accepted such offer
pursuant to the foregoing sentence, it shall be deemed to have irrevocably
waived its right under this _Article III_ and the Company shall thereafter
be free to issue the New Securities to the Prospective Subscribers within one
hundred and twenty (120) days following the date of the Participation Notice
on terms not materially more favorable to the Prospective Subscribers than
those set forth in the Participation Notice, without any further obligation to
the Shareholder. If the Company has not completed the sale of the New
Securities in accordance with the foregoing sentence, the Company shall
provide a new Participation Notice to the Shareholder on the terms and
provisions set forth in _Section 3.2_.

 



21 Section 3.4 _Closing of Preemptive Issuance_. The closing of an issuance
pursuant to this _Article III_ shall take place at such time and place as
the Company shall specify by notice to the Shareholder given not less than
three (3) Business Days prior to the closing of the issuance. At the closing
of any issuance under this _Article III_, the Company shall deliver to the
Shareholder the originals of notes, certificates or other instruments
evidencing the New Securities issued to the Shareholder, in each case, free
and clear of any liens or encumbrances, with any transfer tax stamps affixed
(if applicable), against delivery by the Shareholder of the applicable
consideration.

 

Section 3.5 _Reduction of Preemptive Issuance_. Notwithstanding anything in
this _Article III_ to the contrary, if the amount of New Securities to be
issued is for any reason less than the amount that was initially proposed to
be issued as indicated in the Participation Notice, the Company may (whether
before or after the Shareholder has delivered a Participation Commitment to
the Company) decrease the number of Preemptive Rights Shares that the
Shareholder is entitled to subscribe for or purchase pursuant to this _Article
III_ to an amount not less than the amount necessary to allow the Shareholder
to maintain (but not exceed) its Participation Percentage after giving effect
to the issuance of the applicable New Securities.

 

Section 3.6 _Exclusions_. The preceding provisions of this _Article III_
shall not apply to:

 

(a) any issuance of New Securities to officers, employees, directors, advisors
or consultants of the Company or any subsidiary of the Company, in each case,
in connection with their compensation or employment as such;

(b) any issuance of New Securities in a Public Offering (which, for the
avoidance of doubt, shall be governed by the provisions of _Article II_);

(c) any pro rata dividend of New Securities made to all holders of the common
stock of the Company; or

(d) for the avoidance of doubt, any issuance of New Securities in
connection with the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.

  [ _ _] |  | [ _ _] |  | [ _ _] 
 



   2  | _Note to Draft_ : To be determined prior to the Effective Time. 
---|--- 
 



22 Section 4.2 _Right of Shareholder to Nominate Directors_. From the Closing
Date until the Expiration Date, the Shareholder shall have the right to
nominate to the Company Board: (a) if the total number of Directors
constituting the Company Board is less than fourteen (14), three (3)
Directors; (b) if the total number of Directors constituting the Company
Board is fourteen (14), four (4) Directors; and (c) if the total number of
Directors constituting the Company Board is greater than fourteen (14), a
number of Directors equal to such total number of Directors multiplied by
27%, rounding down in the case of any fractional number (each, an " _AS
Nominee_ " and, after being elected to the Company Board, an " _AS Director_
"). For example, if the size of the Company Board is increased to nineteen
(19), then the Shareholder shall be entitled to nominate five (5) Directors to
the Company Board. If the number of AS Directors is three (3), each AS
Director shall serve in a different class of Directors. If the number of AS
Directors is greater than three (3), no more than two (2) AS Directors shall
serve in any class of Directors. The Shareholder shall have the right to
nominate the AS Nominees from its Affiliates.

 

Section 4.3 _Election of AS Directors to the Board_. Following the Closing
Date, to the extent that an AS Nominee must stand for election or an AS
Director must stand for reelection, as the case may be, to the Company Board
in connection with any annual or special meeting of stockholders of the
Company at which Directors are to be elected (each such annual or special
meeting, an " _Election Meeting_ "), subject to the first sentence of
_Section 4.5(a)_, the Company agrees to (a) nominate and recommend that the
holders of Capital Stock of the Company who are entitled to vote at such
Election Meeting vote in favor of the election of such AS Nominees or the
reelection of such AS Directors, as the case may be, (b) support the AS
Nominees for election or the AS Directors for reelection, as the case may be,
in a manner no less rigorous and favorable than the manner in which the
Company supports its other nominees and (c) otherwise use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the election of the AS Nominees or the reelection
of the AS Directors, as the case may be, to the Company Board at each
Election Meeting.

Section 4.4 _Proxy or Information Statement_. Within a reasonable time prior
to the filing with the SEC of the Companys proxy statement or information
statement with respect to any Election Meeting, the Company shall, to the
extent the Shareholder is then entitled to representation on the Company Board
in accordance with this Agreement, provide the Shareholder with the
opportunity to review and comment on the information contained in such proxy
or information statement applicable to AS Nominees or AS Directors and shall
take into account all reasonable comments from the Shareholder.

Section 4.5 _Qualification and Replacements of AS Directors._

 

(a) Each AS Director shall at all times until cessation of service on the
Company Board meet any (x) applicable requirements or qualifications under
applicable Law or applicable stock exchange rules and (y) the Companys
standard qualifications for Directors. Notwithstanding anything set forth to
the contrary in the Charter or the Bylaws, if an AS 

 



23  Director (i) is unable or unwilling to serve as a Director for any reason,
(ii) is removed (upon death, resignation or otherwise), (iii) in the event
that an AS Director or an AS Nominee, as the case may be, fails to be
reelected or elected, as the case may be, at an Election Meeting solely as a
result of failing to receive the required vote of the holders of voting
Capital Stock as required by the Charter and the Bylaws, the Shareholder
shall have the exclusive right to submit the name of a replacement candidate
for such AS Director or AS Nominee, as the case may be (a " _Replacement_ "),
to the Governance Committee of the Company for its approval. If so approved,
such Replacement shall serve as the AS Nominee for election in the same class
of Directors on the Company Board as the AS Director or AS Nominee for which
such Person serves as a Replacement. For each proposed Replacement that is
not approved by the Company, the Shareholder shall have the right to submit
another proposed Replacement to the Governance Committee for its approval on
the same basis as set forth in the immediately preceding sentence and, for the
avoidance of doubt, the Company shall not fill the vacancy on the Company
Board during any period in which the appointment of an AS Director is pending
without the prior written consent of the Shareholder. The Shareholder shall
have the right to continue submitting the name of a proposed Replacement to
the Governance Committee for its approval until the Governance Committee
approves that a Replacement may serve as a nominee for election or appointment
as a Director or to serve as a Director, whereupon such Person shall be
appointed as the Replacement. To the extent a Replacement is nominated
pursuant to this _Section 4.5(a)_, the Companys obligations under _Section
4.3_ shall be fulfilled with respect to such Replacement.

 

(b) If any AS Director is serving on the Company Board on the Expiration Date,
the Shareholder shall use its commercially reasonably efforts to cause such
AS Director to promptly tender his or her resignation to the Company Board,
which resignation the Governance Committee shall determine to accept or reject
in its sole discretion.

 

Section 4.6 _Board Committee Representation_. So long as the Shareholder has
the right to nominate Directors to the Company Board in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement, the Shareholder shall have the right to require that
one AS Director be appointed to each of the committees of the Company Board,
subject to applicable requirements or qualifications under applicable Law or
applicable stock exchange rules (including with respect to director
independence); __provided__ that the Shareholder shall not have any right to
require that any AS Director be appointed as the chair of any committee of the
Company Board; and __provided__ , __further__ , that the identity of the
particular AS Director appointed to each particular committee shall be subject
to the reasonable mutual agreement of the Shareholder and the Company Board.

 

Section 4.7 _Rights of the AS Directors._

 

(a) The Company shall notify each AS Director, at the same time and in the
same manner as such notification is delivered to the other members of the
Company Board, of all regular meetings and special meetings of the Company
Board and of all regular and special meetings of any committee of the Company
Board of which such AS Director is a member. The Company and the Company Board
shall provide each AS Director with copies of all notices, minutes, consents
and other material that it provides to all other members of the Company Board
concurrently as such materials are provided to the other members.

 



24 (b) Each AS Director shall be entitled to the same directors and officers
insurance coverage as the other Directors and the same indemnification from
the Company as such other Directors, in each case, effective no later than the
date on which such AS Director joins the Company Board. If the Company enters
into indemnification agreements with its Directors generally, the Company
will enter into an indemnification agreement with each AS Director in the same
form and substance as the other Directors.

 

Section 4.8 _No duty for Corporate Opportunities_. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement or in any policy or code of the Company, the
Company, on behalf of itself and its subsidiaries, (a) acknowledges and
affirms that the Shareholder and its Affiliates, employees, directors,
partners and members, including any AS Director (the " _AS Group_ "), (i)
have participated (directly or indirectly) and will continue to participate
(directly or indirectly) in private equity, venture capital and other direct
investments in corporations, joint ventures, limited liability companies and
other entities (" _Other Investments_ "), including Other Investments engaged

or any of its subsidiaries businesses or that could be suitable for the
Companys or any of its subsidiaries interests, (ii) have interests in,
participate with, aid and maintain seats on the board of directors or similar
governing bodies of, Other Investments, (iii) may develop or become aware of
business opportunities for Other Investments; and (iv) may or will, as a
result of matters referred to in this Agreement, the nature of the AS Groups
businesses and other factors, have conflicts of interest or potential
conflicts of interest, (b) hereby renounces and disclaims any interest or
expectancy in any business opportunity (including any Other Investments) or
any other opportunities, in each case, that may arise in connection with the
circumstances described in the foregoing clauses (i)  (iv) (collectively, the
" _Renounced Business Opportunities_ "), (c) acknowledges and affirms that no
member of the AS Group shall have any obligation to communicate or offer any
Renounced Business Opportunity to the Company or any of its subsidiaries, and
any member of the AS Group may pursue a Renounced Business Opportunity,
and (d) acknowledges and affirms that any of the activities set forth in this
_Section 4.8_ shall not be considered a violation of any policies and codes
of the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company does not
renounce its interest in, and an AS Director shall have an obligation to
communicate to the Company Board, any business opportunity of which such AS
Director first became aware in his or her capacity as a Director.

with particular matters regardless of the knowledge of either Party.
Accordingly, Persons other than the Parties may not rely upon the
representations and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations
of actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of
any other date.

Section 8.11 _Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction_. This Agreement shall
be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of
Delaware, without giving effect to any applicable principles of conflict of
laws that would cause the Laws of another State to otherwise govern this
Agreement. The Parties agree that any Action seeking to enforce any provision
of, or based on any matter arising out of or in connection with, this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (whether brought by any
party or any of its Affiliates or against any party or any of its Affiliates)
shall be heard and determined exclusively in the Delaware Court of Chancery;
__provided__ , __however__ , that if the Delaware Court of Chancery does not
have jurisdiction over such Action, such Action shall be heard and determined
exclusively in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware.
Consistent with the preceding sentence, each of the Parties hereby (i) submits
to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts for the purpose of any Action
arising out of or relating to this Agreement brought by any Party; (ii) agrees
that service of process will be validly effected by sending notice in
accordance with  _Section 8.3_; (iii) irrevocably waives, and agrees not to
assert by way of motion, defense, or otherwise, in any such Action, any claim
that it is not subject personally to the jurisdiction of the above-named
courts, that its property is exempt or immune from attachment or execution,
that the Action is brought in an inconvenient forum, that the venue of the
Action is improper, or that this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement may not be enforced in or by any of the above named courts;
and (iv) agrees not to move to transfer any such Action to a court other than
any of the above-named courts.

 

Section 8.12 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVES TO THE
FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL
BY JURY WITH RESPECT TO ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF,
UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS. EACH OF THE
PARTIES HEREBY (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF THE
OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER

 



41  PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING
WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS
AGREEMENT AND THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT, AS APPLICABLE,
BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION
8.12_.

 

Section 8.13 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed and delivered
(including by facsimile transmission or other means of electronic
transmission, such as by electronic mail in "pdf" form) in counterparts, and
by the different Parties in separate counterparts, each of which when executed
shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken together
shall constitute one and the same agreement.

Section 8.14 _Specific Performanc_ _e_. The Parties acknowledge and agree
that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions
of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms
or were otherwise breached. Each Party agrees that, in the event of any breach
or threatened breach by any other Party of any covenant or obligation
contained in this Agreement, a non-breaching Party shall be entitled to (a) an
order of specific performance to enforce the observance and performance of
such covenant or obligation and (b) an injunction restraining such breach or
threatened breach. Each Party further agrees that the non-breaching Party
shall not be required to obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar
instrument in connection with or as a condition to obtaining any remedy
referred to in this _Section 8.14_, and each Party irrevocably waives any
right it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such
bond or similar instrument.

 

Section 8.15 _Amendment_. This Agreement may not be amended except by an
instrument in writing signed by the Company and the Shareholder.

Section 8.16 _Waiver_. At any time, either the Company or the Shareholder (on
behalf of itself and any Affiliate Shareholder) may, to the extent permitted
by applicable Law, (a) extend the time for the performance of any obligation
or other act of the other Party, (b) waive any breach or inaccuracy in the
representations and warranties of the other Party contained in this Agreement
or in any document delivered pursuant hereto, and (c) waive compliance by the
other Party with any agreement or condition to its own obligations contained
in this Agreement. Any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set
forth in an instrument in writing signed by the Party to be bound thereby.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or delay by either Party in
exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall
any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or future exercise
of any other right hereunder.
