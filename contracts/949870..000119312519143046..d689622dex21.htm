an adequate basis for an exemption, the holder may be subject to a $50 penalty imposed by the Internal Revenue Service, and any consideration such holder receives in the Merger may be subject to backup withholding at the applicable rate (currently
24%). If withholding results in an overpayment of taxes, a refund from the Internal Revenue Service may be obtained. To prevent backup withholding on any payment made to a holder of stock in connection with the Merger Agreement, the holder is
required to notify the Purchaser of his or her correct TIN by completing the enclosed Form <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">W-9</FONT> and certifying under penalties of perjury, that the TIN provided on Form
