ARTICLE I

 

 _SALE OF SHARES AND TERMS OF PAYMENT_

Section 1.01. _Sale of the Shares._ Upon the terms and subject to the
satisfaction of the conditions contained in this Agreement, at the Closing,
each Seller hereby sells, assigns, transfers and delivers to Buyer, and Buyer
hereby purchases and acquires from such Seller, all of the Shares of such
Seller free and clear of all Encumbrances.

Section 1.02. _Consideration._ Upon the terms and subject to the satisfaction

Price" shall be an initial amount equal to (a) Sixty Three Million Four
Hundred Two Thousand Seven Hundred Ninety Nine and 90/100 Dollars
($63,402,799.90), less (b) the amount of the Closing Reduction, if any, plus
(c) the amount of the Closing Addition, if any. At the Closing, Buyer shall
pay or cause to be paid the Initial Purchase Price to the Persons and in the
manner set forth in _Section 1.04_. Section 1.03. _Closing Statements._

 

(a) No later than three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Sellers
Representative shall deliver to Buyer Payoff Letters pursuant to _Section
6.09_.

Representative shall deliver to Buyer a statement (the " _Estimated

amount of the Estimated Transaction Expenses in accordance with  _Section
1.05(a)_.

(c) No later than three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date,
Sellers Representative shall deliver to Buyer an estimated Closing Balance

Estimated Net Working Capital and the Estimated Closing Date Indebtedness, in
accordance with  _Section 1.05(a)_.

Section 1.04. _Payment of Initial Purchase Price._

 

(a) Buyer shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, the following at Closing:

 

(i) to SunTrust Bank (the " _Escrow Agent_ "), (A) Four Million Dollars
($4,000,000) in immediately available funds (the " _Price Adjustment Escrow
Amount_ ") and (B) Nine Million Six Hundred Seventy Five Thousand Dollars
($9,675,000) in immediately available funds (the " _Indemnity Escrow Amount_
"), by wire transfer of such immediately available funds to the Escrow Agent,
to be held in escrow in accordance with the terms and conditions of an Escrow
Agreement (the " _Escrow Agreement_ ") in the form of _Exhibit A_ ;

 

(ii) on behalf of the Company Group, to such account or accounts as designated
by the applicable lender or agent in each Payoff Letter, an amount in
immediately available funds equal to that portion of the Payoff Amount for the
Company Debt to which such Payoff Letter relates;

(iii) on behalf of the Company Group, to the account or accounts as Sellers
Representative specifies to Buyer in the Estimated Transaction Expense
Statement, the aggregate amount of the Estimated Transaction Expenses;

(iv) on behalf of the Company Group, to an account designated by Sellers
Representative (for further distribution by Sellers Representative to the
members of Senior Management in accordance with the Transaction Bonus
Letters), Seven Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($7,500,000) in
immediately available funds;

 

(v) on behalf of Sellers, to an account designated by Sellers Representative,
Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000) in immediately available funds (the
" _Expense Funds_ "), to be used by Sellers Representative in accordance with
_Section 12.13(c)_; and

 



2 (vi) to Sellers Representative (for further distribution by
Sellers Representative to Sellers in accordance with _Section 1.04(b)_),
immediately available funds representing the Initial Purchase Price less (A)
the cash amounts paid pursuant to _Sections 1.04(a)(i)_ , _(ii)_ , _(iii)_ , 
_(iv)_ and _(v)_ and (B) Two Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars
($2,500,000) (the " _Continued Service Amount_ "), such amount to be retained
by Buyer and paid to Senior Management, subject to the terms and conditions
of the Transaction Bonus Letters (the aggregate amount of all payments to
Sellers Representative under this _Section 1.04(a)(vi)_, the " _Initial
Sellers Payment_ "). Delivery of the Initial Sellers Payment to Sellers
Representative as provided in the preceding sentence shall be deemed delivery
by Buyer of such Initial Sellers Payment to Sellers for purposes of this
Agreement and, after completion of such delivery, neither Parent nor Buyer
shall have any further obligation to deliver such Initial Sellers Payment to
Sellers. To the extent that any of the Continued Service Amount is forfeited
under the Transaction Bonus Letters, promptly after the first and second
anniversaries of the Closing Date, Buyer shall pay to the Sellers
Representative (by wire transfer of immediately available funds) the portion
of such Continued Service Amount that has been forfeited, if any, as of such
anniversary for further distribution by the Sellers Representative to
Sellers in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Portions.

(b) Following the Closing, Sellers Representative shall, for each Seller who
surrenders an original Company Stock Certificate to Sellers Representative,
pay to such Seller such Sellers Pro Rata Portion of the Initial Sellers
Payment. Within three (3) Business Days of receipt of any such Company Stock
Certificate, Sellers Representative shall deliver such Company Stock
Certificate to Buyer. Each Seller hereby acknowledges and agrees that each
Company Stock Certificate shall be deemed, from and after the Closing Date,
to be cancelled and to represent only the right to receive such Sellers Pro
Rata Portion of the Initial Sellers Payment. If any Company Stock Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the owner of such lost, stolen or
destroyed Company Stock Certificate may in lieu of delivery of such Company
Stock Certificate deliver to Sellers Representative and Buyer an affidavit of
that fact (an " _Affidavit of Loss_ "), in the form attached hereto as
_Exhibit G_ , and, if required by Buyer or Parent, a surety bond in favor of
Buyer and Parent as security against any claim that made be made against Buyer
or Parent with respect to such Company Stock Certificate. Promptly after the
six-month anniversary of the Closing Date, Sellers Representative shall
deliver to Buyer any portion of the Initial Sellers Payment not disbursed to
Sellers, and, thereafter, any Seller that has not yet received his, her
or its Pro Rata Portion of the Initial Sellers Payment shall be entitled to
look to Buyer (subject to abandoned property, escheat and other similar Laws)
with respect to any amounts that may be payable upon due surrender of the
Company Stock Certificates held by such Seller. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, none of Parent, Buyer or Sellers Representative shall be liable to
any Seller for any cash amounts delivered to any public official pursuant to
any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

 



3 Section 1.05. _Adjustment of Initial Purchase Price._

 

(a) _Adjustment at Closing_. In accordance with _Section 1.03_, Sellers
Representative shall deliver to Buyer the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet and
a good faith calculation of the Estimated Net Working Capital based upon the
Estimated Closing Balance Sheet, the Estimated Closing Date Indebtedness and
the Estimated Transaction Expenses, together with reasonable supporting
calculations and supporting documentation therefor. The Estimated Closing
Balance Sheet shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP consistently applied
using the Company Accounting Principles; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the
event of a conflict between consistency with the Company Accounting Principles
and compliance with GAAP, compliance with GAAP shall control; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that, for the avoidance of doubt, the Company
Accounting Principles as applied to the items set forth on _Schedule 1.05(a)_
of the Sellers Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to be in conformity with
GAAP. Sellers Representative will consider in good faith any revisions to the
calculations set forth in the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet proposed by
Buyer and the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet shall be modified accordingly to
reflect any revisions agreed upon by Buyer and Sellers Representative. At the
Closing, as provided in  _Section 1.02_, the Initial Purchase Price shall be
determined in part by (i) reducing it by the amount, if any, by which the
Base-Line Net Working Capital exceeds the Estimated Net Working Capital, or
(ii) increasing it by the amount, if any, by which the Estimated Net Working
Capital exceeds the Base-Line Net Working Capital. The reduction in and
addition to the Initial Purchase Price referred to in the preceding sentence
are hereafter collectively referred to as the " _Closing Reduction_ " and "
_Closing Addition_ ," respectively.

(b) _Final Closing Balance Sheet_. No later than ninety (90) days after the
Closing Date, Buyer will deliver to Sellers Representative the final Closing
Balance Sheet (the " _Final Closing Balance Sheet_ ") and the calculations of
the Final Net Working Capital based upon the Final Closing Balance Sheet, as
well as the Final Closing Date Indebtedness and the Final Transaction
Expenses. The Final Closing Balance Sheet shall be prepared in accordance with
GAAP consistently applied using the Company Accounting Principles; _provided_
, _however_ , that in the event of a conflict between consistency with the
Company Accounting Principles and compliance with GAAP, compliance with GAAP
shall control; _provided_ , _further_ , that, for the avoidance of doubt, the
Company Accounting Principles as applied to the items set forth on _Schedule
1.05(a)_ of the Sellers Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to be in
conformity with GAAP.

 

(c) _Review by Sellers  Representative; Dispute Resolution_.

 

(i) Following receipt of the Final Closing Balance Sheet, Sellers
Representative will be afforded a period of forty-five (45) days to review
the Final Closing Balance Sheet and the calculations of the Final Net Working
Capital, the Final Closing Date Indebtedness and the Final Transaction
Expenses during which period Sellers Representative and its advisors shall
have the right to inspect all materials, including the work papers, generated
by Buyer in preparation of the Final Closing Balance Sheet and such
calculations and shall have reasonable and prompt access, during normal
business hours, to the Company Groups relevant personnel and to information,
books and records of the Company Group reasonably requested by Sellers
Representative and relevant to the Final Closing Balance Sheet and such
calculations. At or before the end of such 45-day review period, Sellers
Representative will either (A) accept the Final Closing Balance Sheet in its
entirety, in which case Buyers calculations shall be final, conclusive and
binding on the parties hereto, or (B) deliver to Buyer written notice and a
written explanation of those items in the Final Closing Balance Sheet which
Sellers Representative disputes and the proposed modification of such
calculations, in which case only the items identified shall be deemed to be
in dispute and the other items shall be deemed to be accepted; _provided,
however_ , that the only bases for objection with respect to the Final Net
Working Capital calculation shall be (1) non-compliance with GAAP or the
Company Accounting Principles, as applicable and (2) computational errors.
Sellers Representative and each Seller shall be deemed to have accepted the
Final Closing Balance Sheet in its entirety, and to have agreed with all
items and amounts contained in the Final Closing Balance Sheet and Buyers
calculations of the Final Net Working Capital, the Final Closing Date
Indebtedness and the Final Transaction Expenses if Sellers Representative
fails to deliver such notice and explanation of any items it disputes at or
before the end of such 30-day review period. Within a further period of twenty
(20) days from the end of the aforementioned review period, Sellers
Representative, Buyer and their accountants will attempt to resolve in good
faith any disputed items.

 



4 (ii) Failing such resolution, either Sellers Representative or Buyer may
refer the unresolved disputed items for final binding resolution to the
Dispute Accountants to review this Agreement and the disputed items or amounts
for the purpose of calculating the Final Net Working Capital, the Final
Closing Date Indebtedness and/or the Final Transaction Expenses. In making
such calculations, the Dispute Accountants shall consider only those items or
amounts in the Final Closing Balance Sheet or the calculations of the Final
Net Working Capital, the Final Closing Date Indebtedness and/or the Final
Transaction Expenses as to which Buyer and Sellers Representative have
disagreed and shall be instructed that it may not resolve any amounts in
dispute such that the resolution is greater than the greatest amount proposed
by the parties or less than the least amount proposed by the parties. The
Dispute Accountants shall deliver to Buyer and Sellers Representative, within
thirty (30) days of reference of the matter to the Dispute Accountants, a
report setting forth its calculations, which shall be prepared in accordance
with the standards set forth in _Section 1.05(b)_. The decision of such
Dispute Accountants, absent manifest error, will be nonappealable and
incontestable by the parties hereto and will not be subject to collateral
attack for any reason. The cost of such review and report shall be paid by
Buyer and Sellers Representative (on behalf of Sellers) equally.

 

(iii) In the event the Dispute Accountants refuse the engagement under this
_Section 1.05(c)_, Buyer and Sellers Representative shall mutually agree on
another nationally recognized firm of certified public accountants having no
material relationship with the Company Group, Buyer or Sellers (the "
_Alternative Dispute Accountant_ ") to resolve any disputes according to this
_Section 1.05(c)_. If within thirty (30) days of such refusal, Buyer and
Sellers Representative fail to mutually agree on an Alternative Dispute
Accountant, Buyer and Sellers Representative shall thereafter promptly cause
the American Arbitration Association to appoint the Alternative Dispute
Accountant, and in making its determination with respect to such appointment,
the American Arbitration Association shall take into account, and attempt to
avoid appointing an accounting firm with, any significant preexisting
relationship with the Company Group, Buyer or Sellers or their respective
Affiliates. The fees and expenses of the Alternative Dispute Accountant shall
be apportioned in the same manner as described in _Section 1.05(c)(ii)_.

(d) _Adjustment after Closing_. After Closing, the Initial Sellers Payment
shall be (i) (A) reduced by the amount, if any, by which the Final Net Working
Capital is less than the Estimated Net Working Capital, or (B) increased by
the amount, if any, by which the Final Net Working Capital is greater than
the Estimated Net Working Capital, (ii) (A) reduced by the amount, if any, by
which the Final Closing Date Indebtedness exceeds the Estimated Closing Date

the calculation of the Final Net Working Capital, the Final Closing Date

disbursement and payment shall be further distributed by Sellers
Representative to Sellers in accordance with their respective Pro
Rata Portions) and Buyer will also pay Sellers Representative the amount of
the Post-Closing Addition in immediately available funds by wire transfer made
within ten (10) Business Days after the final determination of the amount of
the Post-Closing Addition pursuant to _Section 1.05(d)_ (which disbursement
and payment shall be further distributed by Sellers Representative to Sellers
in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Portions).

 

(ii) If any Post-Closing Reduction is required, then Buyer shall be entitled
to receive a disbursement in accordance with the Escrow Agreement from the
Price Adjustment Escrow Account in an amount equal to the Post-Closing
Reduction and, to the extent sufficient funds are not available therein, Buyer
shall be entitled to receive a disbursement in accordance with the
Escrow Agreement from the Indemnity Escrow Account in an amount equal to the
amount of such deficiency; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the amount of the

Account separately from the other Escrow Accounts as provided in the Escrow
Agreement. Upon completion of such deposits, Buyer shall have no further
obligation to pay such amounts to Sellers. The Escrow Funds shall be
distributed by the Escrow Agent as provided in the Escrow Agreement. Buyer
shall be responsible for the fees and expenses of the Escrow Agent and all
taxes payable in respect to the Escrow Funds for so long as they are subject
to escrow hereunder.

 



6 Section 1.07. _Withholding._ Buyer and its Affiliates shall be entitled
to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to
this Agreement to any Seller or Sellers Representative such amounts as Buyer
is required to deduct and withhold under the Code, or any Tax law, with

of Section 280G of the Code and the Department of Treasury regulations
promulgated thereunder), as determined immediately prior to the initiation of

into account in the calculation of the Final Net Working Capital.

(c) _Indemnification_. Sellers shall indemnify the Company Group and Buyer
and hold them harmless from and against (i) all Taxes of the Company Group for
all taxable periods ending on or before the Closing Date; (ii) with respect to

under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of
state, local or foreign Law), as a transferee or successor, by contract, or
otherwise; and (v) any and all Taxes payable by the Company Group (A) as a

or otherwise with respect to the loss of any Tax exemption in Uruguay
relating to any project with Forestal Atlantico Sur S.A.R.L.; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Sellers shall have no liability under clauses (i), (ii), or
(iv) of this  _Section 9.04(c)_ for any Taxes resulting from any action
taken by the Company Group or Buyer on the Closing Date after the Closing that
is not in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practices of
the Company Group; and  _provided_ , _further_ , that Sellers shall not be
required to indemnify Buyer for any Taxes that were accrued as part of the
Final Net Working Capital. In the event of a conflict between a provision in
this _Section 9.04(c)_ and a provision in _Section 10.02_, the provision in
this _Section 9.04(c)_ shall control.

 



39 (d) _Straddle Period_. In the case of any taxable period that includes (but
does not end on) the Closing Date (a " _Straddle Period_ "), the amount of
any Taxes for the pre-Closing and post-Closing portions of such Straddle
Period shall be determined as follows. The portion of any Tax that is
allocable to the taxable period that is deemed to end on the Closing Date
will be: (i) in the case of real property Taxes, personal property Taxes and
similar ad valorem Taxes, deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for the entire
Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the
number of calendar days of such Straddle Period in the portion of the Straddle
Period ending on (and including) the Closing Date and the denominator of which
is the number of calendar days in the entire Straddle Period, and (ii) in the
case of all other Taxes, determined as though the taxable year of the Company
terminated at the close of business on the Closing Date.

(e) _Refunds_. Any Tax refunds or credits that are received by Buyer or the
Company Group that relate to a Tax that was either paid by the Company or any
member of the Company Group on or before the Closing Date or accrued as part
of the Final Net Working Capital shall be for the account of Sellers, and
Buyer shall pay over to Sellers the amount of any such refund or credit, net
of any cost to Buyer or the Company Group attributable to the obtaining and
receipt of such refund or credit, within fifteen (15) days after such receipt
or recognition thereof, except to the extent such refund or credit arises as a
result of a carryback of a loss or other tax benefit from a Tax period (or
portion thereof) beginning after the Closing Date or such refund or credit was
included as an asset in the calculation of the Final Net Working Capital, as
finally determined pursuant to _Section 1.05_. To the extent such refund or
credit is subsequently disallowed or required to be returned to the applicable
Governmental Entity, Sellers agree promptly to repay the amount of such refund
or credit, together with any interest, penalties or other additional amounts
imposed by such Governmental Entity, to Buyer.

(f) _Contests_. Buyer and the Company Group, on the one hand, and
Sellers, Sellers Representative and their Affiliates, on the other hand,
shall promptly notify each other upon receipt by such party of written notice
of any inquiries, claims, assessments, audits or similar events with respect
to Taxes relating to periods ending on or before the Closing Date (any such
inquiry, claim, assessment, audit or similar event, a " _Tax Contest_ "). Any
failure to so notify the other party of any Tax Contest shall not relieve such
other party of any liability with respect to such Tax Contests except to the
extent such party was actually prejudiced as a result thereof. Buyer shall
have sole control of the conduct of all Tax Contests, including any settlement
or compromise thereof, provided, however, that Buyer shall keep Sellers
reasonably informed of the progress of any Tax Contest and shall not effect
any such settlement or compromise with respect to which Sellers are liable
without obtaining Sellers Representatives prior written consent thereto,
which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. In the event of a
conflict between a provision in this _Section 9.04(f)_ and a provision in
_Section 10.06_, the provision in this  _Section 9.04(f)_ shall control.

 



40 (g) _Cooperation on Tax Matters_. Buyer, the Company Group, Sellers
and Sellers Representative shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent
reasonably requested by the other party, in connection with the filing of Tax
Returns and any audit, litigation or other Proceeding with respect to Taxes.
Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the other partys
request) the provision of records and information reasonably relevant to any
such audit, litigation, or other Proceeding and making employees available on
a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation
of any material provided hereunder. Buyer, the Company Group and Sellers agree
(i) to retain all books and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to
the Company Group relating to any taxable period beginning before the Closing
Date until expiration of the statute of limitations (and, to the extent
notified by Buyer or Sellers, any extensions thereof) of the respective
taxable periods, and to abide by all record retention agreements entered into
with any taxing authority, and (ii) to give the other party reasonable written
notice prior to transferring, destroying or discarding any such books and
records and, if the other party so requests, Buyer, the Company Group
or Sellers, as the case may be, shall allow the other party to take
possession of such books and records. Buyer and Sellers further agree, upon
request, to use their reasonable efforts to obtain any certificate or other
document from any Governmental Entity or any other Person as may be necessary
to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed (including with
respect to the transactions contemplated hereby).

Section 9.05. _Confidentiality._

(a) Each Seller agrees that all confidential information relating to the
Company Group or the Business of which such Seller is aware as a result of its
involvement with the Company Group before Closing shall be treated as the sole
property of the Company Group, and such Seller shall use all reasonable
efforts to keep confidential all of such information. The obligation to keep
such information confidential shall not apply to: (i) any information which is
or becomes known to the public through no fault of such Seller; (ii)
disclosures in accordance with applicable Law or an Order of a Governmental
Entity; (iii) any disclosures to Representatives of such Seller who have a
need to know in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and that agree to maintain confidentiality of such information in
accordance with this Agreement; or (iv) in connection with disputes relating
hereto which arise between the parties.

 

(b) The parties agree to maintain, and to cause their Representatives to
maintain, the confidentiality of the terms and conditions of this Agreement
and the Related Agreements and all documents executed and delivered in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Related Agreements except to the extent disclosed in any press release
permitted by  _Section 6.05_ or any SEC filings required to be made by
Parent. The provisions of this _Section 9.05(b)_ shall not apply to
particular conditions or terms of the above referenced documents (i) if the
party seeking to make such disclosure shall have obtained the prior written
consent of the other parties to the disclosure of such conditions or terms,
(ii) that are required to be disclosed during the course of any Proceeding
which may be brought by any party related to the provisions of any of the
above referenced documents, (iii) that are or become generally available to
the public other than as a result of actions taken by the party seeking to
make such disclosure or its agents or Representatives in violation of this
Agreement, or (iv) that are required to be disclosed pursuant to and in
accordance with any Law or Order applicable to the party seeking to make such
disclosure.

 



41 (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a party is requested or required (by
oral questions, interrogatories, requests for information or document
subpoena, civil investigative demand or similar process) to disclose any of
the above-referenced documents or confidential information, such party will
promptly notify the other party of such request so that such other party may
seek an appropriate protective order, at its sole expense, or waive compliance
with the provisions hereof. If, in the absence of a protective order or the
receipt of a waiver hereunder, a party is nonetheless, upon the advice of its
counsel, under an obligation to disclose any terms or conditions of the above-
referenced documents or any confidential information to any Governmental
Entity or else stand liable for contempt or suffer other censure or penalty,
such party may disclose such documents or information to such Governmental
Entity without liability hereunder.

for any representation or warranty shall not terminate or affect any claim
with respect to such representation or warranty or such Section as to which
notice of a claim hereunder has been delivered to the other party prior to the
end of such survival period; and (ii) in the event of fraud, knowing
misrepresentation or criminal or willful misconduct in connection with a

Parties from and against, and hold each of them harmless from, any and all

Losses arising out of fraud, knowing misrepresentation or willful or criminal
misconduct:

 

(i) No Seller shall be responsible for the breach by any other Seller of any
representation or warranty made by such other Seller pursuant to _Article
III_ or _Article IV_ or _Section 9.05_. In the event that a Seller is

_Section 10.02(a)_, the responsibility for such Loss shall be allocated
solely to such Seller. In the event that more than one Seller is required to
indemnify a Buyer Indemnified Party for the same Loss pursuant to _Section
10.02(b)_, the responsibility for such Loss shall be allocated between or
among such Sellers in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Portions.

(ii) Sellers shall not have any obligation to indemnify any Buyer Indemnified
Party from and against any Losses arising out of breaches or inaccuracies
indemnified under _Section 10.02(a)_ or _Section 10.02(b)(i)_ (other than as
a result of a breach of or inaccuracy in a Fundamental Representation or any
of the representations and warranties in _Section 4.14_ (Employee Benefit
Plans) and _Section 4.17_ (Taxes)) until the Buyer Indemnified Parties have
suffered aggregate Losses (including as a result of breaches of or
inaccuracies in Fundamental Representations or any of the representations and
warranties in _Section 4.14_ (Employee Benefit Plans) and _Section 4.17_
(Taxes)) in excess of Six Hundred Thousand Dollars ($600,000) (the "
_Threshold_ "), in which event the Buyer Indemnified Party shall be entitled
to indemnification for the full amount of such Losses from the first dollar.
For the avoidance of doubt, the rights of Buyer Indemnified Parties to
indemnification pursuant to _Section 10.02(a)_ or _Section 10.02(b)(i)_ as a
result of a breach of or inaccuracy in a Fundamental Representation or any of
the representations and warranties in  _Section 4.14_ (Employee Benefit
Plans) and _Section 4.17_ (Taxes) shall not be subject to the Threshold.

or inaccuracy in a Fundamental Representation and the representations and
warranties in _Section 4.14_ (Employee Benefit Plans) and _Section 4.17_
(Taxes) shall not be subject to the Cap.

(iv) Subject to the other limitations contained herein, the Buyer Indemnified
Parties shall satisfy any finally determined claim for indemnification under
this _Section 10.02 (A)_ first, from the Indemnity Escrow Account in
accordance with the terms set forth in this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement and (B) second, if the Escrow Funds in the Indemnity Escrow Account
are insufficient to satisfy any or all such indemnification claims, then from
Sellers directly.

 

(v) Sellers shall not have any obligation to indemnify any Buyer Indemnified
Party from and against any Losses arising out of any action taken by the
Company Group or Buyer on the Closing Date after the Closing that is not in
the ordinary course of business consistent with past practices of the Company
Group.

Section 10.03. _Indemnification by Buyer_.

(a) After the Closing, Buyer will save, defend and indemnify each Seller and
its Affiliates and each of their respective employees, directors, officers,
representatives, agents, successors and assigns (collectively, the " _Seller
Indemnified Parties_ ") from and against, and hold each of them harmless
from, any and all Losses arising out of, based upon, resulting from or

Agreement.

limitations; _provided_ , _however_ , that the following limitations described
in clauses (i) and (ii) below shall not apply to Losses arising out of fraud,
knowing misrepresentation or willful or criminal misconduct:

Party from and against any Losses arising out of breaches or inaccuracies
described in _Section 10.03(a)(i)_ (other than as a result of a breach of or
inaccuracy in a Fundamental Representation) until the Seller
Indemnified Parties have suffered aggregate Losses by reason of such breaches
or inaccuracies (including as a result of breaches of or inaccuracies in
Fundamental Representations) in excess of the Threshold, in which event the
Seller Indemnified Party shall be entitled to indemnification for the full
amount of such Losses from the first dollar. For the avoidance of doubt, the
Seller Indemnified Parties right to indemnification under _Section
10.03(a)(i)_ as a result of a breach of or inaccuracy in a Fundamental
Representation shall not be subject to the Threshold.

(ii) The maximum amount which the Seller Indemnified Parties may recover
arising out of breaches or inaccuracies described in _Section 10.03(a)(i)_

Representation) shall be the Cap. For the further avoidance of doubt, the
Seller Indemnified Parties right to indemnification under _Section
10.03(a)(i)_ as a result of a breach of or inaccuracy in a Fundamental
Representation shall not be subject to the Cap.

 

Section 10.04. _Exclusive Remedy_. From and after the Closing Date, the Buyer
Indemnified Parties and the Seller Indemnified Parties sole and exclusive
remedy for any Claim with respect to the breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement or other express indemnification obligation
set forth in this Agreement shall be those remedies set forth in this
_Article X_ or _Article IX_ (for any Claim with respect to Taxes); _provided_
, _however_ , that nothing herein shall preclude any party hereto from (a)
enforcing its rights to an injunction or specific performance with respect to
the performance of post-Closing agreements or obligations pursuant to _Section
12.11_ or (b) seeking any remedy based upon fraud, knowing misrepresentation
or willful or criminal misconduct by any other party hereto (including,
without limitation, any fraud, knowing misrepresentation or willful or
criminal misconduct committed by any officer, director, member, employee or
agent of Sellers, the Company Group or any Affiliate thereof in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement).

punitive damages in connection with any Losses, except where such damages are
received by a third party from an Indemnified Party in connection with Losses
indemnified hereunder; 

 



45 (ii) the amount of Loss for which any party to this Agreement may be entitled
to seek indemnification under this Agreement will be reduced by (A) the
amount of any third-party insurance (and not self-insurance) proceeds or other
payment from a third party that is actually received by such party (or its
Affiliates) with respect to such Loss (net of any out-of-pocket expenses
incurred in obtaining such amounts, any co-payment, retrospective premium
adjustment and increased premiums resulting from such Loss (" _Reduction
Amounts_ ")) and (B) any net Tax benefit actually recognized in the year of
the Loss by the Indemnified Party;

(iii) if an Indemnified Party, after having received any indemnification
payment pursuant to this Agreement with respect to a Loss, subsequently
actually receives any third-party insurance proceeds or other payment from a
third party for which it was actually indemnified pursuant to this  _Article
X_ , such Indemnified Party will promptly refund and pay to the Indemnifying
Party an amount equal to such insurance proceeds or payment (net of applicable
Reduction Amounts); and

 

(iv) each party to this Agreement (and the Company Group) will use its
commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate any Losses with respect to which
it may be entitled to seek indemnification pursuant to this Agreement;
_provided_ , _however_ , that (A) this clause (iv) shall not require any party
to take any action to recover Losses from any third party unless doing so is
commercially reasonable; and (B) the taking of any such action shall not be a
condition to indemnification rights hereunder.

(b) All indemnification payments pursuant to this _Article X_ or _Article IX_
shall be deemed to be adjustments to the Initial Purchase Price for U.S.

be indemnified pursuant to this Agreement to the extent that such partys
Losses are increased or extended by the willful or criminal misconduct,
violation of applicable Law of such party or bad faith of such party.

 

Section 10.06. _Indemnification Procedures_.

(a) Any party that has an indemnification obligation under this Agreement is
referred to herein as an " _Indemnifying Party_ "; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that, for purposes of this  _Section 10.06_, in the event that such party is
a Seller, " _Indemnifying Party_ " means Sellers, acting through Sellers
Representative. Any party seeking indemnification pursuant to this _Article X_
is referred to herein as an " _Indemnified Party_."

(b) Should any Claim or Proceeding by or involving a third party (including
any Governmental Entity) not party to this Agreement (or an Affiliate thereof)
arise after the Closing Date for which an Indemnifying Party has an
indemnification obligation under the terms of this Agreement (a " _Third-
Party Claim_ "), the Indemnified Party shall notify the Indemnifying Party in
writing (a " _Third-Party Claim Notice_ ") within a reasonable time after such
Claim or Proceeding arises and is known to the Indemnified Party;  _provided_
, _however_ , that no delay on the part of the Indemnified Party to provide
the Indemnifying Party a Third-Party Claim Notice shall relieve the
Indemnifying Party from any obligation hereunder unless (and then solely to
the extent) the Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced as a result
thereof.

 



46 (c) If the Indemnifying Party wishes to assume the defense of any Third-Party
Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall give written notice to Indemnified Party
that it intends to assume such defense within thirty (30) days after notice
from Indemnified Party of such Third-Party Claim, the expenses of which such
defense shall be paid, as incurred, by the Indemnifying Party; _provided_
that, as a condition precedent to the Indemnifying Partys right to assume the
defense of such Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party must first
acknowledge in writing to the Indemnified Party that the Indemnifying Party
will indemnify the Indemnified Party from and against any Losses based upon,
arising out of or resulting from such Third-Party Claim. The Indemnifying
Party shall thereafter assume the defense of such Third-Party Claim, through
counsel reasonably satisfactory to Indemnified Party; _provided_ that
Indemnified Party may participate in such defense at its own expense but, in
any event, Indemnifying Party shall have the right, as long as it is
actively defending any Claim or Proceeding, to control such defense.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Indemnified Party reasonably determines
based on the advice of counsel that the representation by counsel chosen by
the Indemnifying Party creates a conflict of interest and notifies the
Indemnifying Party thereof, the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to
participate in the defense of such claim with counsel of its choice for such
purpose and the Indemnifying Party shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses
of such counsel, as incurred (provided that the Indemnifying Party shall not
be required to pay the fees and expenses for more than one such counsel and
one local counsel in each relevant jurisdiction for all Indemnified
Parties). The Indemnified Party shall reasonably cooperate with Indemnifying
Party, its counsel and its other authorized Representatives in connection with
the exercise of the rights of Indemnifying Party pursuant to this _Section
10.06_. 

(d) The Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to settle, compromise or consent
to the entry of any judgment with respect to any such Third-Party Claim, with
the written consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed); _provided_ , _however_ , that the prior
written consent of the Indemnified Party may be withheld in its sole
discretion if such settlement, compromise or consent: (i) involves the payment
of money damages that will be paid by the Indemnified Party under this
Agreement in connection therewith; (ii) imposes any injunctive or
other equitable relief against the Indemnified Party; (iii) requires the
finding or admission of any wrongdoing by the Indemnified Party or (iv) does
not include an express, unconditional release of the Indemnified Party from
any liability or obligation with respect to such Third-Party Claim. If (A)
the Indemnifying Party has not assumed the defense of a Third-Party Claim in
accordance with _Section 10.06(c)_, (B) in the reasonable judgment of the
Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying Party has failed to diligently prosecute
the defense of any Third-Party Claim that it has previously assumed or fails
to pay the reasonable costs and expenses of the defense of any such Third-
Party Claim (including fees of counsel), as incurred, or (C) the Third-Party
Claim seeks an order, injunction or other equitable relief for other than
monetary damages against the Indemnified Party, the Indemnified Party may, by
written notice to the Indemnifying Party, assume the exclusive right to
defend, compromise or settle such Third-Party Claim with counsel of the
Indemnified Partys selection, but the Indemnifying Party shall have no
liability with respect to any compromise, settlement or consent to entry of
any judgment with respect to such Third-Party Claim without the prior written
consent of the Indemnifying Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed).

 



47 (e) If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any Third-Party Claim in
accordance with the preceding provisions, the Indemnifying Party will keep
the Indemnified Party informed of all material developments relating to or in
connection with such Third-Party Claim. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the
defense of a Third-Party Claim in accordance with the preceding provisions,
the parties hereto will reasonably cooperate in the defense thereof (with the
Indemnifying Party being responsible for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses
of the Indemnified Party in connection with such cooperation). If the
Indemnifying Party elects not to assume the defense of a Third-Party Claim,
the Indemnifying Partys obligations under this _Section 10.06(e)_ shall
apply to the Indemnified Party.

 

(f) Any claim on account of Losses for which indemnification is provided under
this Agreement which does not involve a Third-Party Claim shall be asserted
by reasonably prompt written notice (a " _Notice of Claim_ "), stating, in
reasonable detail, and to the extent known, the nature and basis of such claim
and a good faith, non-binding, preliminary estimate of the aggregate dollar
amount of actual Losses that have arisen and are expected to arise as a result
of such breach or other matter as set forth on such Notice of Claim, given by
the Indemnified Party to the Indemnifying Party; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,
that no delay on the part of the Indemnified Party in notifying the
Indemnifying Party shall relieve the Indemnifying Party from any obligation
hereunder unless (and then solely to the extent) the Indemnifying Party is
actually prejudiced as a result thereof.

(g) Upon receipt of a Notice of Claim, the Indemnifying Party and the
Indemnified Party shall consult with each other in an attempt to agree upon
the matters set forth in the Notice of Claim and reach a written agreement
with respect to such matters (a " _Claim Settlement Agreement_ "). If the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party fail to agree upon the matters
contained in such Notice of Claim within thirty (30) days after the date the
Notice of Claim is delivered to the Indemnified Party, then, at the request of
any party, the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall meet in an
attempt to resolve the objection described in such Notice of Claim and reach a
Claim Settlement Agreement. If the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified
Party enter into a Claim Settlement Agreement, the objections contained in
such Notice of Claim shall be deemed to be as resolved as provided therein. If
the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party are unable to resolve the
objection described in such Notice of Claim within sixty (60) days after
delivery by the Indemnified Party of such Notice of Claim, then either party
may submit the objections contained in such Notice of Claim for resolution in
a proceeding commenced as contemplated by _Section 12.07_.

 

Section 10.07. _Calculation of Loss Amount_. For purposes of determining the
amount of any Losses with respect to any claim for indemnification under
_Section 10.02_ or _Section 10.03_ (but not for purposes of determining
whether any representation or warranty in this Agreement has been breached),
any qualifiers as to materiality (including Material Adverse Effect or
similar terms), contained in an applicable representation and warranty shall
be deemed to be deleted and shall be given no force or effect.

shall be terminated and shall be of no further force and effect; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that nothing shall relieve any party from Liability for any
breach by such party occurring prior to the termination of this Agreement of
either (a) the covenants or agreements of such party set forth in this
Agreement, or (b) the representations and warranties of such party set forth
in this Agreement which give rise to termination hereof pursuant to _Section
11.01(b)(i)_ or _Section 11.01(c)(i)_ which shall, under these circumstances,
survive the termination of this Agreement.

Agreement, any failure of any of the parties to comply with any obligation,
covenant, agreement or condition herein may be waived by the party entitled
to the benefits thereof only by a written instrument signed by the party

the application thereof to any circumstance shall, in any jurisdiction and to
any extent, be invalid or unenforceable, such term or provision shall be

51 Section 12.05. _Assignment; Third Party Beneficiaries_.

 

(a) This Agreement and all of the provisions hereof shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective heirs,
executors, personal representatives, successors and permitted assigns;
_provided_ that neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations hereunder may be assigned by any party hereto without the
prior written consent of the other parties; _provided further_ that, without
the consent of Sellers Representative or any other party:

(i) Parent or Buyer may assign, in whole or in part, its rights and
obligations pursuant to this Agreement to one or more of its respective
Affiliates; _provided_ that the Parent or Buyer, as applicable, will
nonetheless remain liable for all of its obligations hereunder; and

(ii) Parent and Buyer may assign its rights under this Agreement, in whole or
in part, to any subsequent purchaser of Buyer or the Company Group or all or
substantially all of their respective assets (whether such sale is structured
as a sale of stock, a sale of assets, a merger or otherwise); _provided_ that
such subsequent purchaser assumes the obligations of Parent and Buyer
hereunder and Parent and Buyer nonetheless remain liable for all of their
respective obligations hereunder in the event they are not performed by the
subsequent purchaser.

(b) Any purported assignment in violation of the provisions hereof shall be
void.

 

(c) The terms and conditions of this Agreement are intended solely for the
benefit of the parties hereto, the parties entitled to indemnification under
_Article X_ and their respective heirs, executors, personal representatives,
successors and permitted assigns and except as otherwise provided herein, it
is not the intention of the parties to confer third party beneficiary rights
upon any other Person.

Section 12.06. _Governing Law._ This Agreement shall be governed by the laws
of the State of New York as to all matters, including but not limited to
matters of validity, construction, effect, performance and remedies.

Section 12.07. _Suits in New York._ Except with respect to disputes referred
to Dispute Accountants or Alternative Dispute Accountants pursuant to _Section
1.05_, the parties agree that any Proceeding relating in any way to this
Agreement or the Related Agreements or the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby shall be brought and enforced in the Supreme Court of the State of New
York for the County of New York or in the United States District Court for
the Southern District of New York, and the parties hereby waive any objection
to jurisdiction or venue in any such proceeding commenced in or removed to
such courts. EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY
IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR
OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE RELATED
AGREEMENTS OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY.

 

Section 12.08. _Counterparts._ This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, and by any party on separate counterparts, each of which as so
executed and delivered shall be deemed an original, but all of which together
shall constitute one and the same instrument, and it shall not be necessary in
making proof of this Agreement as to any party hereto to produce or account
for more than one such counterpart executed and delivered by such party.
Counterparts may be executed either in original, faxed or digital transmission
form and the parties adopt any signatures received by a receiving fax
machine or computer as original signatures of the parties.

 



52 Section 12.09. _Interpretation; Good Faith._ The words "herein", "hereof",
"hereunder", "hereby", "hereto", "hereinafter", and other words of similar
import refer to this Agreement as a whole, including the Sellers Disclosure
Schedule, other Schedules and Exhibits, as the same may from time to time be
amended, modified, supplemented or restated, and not to any particular
article, section, subsection, paragraph, subparagraph or clause contained in
this Agreement. The Sellers Disclosure Schedule, other Schedules and Exhibits
to this Agreement and _Annex I_ are incorporated into and form an integral
part of this Agreement. Each Section of the Sellers Disclosure Schedule
corresponds to a specific section or subsection of this Agreement.
The disclosure in any section or subsection of the Sellers Disclosure
Schedule qualifies other sections and subsections in this Agreement for which
the relevance or applicability of such disclosure is reasonably apparent. The
use in this Agreement of the term "including" means "including without
limitation." References to documents "made available" by Sellers, Senior
Management or the Company Group to Buyer in this Agreement mean that such
documents must be made available in the data room to which Buyer has been
given access in connection with the transaction contemplated by this
Agreement. The title of and the article, section and paragraph headings in
this Agreement and the provision of tables of contents are for convenience of
reference only and shall not govern or affect the interpretation of any of the
terms or provisions of this Agreement. The use herein of words importing the
singular include the plural and vice versa, and the use of the masculine,
feminine or neuter forms shall also denote the other forms, as in each case
the context may require. The language used in this Agreement has been chosen
by the parties to express their mutual intent, and no rule of strict
construction shall be applied against any party. Accounting terms used but
not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings given to them under GAAP.
All references to monetary amounts are to the currency of the United States
and any payment contemplated by this Agreement shall be made (except as
otherwise provided) in cash, certified check, wire transfer or any other
method that provides immediately available funds to an account designated in
writing by the payee. If any payment is required to be made or other action
is required to be taken pursuant to this Agreement on a date which is not a
Business Day, then such payment or action shall be made or taken on the next
Business Day. Unless expressly provided otherwise, the measure of a period
of one month or year for purposes of this Agreement shall be that date of the
following month or year corresponding to the starting date, provided that if
no corresponding date exists, the measure shall be that date of the following
month or year corresponding to the next day following the starting date. For
example, one month following February 18 is March 18, and one month following
March 31 is May 1\. The parties of this Agreement shall act under this
Agreement in good faith. Time shall be of the essence of this Agreement and
of any part hereof.

Section 12.10. _Entire Agreement._ This Agreement and the Related Agreements,
including the Sellers Disclosure Schedule, other Schedules, Exhibits, Annexes,
documents, certificates and instruments referred to herein and therein, embody
the entire agreement and understanding of the parties hereto in respect of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and supersede all prior
agreements and understandings between the parties with respect thereto.

 

Section 12.11. _Specific Performance._ Each of the parties to this Agreement
acknowledges and agrees that the other party to this Agreement would be
irreparably damaged in the event that any of the terms or provisions of this
Agreement are not performed in accordance with their specific terms or
otherwise are breached. Therefore, notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth in this Agreement, each of the parties to this Agreement
hereby agrees that the other parties to this Agreement shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of any of the terms or
provisions of this Agreement, and to enforce specifically the performance by
the other party under this Agreement, and each party to this Agreement hereby
agrees to waive the defense in any such suit that the other parties to this
Agreement have an adequate remedy at law, and hereby agrees to waive any
requirement to post any bond in connection with obtaining such relief.

 



53 Section 12.12. _Fees and Expenses._ Except as otherwise expressly
provided herein, Sellers and Buyer shall each bear their own costs and
expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement, the Related Agreements
and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. Prior to the Closing
Date, the Company may pay from its available cash any Transaction Expenses.
Buyer shall be responsible for fees, commissions, expenses and reimbursements
incurred by or required to be paid to its professional advisors and investment
bankers. At or after the Closing, Sellers (not the Company Group) shall bear
(from the Purchase Price payments) and be responsible for the fees,
commissions, costs, charges, expenses and reimbursements incurred by or
required to be paid to the Company Groups and Sellers professional advisors
and investment bankers.

Section 12.13. _Sellers  Representative._

 

(a) Each Seller hereby consents to (i) the appointment of Anthony M. Hauff as
the Sellers Representative hereunder and as the attorney-in-fact for and on
behalf of such Seller, and (ii) the taking by Sellers Representative of any
and all actions and the making of any decisions required or permitted by, or
with respect to, this Agreement, the Related Agreements and the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby, including, without limitation, the exercise
of the power to (A) agree to execute any amendments to or terminations of this
Agreement, the Related Agreements and all other documents contemplated hereby
and thereby, (B) authorize delivery to Buyer in accordance with the Escrow
Agreement from the Price Adjustment Escrow Account an amount equal to the
Post-Closing Reduction, if any Post-Closing Reduction is required under 
_Section 1.05_, (C) agree to, negotiate, enter into settlements and
compromises of and comply with orders of courts and awards of arbitrators with
respect to any indemnification claims under _Article X_ , (D) resolve any
such indemnification claims and authorize delivery to any Buyer Indemnified
Party in accordance with the Escrow Agreement from the Indemnity Escrow
Account an amount equal to any disbursements to resolve any such
indemnification claim, (E) make any representations, warranties or
certifications pursuant to this Agreement on behalf of such Seller, (F) accept
receipt of such Sellers Pro Rata Portion of the Initial Sellers Payment on
behalf of such Seller in full satisfaction of Buyers obligation to make such
payment hereunder and (G) take all actions necessary in the judgment of
Sellers Representative incidental to or for the accomplishment of the
foregoing and all of the other terms, conditions and limitations of this
Agreement, the Related Agreements and the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby.

(b) Each Seller shall be bound by the actions taken by Sellers
Representative exercising the rights granted to him by this Agreement, the
Related Agreements or the other documents contemplated by this Agreement, and
Parent and Buyer shall be entitled to rely on any such action or decision of
Sellers Representative. Sellers Representative shall not be entitled to any
fee, commission, compensation or reimbursement for the performance of his
services hereunder or under the Related Agreements from Parent, Buyer or
Sellers or from the cash constituting the Initial Sellers Payment.

 



54 (c) Sellers Representative shall have the sole discretion to use the Expense
Funds to pay any expenses incurred by Sellers Representative in his capacity
as Sellers Representative, including, without limitation, any attorneys,
accountants and other experts fees. Once Sellers
Representative determines, in his sole discretion, that Sellers
Representative will not incur any additional expenses in his capacity as
Sellers Representative, Sellers Representative will distribute, at the sole
expense of Sellers Representative, to Sellers, in accordance with their
respective Pro Rata Portions, the remaining unused Expense Funds, if any,
without interest; _provided_ , _however_ , that Sellers Representative shall
not be required to return any amount to any Seller if the amount such Seller
would otherwise receive would be less than Fifty Dollars ($50).

(d) Sellers Representative, acting in such capacity, shall have no
obligations to any other party to this Agreement other than as expressly set
forth in this Agreement, including as agent, fiduciary or trustee of or for
any Seller. Sellers Representative shall not be liable to any Seller for any
action taken or omitted to be taken under or in connection with this
Agreement, the Related Agreements or the other documents contemplated by this
Agreement, and each Seller hereby waives and shall not assert any right,
claim or cause of action based thereon, except to the extent of liabilities
resulting primarily from Sellers Representatives gross negligence or willful
misconduct (as determined in a final non-appealable judgment by a court of
competent jurisdiction) in connection with his duties expressly set forth
herein.

(e) If Sellers Representative shall die, become disabled, resign or
otherwise be unable to fulfill his responsibilities hereunder, Sellers shall
appoint a new Sellers Representative as soon as reasonably practicable by
written consent by sending notice and a copy of the duly executed written
consent appointing such new Sellers Representative to Buyer. Such appointment
will be effective upon the later of the date indicated in the consent or the
date such consent is received by Buyer.
