applicable Purchaser shall obtain the reasonably equivalent rights and
benefits of any such Assumed Contracts and the reasonably equivalent
corresponding obligations and Liabilities thereunder, so that the parties are
put in substantially the same position they would have been in had such
consent been obtained unconditionally and without recourse. Such agreements
may be in the form of a subcontract, sub-license or sub-lease to a Purchaser
or the applicable Non-U.S. Seller Group appointing the relevant Purchaser as
agent to such Non-U.S. Seller Group to perform such Assumed Contract or any
other arrangement under which the relevant Purchaser would enforce for the
benefit of such Purchaser, with the relevant Purchaser assuming such Non-U.S.
Seller Groups obligations, and any and all rights and benefits of such
Non-U.S. Seller Group against a third party thereto.



(f) For the avoidance of doubt, the Transferred Assets and Assumed Liabilities
(i) of Schlumberger Canada shall be transferred to and assumed by
Itron Canada and (ii) of Schlumberger France shall be transferred to and
assumed by Itron France. Itron hereby guarantees the performance by Itron

Stock, the Taiwan Stock and the Transferred Assets shall be $248,000,000.00

17 Purchasers and STC, BVI and the Non-U.S. Seller Group agree that the
allocation of the Purchase Price shall be as follows: $239.5 million for the
U.S. Stock, which allocation includes consideration of the Companys ownership
of stock of New SLB Mexico, $1.0 million for the Taiwan Stock, $7.0 million
for the Transferred Assets of Schlumberger Canada, and $0.5 million for the
Transferred Assets of Schlumberger France (the " _Allocation_ "). Except for
the Assumed Liabilities, no party hereto is aware of any other item that would
be treated as additional consideration for Tax purposes, but shall notify all
other parties hereto should they become aware of any such other item. Except
as required pursuant to applicable Law or a determination (as defined in
Section 1313 of the Code or any similar provision of Law), the Purchasers
and the members of the Seller Group and their Affiliates shall report, act
and file Tax Returns in all respects and for all Tax purposes consistently
with the Allocation.



(b) As soon as practicable after the Closing Date, Itron (on behalf of itself
and the other Purchasers) shall prepare an allocation of that portion of the

the Transferred Assets (the " _Section 1060 Allocation_ ") in accordance with
Section 1060 of the Code and any similar provision of Law, as applicable.
Itron (on behalf of itself and the other Purchasers) shall deliver the Section
1060 Allocation to each member of the Non-U.S. Seller Group not later than 60
days after the Closing Date. The Non-U.S. Seller Group and Itron shall then
cooperate in good faith to revise and finalize the Section 1060 Allocation. If
the Non-U.S. Seller Group and Itron are unable to agree on the Section 1060
Allocation within 90 days after the Closing Date, they shall select an
Independent Accounting Firm to determine the Section 1060 Allocation,
_provided_ that the Independent Accounting Firm shall take into account the
facts, information and documentation used by each party to prepare its
Section 1060 Allocation and the strength of the factual and legal arguments
made by each party in support thereof and shall specifically comment on such
evidence and arguments in rendering its determination. The cost of any such
firm shall be borne equally by the Non-U.S. Seller Group and Itron. The
Non-U.S. Seller Group, Itron and their Affiliates shall report, act and file
Tax Returns (including (when required), but not limited to, IRS Forms 8594)
in all respects and for all Tax purposes consistently with the Section 1060
Allocation. The Non-U.S. Seller Group, Itron and their Affiliates shall each
cooperate fully with each other and make available to each other,
respectively, such Tax data and other information as may be reasonably
required in order to timely complete the Section 1060 Allocation and any other
required statements or Schedules. Except as required pursuant to applicable
Law or a determination (as defined in Section 1313 of the Code or any similar
provision of Law), the Non-U.S. Seller Group, Itron and their Affiliates shall
not take any Tax position that is inconsistent with the Section 1060
Allocation.



(c) As soon as practicable after the Closing Date, Itron shall prepare
an allocation of the deemed sale price of the assets of the Company resulting
from the Section 338(h)(10) Elections (the " _Section 338 Allocation_ ") among
the assets of the Company (including a specific allocation to the capital
stock of New SLB Mexico and further allocation thereof among the assets of
New SLB Mexico) in accordance with Section 338 of the Code and any similar
provision of Law, as applicable. Itron shall deliver the Section 338
Allocation to STC within 60 days after the Closing Date. STC and Itron shall
then cooperate in good faith to revise and finalize the Section 338
Allocation. If STC and Itron are unable to agree on the Section 338 Allocation
within 90 days after the Closing Date, they shall select an Independent
Accounting Firm to determine the Section 338 Allocation, _provided_ that the
Independent



 

18 Accounting Firm shall take into account the facts, information and
documentation used by each party to prepare its Section 338 Allocation and
the strength of the factual and legal arguments made by each party in support
thereof and shall specifically comment on such evidence and arguments in
rendering its determination. The cost of any such firm shall be borne equally
by STC and Itron. STC, Itron and their Affiliates shall report, act and file
Tax Returns (including, but not limited to, IRS Form 8883) in all respects and
for all Tax purposes consistently with the Section 338 Allocation and with
Section 5.19 of this Agreement. STC, Itron and their Affiliates shall each
cooperate fully with each other and make available to each other,
respectively, such Tax data and other information as may be reasonably
required in order to timely complete the Section 338 Allocation and file any
Section 338(h)(10) Elections and any other required statements or Schedules.
Except as required pursuant to applicable Law or a determination (as defined
in Section 1313 of the Code or any similar provision of Law), the Purchaser,
STC and their Affiliates shall not take any Tax position that is inconsistent
with the Section 338 Allocation.



(d) The Purchasers shall deliver the Purchase Price to the Seller Group on the
Closing Date by wire transfer of immediately available funds to such account
or accounts as the Seller Group may direct. The Purchase Price shall be paid
against delivery of (i) stock certificates representing the Stock being sold,
in proper form and duly endorsed for transfer and (ii) duly executed Bills of
Sale and Assumption Agreements for the Transferred Assets and Assumed
Liabilities, in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A, subject only to
specific changes which may be necessary or required under applicable Laws to

Assets and Assumed Liabilities of Schlumberger France shall be payable in

"Money and Investing" section of the Wall Street Journal on the date that is
two Business Days prior to the Closing Date. The portion of the Purchase Price
payable with respect to the Transferred Assets and Assumed Liabilities of
Schlumberger Canada shall be payable in Canadian dollars, as converted from

section of the Wall Street Journal on the date that is two Business Days prior
to the Closing Date.



2.4 _Closing Date_. The consummation (the " _Closing_ ") of the Transaction
shall take place at the offices of Gibson, Dunn and Crutcher LLP, 200 Park
Avenue, New York, New York 10166 at 12:01 a.m. (local time) on July 1, 2004 or
on such other date and time as STC and the Purchasers shall mutually agree
(the date on which the Closing takes place, the " _Closing Date_ ");
_provided_ , _however_ , that the closing of the Taiwan Stock Sale and the
Asset Sale shall occur at the offices of Schlumberger B.V., Parkstraat 83,
2514 JG, The Hague, The Netherlands.



2.5 _Post-Closing Adjustment to Purchase Price_. The Purchase Price shall be
subject to adjustment, if any, after the Closing Date as specified in this
Section 2.5.



(a) As soon as practicable, but in any event within 60 days following the
Closing Date, Itron shall prepare and deliver to STC (i) a combined balance
sheet of the Business as of the Closing Date prepared in a manner consistent
with past practices of the Business and as set forth on Exhibit 2.5 (the "
_Closing Balance Sheet_ "); (ii) the Adjusted Balance Sheet; and (iii) a



 

19 certificate based on such Adjusted Balance Sheet setting forth Itrons
calculation of the Closing Net Working Capital, as prepared in accordance
with the provisions set forth on Exhibit 2.5 (the " _Certificate_ "). The
Seller Group and Itron shall mutually cooperate and assist each other in order
to prepare the Closing Balance Sheet and Adjusted Balance Sheet.



(b) If the Closing Net Working Capital is less than the Base Period Net
Working Capital, then within 45 days of delivery of the Certificate, STC (on
behalf of itself and the other members of the Seller Group) shall pay, or
cause another member of the Seller Group to pay, by wire transfer in
immediately available funds to the Purchasers (as directed by Itron on behalf
of itself and the other Purchasers) as a downward adjustment to the Purchase
Price, the amount equal to the excess of (i) the Base Period Net Working
Capital over (ii) the Closing Net Working Capital. If the Closing Net Working
Capital is greater than the Base Period Net Working Capital, then within 45
days of delivery of the Certificate, Itron (on behalf of itself and the other
Purchasers) shall pay by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the
members of the Seller Group (as directed by STC on behalf of itself and the
other members of the Seller Group) as an upward adjustment to the Purchase
Price, the amount equal to the excess of (x) the Closing Net Working Capital
over (y) the Base Period Net Working Capital.



(c) The Seller Group may dispute any amounts reflected on the Adjusted Balance
Sheet; _provided_ , _however_ , that STC shall have notified Itron in writing
of each disputed item specifying the amount thereof in dispute, the
calculation of the disputed amount and setting forth, in reasonable detail,
the basis for such dispute, within 45 days of STCs receipt of the Adjusted
Balance Sheet and the Certificate. To the extent STC shall not have
notified Itron in writing by such time of any disputed amount reflected on
the Closing Balance Sheet, STC shall be deemed to have agreed with all items
and amounts contained in the Closing Balance Sheet and Itrons calculation of
the Closing Net Working Capital. In the event of a dispute, Itron and STC
shall attempt in good faith to reconcile their differences. If Itron and STC
are unable to reach a resolution within 30 Business Days after receipt by
Itron of STCs written notice of dispute, Itron and STC shall submit the
items remaining in dispute for resolution by an Independent Accounting Firm,
to whom Itron and STC, respectively, shall submit the items remaining in
dispute for resolution. The Independent Accounting Firm shall be instructed
to resolve, within 30 Business Days of such submission, such remaining
disputed items. The report of the Independent Accounting Firm shall be final,
conclusive and binding on Itron, STC and their Affiliates. The fees and
expenses of the Independent Accounting Firm shall be allocated to Itron and
STC in proportion to the amount unsuccessfully disputed by such party out of
the aggregate disputed amount submitted to the Independent Accounting Firm.
Itron and STC shall pay the costs and expenses of their own accountants and
attorneys.



(d) Itron (on behalf of itself and the other Purchasers), STC, BVI and each
member of the Non-U.S. Seller Group, as appropriate, shall cooperate to
prepare an adjusted Allocation, an adjusted Section 338 Allocation and an
adjusted Section 1060 Allocation to reflect any adjustments to the Purchase
Price made pursuant to Section 2.5(b). If, on the one hand, the payment of the
adjusted Purchase Price pursuant to Section 2.5(b) occurs after the
finalization or determination of an allocation under Section 2.3, then the
parties shall have 15 days from the date of such payment to agree upon the
corresponding adjusted allocation required by this Section 2.5(d). If, on the
other hand, the payment of the adjusted Purchase Price pursuant to Section
2.5(b) occurs before the finalization or determination of an allocation under
Section 2.3,



 

20 then the parties (i) shall not prepare a separate corresponding adjusted
allocation under this Section 2.5(d), (ii) shall instead take into account
such adjusted Purchase Price in such original allocation under Section 2.3 and
(iii) shall have an additional 15 days beyond the date specified in Section
2.3 to agree upon such allocation. If the parties are unable to agree on any
of the adjusted allocations within the above specified periods, they shall
select an Independent Accounting Firm to determine any such disputed
allocation, _provided_ that the Independent Accounting Firm shall take into
account the facts, information and documentation used by each party to
prepare its version of such disputed allocation and the strength of the
factual and legal arguments made by each party in support thereof and shall
specifically comment on such evidence and arguments in rendering its
determination.

waivers, approvals, authorizations or orders from, or make all registrations,
declarations or filings with and give all notices to all Governmental Bodies
or any other Person required by the Purchasers to consummate the transactions

respect to its assets or the assets of any of their respective Subsidiaries or

however, that the Purchasers will not be required to take any action that
would result in a material adverse effect on the Purchasers and their
Affiliates or Subsidiaries (including any Affiliates or Subsidiaries that
become Affiliates or Subsidiaries on or after the Closing Date), taken as a
whole.



 

49 5.7 _Public Announcements_. On and after the date hereof and through the
Closing Date, the Seller Group and the Purchasers shall consult with each
other before issuing any press releases or otherwise making any public
statements with respect to this Agreement or the Transaction contemplated
hereby, and none of the parties shall issue any press release or make any
public statement prior to obtaining the written approval of the other parties,
which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, except that no
such approval shall be necessary to the extent disclosure may be required by
law or applicable stock exchange rule or any listing agreement of any party
hereto.



5.8 _Employees_. (a) The parties hereto intend that there will be continuity
of employment with respect to all Eligible Employees who become Transferred
Employees. Accordingly, the employment of all of the employees of the Business
(other than those employees who are not actively at work on the Closing Date
due to short-term or long-term disability leave), including, without
limitation, those named on Exhibit B who are employed by the Company, New SLB
Mexico or a member of the Seller Group in connection with the Business
immediately prior to the Closing (the " _Eligible Employees_ "), shall either
be automatically transferred to and continued by the Purchasers (where
applicable law provides for an automatic transfer of employees upon the sale
of the stock of an employer or the transfer of assets or of a business as a
going concern), or the Purchasers shall offer employment to commence as of
the Closing Date to all of the Eligible Employees. The Company, New SLB Mexico
and the Seller Group shall take all steps necessary to transfer employees of
the Business who are not Eligible Employees (including, without limitation,
those on short-term or long-term disability leave) to STC or another ERISA
Affiliate prior to the Closing Date in such a way as to assure that such
employees will not lose any of the employee benefits to which they are
entitled immediately prior to such transfer. In the event any such employee
becomes capable of returning to active employment in their prior position (as
determined in accordance with the terms of the Seller Groups disability plan)
within six months after the Closing Date, the Company or the Purchasers shall
offer employment to such employee, commencing on the date such employee is
capable of returning to active employment upon terms no less favorable than
would have been offered to such individual had he been a Transferred Employee
as of the Closing Date, and, upon acceptance of such offer and commencement of
such employment, such employee shall become a Transferred Employee (provided
such commencement occurs within six months after the Closing Date).
Purchasers agree to provide an appropriate liaison to work with the Seller
Groups disability plan administrator regarding plan administration issues.
The Purchasers shall reimburse STC for all reasonable expenses incurred by
STC to provide employee benefits, including short-term disability payments and
health benefits, after the Closing Date to any such transferred employee who
is on short-term disability leave as of the Closing Date for so long as
such employee remains on short-term disability leave. Notwithstanding the
first sentence of this Section 5.8(a), the Purchasers agree that certain
Eligible Employees, who participate in, and meet the requirements to begin
receiving an immediate early or normal retirement pension from, the
Schlumberger Technology Corporation Pension Plan and whose employment would
otherwise be automatically transferred or continued, may retire the day
immediately prior to the Closing Date, and the Purchasers shall offer
employment to such Eligible Employees to commence as of the Closing Date.
Those Eligible Employees who either transfer and continue employment or accept
the Purchasers offer of employment and commence working with the Purchasers
on the Closing Date shall hereafter be referred to as " _Transferred
Employees_ ". To the extent Transferred Employees are covered by a



 

50 collective bargaining agreement, the Purchasers shall assume such agreement,
become the successor employer thereunder, comply with the terms and
conditions thereof, and be solely responsible for all obligations thereunder
with respect to the Transferred Employees on or after the Closing Date;
provided, however, that the Seller Group shall be responsible for, and shall
indemnify, release and hold harmless the Company and the Purchasers from and
against, any Damages arising as a result of, or relating to, any breach by any
member of the Seller Group or the Company of any collective bargaining
agreement prior to the Closing. For a period of not less than twelve (12)
months beginning on the Closing Date, the Company or the Purchasers shall
provide to each Transferred Employee who is not covered by a collective
bargaining agreement, compensation and employee benefits that are not
materially less favorable, in the aggregate, than those provided to such
Transferred Employee by the Company or the Non-U.S. Affiliates immediately
prior to the Closing Date, excluding retiree medical, retiree life insurance
and defined benefit pension benefits. The Seller Group agrees that the Company
and the Purchasers shall have satisfied the requirements of the preceding
sentence with respect to employee benefits, if Transferred Employees are
eligible to participate in the plans identified in _Schedule 5.8(a)_ under
terms that are not less favorable than those provided to similarly situated
employees of the Purchasers; provided, however, that eligibility to
participate in such plans shall not be deemed to be the only method by which
the Company and the Purchasers can satisfy such requirements. To the extent
length of service is relevant for purposes of eligibility and vesting (but not
benefit accrual) under any employee benefit plan, program, policy or
arrangement of the Company or the Purchasers extended to Transferred Employees
(and for purposes of determining vacation, sick leave and severance),
Transferred Employees shall receive credit for their service with the Company
and its ERISA Affiliates prior to the Closing Date. With respect to each
"employee welfare benefit plan," as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA, extended
to Transferred Employees by the Company or the Purchasers, the Purchasers
shall (i) waive any pre-existing condition limitations and exclusions with
respect to each Transferred Employee and his or her eligible spouse and
dependents to the extent that the Transferred Employee and his or her eligible
spouse and dependents are covered, immediately prior to the Closing Date,
with respect to such condition under a similar Employee Plan, and (ii)
recognize for purposes of annual deductible and out-of-pocket limits any
deductible and out-of-pocket expenses paid by Transferred Employees and their
spouses and dependants under similar Employee Plans during the calendar year
in which the Closing Date occurs. The Purchasers shall cause their respective
health plan(s) to be responsible (subject to and in accordance with the terms
of the applicable plan) for all health benefit claims incurred by Transferred
Employees and their covered dependants on and after the Closing Date while the
Company shall cause its respective health plans(s) to be responsible (subject
to and in accordance with the terms of the applicable plan) for all health
benefit claims incurred by Transferred Employees and their covered dependents
prior to the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to
Transferred Employees located in Canada, France, Taiwan, or Mexico, to the
extent necessary under local legislation or labor law requirements to avoid
any liability of the Seller Group to Transferred Employees, the Purchasers
shall maintain salaries, wages, bonus, incentive and other terms and
conditions of employment and shall also offer at least equivalent employee
benefits on an individual per employee basis (and not just in the aggregate),
including, without limitation, taking into account each such employees total
retirement benefits had they remained in the Seller Groups retirement plans.
If, within the twelve (12) month period following the Closing Date, the
Purchasers terminate any Transferred Employee without cause, the Purchasers
shall provide severance pay



 

51 to such Transferred Employee equal to the greater of the severance pay that
such employee would have been entitled to, taking into account service with
both the Purchasers and the Seller Group and their Affiliates and applicable
law, under either (i) the Companys severance plan covering such Transferred
Employee immediately prior to the Closing or (ii) the Purchasers severance
plan covering such Transferred Employee at the time of his or her termination.



(b) (i) Effective as of the close of business on the date immediately
preceding the Closing Date, all Eligible Employees shall be 100% vested in
their benefits under each Employee Plan that is an "employee pension benefit
plan" as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA, and STC shall take all actions
necessary to accomplish such vesting.



(ii) On the Closing Date, the Seller Group shall transfer to the Purchasers
(or such other person(s) as the Purchasers may designate) (A) the health care
spending accounts and the dependent care spending accounts of all Transferred
Employees under the Schlumberger Cafeteria, Health Care Spending Account
and Dependent Care Spending Account Plan (such plan is referred to
hereinafter as the " _Schlumberger Cafeteria Plan_ " and such accounts are
referred to hereinafter, collectively, as the " _FSAs_ ") and the Purchasers
shall assume all liabilities related thereto, subject to the truth of the
Seller Groups representations and warranties under Article III and the Seller
Groups proper performance of its obligations under this paragraph (ii), and
(B) a cash payment equal to the amount by which the aggregate salary
reductions (and other contributions) made for 2004 by Transferred Employees
under the FSAs on or before the Closing Date exceed the aggregate claims for
2004 paid to Transferred Employees under the FSAs on or before the Closing
Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that to the extent the aggregate salary
reductions (and other contributions) made for 2004 by Transferred Employees
under the FSAs on or before the Closing Date are exceeded by the aggregate
claims for 2004 paid to Transferred Employees under the FSAs on or before the
Closing Date (the " _FSA Deficit_ "), Purchasers shall transfer to the Seller
Group a cash payment equal to the FSA Deficit. Within a reasonable period of
time after the signing of this Agreement (and, in any event, prior to the
Closing Date), the Seller Group shall provide to the Purchasers copies of the
2004 Schlumberger Cafeteria Plan elections of all Eligible Employees. At or
before the Closing, the Seller Group shall provide the Purchasers with the
calculation of the amount to be transferred pursuant to clause (B) above.



(iii) The Purchasers shall establish (or, if previously established, continue
to maintain) a U.S. tax qualified 401(k) plan (" _Purchaser 401(k) Plan_ "),
and all U.S. based Transferred Employees shall be eligible to participate in
Purchaser 401(k) Plan effective as of the Closing Date. Subject to the last
sentence of this paragraph (iii), as soon as practicable following the
Closing Date and the contribution of the prorated discretionary employer
contribution for 2004 (but in no event later than April 1, 2005), the Seller
Groups 401(k) Plan shall transfer to the Purchaser 401(k) Plan (i) the
obligation for benefit payments to Transferred Employees under the Seller
Groups 401(k) Plan and (ii) an amount of assets, in cash or kind, as agreed
to by STC and Itron, equal to the aggregate account balances of the
Transferred Employees under the Seller Groups 401(k) Plan, determined as of
a valuation date agreed to by STC and Itron; _provided_ , _however_ , that to
the extent a Transferred Employees account balance consists in whole or in
part of an outstanding loan, the Seller Groups 401(k) Plan trustee shall



 

52 transfer and assign to the Purchaser 401(k) Plan trustee, and the Purchaser
401(k) Plan trustee shall accept and assume in lieu of cash, the promissory
notes and related documents evidencing such loan. The Purchaser 401(k) Plan
shall, both at the time of its adoption and when the transfers described
herein are made, (i) be tax-qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code, (ii)
preserve all optional forms of benefits and other rights within the scope of
Section 411(d)(6) of the Code to the extent required by such Code Section, and
(iii) meet all the requirements of Section 401(k) of the Code with respect to
amounts being transferred hereunder which originally were contributed pursuant
to a qualified cash or deferred arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Code.
Notwithstanding anything contained herein, STC shall not be required
to transfer any amounts from the Seller Groups 401(k) Plan to the Purchaser
401(k) Plan until Itron delivers to STC a copy of (A) a favorable
determination letter issued by the IRS with respect to the Purchaser 401(k)
Plan or (B) assurances satisfactory to STC that Itron will timely request a
favorable determination letter from the IRS and make any and all amendments as
may be required by the IRS to receive such determination letter. In no event
shall any obligation to make benefit payments be transferred from the Seller
Groups 401(k) Plan to the Purchaser 401(k) Plan prior to the transfer to the
Purchaser 401(k) Plan of all assets related to such obligation. As soon as
practicable following the date hereof, the Seller Groups 401(k) Plan shall
be amended to eliminate all distribution options for Transferred Employees
other than a lump sum option, and such amendment will be effective as soon as
allowed by applicable regulations, but in no event earlier than the Closing
Date. No assets or obligation to make benefit payments shall be transferred
from the Seller Groups 401(k) Plan to the Purchaser 401(k) Plan until such
elimination is effective.



(iv) As of the Closing Date, the Purchasers shall assume, honor and be
responsible for any accrued but unused vacation time up to 240 hours per
Transferred Employee (or, solely with respect to employees of the Non-U.S.
Business, any additional amount required by Law) to which any Transferred
Employee is entitled pursuant to the vacation policy applicable to such
employee immediately prior to the Closing Date, and, with respect to employees
in the United States, the Seller Group shall promptly reimburse the Company,
the Joint Venture and the Purchasers for any and all expenses, costs or
liabilities incurred by any of them with respect to unused vacation in excess
of 240 hours per Transferred Employee, including, without limitation, any
amounts paid to a Transferred Employee to cash-out such excess. The Closing
Balance Sheet shall be adjusted to reflect STCs payment of vacation amounts
in excess of 240 hours per employee. The Purchasers shall allow such
Transferred Employee to use such accrued vacation, which shall
be nonforfeitable, in accordance with the Purchasers vacation policy
applicable to similarly situated employees of Purchaser; _provided_ , that the
Purchasers shall be liable for and pay in cash an amount equal to the value of
any remaining accrued vacation time to any Transferred Employee upon such
employees termination of employment with the Company and the Purchasers.



(c) The Seller Group shall make reasonably available to the Purchasers such
actuarial, financial, personnel and related information as may be
reasonably requested by the Purchasers with respect to any Employee Plan as
it relates to a Transferred Employee, including but not limited to,
compensation and employment histories. In addition, the Seller Group shall



 

53 give the Purchasers reasonable access to Eligible Employees after the signing
of this Agreement, and prior to the Closing Date, for purposes of
facilitating the Purchasers obligations under this Section 5.8 or as
Purchaser may deem necessary to ensure the orderly transition of the
workforce.



(d) The terms of this Section 5.8 shall continue in full force and be binding
upon any purchaser, successor, or assign of the Purchasers or any of their
respective businesses or assets, and the Purchasers shall make proper
provision such that any such purchaser, successor, or assign shall expressly
agree to assume and honor the Purchasers obligations under this Section 5.8.



(e) Without limiting the generality of any other provision of this Agreement,
the Purchasers shall defend, indemnify and hold the Seller Group harmless from
and against any and all liability, damages, costs and expenses (including,
without limitation, court costs and attorneys fees) the Seller Group may
incur in connection with any constructive or wrongful termination or dismissal
claim asserted by any employee of the Business located in Canada, France or
Mexico relating to or arising in connection with any act or omission of
the Purchasers, including, without limitation, (a) the Purchasers not
offering any such Canadian, French or Mexican employee employment on
substantially the same terms and conditions (including location) as such
employees employment terms and conditions with the Seller Group, (b) the
Purchasers not complying or continuing to comply with the provisions of this
Section 5.8 or (c) any liability to make payment of pension or other benefits
accrued by Transferred Employees after the Closing Date, but excluding
severance obligations that arise as a matter of law solely as a result of the
consummation of the Transaction (but not as a result of Purchasers breach of
their obligations under this Section 5.8), which severance obligations are to
be shared with the Seller Group as described in the second sentence of Section
5.8(g) below.



(f) Purchasers shall be responsible for and shall indemnify and hold harmless
the Seller Group from and against any Damages related to severance costs
of any kind associated with the termination or constructive termination of a
Transferred Employees employment on or after the Closing Date. Purchasers and
the Seller Group agree to share equally severance costs incurred as a result
of the severance obligations with respect to Transferred Employees that arise
as a matter of Law solely as a result of the consummation of the Transaction
(but not as a result of Purchasers failure to offer equivalent benefits or
Purchasers breach of their obligations under this Section 5.8, as described
in Section 5.8(f) above).



(g) The employment agreements of the Transferred Employees of Schlumberger
France being automatically transferred pursuant to Article L 122-12 of the
French Labor Code, Itron France shall be subrogated in all obligations of
Schlumberger France under any contract, undertaking or any other agreement
whatsoever regarding the Transferred Employees of Schlumberger France entered
into with Schlumberger France prior to the Closing Date.



(h) STC shall retain all obligations and Liabilities related to, the
Sangamo Electric Company Retirement Wage Plan (the " _Sangamo Plan_ "). The
Closing Balance Sheet shall be adjusted to reflect the Seller Groups
assumption of liability for the Sangamo Plan pursuant to Exhibit 2.5. The
Seller Group shall indemnify, hold harmless and defend the



 

54 Company and the Purchaser Indemnified Parties from and against any and all
Damages and obligations incurred, directly or indirectly, by any of them in
connection with the Sangamo Plan. This indemnity shall be in addition to, and
not in lieu of, any indemnity the Company or the Purchaser Indemnified Parties
may have under Article VII hereof or any other provision of this Agreement,
shall not be subject to any of the limitations set forth in Section 7.1(c)(i)
hereof, and shall survive the Closing indefinitely.



(i) The parties acknowledge that, following the Closing, the Company or the
Purchasers may terminate the employment of or, subject to the constraints
set forth in this Section 5.8, change the place of work, responsibilities,
status, compensation, employee benefits or description of, any employee or
group of employees, including, without limitation, any Transferred Employee,
at any time.

 



(j) The parties acknowledge that for the period beginning on the Closing Date
and ending on July 4, 2004, the Transferred Employees who are paid bi-weekly
on an hourly basis shall remain on the payroll (but not benefits) of the
Seller Group. The Purchasers shall promptly reimburse the Seller Group for any
and all amounts paid or attributable to the Transferred Employees during such
period. All other Transferred Employees shall terminate on the payroll and the
benefits of the Seller Group on the Closing Date.



(k) The parties acknowledge that following Closing and during the month
of July 2004, the Purchasers shall pay all retention bonuses and all amounts
pro-rated up to June 30, 2004 under the Management Incentive Plan maintained
by Seller Group with respect to the Transferred Employees at the time and in
accordance with the terms of the plans governing such payments. Upon
notification by the Purchasers that all such payments have been properly made,
Seller Group shall, as soon as practicable, reimburse the Purchasers any and
all such amounts paid on its behalf 



5.9 _Taxes of Non-U.S. Seller Group_. Subject to the provisions of Section
5.14, the Non-U.S. Seller Group shall pay all Taxes (excluding any Taxes
reflected on the Adjusted Balance Sheet pursuant to paragraph 3(g) of Exhibit
2.5) as levied by any jurisdiction with respect to the ownership, use
or operation of the Transferred Assets prior to the Closing Date and the
Purchasers or their Affiliates shall pay all such Taxes with respect to
ownership, use or operation of the Transferred Assets after the Closing Date.



5.10 _Tax Returns_. (a) Itron shall cause the Company to consent to join, for
all taxable periods ending before the Closing Date for which it is eligible to
do so, in all consolidated, combined, or unitary Tax Returns of or including
STC or its other Affiliates that STC requests it to join. STC shall prepare
and timely file or cause to be prepared and timely filed all such
consolidated, combined, or unitary Tax Returns of the Company and all other
Tax Returns of the Company and New SLB Mexico required to be filed prior to
the Closing Date, and shall pay or cause to be paid all Taxes to which such
Tax Returns relate for all periods covered by such Tax Returns. Holdings shall
cause the Joint Venture to prepare and timely file and/or join in all such
consolidated, combined, or unitary Tax Returns of the Joint Venture and all
other Tax Returns of the Joint Venture required to be filed prior to the
Closing Date, and shall pay or cause to be paid all Taxes to which such Tax
Returns relate for all periods covered by such Tax Returns.



 

55 (b) Itron shall prepare and timely file or caused to be prepared and timely
filed all Tax Returns of the Company, New SLB Mexico and the Joint Venture
(other than consolidated, combined, or unitary Tax Returns) for all periods
ending prior to the Closing Date that are required to be filed after the
Closing Date and all periods that begin before the Closing Date and end after
the Closing Date. Not later than five (5) days before the due date for the
payment of Taxes with respect to any such Tax Returns, STC (in the case of a
Company or New SLB Mexico Tax Return) or Holdings (in the case of a Joint
Venture Tax Return) shall pay or cause to be paid to Itron (on behalf of
itself and the other Purchasers) the amount of Tax due on such Tax Returns
which is properly allocable to periods ending prior to the Closing Date and
which has not been reflected on the Adjusted Balance Sheet pursuant to
paragraph 3(g) of Exhibit 2.5.



(c) From and after the Closing Date, STC and Holdings, on the one hand, and
the Purchasers, on the other hand, shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent
reasonably requested by the other party, in connection with the preparation
and filing of Tax Returns.



(d) The Seller Group and the Purchasers shall file their respective income
tax returns in accordance with Section 2.3.



(e) For purposes of this Agreement (including, without limitation, Sections
5.9 and 7.3), Taxes shall be computed based on the closing of the books
method as of the end of the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i)
exemptions, allowances and deductions (such as depreciation deductions)
allowed in a period beginning before and ending on or after the Closing Date
and which are calculated on an annual basis shall be prorated on a per diem
basis, (ii) Taxes resulting from any act (other than the Section 338(h)(10)
Elections), transaction or omission of the Purchasers, the Company or the
Joint Venture that occurs after the Closing and which is not in the ordinary
course of business shall be allocated to a period beginning after the Closing
Date, and (iii) in the case of any Tax imposed upon the ownership, use,
operation or holding of real or personal property, such Taxes shall be
prorated based upon the number of days of such period included in the pre-
Closing Tax period (which period shall include the Closing Date) and the
number of days of such Tax period after the Closing Date.



5.11 _Tax Contests_. (a) With respect to any audit, court proceeding or other
dispute with respect to any Tax matter (each a " _Tax Contest_ ") that (i)
arises in a consolidated, combined or unitary Tax Return that includes a

under Section 7.1(a)(i)(A) or (B), Section 7.1(a)(ii)(A) or (B) or Section 7.3
unless a claim for indemnification is made on or before the expiration of the
time period for survival set forth in Section 8.8. Damages to the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties will be (x) decreased by any insurance proceeds
received by the Purchaser Indemnified Parties (after deduction of costs and
expenses incurred in connection with recovery of such proceeds) with respect
to such Damages and any net tax benefit realized, directly or indirectly, by
the Purchaser Indemnified Parties arising from the incurrence of such Damages,
and (y) increased by any net tax cost incurred, directly or indirectly, by the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties arising from the receipt or accrual of payments
under this Article VII (including any tax resulting from payments under this
Section 7.1(c)(i)(A)). In computing the amount of any such net tax benefit or
net tax cost, the Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall be treated as
recognizing all other items of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit that
arose prior to the incurrence of Damages (including, without limitation, any
net operating loss, capital loss or tax credit carryovers) before recognizing
any item arising from the incurrence of Damages or the receipt or accrual of
any payment hereunder. Any Damages to the Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall
initially be made without regard to this Section 7.1(c)(i)(A) and shall be
decreased or increased to reflect any such net tax benefit or net tax cost
(including gross-up) only after the Purchaser Indemnified Parties have
actually realized such tax benefit or tax cost. The Purchaser Indemnified
Parties shall be deemed to actually realize net tax benefits or net tax costs
at the time at which the amount of taxes payable by the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties is reduced below or



 

67 increased above, as the case may be, the amount of taxes that the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties would be required to pay (determined in accordance with
this Section 7.1(c)(i)(A)) but for the incurrence of Damages or the receipt or
accrual of payment or payments hereunder, in each case at the highest marginal
federal income tax rate in effect for such year, and at the average state
income tax rate applicable to the Purchaser Indemnified Parties for such year,
taking into account, if applicable, the deductibility of state income taxes
for federal income tax purposes. The Purchasers hereby waive on behalf of
themselves and the other Purchaser Indemnified Parties, to the extent
permitted under their applicable insurance policies, any subrogation rights
that their insurers may have with respect to any indemnified Damages.



(B) Except for claims for Damages relating to breaches of the representations
and warranties contained in Section 3.11(d) and Section 3.11(1), the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to recover any amount under Section
7. 1(a)(i)(A) or Section 7.1(a)(ii)(A) of this Agreement or under Section 4
of the Supplemental Agreement unless and until the aggregate amount of all
claims made pursuant to such sections exceeds $2,000,000.00 (the " _Basket_
"), in which event the entire amount in respect of such claims will
be payable.



(C) Except for claims for Damages relating to breaches of the representations
and warranties contained in Section 3.1, 3.2 or 3.3(a), the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to recover an amount in excess of
$30,000,000.00 (the " _Cap_ ") in the aggregate for all claims made pursuant
to Section 7.1(a)(i)(A) and Section 7.1(a)(ii)(A) of this Agreement and
Section 4 of the Supplemental Agreement.



(ii) _Seller Indemnified Parties_.



(A) The Seller Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to any recovery under
Section 7.1(b)(i) or (ii) unless a claim for indemnification is made on or
before the expiration of the time period for survival set forth in Section
8.8. Damages to the Seller Indemnified Parties will be decreased by any
insurance proceeds received by the Seller Indemnified Parties
(after deduction of costs and expenses incurred in connection with recovery
of such proceeds) with respect to such Damages and any net tax benefit
realized, directly or indirectly, by the Seller Indemnified Parties arising
from the incurrence of such Damages, and (y) increased by any net tax cost
incurred, directly or indirectly, by the Seller Indemnified Parties arising
from the receipt or accrual of payments under this Article VII (including any
tax resulting from payments under this Section 7.1(c)(ii)(A)). In computing
the amount of any such net tax benefit or net tax cost, the Seller Indemnified
Parties shall be treated as recognizing all other items of income, gain, loss,
deduction or credit that arose prior to the incurrence of Damages (including,
without limitation, any net operating loss, capital loss or tax credit
carryovers) before recognizing any item arising from the incurrence of Damages
or the receipt or accrual of any payment hereunder. Any Damages to

 



 

68 the Seller Indemnified Parties shall initially be made without regard to this
Section 7.1(c)(ii)(A) and shall be decreased or increased to reflect any such
net tax benefit or net tax cost (including gross-up) only after the Seller
Indemnified Parties have actually realized such tax benefit or tax cost. The
Seller Indemnified Parties shall be deemed to actually realize net tax
benefits or net tax costs at the time at which the amount of taxes payable by
the Seller Indemnified Parties is reduced below or increased above, as the
case may be, the amount of taxes that the Seller Indemnified Parties would be
required to pay (determined in accordance with this Section 7.1(c)(ii)(A)) but
for the incurrence of Damages or the receipt or accrual of payment or payments
hereunder, in each case at the highest marginal federal income tax rate in
effect for such year, and at the average state income tax rate applicable to
the Seller Indemnified Parties for such year, taking into account, if
applicable, the deductibility of state income taxes for federal income tax
purposes. STC hereby waives on behalf of itself and the other Seller
Indemnified Parties, to the extent permitted under its applicable insurance
policies, any subrogation rights that its insurer may have with respect to any
indemnified Damages.



(B) The Seller Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to recover any
amount under Section 7.1(b)(i) unless and until the aggregate amount of all
claims made pursuant to such sections exceeds $2,000,000.00, in which event
the entire amount in respect of such claims will be payable.



(C) Except for claims of breach of the representations and warranties in
Section 4.1 and 4.2(a), the Seller Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled
to recover an amount in excess of $25,000,000.00 in the aggregate for all
claims made pursuant to Section 7.1(b)(i).



(iii) _Scope of Liability_. Nothing under this Section 7.1(c) shall limit any
claim for indemnification for any award or judgment (whether by arbitration,
mediation or litigation) against any Indemnified Party resulting from Third
Party Claims against such Indemnified Party for special,
indirect, incidental, punitive or consequential damages. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, recovery for Direct Claims shall in no event include any special,
indirect, incidental, punitive or consequential damages whatsoever.



7.2 _Procedure_. (a) _Direct Claims_. Any claim by the Seller Indemnified
Parties or the Purchaser Indemnified Parties (any Seller Indemnified Party or
Purchaser Indemnified Party an " _Indemnified Party_ ") for indemnification
under Section 7.1 or Section 7.3 that is not a Third Party Claim (a " _Direct
Claim_ ") may be asserted by giving the Indemnitor notice in reasonable detail
of the facts giving rise to such Direct Claim and shall include the amount or
method of computation of the Direct Claim and a reference to the provision of
this Agreement upon which such claim is based. Any dispute between an
Indemnified Party and its applicable Indemnitor shall be governed by Section
8.5 hereof.



(b) _Third Party Claims_. (i) Promptly after receipt by an Indemnified Party
of notice of the commencement of any action or proceeding by a third party (a
" _Third Party Claim_ ") with respect to any matter for which indemnification
is permitted pursuant to Section 7.1 or



 

69 Section 7.3, the Indemnified Party will give timely notice thereof to the
Indemnitor setting forth such claim in reasonable detail, _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the failure of the Indemnified Party to notify the Indemnitor
will not relieve the Indemnitor of its obligations hereunder, except to the
extent that the Indemnitor demonstrates that the defense of such Third Party
Claim has been actually and materially prejudiced by the Indemnified Partys
failure to give such timely notice.



(ii) If a Third Party Claim is brought against an Indemnified Party and such
Indemnified Party gives notice to the Indemnitor of the commencement of such
Third Party Claim, the Indemnitor shall have twenty days after receipt of such
notice to undertake, conduct and control, through counsel of its own choosing
and its expense, the settlement or defense thereof, and the Indemnified Party
shall reasonably cooperate with it in connection therewith; _provided_ , that
(i) the Indemnified Party may participate in such settlement or defense
through counsel chosen by such Indemnified Party and paid at its own
expense;  _provided_ , _further_ , that if, in the opinion of counsel for
such Indemnified Party, there is a reasonable likelihood of a conflict of
interest between the Indemnitor and the Indemnified Party, the Indemnitor
shall be responsible for reasonable fees and expenses of one such counsel in
connection with the Indemnified Partys defense and (ii) the Indemnitor shall
not pay or settle any claim without the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed. If the Indemnitor does not notify the Indemnified Party within ten
(10) days after receipt of the Indemnified Partys notice of a claim of
indemnity hereunder that it elects to undertake the defense thereof, the
Indemnified Party shall have the right to (A) undertake, at Indemnitors cost,
risk and expense, the defense, compromise or settlement of the claim, but
shall not thereby waive any right to indemnity therefore pursuant to this
Agreement or (B) seek an immediate declaration of the Indemnified Partys
right to indemnification under Section 7.1 or Section 7.3, as applicable, and
if the Indemnified Party is successful in obtaining such declaration the
Indemnitor shall reimburse such Indemnified Party for the costs, fees and
expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), incurred in obtaining such
declaration.



(iii) The Indemnified Party and the Indemnitor agree to provide each other
with reasonable access during regular business hours to the properties, books
and records, employees and representatives of the other, as reasonably
necessary in connection with the preparation for an existing or anticipated
Third Party Claim and its obligations with respect thereto pursuant to this
Article VII.



(iv) The Indemnitor will pay the Indemnified Party promptly, and in any event
within fifteen (15) days after the earlier of (with respect to the claim as to
which the indemnity relates): (i) the entry of an appealable judgment against
the Indemnified Party and the expiration of the applicable appeal period;
(ii) the entry of a non-appealable judgment or final appellate decision
against the Indemnified Party; or (iii) the execution of a settlement
agreement.



(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of Section 5.11 shall apply
to Tax Contests to the extent inconsistent with the provisions of this
Section 7.2.



 

70 7.3 _Tax Indemnity_. (a) STC shall indemnify, hold harmless and defend the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties from and against any and all Damages incurred,
directly or indirectly, by the Purchasers, the Company or New SLB Mexico
arising out of or relating to:



(i) A breach of any representation or warranty made by STC in Section 3.6 of
this Agreement; or

 



(ii) Any Taxes (including any Taxes arising out of the Section 338(h)(10)
Elections, but excluding any Taxes reflected on the Adjusted Balance Sheet
pursuant to paragraph 3(g) of Exhibit 2.5) imposed on the Company (or any
predecessor thereof) or New SLB Mexico, or for which the Company (or
any predecessor thereof) or New SLB Mexico may be liable, for taxable periods
(or portions thereof) ending before the Closing Date.



(b) Holdings shall indemnify, hold harmless and defend the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties from and against any and all Damages incurred, directly
or indirectly, by the Purchasers and 51% of any and all Damages incurred,
directly or indirectly, by the Joint Venture arising out of or relating to:



(i) A breach of any representation or warranty made by Holdings in Section 3.6
of this Agreement;



(ii) Any Taxes (excluding any Taxes reflected on the Adjusted Balance Sheet
pursuant to paragraph 3(g) of Exhibit 2.5) imposed on the Joint Venture (or
any predecessor thereof), or for which the Joint Venture (or any predecessor
thereof) may be liable, for taxable periods (or portions thereof)
ending before the Closing Date; or



(iii) Any Taxes (excluding any Taxes reflected on the Adjusted Balance Sheet
pursuant to paragraph 3(g) of Exhibit 2.5) of the Non-U.S. Seller Group or any
Taxes levied with respect to the ownership, use or operation of the
Transferred Assets prior to the Closing Date.



(c) The Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to recover any
amount under this Section 7.3 unless or until (i) the aggregate of all unpaid
claims under this Section 7.3 equals or exceeds $50,000 or (ii) six months
have elapsed after the later of (x) the Closing Date and (y) the date of the
most recent payment of a claim under this Section 7.3.



7.4 _Mitigation; Exclusivity of Remedy_. (a) Prior to the assertion of any
claims for indemnification under this Article VII with respect to any breach
of a representation or warranty, a party seeking indemnification
shall utilize all commercially reasonable efforts, consistent with normal
practices and policies and good commercial practice, to mitigate any Damages.



(b) The remedies in this Article VII shall be the exclusive remedies of the
parties with respect to all disputes, controversies or claims arising out
of or relating to this Agreement or a breach hereof, except for the remedies
of specific performance, injunction and other equitable relief as specifically
set forth in this Agreement in connection with the failure of any party to
perform its agreements and covenants hereunder.



 

71 7.5 _Multiple Breaches From Same Facts_. For the avoidance of doubt, it is
agreed that if, on account of the same facts or circumstances, (i) a party is
entitled to indemnification under one or more of the provisions of this
Article VII and/or (ii) there is a breach of more than one representation,
warranty or covenant, such facts or circumstances shall give rise to
indemnification as provided by this Article VII, but shall not give rise to
indemnification more than once on account thereof.



 

7.6 _Other Limitations on Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement, the parties acknowledge and agree that if to the Knowledge
of the Purchasers on or prior to the Closing Date any inaccuracy exists with
respect to any representation or warranty of STC or Holdings contained in this
Agreement or breach exists in any covenant contained in this Agreement,
the Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall be deemed to have waived and released
any claim for Damages related thereto and the Purchaser Indemnified Parties,
their successors, assigns and Affiliates shall not be entitled to assert any
such claim hereunder. 



7.7 _Purchase Price Adjustments_. The Purchasers and the Seller Group shall
treat any amounts payable under this Article VII as an adjustment to the
Purchase Price in addition to any adjustment pursuant to Section 2.5.



7.8 _New SLB Mexico Indemnification_. Notwithstanding anything contained
herein to the contrary, neither STC, Holdings nor any of their Affiliates
shall indemnify or have any obligation to indemnify any Purchaser Indemnified
Party for any Damages incurred by the Purchaser Indemnified Parties, directly
or indirectly, relating to the formation, ownership or operation of New SLB
Mexico by any Purchaser Indemnified Parties prior to June 4, 2004.



ARTICLE VIII

_GENERAL PROVISIONS_



8.1 _Termination_. (a) This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to

(i) by mutual written consent of Itron (acting on behalf of itself and the
other Purchasers) and STC (acting on behalf of itself and the Company) and
Holdings (acting on behalf of itself and the Non-U.S. Seller Group);



(ii) by Itron (acting on behalf of itself and the other Purchasers) or the
Seller (acting on behalf of itself and the Company) and Holdings (acting on
behalf of itself and the Non-U.S. Seller Group), if (A) any court of competent
jurisdiction in the United States or other United States Governmental
Body shall have issued a final order, decree or ruling or taken any other
final action restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby and such order, decree, ruling or
other action is or shall have become final and nonappealable or (B) the
transactions contemplated hereby have not been consummated by July 14, 2004
(the " _Deadline Date_ " or the " _Extended Deadline Date_ "); _provided_ ,
that no party may terminate this Agreement pursuant to this clause (B) if
such partys failure to fulfill any of its obligations under this Agreement
shall have been the reason that the Closing Date shall not have occurred on or
before said date;



 

72 (iii) by STC (acting on behalf of itself and the Company) and Holdings (acting
on behalf of itself and the Non-U.S. Seller Group), if: (A) there shall have
been a material breach of any representation or warranty on the part of the
Purchasers set forth in this Agreement or if any representation or warranty of
the Purchasers shall have become untrue, in either case such that the
conditions set forth in Section 6.2 would be incapable of being satisfied by
Deadline Date or (B) there shall have been a material breach by the Purchasers
of any of their covenants or agreements hereunder, and the Purchasers have
not cured such breach within twenty (20) Business Days after notice by any
member of the Seller Group thereof; _provided_ that no member of the Seller
Group has breached any of its material obligations hereunder; or



(iv) by Itron (acting on behalf of itself and the other Purchasers) if (A)
there shall have been a material breach of any representation or warranty on
the part of the Seller Group set forth in this Agreement or if any
representation or warranty of STC or Holdings shall have become untrue in
either case such that the conditions set forth in Section 6.3 would be
incapable of being satisfied by the Deadline Date or (B) there shall have been
a breach by STC or Holdings of its covenants or agreements hereunder, and STC
or Holdings, as applicable, has not cured such breach within twenty (20)
Business Days after notice by the Purchaser thereof; _provided_ , that the
Purchasers have not breached any of their material obligations hereunder.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the conditions of the Purchasers to consummate
the Closing contained in Section 6.3 shall be deemed satisfied if STC or
Holdings delivers to Itron (on behalf of itself and the other Purchasers) a
certificate dated the Closing Date and signed by an authorized officer of STC
or Holdings, as applicable, setting forth any failure of any condition
contained in Section 6.2 and undertaking to indemnify the Purchasers with
respect to any and all damage, loss, liability and reasonable expense ("
_Condition Losses_ "); _provided_ _however_ , that the exception set forth in
this Section 8.1(a)(iv) shall apply only in the case where (A) the failure of
the applicable condition results in Condition Losses which are capable of
being adequately recompensed by the payment of money and (B) the amount of any
such Condition Losses, in the aggregate, does not exceed an amount equal to
$5,000,000. In the absence of fraud or willful misconduct on the part of
any member of the Seller Group or Holdings, or any of their respective
officers, directors, employees or agents in connection with the negotiation,
execution or delivery of this Agreement or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, the remedy contained in this Section
8.1(a)(iv) shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedy of the Purchasers
with respect to any failure of the conditions to the obligations of the
Purchasers to consummate the Closing contained in Section 6.3 to be satisfied
as of the Closing Date and, without limitation, the Purchasers shall have no
right to indemnification pursuant to Article VIII for any Condition Losses
incurred as a result of such breach or failure; _provided_ , that Itron
has consented to the payment of such Condition Loss and the amount of money
offered by STC therefor, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed, and STC has paid such amount to Itron.



(b) In the event of the termination and abandonment of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(a), this Agreement shall forthwith become
void and have no effect (except that the Confidentiality Agreement shall
remain in full force and effect) without any liability on the part of any
party hereto or its Affiliates, directors, officers or stockholders.



 

73 Nothing contained in this Section 8.1(b) shall relieve any party from
liability for any breach of this Agreement.

communications given shall be in writing and shall be given (and shall be
deemed to have been duly given upon receipt) by delivery in person, by

in this Agreement to the contrary, it is the explicit intent of each party
hereto that the Company, STC, Holdings, the Non-U.S. Seller Group and the
Purchasers are making no representation or warranty whatsoever, express or
implied, beyond those expressly given in this Agreement. The representations

The other covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement that

affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

Agreement shall be construed with and as an integral part of this Agreement to
the same extent as if the same had been set forth verbatim herein. To the
extent any information required to be furnished in any section of the Schedule
is contained in this Agreement or disclosed in any section of the Schedule,
such information shall be deemed to be included in all sections of the
Schedule in which the information is required to be included to the extent
that such disclosure is reasonably apparent on its face. The inclusion of any
information in any section of the Schedule shall not be deemed to be an
admission or acknowledgment by the Seller Group or Holdings, in and of
itself, that such information is required by the terms hereof to be disclosed
or is material to or outside the ordinary course of the business of the Seller
Group.



8.11 _Assignment_. This Agreement (including the exhibits and schedules), the

failure of any party to perform its agreements and covenants hereunder,
including its failure to take all actions as are necessary on its part for the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and the failure to
perform the covenants contained in Article V, will cause irreparable injury
to the other party, for which damages, even if available, will not be an
adequate remedy. Accordingly, each party hereby consents to the other partys
right to seek the issuance of injunctive relief by any court of competent
jurisdiction to compel performance of such partys obligations and to the
granting by any court of the remedy of specific performance of its obligations
hereunder.

Non-U.S. Affiliates will not comply with the provisions of any bulk transfer
laws of any jurisdiction in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

the Purchasers will continue to operate the Business for the period
immediately following the Closing Date and the Purchasers shall be solely
