Article I 

SALE AND PURCHASE OF SHARES

1.1 Sale and Purchase of Shares. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
of this Agreement, at the Closing, Purchaser shall purchase and accept from
Seller, and Seller shall sell and convey to Purchaser, the number of the
Company Shares set forth opposite Seller's name in Schedule 1.1 of the Seller
Disclosure Schedules, which constitute 100% of the outstanding Company Shares,
free and clear of all Liens (the "Transaction").

1.2 Purchase Price. The consideration to be paid by Purchaser to Seller in
respect of the purchase of the Company Shares shall be an amount in cash equal
to the sum of (a) U.S. $969,579,760 less the GSF Reserve Amount, and (b) the
Estimated Adjustment Amount (together, the "Estimated Purchase Price"),
subject to adjustment as determined pursuant to Section 1.6 (as adjusted, the
"Purchase Price").

1.3 Closing. The closing of the Transaction (the "Closing") shall take place
at the offices of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP, 4 Times Square,
New York, NY 10036, at 10:00 a.m., New York time, as soon as practicable, but
in any event not later than the fifth (5th) Business Day immediately following
the date on which the last of the conditions contained in Article VI is
fulfilled or waived (except for those conditions which by their nature can
only be fulfilled at the Closing, but subject to the fulfillment or waiver of
such conditions), or at such other place, time and date (the "Closing Date")
as the Parties may agree. The Closing shall be deemed to have occurred for all
purposes at 12:01 a.m. New York time on the Closing Date (the "Deemed Closing
Time"). All actions listed in Section 1.4 that occur on the Closing Date shall
be deemed to occur simultaneously at the Closing.

1.4 Closing Deliveries. At the Closing:

(a) Seller shall provide to Purchaser the original Company's shareholders
register duly updated to evidence the transfer of the Company Shares to
Purchaser or such other documentation as may be reasonably required under
applicable Law to evidence the transfer of the Company Shares to Purchaser.

(b) Purchaser shall pay to Seller an amount in cash equal to the Estimated
Purchase Price (such amount being subject to further adjustment pursuant to
Section 1.6) for the Company Shares, by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to the bank account or accounts which shall be designated by Seller at
least ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing.

(c) Except as required by applicable Law, Seller shall deliver to Purchaser
the resignations or removals, in substantially the form attached hereto as
Exhibit C, of the officers



. 3


 

--- 
| | 

| 

and directors and other persons set forth in Schedule 1.4 of the Seller
Disclosure Schedules from their position as officer or director, or other
position set forth opposite the name of such officer, director or person set
forth in Schedule 1.4 of the Seller Disclosure Schedules.

(d) Each Party shall deliver such other documents and instruments required to
be delivered by it pursuant to Article VI.

1.5 Estimated Adjustment Amount. Not less than eight (8) Business Days prior
to the expected Closing Date, Seller shall deliver to Purchaser a written
statement (the "Estimated Adjustment Amount Statement") setting forth Seller's
good faith calculation of the estimate of the Adjustment Amount as of the
Deemed Closing Time (the "Estimated Adjustment Amount"), along with reasonable
supporting documentation, which estimate shall be based on Seller's review of
the financial information and other books and records of the Acquired
Companies and shall be used in determining the payment of the Estimated
Purchase Price referred to in Section 1.2.

1.6 Post-Closing Payment.

(a) As promptly as practicable, and in any event not later than ninety (90)
days after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall prepare and deliver to Seller a
written statement (the "Adjustment Amount Statement") setting forth in
reasonable detail the Purchaser's calculation of the Adjustment Amount as of
the Deemed Closing Time, as derived from the Purchaser's review of the
financial information and other books and records of the Acquired Companies
and, based thereon, a statement of the Purchaser's calculation of the Post-
Closing Payment.

(b) Purchaser agrees to give Seller and its Representatives access to such
employees, officers and facilities and such books and records (including the
work papers of the Company's auditors, subject to Seller signing a customary
agreement relating to access to such work papers in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to such auditors) of Purchaser and the Acquired
Companies during normal business hours, as is reasonably necessary to allow
Seller and its Representatives to review the Adjustment Amount Statement.

(c) Seller may, in good faith, dispute the Adjustment Amount Statement by
delivery of written notice thereof (a "Dispute Notice") to Purchaser within
sixty (60) days following receipt by Seller of the Adjustment Amount
Statement. The Dispute Notice shall set forth in reasonable detail all items
disputed by Seller, together with Seller's proposed changes thereto, including
an explanation in reasonable detail of the basis on which Seller proposes such
changes. If (i) by written notice to Purchaser, Seller accepts the Adjustment
Amount Statement or (ii) Seller fails to deliver a Dispute Notice within the
prescribed sixty-day (60-day) period (which failure shall result in Seller
being deemed to have agreed to the Adjustment Amount Statement delivered by
Purchaser), the Adjustment Amount Statement delivered by Purchaser, and the
Adjustment Amount

| 

reflected therein, shall become final and binding on Seller and Purchaser as
of the date on which the earlier of the foregoing events occurs.

(d) If Seller has timely delivered a Dispute Notice, then Purchaser and Seller
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to reach agreement on the matters
identified in the Dispute Notice. If, by the thirtieth (30th) day following
Purchaser's receipt of the Dispute Notice, Purchaser and Seller have not
agreed in writing to the resolution of any of the matters identified in the
Dispute Notice, then such unresolved matters shall be submitted to the
Independent Accountants for resolution. Purchaser and Seller shall instruct
the Independent Accountants to prepare and deliver a revised Adjustment Amount
Statement (including the calculation of the Post-Closing Payment) to Purchaser
and Seller within thirty (30) days of the referral of such dispute to the
Independent Accountants, taking into account all items not in dispute between
Purchaser and Seller (to be included in the revised Adjustment Amount
Statement in the amounts agreed by Purchaser and Seller) and those unresolved
items requested by Purchaser and Seller to be resolved by the Independent
Accountants. Purchaser and the Company shall furnish or cause to be furnished
to the Independent Accountants access to such employees, officers, and
facilities and such books and records (including the work papers of the
Company's auditors, subject to Seller signing a customary agreement relating
to access to such work papers in form and substance reasonably acceptable to
such auditors) relating to the disputed items as the Independent Accountants
may reasonably request. The fees and expenses of the Independent Accountants
shall be borne fifty percent (50%) by Seller, on the one hand, and fifty
percent (50%) by Purchaser, on the other hand. The revised Adjustment Amount
Statement (including the calculation of the Adjustment Amount and the Post-
Closing Payment reflected therein) delivered by the Independent Accountants
shall be final and binding upon Purchaser and Seller; provided, however, that
in no event shall (i) Purchaser be obligated to make any payment to Seller
under Section 1.6(e) in excess of the amount that would have been payable
using Purchaser's calculation of the Post-Closing Payment as set forth in the
Adjustment Amount Statement delivered by Purchaser, but taking into account
the changes proposed by Seller set forth in the Dispute Notice or (ii) Seller
be obligated to make any payment to Purchaser under Section 1.6(e) in excess
of the amount that would have been payable using Purchaser's calculation of
the Post-Closing Payment as set forth in the Adjustment Amount Statement
delivered by Purchaser. The Independent Accountants shall act as an expert,
not as an arbitrator.

(e) If the Post-Closing Payment is a negative amount, then Purchaser shall pay
to Seller an amount equal to the Post-Closing Payment. If the Post-Closing
Payment is a positive amount, then Seller shall pay to Purchaser an amount
equal to the Post-Closing Payment. Each payment (if any) required by this
Section 1.6(e) shall be made within ten (10) Business Days following the date
the Post-Closing Payment is deemed to be finally determined pursuant to this
Section 1.6, except to the extent any payment in respect of undisputed amounts
has been paid pursuant to Section 1.6(c). All payments required to be made
pursuant to this Section 1.6 shall be



. 5


 

--- 
| | 

| 

made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the bank account or
accounts designated by the Party receiving such payment.

(f) Purchaser and Seller agree to treat, and to cause their respective
Affiliates to treat, for all Tax purposes, any payment made under this Section
1.6, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable Law, as an adjustment to
the Purchase Price.

1.7 Pre-Closing Restructuring.

(a) Prior to the Closing, Seller shall take or cause to be taken the actions
set forth on Exhibit B hereto substantially in the form described thereon
(collectively, the "Restructuring Transactions"). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Seller shall not, or permit any of its Affiliates to, without the
prior written consent of Purchaser, take any action to amend or modify the
Restructuring Transactions set forth on Exhibit B hereto in any material
respect.

(b) Purchaser acknowledges that, prior to the Closing, Seller may take or
cause to be taken other corporate transactions in connection with the
potential dispositions of its other businesses in Central America and South
America (collectively, the "Additional Restructuring Transactions").

(c) Notwithstanding any other provision contained herein to the contrary,
unless otherwise expressly indicated herein, (i) the consummation of the
Restructuring Transactions shall not constitute a breach of any
representation, warranty or covenant contained herein, if consummated pursuant
to and in accordance with this Agreement, and (ii) in no event shall the
consummation of the Restructuring Transactions, if consummated pursuant to and
in accordance with this Agreement, be deemed to cause a Company Material
Adverse Effect for the purposes of this Agreement.

1.8 Withholding Rights. (a) Purchaser shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from the consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this
Article I, such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect
to the making of such payment under any provision of federal, state, local or
foreign Tax law, including, without limitation, Brazilian capital gains taxes
imposed as a result of the Transaction, including any such Taxes imposed on
Purchaser; provided, however, that if Purchaser intends to withhold any
amounts in accordance with this Section 1.8(a) other than amounts described in
Section 1.8(b), Purchaser shall provide Seller with written notice at least
thirty (30) days prior to the applicable date of payment of such intention
(other than in the case of any change in applicable Law the timing of which
makes such advance notice impractical, in which case Purchaser shall provide
Seller with notice of its intention to withhold as soon as practical) and
afford Seller the opportunity to provide such Tax forms or other documentation
that would eliminate or reduce the amount to be so withheld. To the extent
such amounts are so deducted, Purchaser shall remit to the appropriate Taxing
Authority such withheld amounts, and such withheld



. 6


 

---

| 

and remitted amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the holder of the shares of the Acquired Companies in
respect of which the Purchaser made such deduction and withholding. Each of
the parties agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to mitigate the
imposition of any withholding Taxes but shall not be required to take any
action it determines in its reasonable judgment is adverse to its interests.

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Parties
agree that the following provisions of this Section 1.8(b) shall control with
respect to any Brazilian income Taxes levied under applicable Law on capital
gains realized by the Seller upon the sale of the Company Shares pursuant to
this Agreement (such Taxes, the "Brazilian Withholding Taxes"), including any
Tax Matters related thereto:

(i) The Parties acknowledge and agree that current Brazilian Law (Law No.
10,833 of 29 December 2003, as amended) requires that Purchaser (or, if
Purchaser is a non-Brazilian entity, a representative of Purchaser in Brazil)
withholds and pays on behalf of Seller, as applicable, the Brazilian
Withholding Taxes.

(ii) Seller shall (a) in its reasonable discretion, calculate the amount of
capital gains on the sale of the Company Shares (taking into account the
amount of Seller's acquisition cost based on the foreign investment
registration with the Central Bank of Brazil) and the amount of the applicable
Brazilian Withholding Taxes (including any Brazilian Withholding Taxes
attributable to any Post-Closing Payment made under Section 1.6), which in
each case shall be denominated in U.S. dollars, and (b) communicate such
amounts to Purchaser in the Estimated Adjustment Amount Statement or the
Adjustment Amount Statement, as applicable, and furnish to Purchaser at the
same time drafts of the Documentos de Arrecadaçao de Receitas Federais
("DARFs") that will be used by Purchaser to make the payments of such
Brazilian Withholding Taxes. Seller will consider any reasonable written
objections of Purchaser to the calculation of the amount of capital gains
received by Seller within three (3) days of Seller's delivery to Purchaser of
the Estimated Adjustment Amount Statement or the Adjustment Amount Statement,
as applicable.

(iii) Purchaser (or the relevant representative of Purchaser, as applicable)
shall withhold and pay over the amount of any Brazilian Withholding Taxes as
calculated by Seller under Section 1.8(b)(ii) (converted into Brazilian Reais
based on the exchange rate for selling released by the Central Bank of Brazil
(SISBACEN, PTAX800 - Option 5) on the date of the payment with respect to
which such withholding is made to the relevant Brazilian Taxing Authorities
within the time provided by applicable Law and shall furnish to Seller
documentation evidencing such payments (including DARFs prepared based on the
drafts provided by Seller under Section 1.8(b)(ii)), with the amount converted



. 7


 

--- 
| | 

| 

in Brazilian Reais based on the exchange rate for selling released by the
Central Bank of Brazil (SISBACEN, PTAX800 - Option 5) on the date of the
payment with respect to which such withholding is made to the relevant
Brazilian Taxing Authorities, in form and substance satisfactory to Seller
(such documentation, including any receipts (original or certified copy), if
issued by such Taxing Authorities evidencing such payments, or a copy of the
Tax Return evidencing such payments, the "Brazilian Withholding
Documentation"), (a) in the case of any Brazilian Withholding Taxes shown on
the Estimated Adjustment Amount Statement, at the Closing and (b) in the case
of any Brazilian Withholding Taxes shown on the Adjustment Amount Statement,
within five (5) Business Days of the payment of such Brazilian Withholding
Taxes to the relevant Brazilian Taxing Authority in accordance with this
Section 1.8(b)(iii).

(iv) Purchaser and Seller hereby acknowledge that the Brazilian Withholding
Taxes are currently calculated using a 15% rate under applicable Brazilian
Law, and that such rate is scheduled to increase to 22.5% beginning January 1,
2017 (the incremental increase in the amount of the Brazilian Withholding
Taxes resulting from such increase in rate is hereinafter referred to as the
"Incremental Withholding Taxes"). If (i) the Closing does not occur by
December 31, 2016, solely as a result of Purchaser's failure to obtain the PRC
Regulatory Approvals and (ii) the amount of the Brazilian Withholding Taxes
withheld by Purchaser from the Purchase Price at Closing is calculated using a
rate in excess of 15% under applicable Brazilian Law, Purchaser shall increase
the Purchase Price by an amount equal to the Incremental Withholding Taxes
increased as necessary so that Seller receives an amount, after such
incremental withholding, equal to the amount Seller would have received had
the Brazilian Withholding Taxes been calculated at a rate of 15%; provided,
however, that such increase in Purchase Price shall be reduced by any Tax
benefits, actually realized by Seller or any of its Affiliates as a result of
the payment of such Incremental Withholding Taxes, which Tax benefits
Purchaser will and will cause its Affiliates to use reasonable efforts to
obtain). For the avoidance of doubt, this provision shall not limit
Purchaser's ability to withhold Taxes pursuant to this Section 1.8.

(v) Purchaser shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller and its Affiliates from
and against all Taxes and Losses actually imposed on, suffered by or incurred
by them in connection with, arising out of or resulting from any failure by
Purchaser to remit the Brazilian Withholding Taxes in the amount required by
Section 1.8(b)(iii) to the Brazilian Taxing Authorities as required by
applicable Law (any Taxes and Losses described in this Section 1.8(b)(v), the
"Purchaser Withholding Liabilities").

(vi) Seller shall indemnify and hold harmless Purchaser and its Affiliates
from and against all Taxes and Losses actually imposed on, suffered by or
incurred by them if the relevant Brazilian Taxing Authorities claim or demand
any Brazilian



. 8

| | 

| 

Withholding Taxes in excess of the amount of such Brazilian Withholding Taxes
calculated by Seller in accordance with Section 1.8(b)(ii) (any Taxes and
Losses described in this Section 1.8(b)(vi), the "Seller Withholding
Liabilities"); provided, however, that Seller shall be entitled to control any
Tax Matter related to such a claim in accordance with Section 5.13(e)(i) and
Section 8.5(g).

the "fair saleable value" of the assets of such Person will, as of such date,
exceed (A) the sum of the value of all "Liabilities of such Person, including
contingent and other Liabilities" as of such date, and the capital of such
Person, as computed in accordance with applicable Law as of such date, as such
quoted terms are generally determined in accordance with applicable Laws
governing determinations of the insolvency of debtors, and (B) the amount that
will be required to pay the probable Liabilities of such Person on its
existing debts (including contingent and other Liabilities) as such debts
become absolute and mature, (ii) such Person will not have, as of such date,
an unreasonably small amount of capital for the operation of the businesses in
which it is engaged or proposed to be engaged following such date, and (iii)
such Person will be able to pay its Liabilities, including contingent and
other Liabilities, as they mature. For purposes of this definition, the
phrases "not have an unreasonably small amount of capital for the operation of
the businesses in which it is engaged or proposed to be engaged" and "able to
pay its Liabilities, including contingent and other Liabilities, as they
mature" mean that such Person will be able to generate enough cash

from operations, asset dispositions or refinancing, or a combination thereof,
to meet its obligations as they become due.

4.7 Litigation. Except as set forth in Schedule 4.7 of the Purchaser
Disclosure Schedules, there is no Action pending or, to the Knowledge of
Purchaser, threatened against Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries or
affecting any of their respective assets or properties that, if adversely
determined, would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect, or to otherwise prevent or
materially delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Subject to obtaining the Purchaser Required Statutory Approvals,
there are no Governmental Orders of or by any Governmental Entity applicable
to Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries, except for such that would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Purchaser
Material Adverse Effect, or to otherwise prevent or materially delay the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

4.8 Investment Intention; Sufficient Investment Experience; Independent
Investigation. Purchaser is acquiring the Company Shares for its own account
and not with a view to their sale or distribution in violation of applicable
securities Laws; provided, however, for the avoidance of doubt, Purchaser may
transfer, assign or sell Company Shares to co-investors after the Closing.
Purchaser has such knowledge and experience in financial and business matters
that it is capable of evaluating the Company and the merits and risks of an
investment in the Company Shares. Purchaser has been given adequate
opportunity to examine all documents provided by, conduct due diligence and
ask questions of, and to receive answers from, Seller, the Company and their
respective Representatives concerning the Company and Purchaser's investment
in the Company Shares. Purchaser has, among other things, had full access to
the Virtual Data Room and received the Seller Disclosure Schedules. Purchaser
has also received certain projections and other forecasts, including projected
financial statements, cash flow items, capital expenditure budgets and certain
business plan information, and acknowledges that (a) there are uncertainties
inherent in attempting to make such projections and forecasts and,
accordingly, it is not relying on them, (b) Purchaser is familiar with such
uncertainties and is taking full responsibility for making its own evaluation
of the adequacy and accuracy of all such projections and forecasts, (c)
Purchaser has no claim under this Agreement against anyone with respect to the
accuracy of such projections and forecasts, and (d) neither Seller nor the
Company nor any other Person has made any representation or warranty with
respect to such projections and forecasts. Purchaser acknowledges and affirms
that it has completed to its satisfaction its own independent investigation,
analysis and evaluation of the Acquired Companies, that it has made all such
reviews and inspections of the businesses, assets, Liabilities, results of
operations and condition (financial or otherwise) of the Acquired Companies as
it has deemed necessary or appropriate, and that in making its decision to
enter into this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby it has relied solely on its own independent investigation, analysis and
evaluation of Seller's representations and warranties set forth in Article II
and the Company's representations and warranties set forth in Article III.



. 31

| 

Nothing herein shall prohibit or prevent Purchaser from bringing claims for
actual and intentional fraud against Seller.

4.9 Brokers and Finders. Purchaser has not entered into any agreement or
arrangement entitling any agent, broker, investment banker, financial advisor
or other firm or Person to any broker's or finder's fee or any other
commission or similar fee in connection with any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, except Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and Smith
Incorporated, whose fees and expenses will be paid by Purchaser in accordance
with Purchaser's agreement with such firm.

4.10 Compliance with Laws. Except as set forth in Schedule 4.10 of the
Purchaser Disclosure Schedules, since December 31, 2013, neither Purchaser nor
any of its Affiliates has been given written notice by any Governmental Entity
of, or been charged in writing by any Governmental Entity with, any violation
of, or, to the Knowledge of Purchaser, is in violation of, or is under
investigation with respect to any violation of, any Law or Governmental Order,
except, in each case, for violations which would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect,
or to otherwise prevent or materially delay the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Except as would not, individually
or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Purchaser Material
Adverse Effect, or to otherwise prevent or materially delay the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Purchaser and each of its
Subsidiaries is in compliance with (a) the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, as
amended, and any rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, (b) the Foreign
Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, and any rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder, (c) the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in
International Business Transactions and legislation implementing such
Convention, (d) the United Kingdom Bribery Act of 2010, as amended, and any
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, and (e) the Brazilian
anticorruption law (Law 12,846/13), and any rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder.

4.11 No Other Representations and Warranties. Except for the representations
and warranties contained in this Article IV, neither Purchaser nor any Person
acting on behalf of Purchaser makes any representation or warranty, express or
implied, under this Agreement. Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that, except
as expressly set forth in Article II and Article III, neither Seller nor the
Company nor any of their Affiliates has made any representation or warranty,
express or implied, to Purchaser or any of its Affiliates in connection with
this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and except
as expressly set forth in Article II and Article III, (a) Purchaser
acknowledges and agrees that neither Seller nor the Company nor any of their
Affiliates has made any representation or warranty, express or implied, as to
the accuracy or completeness of any information regarding Seller or its
Affiliates made available to Purchaser, and (b) neither Seller nor the Company
nor any other Person shall be subject to any Liability to Purchaser,



. 32


 

--- 
| | 

| 

or any other Person, as a result of Seller having made available to Purchaser
any such information, including in the Virtual Data Room, management
presentations (formal or informal), or in any other form in connection with
the Transaction. Without limiting the foregoing, neither Seller nor the
Company nor any of their Affiliates makes any representation or warranty to
Purchaser with respect to any financial projection or forecast relating to the
Acquired Companies. Nothing herein shall prohibit or prevent Purchaser from
bringing claims for actual and intentional fraud against Seller.

. 36

| 

to obtain, and shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain, the Required
Statutory Approvals. The Parties further agree to use reasonable best efforts
(i) to take any act, make any undertaking or receive any clearance or approval
required by any Governmental Entity or applicable Law and (ii) to satisfy any
conditions imposed by any Governmental Entity in all Final Orders, in each
case in order to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby as soon as
reasonably possible. Each of the Parties shall (i) respond as promptly as
practicable to any inquiries or requests received from any Governmental Entity
for additional information or documentation, (ii) provide such information
with respect to such Party as may be necessary to obtain the Required
Statutory Approvals and (iii) not enter into any agreement with any
Governmental Entity that would reasonably be expected to adversely affect the
Parties' ability to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, except with the prior consent of the other Parties (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Each of the
Parties shall use reasonable best efforts to avoid or eliminate each and every
impediment under any antitrust, competition, or trade or energy regulation Law
that may be asserted by any Governmental Entity with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby so as to enable the Closing Date to occur as
soon as reasonably possible. The actions required by the immediately preceding
sentence shall include proposing, negotiating, committing to and effecting, by
consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or
disposition of such assets or businesses of Purchaser or its Affiliates
(including their respective Subsidiaries), and agreeing to such limitations on
its or their conduct or actions as may be required in order to obtain the
Required Statutory Approvals as soon as reasonably possible, to avoid the
entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any injunction, temporary
restraining order or other order in any suit or proceeding, which would
otherwise have the effect of preventing or delaying the Closing Date, and
defending through litigation on the merits, including appeals, any claim
asserted in any court by any Person.

with copies of all filings, notices, correspondence or other written
communications from or to, and inform one another of any communications
received from, any Governmental Entity, (ii) promptly make any appropriate or
necessary subsequent or supplemental filings, (iii) cooperate in the
preparation of such filings as is reasonably necessary and appropriate, and

consider in good faith any comments to, any proposed written communication
between such Party and any Governmental Entity. If a Party or any of its
Affiliates intends to participate in any substantive meeting or discussion
with any Governmental Entity with respect to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or any filings, investigations or inquiries made in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, it will give the other
Parties reasonable prior notice of and, to the extent permitted by such
Governmental Entity, an opportunity to participate in, such meeting or
discussion. This Section 5.2(b) does not relate to Tax matters, which are
instead the subject of Section 5.13.

5.3 Required Consents. Seller and the Company, on the one hand, and Purchaser,
on the other hand, agree to use reasonable best efforts to obtain the Company
Required Consents and the Purchaser Required Consents, respectively, and to
cooperate with each other in connection with the foregoing.

5.4 Access; Confidentiality.

(a) Subject to applicable Law and Governmental Orders, Seller shall, and shall
cause each of the Acquired Companies to, during the period from and after the
date hereof until the Closing, upon reasonable advance notice, (i) afford
Purchaser and its authorized directors, officers, employees, accountants,
counsel, financing sources and lenders, investment bankers and consultants
(collectively, "Representatives") reasonable access, during normal business
hours, in the presence of at least one (1) Representative of Seller, to all
officers, employees, properties, books and records (with respect to U.S. Tax
books and records, only to the extent solely and directly related to the
Acquired Companies), Contracts and other documents of the Acquired Companies,
(ii) furnish to Purchaser such financial and operating data and other
information relating to the Acquired Companies as Purchaser may reasonably
request (including such accounting and auditing information as may be
necessary to prepare financial statements), and (iii) instruct the appropriate
Acquired Company employees to cooperate reasonably with Purchaser and its
Representatives in connection with the foregoing; provided, however, that, in
each case, such access, furnishing of information and cooperation shall not
(w) unreasonably disrupt any Acquired Company's operations, (x) require any
Acquired Company to permit any inspection or to disclose any information that,
in the reasonable judgment of such Acquired Company, would result in the
disclosure of any trade secrets or violate any of its obligations to third
parties with respect to confidentiality (so long as the Seller notifies
Purchaser of such confidentiality requirement and used its commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain a waiver thereof or agree to alternative means of
disclosure), (y) require any Acquired Company to disclose any attorney-client
privileged information of any Acquired Company (so long as the Seller has used
commercially reasonable efforts to agree to alternative means of disclosure),
or (z) include any sampling of environmental media or building materials or
(z) require Seller or any of its Affiliates (including the Acquired Companies)
to disclose any proprietary information of or regarding Seller or its
Affiliates (excluding the Acquired Companies). All requests for information
made pursuant to this Section 5.4(a) shall be directed to such Persons
designated by Seller in writing from time to time. All such information shall
be governed by the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement. Purchaser shall
not, and shall cause its Representatives not to, use any information obtained
pursuant to this Section 5.4(a) (as well as any other confidential information
provided to Purchaser or any of its Representatives by or on behalf of Parent,
Seller or any Acquired Company prior to the date hereof) for any purpose
unrelated to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.



. 38


 

--- 
| | 

| 

(b) Purchaser shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller, its Affiliates and
their respective Representatives for any and all Liabilities, Losses, costs or
expenses incurred by Seller, its Affiliates or their respective
Representatives arising out of the access rights under this Section 5.4,
including any claims by any of Purchaser's Representatives for any injuries or
property damage while present on the Real Property.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 5.4, neither
Seller nor the Acquired Companies shall be obligated to disclose to Purchaser
any information (x) the disclosure of which could reasonably be expected to
(i) violate any applicable Law, (ii) result in the loss of attorney-client
privilege with respect to such information (so long as Seller has used
commercially reasonable efforts to consider alternative means of disclosure),
or (iii) result in a breach of an agreement to which Seller or any Acquired
Company or any of their respective Affiliates is a party (so long as Seller
notifies Purchaser of such confidentiality requirement and used its
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain a waiver thereof and to agree to
alternative means of disclosure), or (y) that constitutes any trade secret or
confidential information of third parties (so long as Seller notifies
Purchaser of the confidentiality of such information and used its commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain a waiver thereof or agree to alternative means of
disclosure)

(d) From and for a period of two (2) years after the Closing, Seller shall,
and shall cause its Affiliates and its or their respective Representatives to,
hold in confidence any and all information concerning Purchaser and the
Acquired Companies, and their respective Affiliates, except to the extent that
such information (i) has come within the public domain through no action or
omission of the Seller or its Affiliates or Representatives in violation of
clause (iii) hereof; (ii) is later acquired by Seller or its Affiliates after
the Closing from another source if the receiving Person is not aware that such
source is under an obligation to Purchaser or the Acquired Companies or their
respective Affiliates to keep such documents and information confidential or
(iii) is disclosed in connection with Parent's reporting obligations under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended. If Seller or any of its Affiliates or their respective
Representatives are compelled to disclose any information subject to such
confidentiality obligations by Law or Governmental Order or in an Action,
Seller shall, to the extent legally permissible, give Purchaser prompt notice
of such disclosure to permit Purchaser to seek a protective order should it so
determine. At any time that such protective order or remedy has not been
obtained, Seller or such Affiliate or Representative may disclose only that
portion of such information which such Person is legally required to disclose
or of which disclosure is required to avoid sanction for contempt or any
similar sanction, and Seller shall exercise its commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded to
such information so disclosed.

(e) For a period of twelve (12) months after the Closing Date, Seller shall
not and shall cause its Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly, employ,
engage, hire, recruit or solicit



. 39


 

--- 
| | 

| 

for employment, recruitment, engagement or hire (whether as an employee,
consultant or otherwise) any Continuing Employee; provided that, Seller shall
not be precluded from employing, soliciting, recruiting or hiring any such
Continuing Employee (i) who has been terminated by the Company or any of its
Affiliates at least six (6) months prior to the commencement of employment or
hiring discussion with such Continuing Employee, or (ii) who responds to a
general or public solicitation not targeted at Continuing Employees.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller and its Affiliates shall not be
restricted from engaging in general or public solicitations or advertising not
targeted at any such Continuing Employees.

(f) From and after the Closing, Purchaser and Seller shall, and shall cause
their respective Representatives, upon reasonable notice, to (i) furnish to
each other, and their respective Representatives, such financial and operating
data and other information relating to the Acquired Companies (including books
and records of the Acquired Companies) as is reasonably necessary for planning
any systems conversions, process changes, litigation, employee benefits,
environmental, financial reporting and accounting matters, or the preparation
and filing of any required regulatory or other filings, responses or reports
and information relating to any Action or as required by any Law or
Governmental Order, and (ii) make available to each other, and their
respective Representatives, their respective directors, officers and employees
as may reasonably be requested to cooperate in connection with the foregoing;
provided that such access shall not unreasonably interrupt Seller's or the
Acquired Companies' businesses; provided, further, that with respect to any
claim under this Agreement, disclosure shall be governed by applicable rules
of evidence. After the Closing, Purchaser shall cause the Acquired Companies
to preserve such information and the books and records for at least eight (8)
years after the Closing Date. This Section 5.4(f) does not relate to Tax
matters, which are instead the subject of Section 5.13.

5.5 Publicity. Each of the Parties shall be entitled to issue a press release
in connection with entry into in this Agreement, provided that they shall
consult with each other before issuing any such press release. Thereafter,
until the Closing, none of Seller, the Company or Purchaser or any of their
respective Affiliates shall, without the express written approval of Seller,
the Company and Purchaser (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), make any press release or other public announcements
concerning the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except as and to
the extent that any such Party shall be so obligated by applicable Law, or
pursuant to any such listing agreement or rules of any national securities
exchange, in which case the other Parties shall be advised and the Parties
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause a mutually agreeable
release or announcement to be issued.

5.6 Employee Matters.

(a) For a period of twelve (12) months following the Closing Date, Purchaser
and the Company shall cause the employees of the Company or any Subsidiary of
the



. 40


 

--- 
| | 

| 

Company who remain in the employment of Purchaser, the Company, their
Subsidiaries or their respective successors immediately following the Closing
(the "Continuing Employees") to receive compensation, employee benefits and
severance protection (other than equity compensation) that are each
substantially comparable in the aggregate to the compensation, employee
benefits and severance protection (including statutory severance and the
Acquired Companies' past practice of providing market-based severance through
benchmarking) provided to such employees immediately prior to the Closing.
Nothing contained herein shall be construed as requiring Purchaser, the
Company or any Subsidiary of the Company to continue or to cause the
continuance of any specific employee benefit plans or to continue or cause the
continuance of the employment of any specific person.

(b) With respect to each benefit plan of Purchaser or its Subsidiaries in
which a Continuing Employee participates after the Closing, for purposes of
determining eligibility, vesting and amount of benefits, including severance
benefits and paid time off entitlement (but not for pension benefit accrual
purposes), Purchaser shall cause service with the Company and its Subsidiaries
(or predecessor employers to the extent the Company or its Subsidiaries
provided past service credit) to be treated as service with Purchaser and its
Subsidiaries; provided that such service shall not be recognized to the extent
that such recognition would result in a duplication of benefits or to the
extent that such service was not recognized under an analogous Company Plan.

(c) With respect to any welfare benefit plan maintained by Purchaser or its
Subsidiaries in which Continuing Employees are eligible to participate after
the Closing, Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries
to use commercially reasonable efforts to, (i) waive all limitations as to
preexisting conditions and exclusions with respect to participation and
coverage requirements applicable to such employees to the extent such
conditions and exclusions were satisfied or did not apply to such employees
under the Company Plans prior to the Closing, and (ii) provide each Continuing
Employee with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid prior to the
Closing in satisfying any analogous deductible or out-of-pocket requirements
to the extent applicable under any such plan.

(d) Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Acquired Companies to, honor the
terms of each CBA until such CBA otherwise expires pursuant to its terms or is
modified by the parties thereto.

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no Acquired
Company will assume or have any liability under any Company Plan that is not a
Non-US Benefit Plan (a "Seller Plan") at or following the Closing and Seller
shall indemnify and hold harmless Purchaser or any Acquired Company for any
claim or liability with respect to any Seller Plan.



. 41


 

--- 
| | 

| 

(f) Nothing contained in this Section 5.6 shall be construed to (i) establish,
amend or modify any benefit or compensation plan, program, agreement,
contract, policy or arrangement, (ii) limit the ability of Purchaser, the
Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries to amend, modify or terminate
any benefit or compensation plan, program, agreement, contract, policy or
arrangement at any time assumed, established, sponsored or maintained by any
of them or (iii) create any third-party beneficiary rights in any employee of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, any beneficiary or dependent thereof,
or any collective bargaining representative thereof, with respect to the
compensation, terms and conditions of employment and/or benefits that may be
provided to any Continuing Employee by Purchaser or the Company or under any
benefit plan which Purchaser or the Company may maintain.

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable, but in any event within forty (40) days
following the Closing, Purchaser shall, and shall cause each Acquired Company
to, cease using as trademarks or source identifiers of Purchaser's business
all trademarks, trade names, logos and symbols or other indicia of origin
owned by Seller or the Non-Company Affiliates, including those set forth in
Schedule 5.9(a) of the Seller Disclosure Schedules (collectively, the "Seller
Marks"), including eliminating the Seller Marks from the Real Property and the
material assets of the Project Companies, and disposing of any unused
stationery and literature of the Acquired Companies bearing the Seller Marks.
Purchaser acknowledges and Seller represents that, as between the Parties, the
Seller Marks are owned exclusively by Seller or the Non-Company Affiliates,
and, except to the extent expressly permitted by this Section 5.9(a), from and
after the Closing, Purchaser shall not, and shall cause each Acquired Company
and their Affiliates not to, use the Seller Marks that have not been expressly
conveyed to Purchaser or an Acquired Company, and Purchaser acknowledges that
it, its Affiliates and the Acquired Companies have no rights whatsoever to use
the Seller Marks. Without limiting the foregoing:

(i) within thirty (30) days after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall cause each
Acquired Company whose name contains any of the Seller Marks to make all
filings required by the Governmental Entities to change its name to a name

Acquired Company to eliminate such Seller Marks from the name of such Acquired
Company; and

(ii) within forty (40) days after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall provide
evidence to Seller in a format that is reasonably acceptable to Seller that
Purchaser has made all filings required by the Governmental Entities pursuant
to subsection (a)(i) above and has provided notice to all applicable
Governmental Entities and all counterparties to the Company Material Contracts
regarding the sale of the Acquired Companies and the new address for notice
purposes.

requirements, policies and guidelines in effect at such time that have been
provided to Purchaser or any Acquired Company as of the Closing.

5.10 Notification of Certain Matters. Seller and the Company, on the one hand,
and Purchaser, on the other hand, shall promptly notify each other of the
occurrence or non‑occurrence of any fact or event which would be reasonably
likely to cause any condition set forth in Article VI not to be satisfied;
provided that no such notification, nor the obligation to make such
notification, shall affect the representations, warranties or covenants, or
the conditions to the obligations of, the applicable party.

5.11 Financing.

(a) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary,
Purchaser expressly acknowledges and agrees that Purchaser's obligations
hereunder are not conditioned in any manner whatsoever upon Purchaser
obtaining any financing, and any failure to fulfill any obligation hereunder
arising from the failure of Purchaser to obtain financing or the
unavailability of such financing shall be deemed to be intentional for
purposes hereof. Purchaser shall keep Seller reasonably apprised of all
developments or changes relating to the Financing Arrangements and the
financing contemplated thereby. In the event that the Financing Arrangements
shall cease to be in full force and effect at any time or the lenders party
thereto shall indicate any unwillingness to provide the financing contemplated
thereby, or for any reason Purchaser otherwise no longer believes in good
faith that it will be able to obtain the financing contemplated thereby, then
Purchaser shall promptly notify Seller and use reasonable best efforts to
obtain replacement financing arrangements or commitment letters as soon as
reasonably practicable.

(b) Prior to the Closing, Seller shall, and shall cause the Acquired Companies
and their respective Representatives to, provide all cooperation reasonably
requested by Purchaser in connection with the financing contemplated by the

appropriate officers and employees of the Acquired Companies to be available
on a customary basis to meet with prospective lenders, financing sources,
ratings agencies and investors in presentations, meetings, and due diligence
sessions, (ii) to assist with the preparation of disclosure documents, bank
information memoranda, rating agency presentations, projections and similar
documents in connection therewith, (iii) to furnish Purchaser and its
financing sources with financial statements and financial and other pertinent
information regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries as may be reasonably
requested by Purchaser to consummate the financing contemplated by the
Financing Arrangements, (iv) to execute and deliver any definitive financing
documentation, security documents, hedging arrangements, customary
certificates, legal opinions or other documents as may be reasonably requested
by Purchaser in connection with the Financing Arrangements, in each case which
will become effective only on or after the Closing, (v) to take such
reasonable actions as may be required to facilitate the pledge of collateral
to secure the Financing Arrangements (including cooperation in connection with
the payoff of existing Indebtedness, if any such pay-off will be effectuated,
and the release of Liens related thereto), (vi) to obtain all waivers,
consents and approvals from other parties to Contracts and Liens to which any
of the Acquired Companies is a party or by which any of them or their assets
or properties is bound or subject, (vii) to provide all documentation and
other information required by bank regulatory authorities under applicable
"know-your-customer" and anti-money laundering rules and regulations, and

Financing Arrangements; provided that, such requested cooperation does not
unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of the Acquired Companies.

the Restructuring Transactions, if any, prior to the Closing; provided that,
all documentation effectuating the Restructuring Transactions shall be in form
and substance reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser.

5.13 Tax Matters.

connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be
shared one-half by Seller and one-half by Purchaser. All necessary
documentation and Tax Returns with respect to such Transfer Taxes shall be
prepared and filed by the party required under applicable Law to file such Tax
Returns. If required by applicable Law, Seller and Purchaser shall, and shall
cause their respective Affiliates to, cooperate in preparing and filing, and,
if required by applicable Law, join in the execution of, any such Tax Returns.

(b) Tax Returns. Except as otherwise provided in Section 5.13(a):



. 45


 

--- 
| | 

| 

(i) Seller shall prepare and timely file, or cause to be prepared and timely
filed, all Tax Returns that are required to be filed by any Acquired Company
on or prior to the Closing Date. With respect to any Tax Return of the
Acquired Companies for a Pre-Closing Tax Period that is due after the Closing
Date, Seller shall prepare such Tax Return in a manner consistent with past
practice (unless otherwise required by applicable Law) and shall provide
Purchaser a copy of such Tax Return no later than fifteen (15) days prior to
the due date for the filing of such Tax Return (including extensions), and
Purchaser shall execute and file (or cause to be executed and filed) such Tax
Return as prepared by Seller. Seller shall pay to the Company no later than
three (3) days prior to the due date for the filing of such Tax Return, any
amount due and payable on such Tax Return.

(ii) Purchaser shall prepare and timely file, or cause to be prepared and
timely filed, all Tax Returns that are required to be filed by any Acquired
Company for a Straddle Period. Purchaser shall timely remit, or cause to be
timely remitted, all Taxes due in respect of such Tax Returns. All such Tax
Returns shall be prepared in a manner consistent with past practice, unless
otherwise required by applicable Law. Not later than forty-five (45) days
prior to the due date for filing of each such Tax Return (including
extensions), Purchaser shall provide Seller with a draft copy of such Tax
Return for review and comment. If Seller objects to any item on any such Tax
Return, it shall, within ten (10) days after delivery of such Tax Return,
notify Purchaser in writing that it so objects, specifying with particularity
any such item and stating the specific factual or legal basis for any such
objection. If a notice of objection shall be so delivered, Purchaser and
Seller shall negotiate in good faith and use their commercially reasonable
efforts to resolve such items. If Purchaser and Seller are unable to reach
such agreement within ten (10) days after receipt by Purchaser of such notice,
the disputed items shall be resolved by the Independent Accountants and any
determination by the Independent Accountants shall be final, binding and
conclusive on the Parties. The Independent Accountants shall resolve any
disputed items within twenty (20) days of having the item referred to it
pursuant to such procedures as it may require. The costs, fees and expenses of
the Independent Accountants shall be borne equally by Purchaser and Seller.
For the avoidance of doubt, the preparation and filing of any Tax Return of
the Acquired Companies that does not relate to the Pre-Closing Tax Period or
the Straddle Period shall be exclusively within the control of Purchaser.
Seller shall pay or cause to be paid to the Company, no later than one (1) day
prior to the due date for the filing of such Tax Return, the portion of any
amount due and payable on such Tax Return that is apportioned to the period
deemed to end at the close of the Closing Date (as determined under Section
5.13(c)).

(iii) Purchaser shall not amend, refile or otherwise modify, or cause or
permit to be amended, refiled or otherwise modified, any Tax Return filed by
any Acquired Company for any Pre-Closing Tax Period. With respect to any Tax
Return of an



. 46


 

--- 
| | 

| 

Acquired Company for a Straddle Period, Purchaser shall be allowed to amend,
refile or otherwise modify, or cause or permit to be amended, refiled or
otherwise modified any such Tax Return; provided, however, that to the extent
any such amendment or modification could reasonably be expected to increase
the tax liability of Seller for a Pre-Closing Tax Period or the pre-Closing
portion of any Straddle Period, Purchaser shall provide Seller with a draft
copy of each such amended Tax Return for review and comment not later than
forty-five (45) days prior to the filing thereof. If Seller objects to any
item on any such Tax Return that relates to the portion of the Straddle Period
deemed to end at the close of the Closing Date ("Pre-Closing Tax Period
Items"), it shall, within fifteen (15) days after delivery of such amended Tax
Return, notify Purchaser in writing that it so objects, specifying with
particularity any such item and stating the specific factual or legal basis
for any such objection. If a notice of objection shall be so delivered,
Purchaser and Seller shall negotiate in good faith and use their commercially
reasonable efforts to resolve such items. If Purchaser and Seller are unable
to reach such agreement within ten (10) days after receipt by Purchaser of
such notice, the disputed items shall be resolved by the Independent
Accountants and any determination by the Independent Accountants shall be
final, binding and conclusive on the Parties. The Independent Accountants
shall resolve any disputed items within twenty (20) days of having the item
referred to it pursuant to such procedures as it may require. The costs, fees
and expenses of the Independent Accountants shall be borne equally by
Purchaser and Seller.

(c) Straddle Period Tax Liabilities. Where it is necessary for purposes of
this Agreement to apportion between Seller and Purchaser the Taxes of or with
respect to any Acquired Company for any Straddle Period, such liability shall
be apportioned between the period deemed to end at the close of the Closing
Date and the period deemed to begin at the beginning of the day following the
Closing Date on the basis of an interim closing of the books, except that
Taxes (such as real or personal property Taxes, but, for the avoidance of
doubt, not income, sales and use, or withholding Taxes) imposed on a periodic
basis shall be allocated on a daily basis.

(d) Cooperation on Certain Tax Matters. From and after the Closing, Purchaser,
Seller and each of their Affiliates shall furnish or cause to be furnished to
each other or to the Acquired Companies, upon request, as promptly as
reasonably practicable, such information (including access to books and
records relating to Taxes, but only to the extent such books and records are
solely and directly related to the Acquired Companies) and assistance relating
to the Acquired Companies as is reasonably necessary for (i) the preparation
and filing of any Tax Return, amended Tax Return or claim for refund, (ii) the
preparation for any audit, examination or other action or proceeding with
respect to Taxes and for the prosecution or defense of any action relating to
any proposed adjustment or (iii) determining a Liability for Taxes. Such
cooperation and information shall include providing copies of all relevant
portions of relevant Tax Returns, together with all relevant portions of
relevant accompanying schedules, relevant documents relating to rulings



. 47

or other determinations by Taxing Authorities and relevant records concerning
the ownership and tax basis of property and other relevant information, which
any such Party or its Affiliates may possess. From and after the Closing,
Purchaser agrees to retain or cause to be retained all books and records held
by it or any of its Affiliates (including the Acquired Companies) relating to
Taxes of the Acquired Companies for a Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle
Period for at least seven (7) years after the Closing Date, and to abide by or
cause the abidance with all record retention agreements entered into with any
Taxing Authority. From and after the Closing, Purchaser agrees to notify
Seller at least sixty (60) days before Purchaser or any of its Affiliates
transfers, discards or destroys any such books and records after the period
set forth in the preceding sentence and, if Seller notifies Purchaser in
writing within such sixty-day (60-day) period that it intends to take
possession of such books and records, Purchaser and its Affiliates shall allow
Seller and any of Seller's Representatives to take possession of such books
and records and shall not transfer, discard or destroy such books and records
unless Seller notifies Purchaser in writing that it no longer intends to take
possession thereof. Purchaser and Seller shall reasonably cooperate with each
other in the conduct of any audit, filing of Tax Returns or other proceedings
involving any Acquired Company for any Tax purposes and each shall execute and
deliver such powers of attorney and other documents as are necessary to carry
out the intent of this Section 5.13.

similar events with respect to Taxes of or with respect to any Acquired
Company (any such inquiry, claim, assessment, audit or similar event, a "Tax
Matter") to the extent relating to any Pre-Closing Tax Period or the pre-
Closing portion of any Straddle Period (as determined under Section 5.13(c)).
Seller at its sole expense, shall have the right to control the resolution of
any such Tax Matter that relates solely to a Pre-Closing Tax Period; provided
that, with respect to any such Tax Matter that could reasonably be expected to
adversely affect the Tax liability of Purchaser or any Acquired Company for
any Post-Closing Tax Period, including the portion of the Straddle Period that
is after the Closing Date, (A) Seller shall defend or prosecute such Tax

defense and prosecution of such Tax Matter .

controlled by Seller in accordance with Section 5.13(e)(i) (including any Tax
Matter that would otherwise be controlled by Seller in accordance with Section
5.13(e)(i) but with respect to which Seller notifies Purchaser in writing that

Matter with respect to which Seller could reasonably be expected to have
liability under this Agreement, (A) Purchaser shall defend or prosecute such

Acquired Companies not to, enter into any compromise or settlement of any such
Tax Matter without the prior written consent of Seller, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, (C) Purchaser shall

Matter (including promptly responding to questions and information requests
and promptly providing Seller with copies of relevant correspondence to or

respect to any Acquired Company (net of reasonable fees or expenses incurred
by Purchaser or the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in obtaining such
refund), and any interest received thereon, with respect to any Pre-Closing
Tax Period or the pre-Closing portion of any Straddle Period (as determined
under Section 5.13(c)) that does not relate to deductions or credits arising
with respect to amounts funded by Purchaser. Notwithstanding anything else in
this Section 5.13 to the contrary, Purchaser shall not be obligated to pay any
such refund under this Section 5.13 to the extent that any such refund results
from the carrying back of any net operating loss or other Tax attribute or Tax
credit incurred in a taxable period beginning after the Closing Date
(including the portion of any Straddle Period beginning after the Closing
Date). To the extent a refund against Taxes that gave rise to a payment
hereunder is subsequently disallowed or otherwise reduced, Seller shall pay to
Purchaser the amount of such disallowed or reduced refund against Taxes (net
of reasonable fees or expenses incurred).

commercially reasonable cooperation to Purchaser and the Acquired Companies,
at Purchaser's request and direction, in connection with Purchaser's and the
Acquired Companies' prosecution, defense, compromise, settlement and disposal
of the GSF Matter after the Closing, including by timely providing any
information relating to the GSF Matter. In the event that, after Closing, the
GSF Matter is resolved (by settlement, order or otherwise) for an amount below
the GSF Reserve Amount, then Purchaser shall notify Seller within five
Business Days thereof and promptly (but in any event no later than fifteen
(15) Business Days) remit an amount in cash to Seller equal to fifty percent
(50%) of the amount by which the GSF Reserve Amount exceeds the amount of such
resolution.

5.21 Further Assurances. Each of Seller, the Company and Purchaser agrees
that, from time to time before and after the Closing Date, they will execute
and deliver, and Seller shall cause the Acquired Companies (prior to Closing)
and Purchaser shall cause the Acquired Companies (after the Closing) to
execute and deliver, such further instruments, and take, or cause their
respective Affiliates to take, such other action, as may be reasonably
necessary to carry out the purposes and intents of this Agreement. Purchaser,
the Company and Seller agree to use reasonable best efforts to refrain from
taking any action which could reasonably be expected to materially delay the
consummation of the Transaction.





5.22 Transition Services

(a) From and after the date hereof, Seller shall provide or cause to be
provided to Purchaser or the Acquired Companies until expiration of the three-
month transition period immediately following the Closing Date transition
services that are described on Annex A. Purchaser may request an extension in
writing (providing reasonable detail) not later than fifteen (15) Business
Days before the end of such transition period. Purchaser shall provide or
cause to be provided to Seller or its Non-Company Affiliates for the three-
month period immediately following the Closing Date transition services that

Date. The services referred to in this Section 5.22(a) are herein referred to
as the "Transition Services," the recipient of such services as the "Services
Recipient" and the provider of such services as the "Services Provider."

(b) Services Provider shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, perform any
Transition Services provided hereunder in substantially the same quality and
manner as the same or comparable services were provided during the three
(3)-month period preceding the Closing, all during normal business hours and
without interfering with the responsibilities of any applicable employee to
his or her employees; provided, however, that notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, (A) Services Provider and its Affiliates shall not
have any liability to Services Recipient or its Affiliates for any acts or
omissions of Services Provider or its Affiliates in connection with this
Section 5.22 and the Transition Services, (B) Services Recipient shall
indemnify and hold harmless Services Provider and its Affiliates from and
against any and all Losses relating to the Transition Services except to the
extent such Losses were caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct
of Services Provider or its Affiliates, (C) Services Provider shall not be
obligated to retain any employees to provide the Transition Services, and (D)
the exclusive remedy of Services Recipient and its Affiliates against Services
Provider or its Affiliates for breach of this Section 5.22 or otherwise
relating to the Transition Services shall be limited to termination (effective
upon ten (10) days prior written notice) of the affected Transition Service
and, in the case of Services Provider's or its Affiliates' gross negligence or
willful misconduct, monetary damages (but in no event exceeding the amount
paid to Services Provider for such Transition Services under Section 5.22(c)).

(c) Services Recipient, upon not less than ten (10) days written notice to
Service Provider, at any time and from time to time may, as of the date set
forth in such notice (which may not precede the end of such ten (10)-day
period without Service Provider's approval), reduce or terminate its right to
receive (and Service Provider's associated obligations to provide or cause the
provision of) any or all of the applicable Transition Services. Services
Recipient shall reimburse Service Provider for the reasonable hourly salary
and out-of-pocket expenses actually incurred by or on behalf of Service
Provider or its Affiliates attributable to the provision of the Transition
Services (such costs and expenses, the "Direct Costs"). No later than the
fifteenth (15th) Business Day after the end of each calendar month during
which Service Provider or its Affiliates provided Transition Services,
beginning with the calendar month immediately following the Closing, Service
Provider shall submit an invoice to Services Recipient for the Direct Costs
incurred during such calendar month. If the Closing occurs on a day other than
the last day of a month, the invoice for the first month shall be only for
those Transition Services provided from such date until the end of the month
in which the Closing took place. Services Recipient shall pay or cause to be
paid each such invoice it receives within fifteen (15) days after its receipt.

. 57


 

--- 
| | 

| 

(c) by Purchaser or Seller, by written notice, if the Closing Date shall not
have occurred within six (6) months from the date hereof (the "Initial
Termination Date"); provided, however, that the right to terminate the
Agreement under this Section 7.1(c) shall not be available to any Party whose
failure to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement shall have caused or
resulted in the failure of the Closing Date to occur on or before such date;
and provided, further, that if on the Initial Termination Date the conditions
to the Closing set forth in Section 6.1(a) or Section 6.1(b) (in the case of
Section 6.1(b), solely insofar as such order, injunction, Law or regulation
relates to the Required Statutory Approvals) have not been fulfilled but all
other conditions to the Closing (other than those conditions that, by their
terms, cannot be satisfied until the Closing) have been fulfilled (or waived)
or are capable of being fulfilled by such date that is ninety (90) days
following the Initial Termination Date (the "Final Termination Date"), then no
Party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 7.1(c) prior to the Final Termination Date;

(d) by Purchaser, so long as Purchaser is not then in material breach of any
of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements hereunder, by
written notice to Seller, if there shall have been a breach of any
representation or warranty of Seller or the Company, or a breach of any
covenant or agreement of Seller or the Company hereunder, which breach would
result in a failure of a condition set forth in Section 6.2, and such breach
shall not have been remedied within thirty (30) days after receipt by Seller
and/or the Company of notice in writing from Purchaser, specifying the nature
of such breach and requesting that it be remedied, or Purchaser shall not have
received adequate assurance of a cure of such breach within such thirty-day
(30-day) period;

(e) by Seller, so long as Seller or the Company is not then in material breach
of any of their representations, warranties, covenants or agreements

of any representation or warranty, or a breach of any covenant or agreement of
Purchaser hereunder, which breach would result in a failure of a condition set
forth in Section 6.3, and such breach shall not have been remedied within
thirty (30) days after receipt by Purchaser of notice in writing from Seller,
specifying the nature of such breach and requesting that it be remedied or
Seller shall not have received adequate assurance of a cure of such breach
within such thirty-day (30-day) period;

(f) by Seller or Purchaser pursuant to Section 5.18;

satisfied or waived (other than (x) the condition contained in Section 6.1(b)
(due solely to an order, injunction, Law or regulation by any Governmental
Entity in the PRC) and (y) those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing but which conditions would be satisfied or would be
capable of being satisfied if the Closing Date were on the date of



. 58

| 

such termination, or those conditions that have not been satisfied as a result
of a breach by Purchaser); or

(h) . by Purchaser, if a copy of each of the Shareholder Agreement Consents
has not been delivered to Purchaser within the time period prescribed in
Section 5.22.

7.2 Effect of Termination. No termination of this Agreement pursuant to
Section 7.1 shall be effective until notice thereof is given to the non-
terminating Parties specifying the provision hereof pursuant to which such
termination is made. If validly terminated pursuant to Section 7.1, this
Agreement shall become wholly void and of no further force and effect without
liability to any Party or to any Affiliate, or their respective members or
shareholders, directors, officers, employees, agents, advisors or
Representatives, and following such termination no Party shall have any
liability under this Agreement or relating to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement to any other Party; provided that, (i) this Section 7.2 and
Section 5.4(d) (insofar as it relates to information of Purchaser) of this
Agreement shall survive termination hereof, (ii) no such termination shall
relieve any Party from any liability for Willful Breach by such Party prior to
the termination of this Agreement of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement of such Party under this Agreement, and (iii) no such termination
shall relieve Purchaser of its obligation to pay the Purchaser Termination
Fee, if, as and when required pursuant to Section 7.3 (which Section 7.3 shall
survive any such termination). In the event of the termination of this
Agreement as provided in Section 7.1, Purchaser shall redeliver to Seller or
the Company, as the case may be, and will cause its agents to redeliver to
Seller or the Company, as the case may be, all documents, workpapers and other
materials of Seller and the Acquired Companies, relating to any of them and
the transactions contemplated hereby, whether obtained before or after the
execution hereof, and Purchaser shall comply with all of its obligations under
the Confidentiality Agreement.

7.3 Purchaser Termination Fee.

(a) The Parties agree that if this Agreement is terminated:

(i) by Seller or Purchaser pursuant to Section 7.1(b) due to a statute, rule,
regulation, executive order, order, decree, ruling or injunction by any
Governmental Entity in the PRC; or

(ii) by Seller pursuant to Section 7.1(g),

then Purchaser shall, within five (5) Business Days following any such
termination, pay (or cause to be paid) by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account designated in writing by Seller a termination
fee equal to $48,478,988 (the "Purchaser Termination Fee").

(b) For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall Purchaser be obligated to
pay the Purchaser Termination Fee on more than one (1) occasion. Payment of
the Purchaser Termination Fee is not a penalty and shall constitute liquidated
damages as a reasonable amount



. 59


 

--- 
| | 

| 

that will compensate Seller in the circumstances upon which the Purchaser
Termination Fee is payable for the efforts and resources expended and
opportunity foregone with respect to the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby which would otherwise be impossible to calculate with
precision and, except as provided in clauses (i) and (ii) of the proviso of
Section 7.2, from and after such termination as described in Section 7.3(a),
Purchaser shall have no further liability or obligations of any kind in
connection with this Agreement or the termination contemplated hereby other
than as provided under this Section 7.3.

(c) Purchaser acknowledges that the agreement contained in this Section 7.3 is
an integral part of this Agreement and that, without this Section 7.3, Seller
would not have entered into this Agreement. Accordingly, if Purchaser fails to
promptly pay any amount due pursuant to this Section 7.3, Purchaser shall pay
to Seller all reasonable fees, costs and expenses of enforcement (including
reasonable attorney's fees as well as reasonable expenses incurred in
connection with any action initiated by Seller), together with interest on the
amount of the Purchaser Termination Fee at the prime lending rate as published
in The Wall Street Journal, in effect on the date such payment is required to
be made.

warranty or covenant contained herein, unless written notice of such claim or
Action has been given by the Indemnified Party to the Indemnifying Party,
describing in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances with respect to
the subject matter of such claim or Action (or if reasonable detail is not

claim), on or prior to the date on which the representation or warranty on
which such claim or Action is based ceases to survive as set forth in Section
8.1;

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement:

(i) except in the breaches of any Fundamental Representation, the
representations set forth in Sections 2.7 (Brokers and Finders) and 3.21
(Brokers and Finders), or the Tax Reps and Covenants, Seller shall not be
liable for any claim for indemnification pursuant to Section 8.2(a), unless
and until the aggregate amount of indemnifiable Losses that may be recovered

representations set forth in Sections 2.7 (Brokers and Finders) and 3.21

forth in subsection (i) of this Section 8.4(b), other than Losses in excess of
one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) resulting from any single claim or

representations set forth in Sections 2.7 (Brokers and Finders) and 3.21

be affected by any investigation conducted or any knowledge acquired at any
time whether before or after the date hereof or the Closing Date, with respect
to the accuracy or inaccuracy of such representation or warranty; and

8.5 Notice of Loss; Third Party Claims.

(a) Other than with respect to any Third Party Claim that is provided for in
Section 8.5(b), an Indemnified Party shall give the Indemnifying Party notice
of any matter that an Indemnified Party has determined has given rise to a
right of indemnification under this Article VIII, promptly after such
determination, stating the amount of the Losses, if known, and method of
computation thereof, and containing a reference to the provisions of this
Agreement in respect of which such right of indemnification is claimed or
arises; provided, however, that the failure to provide such notice shall not
release the Indemnifying Party from any of its obligations under this Article
VIII, except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is actually and
materially prejudiced by such failure.

(b) If an Indemnified Party shall receive notice of any Action, audit, claim,
demand or assessment (each, a "Third Party Claim") against it that may give
rise to a claim for Losses under this Article VIII, promptly after the receipt
of such notice, the Indemnified Party shall give the Indemnifying Party notice
of such Third Party Claim (a "Claim Notice"); provided, however, that the
failure to provide such notice shall not release the Indemnifying Party from
any of its obligations under this Article VIII, except to the extent that the
Indemnifying Party is actually and materially prejudiced by such failure. The
Indemnifying Party shall be entitled, to the extent permitted by applicable
Law, to assume and control the defense of such Third Party Claim at its
expense and through counsel of its choice (reasonably acceptable to the
Indemnified Party), if it gives notice of its intention to do so to the
Indemnified Party within thirty (30) days of its receipt of the Claim Notice;
provided that the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to assume control
of such defense and shall pay (x) the fees and expenses of counsel retained by
the Indemnified Party and (y) in the case of Third Party Claims relating to a
claim made by a Governmental Entity, the cost of posting a bond or other
security in connection with such Third Party Claim, if (A) such Third



. 63


 

--- 
| | 

| 

Party Claim for indemnification relates to or arises in connection with any
criminal Action; (B) such Third Party Claim seeks an injunction or equitable
relief against the Indemnified Party; (C) such Third Party Claim is reasonably
foreseeable to result in Losses which are more than 200% of the remaining
applicable indemnifiable amount pursuant to this Article VIII at the time such
claim is submitted by the Indemnified Party; (D) such Third Party Claim
relates to a claim made by a Governmental Entity; (E) such Third Party Claim
relates to or arises in connection with customers, suppliers or senior
management of the Acquired Companies, or (F) such Third Party Claim relates to
any of the Actions set forth on Schedule 8.2(f) of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule or on Schedule 8.2(g) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule.

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the actual or potential defendants in,
or targets of, such Third Party Claim include both the Indemnifying Party and
the Indemnified Party, and the Indemnified Party shall have reasonably
concluded that there exists an actual conflict of interest between them
(including one or more legal defenses available to the Indemnified Party which
are not available to the Indemnifying Party) or is reasonably likely to
develop during the pendency of the litigation that would make it inappropriate
in the reasonable judgment of the Indemnified Party for the same counsel to
represent both the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party, then the
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to retain one counsel (plus one local
counsel, if necessary) reasonably acceptable to the Indemnifying Party, at the
expense of the Indemnifying Party; provided that the Indemnified Party and
such counsel shall use diligent and good faith efforts in such defense.

defense and settlement of any Third Party Claim and make available to the

that such access shall not unduly interrupt the Indemnified Party's
businesses. Any settlement or compromise of such Third Party Claim by the
Indemnifying Party shall require the prior written consent of the Indemnified
Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed; provided, further, that no such consent shall be required as long as

Party.

Third Party Claim as provided in Section 8.5(b), then the Indemnified Party

| 

the written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, unless, that in such event, the
Indemnified Party shall waive any right to indemnity therefor by the
Indemnifying Party for such Third Party Claim. In such event, the Indemnifying
Party shall cooperate with the Indemnified Party in the defense and settlement
of any Third Party Claim and make available to the Indemnified Party all
witnesses, pertinent records, materials and information in the Indemnifying
Party's possession or under the Indemnifying Party's control relating thereto
as is reasonably required by the Indemnified Party; provided that such access
shall not unduly interrupt the Indemnifying Party's businesses. The
Indemnified Party shall not pay, or permit to be paid, any part of such Third
Party Claim unless (i) the Indemnifying Party consents in writing to such
payment, (ii) a final judgment from which no appeal may be taken by or on
behalf of the Indemnifying Party has been entered against the Indemnified
Party for such Third Party Claim or (iii) the Indemnified Party waives in
writing its right to indemnification hereunder with respect to such Third
Party Claim.

(f) With respect to any Tax Matter, the provisions of Section 5.13(e), and not
this Section 8.5 (except Section 8.5(g)) shall control to the extent of any
conflict between such provisions. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, with
respect to any Third Party Claim and any Tax Matter, if there is any conflict
between Section 8.5(g) and any other provision herein (including Section
5.13(e)), Section 8.5(g) shall govern in all events.

(g) The defense of proceedings related to any Third Party Claims and any Tax
Matter that may affect the ability of the Acquired Companies and/or the
Purchaser to obtain clearance certificates (or positive certificates with
clearance effects) of debts or obligations owed to Governmental Authorities
(including without limitation Tax debts, Taxes and sector charges), shall be
conducted through the adoption of any and all measure necessary to maintain
the suspension of the applicability (in Portuguese, "suspensao de
exigibilidade") of any liability or obligation under discussion, allowing for
the issuance of said certificates. If, at any time, the applicability of any
liability is no longer suspended or the obtaining of certificates is impaired,
the Indemnifying Party, or the Seller in the case of a Tax Matter contested in
accordance with Section 5.13(e)(i), shall have a maximum period of ten (10)
days from the knowledge by the Indemnifying Party, or the Seller in the case
of a Tax Matter contested in accordance with Section 5.13(e)(i), to perform
any act necessary to reverse the situation. In case there is a need obtain
certificates that allow the Acquired Companies and/or Purchaser to participate
in tenders, enter into agreements or enjoy relevant rights, and it is not
possible to obtain them with at least ten (10) days before the date when they
shall be presented, the Indemnified Party, or the Purchaser in the case of a
Tax Matter contested in accordance with Section 5.13(e)(i), shall notify the
Indemnifying Party, or the Seller in the case of a Tax Matter contested in
accordance with Section 5.13(e)(i), so that the latter may obtain, within
three (3) days from the receipt of such notification, the suspension of the
enforceability of credit or obligation in order to allow the effective
issuance of the referred certificates. In case the Indemnifying Party, or the
Seller in the case of a Tax Matter contested in accordance with Section
5.13(e)(i), does not



. 65


 

--- 
| | 

| 

obtain such suspension in the referred term, (i) in the case of a Third Party
Claim, the Indemnified Party may revoke the power of attorney granted to the
lawyer responsible for the defense, and (ii) in the case of Tax Matter
contested in accordance with Section 5.13(e)(i), the Seller shall no longer
control the resolution of such Tax Matter and the provisions of Section
5.13(e)(ii) shall apply, and/or adopt the measures required to obtain the
suspension of the enforceability of credit and the referred certificates,
being fully indemnified, in accordance with this Agreement, for amounts paid
and other costs relating to the proceedings, regardless of any discussion
about the efficiency or convenience of the payment or any other act performed
in this respect. In any case, the reasonable costs associated with the legal
fees of the defense, after it is assumed by the Indemnified Party or the
Purchaser, as the case may be, shall still be subject to indemnification to
the Indemnified Party or the Purchaser, as the case may be, in accordance with
the provisions in this Agreement.

8.6 Mitigation; Adjustments.

(a) Each Indemnified Party shall use its reasonable best efforts to mitigate
any Losses under this Article VIII (which efforts in no event shall include
commencement of litigation against any Person). In the event an Indemnified
Party fails to so mitigate an indemnifiable Loss, the Indemnifying Party shall
have no Liability for any portion of such Loss that reasonably would have been
avoided had the Indemnified Party made such efforts. Purchaser shall, and
shall cause the Acquired Companies to, reasonably cooperate with Seller in
recovering from any third parties (including with respect to enforcement of
any Acquired Company's indemnification rights) any Loss paid by Seller
pursuant to this Article VIII.

(b) In calculating the amount of any Loss under this Article VIII, the
proceeds actually received by the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates
under any third-party insurance policy, or pursuant to any claim, recovery,
settlement or payment by or against any other Person, net of any actual costs,
expenses or premiums incurred in connection with securing or obtaining such
proceeds, shall be deducted from such Loss or indemnification payment.

(c) The amount of any Damages incurred by the Indemnified Party shall be
reduced by the amount of any Tax benefit attributable to such Damages that are
actually realized by the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates through a
reduction in cash Tax payments that otherwise would have been required to be
made by such Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates, as the case may be,
on or before the end of the taxable year in which indemnification is sought or
in the taxable year immediately following such taxable year; provided,
however, that for the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall such Indemnified
Party (or its applicable Affiliate) be required to disclose any information it
deems confidential, including its tax returns and its calculations.



. 66

| | 

| 

(d) Purchaser and Seller agree to treat, and to cause their respective

VIII, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable Law, as an adjustment to

intentional fraud, (a) this Article VIII shall be the exclusive remedy of the
Parties hereto following the Closing for any Losses arising out of any breach
or inaccuracy of the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of
the Parties contained in this Agreement, and (b) each of the Parties hereto
hereby waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any and all
rights, claims and causes of action it may have against the other Parties
hereto with respect to any breach or inaccuracy of the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements of the Parties contained in this
Agreement, arising under or based upon any Law or Governmental Order, other
than the right to seek indemnity pursuant to this Article VIII.

Actions, causes of action, promises and/or Liabilities of every kind or
character whatsoever, whether in law or in equity, the same may owe or have to
the Acquired Companies in his or her capacity as a director or officer thereof
arising on or before the Closing, other than liabilities arising from his or
her gross negligence, recklessness, criminal conduct or self-dealing.

(b) Effective on the Closing, the Seller, on behalf of itself and its
Affiliates, hereby completely and irrevocably releases, holds harmless and
forever discharges Purchaser, each Acquired Company and each of their
respective post-Closing Affiliates, from any and all claims, damages, Losses,
demands, Actions, causes of action, promises and/or Liabilities of every kind
or character whatsoever, whether in law or in equity, to the extent arising
out of Seller or any of its Affiliates having been an equity, debt or option
holder of any of the Acquired Companies, including, without limitation, any
such claims, damages, Losses, demands, Actions, promises with respect to

10.2 Amendments and Waivers. Any provision of this Agreement may be amended or
waived if, but only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and is signed,
in the case of an amendment, by each Party to this Agreement, or in the case
of a waiver, by the Party against whom the waiver is to be effective. Any

Transactions, this Agreement may not be assigned by a Party by operation of
Law or otherwise without the express written consent of the other Party, and

provided, however, that no such assignment shall relieve Purchaser of any of
its obligations hereunder, and (b) Purchaser or any such Affiliate or designee
or co-investor may collaterally assign its rights hereunder to its financing
sources and lenders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if such an assignment
occurs, Purchaser shall notify Seller in writing thereof and Seller
acknowledges and agrees that Purchaser shall have the sole right to exercise
any and all rights of any such assignee under or in connection with this
Agreement, including, without limitation, (i) any consent to any amendment,
supplement or modification of this Agreement, (ii) the granting of any waivers
or consents, (iii) the determination of whether all of the conditions
precedent to the obligations of Purchaser to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement have been satisfied (or whether any unsatisfied
condition precedent shall be waived such that Purchaser shall be obligated to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) and (iv) whether
to terminate this Agreement in any circumstance in which Purchaser is entitled
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to its terms. In addition,
notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller may conclusively rely upon, without
independent verification or investigation, all decisions made by and all
actions taken or omitted to be taken by Purchaser on behalf of any assignee
pursuant to or under this Agreement, whether or not Purchaser assigns any of
its rights or obligations hereunder to one or more of its Affiliates or
designees or co-investors. Subject to the preceding sentences,



. 82


 

--- 
| | 

| 

this Agreement shall be binding upon, and shall inure to the benefit of, the
Parties and their respective successors and assigns (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, successor(s) or assign(s) of Seller as a result of the
Restructuring Transactions).

10.4 Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial.

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the
Laws of the State of New York, without regard to the conflict of laws rules
thereof.

(b) All actions or proceedings arising out of or relating to this Agreement or
any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be heard and
determined exclusively in any federal court sitting in the Borough of

court does not have jurisdiction over such action or proceeding, such action
or proceeding shall be heard and determined exclusively in any state court
sitting in the Borough of Manhattan of The City of New York. Consistent with
the preceding sentence, the Parties hereby (i) irrevocably submit to the
exclusive jurisdiction of any federal or New York state court sitting in the
Borough of Manhattan of The City of New York for the purpose of any action or
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement brought by any Party,
(ii) irrevocably waive, and agree not to assert by way of motion, defense or
otherwise, in any such action or proceeding, any claim that it is not subject
personally to the jurisdiction of the above-named courts, that its property is
exempt or immune from attachment or execution, that the action or proceeding
is brought in an inconvenient forum, that the venue of the action or
proceeding is improper, or that this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement may not be enforced in or by any of the above-
named courts and (iii) irrevocably consent to and grant any such court
exclusive jurisdiction over the Person of such Parties and over the subject
matter of such action or proceeding and agree that mailing of process or other
papers in connection with any such action or proceeding in the manner provided
in Section 10.1 or in such other manner as may be permitted by applicable Law
shall be valid and sufficient service thereof.

(c) EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES
TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A
TRIAL BY JURY WITH RESPECT TO ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY
ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH (i) THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT OR (ii) ANY FINANCING WHETHER NOW
EXISTING OR HEREAFTER PROVIDED OR COMMITTED TO BE PROVIDED. EACH OF THE
PARTIES HERETO HEREBY (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY
OF THE OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER

AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT HAS BEEN



. 83


 

--- 
| | 

| 

INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS
AGREEMENT, AS APPLICABLE, BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND
CERTIFICATIONS CONTAINED IN THIS SECTION 10.4(c).

10.5 Specific Performance. The Parties recognize and agree that if for any
reason any of the provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance
with their specific terms or are otherwise breached, immediate and irreparable
harm or damage would be caused for which money damages would not be an
adequate remedy. Accordingly, each Party agrees that, in addition to any other
available remedies, each Party shall be entitled to seek to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement or to seek an
injunction restraining any breach or violation or threatened breach or
violation of any of the provisions of this Agreement without the necessity of
posting a bond or other form of security. In the event that any action or
proceeding should be brought in equity to enforce the provisions of this
Agreement, no Party shall allege, and each Party hereby waives the defense,
that there is an adequate remedy at Law.

10.6 Waiver.

(a) It is acknowledged by the Parties that Seller and the Company have used or
retained the counsel set forth in Schedule 10.6 of the Seller Disclosure
Schedules to act as their counsel in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement ("Seller Counsels") and that Seller Counsels
have not acted as counsel for any other Person in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement for conflict of interest or any
other purposes. Purchaser agrees that any attorney-client privilege and the
expectation of client confidence attaching as a result of Seller Counsels'
representation of Seller and the Company related to the preparation for, and
negotiation and consummation of, the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including all communications among Seller Counsels and Seller, the
Acquired Companies and/or their respective Affiliates in preparation for, and
negotiation and consummation of, the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, shall survive the Closing and shall remain in effect. Furthermore,
effective as of the Closing, (i) all communications (and materials relating
thereto) between the Acquired Companies, on the one hand, and Seller Counsels
or any other legal counsel or financial advisor, on the other hand, related to
the preparation for, and negotiation and consummation of, the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement are hereby assigned and transferred to Seller,
(ii) the Acquired Companies hereby release all of their rights and interests
to and in such communications and related materials and (iii) the Acquired
Companies hereby release any right to assert or waive any privilege related to
the communications referenced in this Section 10.6; except, in each case, with
respect to or in connection with any request by Governmental Entities,
provided that Purchaser shall have used commercially reasonable efforts to
resist such request.

(b) Purchaser agrees that, notwithstanding any current or prior representation
of the Acquired Companies by Seller Counsels, Seller Counsels shall be allowed
to



. 84


 

--- 
| | 

| 

represent Seller or any of its Affiliates in any matters and disputes adverse
to Purchaser and/or the Acquired Companies that either is existing on the date
hereof or arises in the future and relates to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby; and Purchaser and the Acquired Companies
hereby waive any conflicts or claim of privilege that may arise in connection
with such representation. Further, Purchaser agrees that, in the event that a
dispute arises after the Closing between Purchaser or the Company and Seller
or any of its Affiliates, Seller Counsels may represent Seller or its
Affiliate in such dispute even though the interests of Seller or its Affiliate
may be directly adverse to Purchaser or the Acquired Companies and even though
Seller Counsels may have represented the Acquired Companies in a matter
substantially related to such dispute.

(c) Purchaser acknowledges that any advice given to or communication with
Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than the Acquired Companies) by Seller
Counsels shall not be subject to any joint privilege and shall be owned solely
by Seller or its Affiliates; except, in each case, with respect to or in
connection with any request by Governmental Entities, provided that Purchaser
shall have used commercially reasonable efforts to resist such request.
Purchaser hereby acknowledges that it has had the opportunity to discuss and
obtain adequate information concerning the significance and material risks of,
and reasonable available alternatives to, the waivers, permissions and other
provisions of this Agreement, including the opportunity to consult with
counsel other than Seller Counsels.

10.7 Entire Agreement; Severability.

(a) This Agreement, the Disclosure Schedules, the Seller Guaranty, the
Purchaser Guaranty and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire
agreement between the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and
supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both oral and written,
between the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof.

(b) If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced by any Law or public policy, all of the other
terms and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force
and effect. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall negotiate
in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of
the Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order for the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated as originally
contemplated to the greatest extent possible.



10.8 Disclosure Schedules. There may be included in the Seller Disclosure
Schedules or the Purchaser Disclosure Schedules (collectively, the "Disclosure
Schedules") items and information, the disclosure of which is not required
either in response to an express disclosure



. 85


 

--- 
| | 

| 

requirement contained in a provision hereof or as an exception to one or more
representations or warranties contained in Article II, Article III or Article
IV or to one or more covenants contained in Article V. Inclusion of any items
or information in the Disclosure Schedules shall not be deemed to be an
acknowledgment or agreement that any such item or information (or any non-
disclosed item or information of comparable or greater significance) is
"material" or constitutes a Company Material Adverse Effect or to affect the
interpretation of such term for purposes of this Agreement. The Disclosure
Schedules set forth items of disclosure with specific reference to the
particular Section and/or subsection of this Agreement to which the items or
information in such Disclosure Schedules relates; provided, however, that any
information set forth in one section or subsection pertaining to the
representations, warranties and covenants of the Seller Disclosure Schedules
or the Purchaser Disclosure Schedules, as the case may be, shall be deemed to
apply to each other section or subsection thereof pertaining to
representations, warranties and covenants to the extent that it is reasonably
apparent on its face that it is relevant to such other sections or subsections
of the Seller Disclosure Schedules or the Purchaser Disclosure Schedules, as
the case may be. Any action taken by Seller or an Acquired Company in
compliance with the covenants set forth in Sections 5.1(a)(ii) through (xvi)
(including if the actions set forth in Sections 5.1(a)(ii) through (xvi) are
taken with Purchaser's prior written consent) shall be deemed to automatically
update the relevant sections of the Seller Disclosure Schedules (corresponding
to ARTICLE II and ARTICLE III hereof) for all purposes under this Agreement.

10.9 No Third Party Beneficiaries. Except as provided in Section 5.7, this
Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of the Parties
and their respective successors and permitted assigns, and nothing herein,
express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other Person other
than Seller, Purchaser and their respective successors and permitted assigns,
any legal or equitable right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under
or by reason of this Agreement.

10.10 Expenses. Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, all costs and
expenses (including fees and expenses of counsel and financial advisors)
incurred in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby shall be paid by the Party incurring such costs or expenses, whether or
not the Closing shall have occurred, except that costs incurred by the
Acquired Companies in connection with all filing and court fees shall be
shared one-half by Seller and one-half by Purchaser.

10.11 Currency. All amounts payable to or by any Party under this Agreement
shall be paid in United States dollars, unless otherwise expressly specified.
All amounts set forth in this Agreement are denominated in United States
dollars unless otherwise expressly specified. In the event any conversion
between United States dollars and another currency is required in connection
with this Agreement for any reason, other than as otherwise specified in this
Agreement or the Seller Disclosure Schedules, such conversion shall be based
on the average of the exchange rates for such



. 86


 

--- 
| | 

| 

conversion published in The Wall Street Journal on each of the five (5)
Business Days preceding October 8, 2016 or such other day on which this
Agreement or the Disclosure Schedules specify such conversion is to be
calculated (provided that it is acknowledged that the Seller Disclosure
Schedules were prepared based on the average of the exchange rates for such
conversion published in The Wall Street Journal on each of the five (5)
Business Days preceding March 31, 2016). If The Wall Street Journal is not
published on the Business Day in question, then the exchange rate published in
The New York Times on such Business Day shall be used or, if neither The Wall
Street Journal nor The New York Times is published on such Business Day, then
the exchange rate quoted on such Business Day, or quoted on the nearest
Business Day preceding such Business Day, by Citibank, N.A. (or its successor)
in New York City, New York, shall be used.

10.12 Sovereign Immunity Waiver. Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that the
transactions contemplated by the provisions of this Agreement are commercial
in nature rather than governmental or public, and acknowledges and agrees that
it is not entitled to any right of immunity on the grounds of sovereignty or
otherwise with respect to such activities or in any legal action or proceeding
arising out of or relating to this Agreement in respect of itself or its
properties and revenues. Purchaser expressly and irrevocably waives any right
of immunity which may now or hereafter exist (including any immunity from any
legal process, from the jurisdiction of any court or from any attachment prior
to judgment, attachment in aid of execution, execution or otherwise), and
agrees not to assert, and to ensure that no person asserts on its behalf, any
such right or claim in any such action or proceeding, whether in the United
States of America or otherwise.

10.13 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed and delivered (including by
facsimile or other electronic transmission) in one or more counterparts, and
each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original, but all of
which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement. The
facsimile or other electronic transmission of any signed original counterpart
of this Agreement shall be deemed to be the delivery of an original
counterpart of this Agreement.

10.14 Acknowledgment. The Company hereby acknowledges the sale and purchase of
the Company Shares under the terms and conditions of this Agreement for the
purposes of article 190 of the Luxembourg law on commercial companies dated 10
August 1915, as amended, and of article 1690 of the Luxembourg civil code.
