required under the Law (provided that, if required under Law, the Company will
use commercially reasonable efforts to give the Parent and the Purchaser
a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any such submissions,
applications, notifications, filings, or representations). Despite the
foregoing, submissions, filings or other written communications with any
Governmental Entity may be redacted as necessary before sharing with the
other Party to address reasonable attorney-client or other privilege or
confidentiality concerns; _provided however_ , that a Party must provide

necessary or advisable. In such case, the Parties will cooperate in the
preparation, filing and dissemination, as applicable, of any such amendment or
supplement. 
---|--- 



   (5) | The Parties will request that the Required Regulatory Approvals
be processed by the applicable Governmental Entity on an expedited basis and,
to the extent that a public hearing is held, the Parties will request
the earliest possible hearing date for the consideration of the Required
Regulatory Approvals. 
---|--- 



   (6) | If any objections are asserted with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement under any Law, or if any proceeding is
instituted or threatened by any Governmental Entity challenging or which could
lead to a challenge of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
as not in compliance with Law or as not satisfying any applicable legal text
under a Law necessary to obtain the Required Regulatory Approvals, the Parties
will use their reasonable commercial efforts consistent with the terms of
this Agreement to resolve such proceeding so as to allow the Effective Time to
occur on or prior to the Outside Date.

agreement, or action required to obtain and maintain such Required Regulatory
Approvals and, in furtherance of the obligations of the Parent and the
Purchaser in relation to the ICA Approval, the Parent and the Purchaser agree
and acknowledge that reasonable best efforts will include, if requested,
entering into written undertakings with Her Majesty the Queen in right of
Canada as may be required to secure the ICA Approval; _provided however_ ,
that neither the Parent nor the Purchaser will be required to make or agree
to any undertaking, agreement or action where such undertaking, agreement or
action would give rise to a Material Adverse Effect to the Company and its
Subsidiaries, considered as a whole.  
---|--- 



   (8) | The Parent and the Purchaser will be jointly and severally
responsible for and will pay any and all filing fees and applicable Taxes
payable to a Governmental Entity by any of the Company or its Subsidiaries
in connection with any application, notification or filing in respect of any
of the Required Regulatory Approvals. 
---|--- 



   Section 4.3 | Performance of Obligations.

performed by each of them and their respective Subsidiaries under
this Agreement, cooperate with each other in connection therewith and do all
such other acts and things as may be necessary or desirable in order to
consummate and make effective, as soon as reasonably practicable, the
Transactions contemplated hereby and, without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the Company will and, where appropriate, will cause its
Subsidiaries to:

and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole; or (ii) any written notice or other
communication received by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries from any
Person, subsequent to the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time,

to any Acquisition Proposal unless it is a Superior Proposal and the Matching

providing therefor.

promptly to the Parent all information concerning its business, properties

4.4(1) will be provided during the Companys normal business hours only; and
(iii) the Companys compliance with any request under this Section 4.4(1) will

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Parent and the Company
will reasonably cooperate and consult, acting in good faith, with respect to
the Parents ability to access the Companys properties.  
---|--- 



   (2) | The Purchaser acknowledges that the Confidentiality Agreement
continues to apply and that any requests for information and any information
provided pursuant to Section 4.4(1) will be subject to the terms of
the Confidentiality Agreement.

   Section 4.6 | Bump Transactions

("Bump Transactions") and the Company agrees to provide reasonable
cooperation and use reasonable commercial efforts to provide information
reasonably required by the Purchaser in this regard on a timely basis and to
assist in the obtaining of any such information in order to facilitate a
successful completion of the Bump Transactions. The Company also agrees, to
the extent that there is a change in Law that would preclude the Purchaser
from completing, or that would have the effect of denying the Parent or the
Purchaser the expected benefit from, any Bump Transactions, to amend the Plan
of Arrangement as necessary to effect any Bump Transactions; _provided_
_however_ , that: (i) the Bump Transactions are not prejudicial to Company
Securityholders (having regard to the indemnities provided herein); (ii) the
Bump Transactions do not impair the ability of the Parent or the Purchaser to
complete the Arrangement or delay the completion of the Arrangement; (iii) the
Bump Transactions are effected as close as reasonably practicable prior to
the Effective Time; (iv) none of the Company or its Subsidiaries is required
to take any action that would reasonably be expected to result in Taxes being

Securityholder incrementally greater than the Taxes or other consequences to
such party in connection with the completion of the Arrangement in the absence
of action being taken pursuant to this Section 4.6; (v) the Bump Transactions
do not result in any material breach by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
of any Contract or any breach by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of
their respective Organizational Documents or Law; and 

 



35  (vi) the completion of the Bump Transactions is conditional on completion of
the Arrangement as a whole and will not become effective unless the Parent and
the Purchaser each has waived or confirmed in writing the satisfaction of all
conditions in its favour under Section 6.1 and Section 6.2 and will have
confirmed in writing that each of them is prepared to promptly and without
condition (other than compliance with this Section 4.6) proceed to effect the
Arrangement. The Parent and the Purchaser waive any breach of a
representation, warranty or covenant by the Company, where such breach is a
result of an action taken by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in good
faith pursuant to a request by the Purchaser in accordance with this Section
4.6. The Purchaser will provide written notice to the Company of any proposed
Bump Transaction at least 10 Business Days prior to the Effective Time.
Upon receipt of such notice, the Purchaser and the Company will work co-
operatively and use reasonable commercial efforts to prepare prior to the
Effective Time all documentation necessary and do all such other acts and
things as are reasonably necessary, including making amendments to this
Agreement or the Plan of Arrangement ( _provided however_ , that such
amendments do not require the Company to obtain approval of Company
Securityholders (other than as properly put forward and approved at the
Company Meeting)), to give effect to such Bump Transactions. If the
Arrangement is not completed, other than due to a breach by the Company of the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Purchaser will: (x) forthwith
reimburse the Company for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs
and expenses incurred in connection with any proposed Bump Transaction; and
(y) indemnify the Company for any losses or costs (other than those reimbursed
in accordance with the foregoing) incurred by the Company and arising directly
out of any Bump Transaction, other than loss of profit and other indirect or
consequential damages and provided that such amendment does not require the
approval of the Company Securityholders.



   Section 4.7 | Public and Employee Communications 
---|--- 



   (1) | The Parties will agree on a communication plan in connection
with: (a) the execution of this Agreement; and/or (b) the completion of the
Transactions. Except as required by Law, a Party must not issue any press
release or make any other public statement or disclosure with respect to this
Agreement or the Arrangement without the consent of the other Party (which
consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed); _provided however_ ,
that any Party that, in the opinion of its legal counsel, is required to make
disclosure by Law will use its reasonable commercial efforts to give the other
Party prior oral or written notice and a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment on the disclosure. The Party making such disclosure will give
reasonable consideration to any comments made by the other Party or its
counsel, and if such prior notice is not possible, will give such notice
immediately following the making of such disclosure and will consult with
each other in connection with any other external communication with respect to
the Transactions; _provided_ _further_ , that, in each case, nothing will
restrict a Party from responding to inquiries from investors or financial
analysts in compliance with Securities Law requirements; and, _provided
further_ , that each Party is expressly permitted to hold a public call with
its investment community to discuss the Transactions and related matters.

such comments in good faith; and (d) the Parent and the Company will
cooperate in providing any such mutually agreeable communication.

   Section 4.8 | Insurance and Indemnification 
---|--- 



   (1) | From and after the Effective Time, each of the Parent and the
Company agrees that it will indemnify and hold harmless each present and
former director and officer (which for the purposes of this Section
4.8, includes all individuals listed under the definition of "Companys
Knowledge") of the Company (in each case, when acting in such capacity),
determined as of the Effective Time (the "Indemnified Persons"), against
any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments,
fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any
Action, arising out of matters existing or occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Effective Time, to the fullest extent that the Company would have been
permitted under the CBCA, applicable Law and its Organizational Documents in
effect on the date hereof to indemnify such Person (and the Parent or the
Company will also advance expenses as incurred to the fullest extent permitted
under Law; _provided_ _however_ , that the Person to whom expenses are
advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if and when a court
of competent jurisdiction ultimately determines in a non-appealable ruling
that such Person is not entitled to indemnification). 
---|--- 
 



   (2) | Any Indemnified Person wishing to claim indemnification under
paragraph (1) of this Section 4.8, upon learning of any such Action, will
promptly notify the Parent thereof, but the failure to so notify will
not relieve the Parent or the Company of any liability it may have to such
Indemnified Person except to the extent such failure materially prejudices the
indemnifying Party. In the event of any such Action (whether arising before or
after the Effective Time): (a) the Parent or the Company will have the right
to assume the defense thereof, and the Parent and the Company will not be
liable to such Indemnified Persons for any legal expenses of other counsel or
any other expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Persons in
connection with the defense thereof, except that if the Parent or the Company
elects not to assume such defense or counsel for the Indemnified Persons
advises in writing that there are conflicts of interest between the Parent or
the Company and the Indemnified Persons, the Indemnified Persons may retain
counsel satisfactory to them, and the Parent or the Company will pay all
reasonable documented fees and expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified
Persons promptly as statements therefor are received; _provided however_ ,
that the Parent and the Company will be obligated pursuant to this paragraph
(2) to pay for only one firm of counsel for all Indemnified Persons in any
jurisdiction unless the use of one counsel for such Indemnified Persons would
present such counsel with a conflict of interest; _provided further_ , that
the fewest number of counsels necessary to avoid conflicts of interest will be
used; (b) the Indemnified Persons will reasonably cooperate in the defense of
any such matter; and (c) the Parent and the Company will not be liable for any
settlement effected without their prior written consent (not to be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned); and, _provided further_ ,
that the Parent and the Company will not have any obligation hereunder to any
Indemnified Person if and when a court of competent jurisdiction will
ultimately determine, and such determination will have become final, that the
indemnification of such Indemnified Person in the manner contemplated hereby
is prohibited by Law. 
---|--- 
 



37 Company is unable to, the Parent will cause the Company as of the Effective
Time to, obtain and fully pay for "tail" insurance policies with a
claims period of at least six years from and after the Effective Time from an
insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Companys
current insurance carrier with respect to directors and officers liability
insurance and fiduciary liability insurance (collectively, "DandO Insurance")
with benefits and levels of coverage at least as favourable as the Companys
existing policies with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time (including in connection with this Agreement, the
Transactions or actions contemplated hereby); _provided_ _however_ , that in
no event will the Company expend for such policies a premium amount in excess
of 300% of the annual premium currently paid by the Company in respect of its
current DandO Insurance coverage. If the Company and the Parent for any reason
fail to obtain such "tail" insurance policies as of the Effective Time, the
Company will, and the Parent will cause the Company to, continue to maintain
in effect for a period of at least six years from and after the Effective Time
the DandO Insurance in place as of the date hereof with benefits and levels of
coverage at least as favourable as provided in the Companys existing
policies as of the date hereof, or the Company will, and the Parent will cause
the Company to, use reasonable commercial efforts to purchase comparable DandO
Insurance for such six-year period with benefits and levels of coverage at
least as favourable as provided in the Companys existing policies as of the
date hereof; _provided further_ that in no event will the Parent or
the Company be required to expend for such policies an annual premium amount
in excess of 300% of the annual premiums currently paid by the Company for
such insurance; _provided further_ that if the annual premiums of such
insurance coverage exceed such amount, the Company will obtain a policy with
the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding such amount.

   (4) | If the Parent or the Company or any of their respective
successors or assigns: (a) will consolidate with or merge into any other
corporation or entity and will not be the continuing or surviving corporation
or entity of such consolidation or merger; or (b) will transfer all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, corporation or
other entity, then, and in each such case, proper provisions will be made so
that the successors and assigns of the Parent or the Company will assume all
of the obligations set forth in this Section 4.8. 
---|--- 



   (5) | The provisions of this Section 4.8 are intended to be for the
benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Persons.

   (6) | The rights of the Indemnified Person under this Section 4.8 are
in addition to any rights such Indemnified Person may have under the
Organizational Documents of the Company, or under any applicable Contracts
or Laws, which rights will be honoured by each of, and not derogated from any
of, the Parent, the Purchaser and the Company. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, the limits and obligations tied to the rights set out in
this Section 4.8 will not limit or otherwise prejudice any rights the
Indemnified Person may have under such Organizational Documents, Contracts or
Laws. 
---|--- 
 



38 ---|--- 

The Parties will use their respective reasonable commercial efforts to
prevent the entry of (and, if entered, to have vacated, lifted, reversed or
overturned) any Order that results from any shareholder litigation or Order
issued by any Governmental Entity against the Parties or any of their
respective directors or officers relating to this Agreement or the
Transactions; _provided however_ , that in the event that any shareholder
litigation or Order issued by any Governmental Entity related to this
Agreement or the Transactions is brought, or, to the knowledge of such party,
threatened in writing, against the Parties or any members of the Board of such
Party after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time ("Transaction
Litigation"): (a) the Party will promptly notify the other Parties of any
such Transaction Litigation and will keep the other Parties reasonably
informed with respect to the status thereof; (b) the Party will give the other
Parties the opportunity to participate in the defense of any Transaction
Litigation; and (c) the Party will not settle or agree to settle any
Transaction Litigation without the other Parties prior written consent, such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.

Purchaser of the Existing Credit Facility, the Company will: (i) deliver all
notices and use reasonable commercial efforts to take all other actions

thereafter) (the "Payoff Amount"); (B) state that upon receipt of the Payoff
Amount, the Existing Credit Facility and related notes, guaranties, security
agreements and other instruments supporting the repayment of the Existing

of the Existing Credit Facility survive such termination); and (C) state that
all Liens on the assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries securing
the obligations under the Existing Credit Facility will be, upon the payment
by the Company or the Parent of the Payoff Amount on the Closing Date,
released. If the Arrangement is not completed, other than due to a breach by
the Company of the terms and conditions of this Agreement or the termination
of this Agreement pursuant to a Termination Fee Event, the Purchaser will
forthwith reimburse the Company for all reasonable and documented out-of-
pocket costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Section 4.10.

---|--- 



   (1) | The Company will: (i) immediately cease and cause to be
terminated any activities, discussions or negotiations that may be ongoing

material portion of their respective assets, return or destroy all non-public
information heretofore furnished to such Person by or on behalf of it or any
of its Subsidiaries; and (iii) enforce and not waive (and cause its
Subsidiaries to enforce and not waive) the terms of any such confidentiality
agreement and any standstill agreement to which it (or any of its
Subsidiaries) is a party relating to an actual or potential Acquisition

Time or, if earlier, the termination of this Agreement in accordance with
Article 7, the Company and its Subsidiaries will not, and the Company will not
permit its and its Subsidiaries respective Representatives to, directly or
indirectly:  
---|--- 



     | (a) | solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage or otherwise
facilitate (including by way of furnishing any non-public information) any
inquiry, proposal or offer that constitutes or may reasonably be expected to
lead to, an Acquisition Proposal; 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | engage or participate in any discussions or negotiations
regarding any Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ _however_ , that the Company
may ascertain facts from the Person making such Acquisition Proposal for
the sole purpose of the Board informing itself about such Acquisition
Proposal and the Person that made it; 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | (i) withhold, withdraw, modify or qualify, or publicly
propose to withhold, withdraw, modify or qualify, the Board Recommendation;

the same effect; or (iii) accept, approve, endorse or recommend, or publicly
propose to accept, approve, endorse or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal
(the actions in this clause (c), an "Adverse Recommendation Change"); or 
---|---|--- 



     | (d) | approve, endorse, recommend or enter into or publicly
propose to approve, endorse, recommend or enter into, any agreement, any
letter of intent, understanding, agreement or arrangement (other than a

---|---|--- 
 



43 it being understood that publicly taking no position or a neutral position
with respect to a publicly announced, or otherwise publicly disclosed
Acquisition Proposal for a period equal to the Matching Period plus one
Business Day will not be considered to be in violation of this Section 5.1
provided the Board has rejected such Acquisition Proposal and affirmed the
Board Recommendation before the end of the Matching Period plus one Business
Day period.



   Section 5.2 | Responding to an Acquisition Proposal 
---|--- 



   (1) | Notwithstanding Section 5.1, if at any time prior to obtaining
the approval of the Arrangement Resolution, the Company receives from a Person
a _bona fide_ written Acquisition Proposal that was not, directly or
indirectly, solicited, initiated, knowingly encouraged or otherwise
facilitated in violation of Section 5.1, the Company may, in response to such
Acquisition Proposal: (i) furnish information with respect to the Company in
response to a request therefor by such Person; and (ii) engage in or
participate in discussions or negotiations with such Person regarding such
Acquisition Proposal, if and only if: 
---|--- 
 



     | (a) | prior to the taking of any such action, the Board determines
in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and its outside
legal counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or could reasonably
be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal, and that the failure to take such
action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under Law; and 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (b) | prior to providing any such information, the Company enters
into a confidentiality agreement with such Person that will include a
customary standstill provision, and that is otherwise on terms and conditions
no less onerous or more beneficial to such Person than those set forth in the
Confidentiality Agreement, provided that: (i) such agreement need not prohibit
the making or amendment of any Acquisition Proposal and may include provisions
granting such Person an exclusive right to negotiate with the Company
provided that such exclusive right will not adversely interfere with the
Parent and the Purchasers rights under this Agreement with respect to such
Acquisition Proposal; and (ii) the Company sends a copy of such
confidentiality and standstill agreement to the Parent and the Purchaser
promptly following its execution and before any non-public information is
provided to any such Person and the Parent and the Purchaser are promptly
provided (to the extent not previously provided) with any such information
provided to such Person. 
---|---|--- 



   Section 5.3 | Adverse Recommendation Change; Alternative Transaction
Agreement 
---|--- 



   (1) | At any time prior to obtaining the approval of the Arrangement
Resolution, the Board may, in response to a _bona fide_ written Acquisition
Proposal that was not directly or indirectly, solicited, initiated, knowingly
encouraged or otherwise facilitated in violation of this Article 5, effect an
Adverse Recommendation Change or enter into an Alternative Transaction
Agreement, if and only if: 
---|--- 
 



     | (a) | the Company has complied in all material respects with its
obligations under Article 5; 
---|---|--- 
 



44 with its financial advisors and its outside legal counsel, that such
Acquisition Proposal is reasonably capable of constituting a Superior Proposal
and that the failure to take the relevant action would reasonably be expected
to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Law; 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | the Company provides the Parent with written notice of its
intention to take such action (a "Superior Proposal Notice"), which notice
will include all the information with respect to such Acquisition Proposal
that is specified in Section 5.4(1) as well as a copy of such Acquisition
Proposal (it being agreed that neither the delivery of a Superior Proposal
Notice nor any public announcement thereof that the Company is required to
make under Law will constitute an Adverse Recommendation Change unless and
until the Company will have failed at or prior to the end of the Matching
Period (and, upon the occurrence of such failure, such Superior Proposal
Notice and such public announcement will constitute an Adverse Recommendation
Change) to publicly announce that it: (A) is recommending the Transactions;
and (B) has determined that such other Acquisition Proposal (taking into
account: (x) any modifications or adjustments made to the Transactions agreed
to by the Parent in writing; and (y) any modifications or adjustments made to
such other Acquisition Proposal) is not a Superior Proposal and has publicly
rejected such Acquisition Proposal);  
---|---|--- 



     | (d) | during the Matching Period, the Board and, if requested by
the Parent, the Companys Representatives, have negotiated in good faith with
the Parent (to the extent the Parent desires to negotiate) regarding
any revisions to the terms of the Transactions proposed by the Parent in
response to such Acquisition Proposal; 
---|---|--- 



     | (e) | at the end of the Matching Period, the Board determines in
good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and its outside
legal counsel (and taking into account any amendment or modification to the
terms of this Agreement or the Transactions that the Parent has agreed in
writing to make), that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior
Proposal, and that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with
its fiduciary duties under Law; and 
---|---|--- 



     | (f) | prior to or concurrently with taking any such action, the
Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.2(1)(c)(ii). 
---|---|--- 



    (2) |

During the Matching Period, the Parent and the Purchaser will have the
opportunity, but not the obligation, to offer to amend the terms of the
Arrangement and this Agreement, and the Company will cooperate with the Parent
and the Purchaser with respect thereto, including meeting and negotiating in
good faith with the Parent and the Purchaser to  

---|--- 
 



45 to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Arrangement as the
Parent and the Purchaser deem appropriate and as would permit the Parent and
the Purchaser to proceed with the Arrangement and any related transactions on
such adjusted terms. The Board will review any such offer by the Parent and
the Purchaser to amend the terms of the Arrangement and this Agreement in
order to determine, in good faith in the exercise of its fiduciary duties,
after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors,
whether the Parent and the Purchasers offer to amend the Arrangement and this
Agreement, upon its acceptance, would result in the applicable Acquisition
Proposal ceasing to be a Superior Proposal when assessed against the
Arrangement as it is proposed to be amended as at the termination of the
Matching Period. If the Board so determines that the applicable Acquisition
Proposal would cease to be a Superior Proposal when assessed against the
Arrangement as it is proposed to be amended as at the termination of the
Matching Period, the Parent and the Purchaser will amend the terms of
the Arrangement and the Company, the Parent and the Purchaser will enter into
an amendment to this Agreement reflecting the offer by the Parent and the
Purchaser to amend the terms of the Arrangement and this Agreement, and will
take and cause to be taken all such actions as are necessary to give effect
to the foregoing. 
---|--- 



   (3) | The Board will promptly reaffirm its Board Recommendation by
press release after: (i) any Acquisition Proposal is publicly announced or
made and the Board determines it is not a Superior Proposal; (ii) the Board
determines that a proposed amendment to the terms of the Transactions pursuant
to Section 5.3(2) would result in an Acquisition Proposal not being a Superior
Proposal when assessed against the Arrangement as it is proposed to be
amended as at the termination of the Matching Period, and the Parent and the
Purchaser have so amended the terms of the Arrangement in accordance with
Section 5.3(2); or (iii) the Purchaser, acting reasonably, requests
reaffirmation of such Board Recommendation by the Board. The Parent and the
Purchaser will be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the
form and content of any such press release. 
---|--- 
 



   (4) | Any material amendment or modification to any such Acquisition
Proposal will require a new Superior Proposal Notice and the Parent will be
afforded a new Matching Period (except that references to the four Business
Day period in the definition of Matching Period will be deemed to be
references to a three Business Day period; _provided however_ , that such new
Matching Period will in no event shorten the original Matching Period). 
---|--- 
 



   Section 5.4 | Notification of Acquisition Proposals; Certain
Disclosure; Subsidiaries and Representatives 
---|--- 



   (1) |

5.3, if the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
Representatives receives or otherwise becomes aware of any inquiry, proposal
or offer that constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead to, an
Acquisition Proposal, or any request for non-public information relating to
the Company or any Subsidiary (other than requests for information in the
Ordinary Course consistent with past practice and unrelated to an  

---|--- 
 



46 regarding any Acquisition Proposal, the Company will promptly (and in any
event within 24 hours) notify the Purchaser orally and in writing of such
Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, proposal, offer or request, and the identity of
all Persons making the Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, proposal, offer or
request, and will provide to the Parent copies of any such Acquisition
Proposal, inquiry, proposal, offer or request (or where no such copies are
available, a reasonably detailed written description thereof). The Company
will keep the Parent reasonably informed (orally and in writing) on a current
basis (and in any event at the Parents request and otherwise no later than
24 hours after the occurrence of any modifications, developments, discussions
and negotiations) of the status of any such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry,
proposal, offer or request (including the terms and conditions thereof and
any modification thereto), and any developments, discussions and negotiations
with respect thereto, including furnishing copies of all written documents,
correspondence and draft documentation and reasonably detailed written
summaries of any material inquiries or discussions. Without limiting the
foregoing, the Company will promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) notify
the Parent orally and in writing if it determines to begin providing
information or to engage in discussions or negotiations relating to an
Acquisition Proposal pursuant to this Article 5\. The Company will, subject to
applicable restrictions under Law, prior to or concurrent with the time it is
provided to any Persons, provide to the Parent any non-public information
concerning the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that the Company provided to
any Person in connection with any Acquisition Proposal which was not
previously provided to the Parent. 
---|--- 



   (2) | Nothing contained in this Agreement will prevent the Board from:
(i) complying with Section 2.17 of Multilateral Instrument 62-104  _Takeover
Bids and Issuer Bids_ and similar provisions under Securities Laws relating
to the provision of a directors circular in respect of an Acquisition
Proposal; (ii) making any disclosure to the Company Securityholders, if the
Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside counsel,
that the failure to make such disclosure would be inconsistent with its duties
to Company Securityholders under, or would violate Securities Laws; or (iii)
making accurate disclosure to the Company Securityholders of (x) factual
information regarding the business, financial condition or results of
operations of the Company or (y) the fact that an Acquisition Proposal has
been made, the identity of the Person making such Acquisition Proposal or the
material terms of such Acquisition Proposal (and such disclosure will not be
deemed to be an Adverse Recommendation Change) so long as (unless otherwise
required by Law) any disclosure contemplated by this Section 5.4(2) does not
contain either an express Adverse Recommendation Change (without giving effect
to clause (ii) of the definition thereof), or any other statements by or on
behalf of the Board which would reasonably be expected to have the same
effect as an Adverse Recommendation Change. 
---|--- 



   (3) | Any violation of the restrictions set forth in this Article 5 by
the Companys Subsidiaries or the Companys and its Subsidiaries respective
Representatives will be deemed to be a breach of this Article 5 by the
Company. 
---|---

The Parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this Section 8.2 are
an integral part of the Transactions, and that without these agreements the
Parties would not enter into this Agreement, and that the amounts set out in
this Section 8.2 represent liquidated damages which are a genuine pre-
estimate of the damages, including opportunity costs, which the Parent and the
Purchaser will suffer or incur as a result of the event giving rise to such
damages and resultant termination of this Agreement, and are not penalties.
Each Party irrevocably waives any right it may have to raise as a defence that
any such liquidated damages are excessive or punitive. Each Party agrees that
(other than with respect to claims made by or on behalf of a Person based
upon, arising out of or relating to any fraud, criminal acts or wilful
misconduct) the payment of the Termination Fee, in the manner provided in this
Section 8.2 is the sole monetary remedy of the Parent and the Purchaser
in respect of the event giving rise to such payment. Notwithstanding anything

Termination Fee from the date that the payment of the Termination Fee was due
to the date of actual payment at the rate equal to the prime rate published
in _The Wall Street Journal_ for the relevant period, together with the costs
and expenses of the Parent or the Purchaser (including reasonable legal fees
and expenses) in connection with such suit.

Agreement, the Plan of Arrangement and the Transactions, including all costs,
expenses and fees of the Company incurred prior to or after the Effective
Time in connection with, or incidental to, the Plan of Arrangement, will be

   Section 8.5 | Time of the Essence. 
---|--- 

Time is of the essence in this Agreement.

 



   Section 8.6 | Injunctive Relief 
---|--- 

The Parties agree that irreparable harm would occur for which money damages
would not be an adequate remedy at Law in the event that any of the provisions
of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms
or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the Parties will
be entitled to injunctive and other equitable relief to prevent breaches or
threatened breaches of this Agreement, and to enforce compliance with the
terms of this Agreement without any requirement for the securing or posting of
any bond in connection with the obtaining of any such injunctive or other
equitable relief, this being in addition to any other remedy to which the
Parties may be entitled at Law or in equity.

 



55 ---|--- 



   (1) | Except as provided in Section 4.8(1) and Section 8.14, which,
without limiting their terms, are intended as stipulations for the benefit of
the third Persons mentioned in such provisions (such third Persons referred
to in this Section 8.7 as the "Indemnified Persons"), the Parties intend and
hereby agree that this Agreement will not benefit or create any right or cause
of action in favour of any Person other than the Parties and that no Person,
other than the Parties, will be entitled to rely on the provisions of this
Agreement set forth herein for any Action. 
---|--- 



   (2) | Despite the foregoing, the Parties acknowledge to each of the
Indemnified Persons their direct rights against the applicable Party under
Section 4.8(1) and Section 8.14, which are intended for the benefit of, and
will be enforceable by, each applicable Indemnified Person, his or her heirs
and his or her legal representatives, and for such purpose, the Company or the
Parent and the Purchaser, as applicable, confirms that it is acting as trustee
on their behalf, and agrees to enforce such provisions on their behalf;
_provided however_ , that the Parties further agree that the rights of the
Indemnified Persons, his or her heirs and his or her legal representatives as
contemplated by this Section 8.7 will not arise unless and until the
Effective Time occurs. 
---|--- 



   Section 8.8 | Waiver 
---|--- 

No waiver of any of the provisions of this Agreement will constitute a waiver
of any other provision (whether or not similar). No waiver will be binding
unless executed in writing by the Party to be bound by the waiver. A Partys
failure or delay in exercising any right under this Agreement will not operate
as a waiver of that right. A single or partial exercise of any right will not
preclude a Party from any other or further exercise of that right or the
exercise of any other right.



   Section 8.9 | Entire Agreement 
---|--- 

This Agreement, together with the Confidentiality Agreement and the Company
Disclosure Letter, constitutes the entire agreement between the Parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersedes all prior and
contemporaneous agreements, understandings, negotiations, representations,
warranties and discussions, whether oral or written, of the Parties.



   Section 8.10 | Successors and Assigns 
---|--- 



   (1) | This Agreement becomes effective only when executed by the
Parties. After that time, it will be binding upon and enure to the benefit of
the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns.  
---|--- 
 



56 obligations under this Agreement are assignable, delegable or transferable (as
the case may be), in whole or in part, by the other Party without the
prior written consent of the other Parties and any attempted or purported
assignment, delegation or transfer (as the case may be) in violation of this
Section 8.10 will be null and void; _provided however_ , that the Purchaser
may assign, delegate or transfer (as the case may be) all or part of its
rights under this Agreement to, and all or part of its obligations under this
Agreement may be assumed by, any of its Affiliates so long as the Parent
continues to be liable for all of its obligations hereunder. 
---|--- 



   Section 8.11 | Severability 
---|--- 

The provisions of this Agreement will be deemed severable and the illegality,
invalidity or unenforceability of any provision will not affect the legality,
validity or enforceability of any other provision hereof. If any provision of
this Agreement, or application thereof to any Person or any circumstance,
is illegal, invalid or unenforceable: (a) a suitable and equitable provision
will be substituted therefor in order to carry out, so far as may be legal,
valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such illegal, invalid or
unenforceable provision; and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the
application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances will not be
affected by such illegality, invalidity or unenforceability, nor will such
illegality, invalidity or unenforceability affect the legality, validity or
enforceability of such provision, or the application thereof, in any other
jurisdiction.



   Section 8.12 | Governing Law; Jurisdiction 
---|--- 

This Agreement will be governed by, construed and interpreted and enforced in
accordance with the laws of British Columbia and the federal laws of Canada
applicable therein, without regard to the conflict of laws, rules or
principles thereof (or any other jurisdiction to the extent such laws,
rules or principles would direct a matter to another jurisdiction). Each of
the Parties hereby irrevocably attorns and submits to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the British Columbia Courts situated in Vancouver, British
Columbia in respect of all matters arising under and in relation to this
Agreement and the Transactions, and irrevocably waives objection to the venue
of any proceeding in such court or that such court provides an inconvenient
forum.

 



   Section 8.13 | Rules of Construction 
---|--- 

The Parties have participated jointly in negotiating and drafting this
Agreement and the Parties to this Agreement waive the application of any Law
or rule of construction, providing that ambiguities in any agreement or other
document will be construed against the party drafting such agreement or other
document and agree this Agreement will be construed as if drafted jointly.



   Section 8.14 | No Liability 
---|--- 

This Agreement may only be enforced against, and any claims or causes
of action that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement,
or the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement may only be
