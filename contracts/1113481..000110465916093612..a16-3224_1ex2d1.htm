(vii) all obligations and liabilities of Parent or any of its Affiliates under

law in connection with the purchase of the Acquired Companies.

 



 

(f) _License Grants_. On the terms and subject to the conditions of this

 



      
 

 



 

Agreement, at the Closing, Parent hereby grants to Buyer the following
licenses and rights:

 



 

(i) License to Licensed Product Technology.

 



 

(A) Parent hereby irrevocably grants to Buyer as of the Closing (1) a royalty-
free, non-exclusive, worldwide, transferrable, sublicensable, perpetual
license under and to all Licensed Product Technology for the purposes of (w)
advertising, promoting, marketing, distributing, offering to sell and selling
Products, (x) manufacturing, having manufactured and developing Products, (y)
obtaining, maintaining or expanding any registration or Regulatory Approval
for any of the Products and (z) otherwise continuing to conduct the Businesses
and (2) a royalty-free, non-exclusive, worldwide, transferrable,
sublicensable, perpetual license to use all Licensed Product Technology in
connection with any reasonably anticipated expansion of the Business, such as
use of the Licensed Product Technology in connection with the development,
manufacture, or having manufactured of other pharmaceutical products in
connection with such reasonably anticipated expansion of the Business.

 



 

(B) Buyer may modify or improve the Licensed Product Technology and, as
between Buyer and Parent, Buyer shall own all right, title and interest in any
such modifications or improvements made by or on behalf of Buyer, and Buyers
licenses and rights under and to the Licensed Product Technology as set forth
in _Section 1.2(f)(i)(A)_ shall be deemed to include the right to use the
Licensed Product Technology as it may be incorporated into, embodied by or
used in connection with any such improvements.

 



 

(ii) _License to Licensed Promotional Materials_. Parent hereby grants to
Buyer a royalty-free, non-exclusive, worldwide, transferrable, sublicensable,
perpetual license to and under any and all right, title and interest
(including copyrights) of Parent in any Licensed Promotional Materials and to
use, reproduce, distribute and create derivative works of any Licensed
Promotional Materials, in each case solely in connection with (A) the
manufacture, having manufactured, advertising, promotion, marketing, sale,
offer for sale or distribution of any Products and (B) otherwise continuing to
conduct the Businesses and any reasonably anticipated expansion of the
Businesses, which license shall not be sublicensable, assignable, or
transferable except to any third party providing services in connection with
any such activities or except in accordance with the terms of this _Section
1.1(f)_.

 



 

(iii) _License to Retained Trademarks_. Buyer agrees to use commercially
reasonable efforts to convert packaging and labelling for the Products to
packaging and labelling that does not include Retained Marks promptly
following the Closing and to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause any
third party manufacturers of such Products under any agreement to which an
Acquired Company or Business Subsidiary is a party or that is included in the
Acquired Assets to implement such changes as promptly as is commercially
reasonable. Subject to Buyers compliance with its obligations in the
preceding sentence, Parent hereby grants to Buyer a royalty-free, non-
exclusive, worldwide, nontransferable, sublicensable license under the
Retained Marks to (A) use such Retained Marks in connection with distributing,
selling and offering to sell existing inventories of Products included in the
Acquired Assets or owned by an Acquired Affiliate or Business Subsidiary that
bear the Retained Marks

 



      
 

 



 

and (B) use such Retained Marks in connection with manufacturing or having
manufactured such quantities of the Products that bear Retained Marks as of
the Closing that Buyer, in its discretion, deems reasonably necessary to
prevent a stock-out or shortage of any such Products, and to use such Retained
Marks in connection with distributing, marketing, selling and offering to sell
any such Product manufactured pursuant to this item (B). With respect to any
such quantities of the Products that Buyer manufacturers or has manufactured
after the Closing, such Products shall be of a quality that is at least equal
to the quality of such Products sold by Parent under such marks prior to the
Closing Date. If Parent at any time finds that any of such Products are not
being provided in accordance with such standards of quality, Parent may notify
Buyer in writing of such deficiencies, and if Buyer fails to correct such
deficiencies within thirty (30) days after receipt of such notice, Parent may,
at its election, terminate this license effective immediately.

being [**] Dollars ($[**]).

 



 

(ii) Not less than three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date and in
accordance with the provisions of _Section 1.4_, Parent shall deliver to
Buyer a statement in the format of the Form of Closing Statement setting forth
Parents good faith estimate of the Closing Adjustment Amount (the "
_Estimated Closing Adjustment Amount_ ") and shall include a statement listing
detail by SKU of the Recothrom Inventory, including the quantity of each item
of Recothrom Inventory. If the Estimated Closing Adjustment Amount is
positive, then the Upfront Payment shall be increased by the Estimated Closing
Adjustment Amount. If the Estimated Closing Adjustment Amount is negative,
then the Upfront Payment shall be reduced

 



      
 

 



 

by the Estimated Closing Adjustment Amount. If the Estimated Closing
Adjustment Amount is zero (0), then the Upfront Payment shall not be adjusted
pursuant to this _Section 1.2(a)(ii)_.

 



 

(iii) Within ninety (90) days following the final determination of the
Purchase Price (as adjusted pursuant to _Section 1.2(a)(ii)_ and _Section
1.4_, the " _Adjusted Purchase Price_ "), but no later than 30 days prior to
the due date (including extensions) for the filing of the United States
federal income tax return of Parent or any Acquired Company or Business
Subsidiary, if earlier, Buyer shall prepare and deliver to Parent an
allocation schedule (the " _Allocation Schedule_ ") allocating the Adjusted
Purchase Price and the Assumed Liabilities per purchasing entity among the
Shares and the Acquired Assets, taking into account any adjustments in
determining the Adjusted Purchase Price and the amount and source of any
Assumed Liabilities, in accordance with Section 1060 of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986 (the " _Code_ ") and the Treasury Regulations promulgated
thereunder (and any similar provision of state, local or foreign law, as
appropriate). The Parties agree (1) to allocate $10,000,000 of the Upfront
Payment to the Tenaxis Shares, and (2) the obligations assumed under Section
1.1(d)(vi) relating to the Tenaxis Purchase Agreement shall be allocated to
the Tenaxis Shares, and (3) the value at Closing of the obligations to make
payments under the Tenaxis Purchase Agreement is $13,500,000. As payments are
made pursuant to _Section 1.2(a)(i)_, Buyer shall prepare and deliver to
Parent an updated Allocation Schedule reflecting such additional payments. The
Parties recognize that the Adjusted Purchase Price and the Assumed Liabilities
do not include Parents selling expenses or Buyers acquisition expenses.
Parent shall have the right, for fifteen (15) Business Days after such
delivery, to review and provide reasonable written comments to such draft
Allocation Schedule. If Parent does not object to such draft Allocation
Schedule within such fifteen (15) Business Day period, such Allocation
Schedule shall be final and binding on the Parties. If Parent does object to
such draft Allocation Schedule within such period, Buyer and Parent shall seek
in good faith for thirty (30) days thereafter to resolve any disagreements
between them with respect to such draft Allocation Schedule. If prior to the
end of such thirty (30) day period, Buyer and Parent are unable to so agree on
the Allocation Schedule, then such Allocation Schedule shall not be binding on
the Parties, provided that in all events the allocation to the Tenaxis Shares
of an amount equal to $23,500,000 shall be binding on the Parties.

 



 

(iv) The Parties and each of their respective Affiliates shall report the
transactions consummated pursuant to this Agreement in a manner consistent
with such final Allocation Schedule, if any, on all Tax Returns (including IRS
Form 8594) and shall cooperate in the preparation of any forms or reports
required to be filed pursuant to Section 1060 of the Code. If the Parties
agree on a final Allocation Schedule, each Party agrees that it shall (i) be
bound by this final Allocation Schedule for the purposes of determining any
Taxes, (ii) report for Tax purposes the transactions consummated pursuant to
this Agreement in a manner consistent with this final Allocation Schedule, and
(iii) not take a position for Tax purposes that is inconsistent with such
Allocation Schedule on any applicable Tax Return or in any proceeding before
any Taxing Authority or otherwise except with the prior written consent of the
other Party; provided, however, that necessary adjustments shall be made to
account for differences between the Assumed Liabilities and obligations
treated as liabilities for Tax purposes. In the

 



      
 

 



 

event that the allocation contained in the Allocation Schedule, if any, is
disputed by any Taxing Authority, the Party receiving notice of such dispute
will promptly notify the other Party and the Parties will consult in good
faith how to resolve such dispute in a manner consistent with the allocation.
In the event that the Parties do not agree on a final Allocation Schedule in
accordance with Section 1.2(a)(iii), the provisions of this Section 1.2(a)(iv)
shall apply solely to the allocation made with respect to the Tenaxis Shares
provided in Section 1.2(a)(iii) above.

 



 

(b) _Withholding_. Notwithstanding any provision hereof to the contrary, Buyer
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration otherwise
payable hereunder such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold
pursuant to any provision of law, including those related to or regarding
Taxes. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Buyer under any provision
of this Agreement, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the recipients in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made by Buyer.

 



 

1.3 _The Closing_.

 



 

(a) _Time and Location_. The closing of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place at the offices of Wilmer Cutler
Pickering Hale and Dorr LLP in New York, New York, commencing at 10:00 a.m.,
local time, on the third (3rd) Business Day following the day on which the
conditions to the obligations of the Parties to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby (excluding the delivery of any documents to be delivered
at the Closing by either of the Parties and other than the satisfaction of
those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, it
being understood that the occurrence of the Closing shall remain subject to
the delivery of such documents and the satisfaction or waiver of such
conditions) have first been satisfied or waived (the " _Closing Date_ "), or
at such other time and place as the Parties shall reasonably agree in writing.
For purposes of this Agreement, a " _Business Day_ " shall be any day other
than (i) a Saturday or Sunday or (ii) a day on which banking institutions
located in New York, New York (or, solely for purposes of this _Section
1.3(a)_, Amsterdam, the Netherlands) are permitted or required by law,
executive order or governmental decree to remain closed. The Closing shall be

1.4 _Post-Closing Adjustment_. The portion of the Purchase Price payable at
Closing, as adjusted pursuant to _Section 1.2(a)(ii)_, shall be subject to
further adjustment after the Closing as follows:

 



 

(a) Within ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall prepare and
deliver to Parent a statement (the " _Closing Statement_ ") calculating the
Closing Adjustment Amount. For purposes of this Agreement:

 



 

(i) " _Closing Adjustment Amount_ " means (A) the Closing Recothrom Inventory
Value, _plus_ (B) the Closing Working Capital Adjustment Amount and _less_ (C)
the amount of Indebtedness of all Acquired Companies and Business Subsidiaries
as of the Closing Date; and

 



      
 

 



 

(ii) " _Closing Working Capital Adjustment Amount_ " means an amount (which
may be positive or negative) equal to (A) the amount of the consolidated
current assets of the Businesses as of the Closing Date to be transferred to
Buyer or an Affiliate whether by asset sale or stock sale as contemplated by
this Agreement (other than Recothrom Inventory, cash and cash equivalents or
similar type investments, bank accounts, certificates of deposit, Treasury
bills and other marketable securities and deferred Tax assets) of the type
described by the asset line items on the Form of Closing Statement, _less_ (B)
the amount of the consolidated current liabilities of the Businesses as of the
Closing Date to be transferred to Buyer or an Affiliate whether by asset sale
or stock sale as contemplated by this Agreement (other than Indebtedness and
deferred Tax liabilities) of the type described by the liability line items on
the Form of Closing Statement, _plus_ (C) the amount of any cash or cash
equivalents or similar type investments, bank accounts, certificates of
deposit, Treasury bills or other marketable securities of the Businesses as of
the Closing Date to be transferred to Buyer or an Affiliate, whether by asset
sale or stock sale as contemplated by this Agreement, _less_ (D) $6,100,000.

 



 

All such amounts shall be calculated in accordance with United States
generally accepted accounting principles (" _GAAP_ ") applied in a manner
consistent with the past practices of Parent (the " _Parent Accounting
Principles_ "). The Closing Statement shall be prepared in the format of
_Exhibit I_ (the " _Form of Closing Statement_") and using the Parent
Accounting Principles. The Closing Statement shall include a statement
listing, by SKU, of the Recothrom Inventory, including the quantity of each
item of Recothrom Inventory. The Recothrom Inventory shall be based on a
physical count of the Recothrom Inventory conducted within ten (10) Business
Days of the Closing. For purposes of determining the Recothrom Inventory
Value, any Recothrom Inventory with a remaining shelf life of less than six
(6) months as of the Closing Date shall be disregarded.

 



 

(b) If Parent disputes the Closing Adjustment Amount as shown on the Closing
Statement prepared by Buyer, Parent shall deliver to Buyer within forty-five
(45) days after receipt of the Closing Statement a notice accompanied by
supporting documentation, if available, and setting forth Parents calculation
of the Closing Adjustment Amount (which shall be calculated in accordance with
_Section 1.4(a)_) and describing in detail the basis for the determination of
such different Closing Adjustment Amount (the " _Dispute Notice_ "). Buyer and
Parent shall use reasonable efforts to resolve such differences regarding the
determination of the Closing Adjustment Amount for a period of thirty (30)
days after Parent has given the Dispute Notice. If Buyer and Parent resolve
such differences, the Closing Adjustment Amount agreed to by the Parties shall
be deemed to be the " _Final Closing Adjustment Amount_ " and the Closing
Statement agreed to by the Parties shall be deemed to be the " _Final Closing
Statement_." If Parent does not timely deliver a Dispute Notice to Buyer, then
the Closing Adjustment Amount proposed by Buyer in its Closing Statement shall
be deemed to be the " _Final Closing Adjustment Amount_ " and shall be
conclusive and binding on the Parties, absent fraud or manifest error.

 



 

(c) If Buyer and Parent do not reach a final resolution on the Closing
Adjustment Amount within thirty (30) days after Parent has given the Dispute
Notice, unless the Parties mutually agree to continue their efforts to resolve
such differences, a national accounting

 



      
 

 



 

firm jointly selected by Parent and Buyer (or if Parent and Buyer are unable
to agree on an accounting firm, a national accounting firm jointly selected by
a national accounting firm selected by Parent and a national accounting firm
selected by Buyer) (the " _Neutral Accountant_ ") shall resolve such
differences, pursuant to an engagement agreement executed by the Parties and
the Neutral Accountant, in the manner provided below. Each of Buyer and Parent
shall be entitled to make a presentation to the Neutral Accountant, pursuant
to procedures to be agreed to among Parent, Buyer and the Neutral Accountant
(or, if they cannot agree on such procedures, pursuant to procedures
determined by the Neutral Accountant), regarding such Partys calculation of
the Closing Adjustment Amount; and the Neutral Accountant shall be required to
resolve the differences between the Parties and determine the Closing
Adjustment Amount within twenty (20) Business Days thereafter. The Closing
Adjustment Amount determined by the Neutral Accountant shall be deemed to be
the Final Closing Adjustment Amount and the Closing Statement, as adjusted to
reflect such determination, shall be deemed to be the Final Closing Statement.
Such determination by the Neutral Accountant shall be conclusive and binding
upon the Parties, absent fraud or manifest error.

 



 

(d) The Neutral Accountant shall not be authorized or permitted to:

 



 

(i) determine any questions or matters whatsoever under or in connection with
this Agreement except for the resolution of differences between the Parties
regarding the determination of the Closing Adjustment Amount in accordance
with this _Section 1.4_;

 



 

(ii) resolve any such differences by making an adjustment to the Closing
Statement that is outside of the range defined by amounts as finally proposed
by the Parties; or

 



 

(iii) apply any accounting practices, methods, treatments, principles or
procedures other than the Parent Accounting Principles.

 



 

(e) Each of Parent and Buyer shall pay one-half of the fees and expenses of
the Neutral Accountant; _provided_ that if the Neutral Accountant determines
that one Party has adopted one or more positions with respect to the Closing
Statement or the calculation of the Closing Adjustment Amount that are
frivolous or clearly without merit, the Neutral Accountant may, in its
discretion, assign a greater portion of any such fees and expenses to such
Party, in which case the Neutral Accountant shall provide to the Parties a
written explanation of its reasons for making such a determination.

 



 

(f) The Parties agree that the procedure set forth in this _Section 1.4_ for
resolving disputes with respect to the Closing Adjustment Amount shall be the
sole and exclusive method for resolving any such disputes, provided that this
provision shall not prohibit any Party from instituting litigation to enforce
the ruling of the Neutral Accountant.

 



 

(g) If the Final Closing Adjustment Amount is less than the Estimated Closing
Adjustment Amount, then (i) Parent shall pay to Buyer an amount equal to the
difference

 



      
 

 



 

between the Estimated Closing Adjustment Amount and the Final Closing
Adjustment Amount and (ii) the Purchase Price, as adjusted pursuant to
_Section 1.2(a)(ii)_, shall be reduced by the amount of such difference. If
the Final Closing Adjustment Amount is more than the Estimated Closing
Adjustment Amount, then (A) Buyer shall pay to Parent an amount equal to the
difference between the Final Closing Adjustment Amount and the Estimated
Closing Adjustment Amount and (B) the Purchase Price, as adjusted pursuant to
_Section 1.2(a)(ii)_, shall be increased by the amount of such difference. If
the Final Closing Adjustment Amount is equal to the Estimated Closing
Adjustment Amount, then the Purchase Price shall not be adjusted pursuant to
this _Section 1.4_. Any payment pursuant to this _Section 1.4(g)_ shall be
made in cash by wire transfer of immediately available funds into an account
designated by Buyer or Parent, as the case may be, within five (5) Business
Days after the date on which the Final Closing Adjustment Amount is finally
determined pursuant to this _Section 1.4_.

 



 

1.5 _Consents to Assignment_. Anything in this Agreement to the contrary
notwithstanding, this Agreement shall not constitute an agreement to assign or
transfer any Acquired Asset if an attempted assignment or transfer thereof,
without the consent of a third party thereto or of the issuing Governmental
Entity, as the case may be, would constitute a breach or default thereof,
would result in a violation of the rights of any such third party, would be
ineffective, or would in any way adversely affect the rights of Parent or
Buyer thereunder and such consent is not obtained at or prior to the Closing
(a " _Deferred Consent_ "). With respect to each Deferred Consent, (a) the
Acquired Asset to which such Deferred Consent relates (a " _Deferred Item_ ")
shall be withheld from sale pursuant to this Agreement without any reduction
in the Purchase Price, (b) for a period of twelve (12) months after the
Closing, Parent and Buyer shall cooperate, in all reasonable respects, to
obtain such Deferred Consent as soon as practicable after the Closing,
provided that Parent shall not be required to make any payments or agree to
any material undertakings in connection therewith, (c) during such period
until such Deferred Consent is obtained, Parent and Buyer shall cooperate, in
all reasonable respects, in any lawful and commercially reasonable arrangement
reasonably proposed by Buyer under which (i) Buyer would obtain (without
infringing upon the legal rights of any third party) the economic claims,
rights and benefits and (ii) Buyer would assume any related economic burden
with respect to the Deferred Item, and (d) Parent, the Acquired Company or the
Business Subsidiary, as applicable, shall hold such Acquired Asset as nominee
for Buyer until completion of such transfers in accordance with the provisions
of this _Section 1.5_. For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Affiliate_
" shall, subject to _Section 11.3_, have the meaning assigned to it in Rule
12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

 



 

1.6 _Further Assurances_.

 



 

(a) At any time and from time to time after the Closing Date, as and when
requested by either Party and at the requesting Partys expense, the other
Party shall promptly execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and
delivered, all such documents, instruments and certificates and shall take, or
cause to be taken, all such further or other actions as are necessary to
evidence and effectuate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Without limitation of the foregoing (but subject to _Section 1.5_), if it any
time or from time to time after the Closing

 



      
 

 



 

Date either Party (or any Affiliate thereof) shall discover that it is in
possession of an asset or liability that is allocated to the other Party (or
any of its Affiliates) pursuant to this Agreement or any agreement or other
instrument delivered pursuant hereto, such first party shall use its
reasonable best efforts to promptly transfer (or cause to be transferred) such
asset or liability to the Party (or Affiliate thereof) to which such asset or
liability is otherwise allocated hereunder. Prior to any such transfer, such
transferor shall (and shall be deemed to) hold such asset or liability in
trust for such transferee.

 



 

(b) To the extent that Parent or its Affiliates are party to any agreement
that is an Excluded Asset but that relates to the Businesses (each, a "
_Shared Contract_ "), for a period of twelve (12) months after the Closing,
(i) Parent and Buyer shall cooperate, in all reasonable respects, to obtain
the consent of any third party required for the assignment or transfer of the
rights and obligations under each Shared Contract (solely to the extent such
rights and obligations are related to the Businesses) as soon as practicable
after the Closing, provided that Parent shall not be required to make any
payments or agree to any material undertakings in connection therewith or
agree to any action that would reasonably be expected to adversely affect
Parents rights or obligations under any such Shared Contract, and (ii) during
the period until such consent is obtained, Parent and Buyer shall cooperate in
all reasonable respects, in any lawful and commercially reasonable arrangement
reasonably proposed by Buyer under which (A) Buyer would obtain (without
infringing upon the legal rights of any third party) the economic claims,
rights and benefits and (B) Buyer would assume any related economic burden
with respect to the such Shared Contract, to the extent related to the
Businesses.

 



 

 **ARTICLE II** ** 
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT**

 



 

Parent represents and warrants to Buyer that the following representations and
warranties are true and correct, except as set forth in the disclosure
schedules provided by Parent to Buyer (collectively, the " _Disclosure
Schedule_ "). The Disclosure Schedule shall be arranged in Schedules
corresponding to the numbered and lettered sections and paragraphs contained
in this Agreement. The disclosures in any Schedule of the Disclosure Schedule
shall qualify (i) the corresponding section or paragraph of this Agreement and
(ii) each other section or paragraph of this Agreement to the extent that it
is reasonably apparent that such disclosure is relevant to such other section
or paragraph. The inclusion of any information in the Disclosure Schedule
shall not be deemed to be an admission or acknowledgment, in and of itself,

material to the Businesses, has resulted in or would result in a Business
Material Adverse Effect, or is outside the ordinary course of business.

 



 

2.1 _Organization, Qualification and Corporate Power_.

 



 

(a) _Parent_. Parent is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in
good standing under the laws of Delaware and is duly qualified to conduct
business under the laws of each other jurisdiction where the character of the

makes such qualification necessary, except for any such failure to be
qualified that would not reasonably be expected to result in a Business
Material Adverse

 



      
 

 



 

Effect. Parent has all requisite corporate power and authority to carry on the
business in which it is now engaged and to own and use the properties now
owned and used by it.

 



 

(b) _Acquired Companies_. Each of the Acquired Companies is an entity duly
organized, validly existing and, where applicable, in good standing under the
laws of its jurisdiction of organization and is duly qualified to conduct
business under the laws of each other jurisdiction where the character of the
properties owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of its activities
makes such qualification necessary, except for any such failure to be
qualified that would not reasonably be expected to result in a Business
Material Adverse Effect. Each of the Acquired Companies has all requisite
corporate or comparable power and authority to carry on the business in which
it is now engaged and to own and use the properties now owned and used by it.

 



 

(c) _Charter and Corporate Records_. Parent has made available to Buyer

or foreign law), as a transferee or successor, by contract, or otherwise for
any taxable period (or portion thereof) ending on or before the Closing Date.

of the Acquired Assets or any assets of the Acquired Companies or Business
Subsidiaries and no such liens are anticipated.

respect to the Businesses) Parent has agreed to any extension or waiver of the
statute of limitations applicable to any Tax Return, or agreed to any
extension of time with respect to a Tax assessment or deficiency, which period
(after giving effect to such extension or waiver) has not yet expired.

 



 

(f) _Schedule_ _2.9(f)_ lists all Tax Returns required to be filed by the
Acquired Companies and Business Subsidiaries for periods up to and including

Authority have been delivered to Buyer.

 



 

(h) The aggregate unpaid Taxes of the Acquired Companies and Business
Subsidiaries as of the date of the Most Recent Balance Sheet did not exceed
the reserve for Tax liability (excluding any reserve for deferred Taxes

business.

regulations,

 



      
 

 



 

including the maintenance of contemporaneous documentation substantiating the
applicable transfer pricing practices and methodology.

 



 

(o) The Parties agree that (i) other than with respect to the representations
contained in _Section 2.9(i)_, _(j)_ and _(l)_ , the representations and
warranties of Parent in this _Section 2.9_ refer only to activities prior to
the Closing and shall not serve as representations and warranties regarding,
or guarantees of, nor can they be relied upon with respect to, Taxes
attributable to any Tax period or portion thereof beginning after the Closing
Date including, without limitation, Taxes attributable to any Tax positions
taken in any such periods and (ii) no representations, warranties or
guarantees are made with respect to the amount or availability of any Tax
attributes (including, without limitation, net operating loss, any net

any Acquired Company or Business Subsidiary after the Closing Date.

valid title to a valid leasehold interest in, or a valid license to use, all
of the material tangible personal property owned or purported to be owned or
used by any Acquired Company, free and clear of all Encumbrances other than
Permitted Encumbrances.

 



 

(c) Assuming that Buyer (or one or more of its Affiliates) provides to the
Businesses all corporate-level services currently provided to the Businesses
by Parent and its Affiliates, the assets of the Acquired Companies and the
Business Subsidiaries, together with the Acquired Assets and the services
provided to Buyer by Parent or its Affiliates pursuant to this Agreement and
the Transition Services Agreement, collectively, are all of the assets of
Parent or any of its Affiliates that are necessary to operate the Businesses
as of immediately after the Closing substantially in the manner in which such
Businesses are currently conducted by Parent and its Affiliates as of the date
hereof.

 



 

2.11 _Real Property_. Neither Parent (solely with respect to the Businesses)
nor any Acquired Company or Business Subsidiary owns any real property.
_Schedule 2.11(c)_ sets forth an accurate and complete list of all real
property leased or subleased by Parent (solely with respect to the Businesses)
or any of the Acquired Companies or Business Subsidiaries or included in the
Acquired Assets (the " _Leased Real Property_ "). Parent has made available to
Buyer correct and complete copies of all leases and subleases (as amended to
date) for all Leased Real Property (the " _Leases_ "). Parent or the Acquired
Companies or Business Subsidiaries have a valid leasehold interest in the
Leased Real Property, in each case, free and clear of all Encumbrances other
than (i) Permitted Encumbrances, and (ii) Encumbrances on the fee title to the
Leased Real Property which do not or would not, individually or in the
aggregate, materially affect the current use of the Leased Real Property
subject thereto or otherwise impair the

 



      
 

 



 

continued operation of the Businesses thereat as presently conducted, and have
the right to quiet enjoyment of the Leased Real Property for the full term of
such Lease. There are no leases, subleases, licenses, concessions or other
agreements of Parent or any of the Acquired Companies or Business
Subsidiaries, written or oral, granting to any person or entity the right to
use or occupy any portion of the Leased Real Property. The improvements,
fixtures, systems and other items of property owned by Parent or any of the
Acquired Companies or Business Subsidiaries and located at the Leased Real
Property, taken as a whole, are adequately maintained for the purpose of
conducting the Businesses as now being conducted, ordinary wear and tear
excepted. Neither the current use of the Leased Real Property nor the
operations of Parent or any of the Acquired Companies or Business
Subsidiaries, as applicable, violates in any material respect any applicable
legal requirements or, to the knowledge of Parent, any instrument of record or
agreement affecting the Leased Real Property. All Leased Real Property has
reasonable access to public roads and utilities. Neither Parent nor any of the
Acquired Companies or Business Subsidiaries has received any written notice,
order or proposal, which would adversely affect the use or enjoyment of any
Leased Real Property.

 



 

2.12 _Intellectual Property_.

 



 

(a) _Schedule 2.12(a)_ includes a complete and accurate list, as of the date
of this Agreement, of (i) all patents and pending patent applications, (ii)
trademark and service mark registrations and pending applications to register
trademarks and service marks, (iii) domain name registrations and (iv)
copyright registrations and pending applications therefor that are included in
the Acquired Assets, owned by an Acquired Company or Business Subsidiary,
licensed to an Acquired Company or Business Subsidiary, or licensed to Parent
pursuant to an agreement included in the Acquired Assets (the " _Designated
Intellectual Property_ "). With respect to each item of Designated
Intellectual Property, _Schedule 2.12(a)_ accurately sets forth the owner of
such Designated Intellectual Property. All right, title and interest in and to
each item of Designated Intellectual Property that Parent, an Acquired Company
or a Business Subsidiary owns or is purported to own is solely owned by such
entity and, as of the Closing, record title of each such item of Designated
Intellectual Property correctly reflects such entity as sole owner of such
item of Designated Intellectual Property. To Parents knowledge, (x) all
Designated Intellectual Property that has been issued or granted is valid and
enforceable and (y) all pending patent applications, if issued with claims
that are substantially similar to the claims presented as of the Closing, will
be valid and enforceable upon such issuance. To Parents knowledge, Parent, an
Acquired Company or a Business Subsidiary possesses valid rights under all
Designated Intellectual Property owned by a third party for all purposes for
which the Designated Intellectual Property is used in the Businesses. From and
after the Closing, subject to Buyer or the applicable Acquired Company or
Business Subsidiary maintaining any applicable licenses from third parties in
force, Buyer, an Acquired Company or a Business Subsidiary will own, be
licensed to use or otherwise possess valid rights under, all Designated
Intellectual Property such that the continued conduct of the Businesses as
currently conducted (including, with respect to each of the Products, the
manufacture, development and commercialization of such Product in the United
States, regardless of whether such Product is currently manufactured, being
developed or commercialized in the United States, and all other jurisdictions
in which such

 



      
 

 



 

Product is manufactured, being developed or commercialized as of the date of
this Agreement) after Closing by Buyer, an Acquired Company or a Business
Subsidiary will not infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate any
intellectual property or other proprietary rights of Parent, any of its
Affiliates or any other Person in or to any Designated Intellectual Property.

 



 

(b) As of the date of this Agreement, no Acquired Company, Business Subsidiary
or, with respect to the Businesses, Parent has been named in any pending suit,
action or proceeding and, during the twenty-four (24) month period immediately
preceding the date of this Agreement, no Acquired Company, Business Subsidiary
or, with respect to the Businesses, Parent has received any written notice
from any third party or been a party to any suit, action, proceeding or
investigation which (i) involves a claim of infringement of any patents,
trademarks, trade names, service marks or copyrights of any third party or
misappropriation or other violation of any trade secrets or other intellectual
property or proprietary rights of any third party, (ii) challenges an Acquired
Companys, a Business Subsidiarys or, with respect to the Businesses,
Parents ownership or rights to use any intellectual property or proprietary
rights relating to the Businesses, the Products, the Acquired Assets, the
Licensed Product Technology or the Designated Intellectual Property or
asserting that the manufacture, development, importation, use or sale of any
of the Products infringes, misappropriates or otherwise violates any third
partys intellectual, proprietary or other rights, or (iii) alleges false
advertising or unfair business practices in respect of or relating to the
Businesses, the Products, the Acquired Assets, the Licensed Product Technology
or the Designated Intellectual Property and, to the knowledge of Parent, there
is no basis for any claim or challenge of the type described in clauses (i),
(ii) or (iii) of this sentence. Neither the conduct of the Businesses as
currently conducted nor the manufacture, development, use, offer for sale,
sale, importation, promotion, marketing or advertising of any of the Products
in the conduct of the Businesses as currently conducted (including in respect
of the conduct of such activities in the United States, regardless of whether
any such Product is currently manufactured, being developed, used, offered for
sale, sold, imported into, promoted, marketed or advertised in the United
States, and all other jurisdictions in which such Product is manufactured,
being developed, used, offered for sale, sold, imported into, promoted,
marketed or advertised as of the date of this Agreement) infringes,
misappropriates or otherwise violates any patents, trademarks, trade names,
service marks, copyrights or other intellectual property or proprietary rights
of any third party.

 



 

(c) To Parents knowledge, no third party is infringing any of the Designated
Intellectual Property or misappropriating any Know-How or infringing,
misappropriating or otherwise violating intellectual property rights owned by
any Acquired Company or Business Subsidiary or that are included in the
Acquired Assets and, during the twenty-four (24) month period immediately
preceding the date of this Agreement, no such claim has been asserted in

Acquired Company or any Business Subsidiary licenses from any third party any
right to use any intellectual property; provided, however, the Parties
acknowledge and agree that _Schedule 2.12(d)_ does not contain, and Parent is
not obligated to list or disclose, the following agreements: (1) those
agreements relating to non-customized "off-the-shelf" software in a version
that its licensor makes generally available to its customers and which Parent,
an Acquired Company or any Business Subsidiary uses pursuant to a standard
shrink-wrap license agreement, (2) those agreements relating to non-customized
online-delivered or online-accessible software in a version that its licensor
makes generally available to its customers and which Parent, an Acquired
Company or any Business Subsidiary uses pursuant to a standard click-wrap

agreement for tangible property which has an electronic component controlled
in whole or part by intellectual property, including but not limited to
electronic communications equipment such as office telephones, smartphones,
electronic HVAC thermostats, photocopying machines, facsimile machines,
monitors, and other peripheral devices such as standard commercially available
keyboards, printers and "mice", and (4) any license granted to Parent in
respect of any intellectual property that does not solely relate to the
Businesses and that is used by Parent in connection with information systems
used in connection with the manufacture or development of the Products that
are not specific to any Product. Except as otherwise indicated on _Schedule
2.12(d)_, all agreements listed on _Schedule 2.12(d)_ to which Parent is a
party are included in the Assigned Assets.

 



 

(e) _Schedule 2.12(e)_ lists, as of the date of this Agreement, each
agreement pursuant to which Parent (with respect to any Acquired Assets or
rights licensed pursuant to any agreement required to be listed on _Schedule
2.12(d)_ or otherwise solely with respect to any Businesses), any Acquired
Company or any Business Subsidiary (i) licenses or sublicenses to any third
party any right to use any intellectual property, other than non-exclusive
licenses or sublicenses granted under a manufacturing, supply or distribution
agreement to which an Acquired Company or Business Subsidiary is a party or
that is included in the Acquired Assets pursuant to which a third party is
granted such license or sublicense solely to enable it to provide services to
Parent, an Acquired Company or Business Subsidiary under such agreement, (ii)
is restricted in its right to use or register any intellectual property rights
it owns or purports to own in relation to the manufacture, development,
importation, use, offer for sale or sale of any of the Products, or (iii)
permits or agrees to permit any third party (or, in respect of any agreement
to which an Acquired Company or Business Subsidiary is a party, permits Parent
or any of its Affiliates) to use, obtain, enforce, or register any
intellectual property rights in relation to the manufacture, development,
importation, use, offer for sale or sale of any of the Products.

 



 

(f) Parent (with respect to any Know-How included in the Acquired Assets and,
otherwise, solely with respect to the Businesses), the Acquired Companies and
the Business Subsidiaries have taken measures to maintain the confidentiality
of all material trade secrets and other confidential and proprietary
information that is owned by or licensed to Parent (with respect to any Know-
How included in the Acquired Assets and, otherwise, solely with respect to the
Businesses), any Acquired Company, or any Business Subsidiary that are
commercially reasonable in light of the nature and value of such trade secrets
or other confidential information

 



      
 

 



 

and that are in compliance with any third party agreements in respect of any
such trade secrets or confidential information owned by a third party. To
Parents knowledge, each contractor and each current and former employee and
officer of Parent, any Affiliate of Parent, any Acquired Company or any
Business Subsidiary who has been involved with the research or development of
any Products or any Designated Intellectual Property that Parent, any Acquired
Company or any Business Subsidiary owns or purports to own, has executed a
proprietary information and inventions agreement or agreements or has
otherwise assigned in writing or by operation of law all intellectual property
rights in and to such Products or such Designated Intellectual Property to
Parent, the Acquired Company or Business Subsidiary, as the case may be. No
current or former employee or officer of Parent, any Acquired Company or any
Business Subsidiary who is a named inventor on any patent or pending
application included in Designated Intellectual Property that Parent, any
Acquired Company or any Business Subsidiary owns or purports to own has
excluded inventions from his or her assignment of inventions pursuant to such
employees proprietary information and inventions agreement that relate in any
manner to the Businesses or the Products.

 



 

(g) The intellectual property rights included in the Acquired Assets, the
intellectual property rights owned by or licensed to any Acquired Company or
Business Subsidiary, along with the intellectual property rights licensed to
Buyer pursuant to this Agreement, constitute all of the intellectual property
rights that are currently used or intended for use in the manufacture,
development or commercialization of the Products, other than the Excluded
Assets; provided, however, for the avoidance of doubt, such representation and
warranty shall exclude any and all intellectual property that is owned by or
licensed to Parent and is used by Parent in connection with information
systems used in connection with the manufacture or development of the Products
that are not specific to any Product. All right, title and interest of Parent
or any of its Affiliates in or to any patents, patent registrations or patent
applications that (i) would be infringed, absent a license thereto, by the
manufacture, development or commercialization of the Products anywhere in the
world, (ii) if a patent application, include claims that, if allowed, would be
infringed, absent a license thereto, by the manufacture, development or
commercialization of the Products anywhere in the world, (iii) disclose any
invention in which Parent or any of its Affiliates has any right, title or
interest that is directed to any of the Products or any specific use of the
Products (whether alone or in combination with any other product, device, or
other composition of matter), any methods of manufacturing the Products
(whether or not such methods are currently employed in the manufacture of the
Products) and (iv) that claims priority to any patents, patent registrations
or patent applications described in items (i)-(iii) above are either included
in the Acquired Assets or solely owned by an Acquired Company or Business
Subsidiary (as between Parent or its Affiliate and the Acquired Company or
Business Subsidiary). Except as set forth on _Schedule 2.12(g)_ , no
intellectual property rights generated in the course of research and
development of any of the Products or acquired in respect of the research and
development of any of the Products and retained by Parent or its Affiliates
(other than any intellectual property rights included in the Licensed Product
Technology) would be infringed by any Competitive Activities absent a license
or other right to use such intellectual property rights or would otherwise
reasonably be expected to be useful to the manufacture, development or
commercialization of the Products, including for

 



      
 

 



 

defensive purposes.

(a) _Schedule 2.16(a)_ contains a complete and accurate list of all Employee
Benefit Plans maintained, or contributed to, by Parent, any Acquired Company
or Business Subsidiary, or any ERISA Affiliate for the benefit of Business
Employees (and their beneficiaries) or in connection with which any Acquired
Company or Business Subsidiary has or may have any liability (the " _Business
Benefit Plans_ "). Any Business Benefit Plan sponsored by an Acquired Company
or Business Subsidiary shall be separately identified in _Schedule 2.16(a)_
and shall be referred to as a " _Company Plan_." Any Business Benefit Plan
other than a Company Plan and any other Employee Benefit Plan or other benefit
plan or arrangement maintained or contributed to by Parent or any ERISA
Affiliate shall be referred to as a " _Parent Benefit Plan_." Buyer and its
Affiliates, including any Acquired Company or Business Subsidiary after the
Closing, shall not assume or otherwise have any obligation or liability in
connection with any Parent Benefit Plan. For purposes of this Agreement, "
_Employee Benefit Plan_ " means any "employee pension benefit plan" (as
defined in Section 3(2) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974
(" _ERISA_ ")), any "employee welfare benefit plan" (as defined in Section
3(1) of ERISA), and any other written or unwritten plan, agreement or
arrangement involving pension, retirement, profit sharing, welfare or fringe

common control (as defined in Section 414(c) of the Code), or (iii) an
affiliated service group (as defined under Section 414(m) of the Code or the

all related trust agreements, insurance contracts and summary plan
descriptions, Forms 5500 for the three most recent plan years, ruling letter
and any outstanding request for a ruling letter with respect to the tax-exempt
status of any VEBA, and IRS determination letter and any outstanding request
for a determination letter have been made available to Buyer. Each Business
Benefit Plan and related trust agreement, annuity contract or other funding
instrument complies with and has been administered, operated, and maintained
in material compliance with its terms and ERISA, the Code and other applicable
law. With respect to each Business Benefit Plan, no prohibited transactions
(as defined in ERISA Section 406 or Code Section 4975) and no violations of
ERISA Section 407 for which an applicable statutory or administrative
exemption does not exist have occurred. Parent or the applicable Acquired
Company or Business Subsidiary, as the case may be, has met its obligations in
all material respects with respect to such Business Benefit Plan. Parent
(solely with respect to the Businesses) and the Acquired Companies and
Business Subsidiaries are in compliance in all material respects with the
currently applicable provisions of ERISA and the Code and other applicable
law.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) There are no pending or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened claims
(except claims for benefits payable in the normal operation of the Business
Benefit Plans and proceedings with respect to qualified domestic relations
orders), suits or proceedings against or involving any Business Benefit Plan
or asserting any rights or claims to benefits under any Business Benefit Plan,
or, to Parents knowledge, investigations by any Governmental Entity involving
any Business Benefit Plan, and no facts exist that would give rise thereto. No
claim in relation to any of the Business Employees or former employees or in
relation to applicants for employment has been made or threatened against the
Parent, any Acquired Company or Business Subsidiary or ERISA Affiliate or
against any person whom any such company is liable to compensate or indemnify.

 



 

(c) The Business Benefit Plans that are intended to be qualified under Section
401(a) of the Code have received determination, opinion or advisory letters
from the Internal Revenue Service to the effect that such Business Benefit
Plans are qualified and the plans and the trusts related thereto are exempt
from federal income Taxes under Sections 401(a) and 501(a), respectively, of
the Code.

 



 

(d) None of Parent, any Acquired Company or Business Subsidiary or ERISA
Affiliates has ever (i) maintained or made any contributions to an Employee
Benefit Plan subject to Section 412 of the Code or Title IV of ERISA or (ii)
been obligated to contribute to a "multiemployer plan" (as described in
Section 4001(a)(3) or Section 3(37) of ERISA) or "multiemployer plan" or
"mandatory industry wide pension fund" under other applicable laws in either
case that could result in liability for the Buyer.

 



 

(e) There are no Business Benefit Plans providing welfare benefits after
termination of employment to any Business Employee (or to any beneficiary of
any such Business Employee), excluding continuation of health coverage
required to be continued under Section 4980B of the Code or other applicable
laws and, where eligible, paid coverage during severance periods (" _Severance
Coverage_ "). Any Business Benefit Plan providing Severance Coverage is a
Parent Benefit Plan, and in no event shall any Acquired Company, any Business
Subsidiary or the Buyer have any liability in connection with any Severance
Coverage or obligation to provide Severance Coverage on or after the Closing.

 



 

(f) No act or omission has occurred and no condition exists with respect to
any Business Benefit Plan maintained by Parent or any Acquired Company or
Business Subsidiary, any of their respective Affiliates or any ERISA Affiliate
that would subject Parent, any Acquired Company or Business Subsidiary or any
ERISA Affiliate to any material fine, penalty, Tax or liability of any kind
imposed under ERISA or the Code or any other law (other than liabilities for
benefits accrued under Business Benefit Plans for employees of Parent or any
Acquired Company or Business Subsidiary, and each of their beneficiaries).

 



 

(g) Each Business Benefit Plan and related trust agreement or other agreement,
annuity contract or other funding instrument is legal, valid and binding
(where applicable) and in full force and effect, and there are no material
defaults thereunder. Each Company Plan (including any Employee Benefit Plan
covering former employees and retirees of

 



      
 

 



 

the Acquired Companies or Business Subsidiaries or (solely with respect to the
Businesses) Parent) may be amended or terminated by an Acquired Company or
Business Subsidiary or Buyer on or at any time after the Closing Date without
further liability thereunder excluding any Company Plans that are individual
retention, severance, or employment agreements.

 



 

(h) Parent and the Acquired Companies and Business Subsidiaries have not
terminated or taken action to terminate (in part or in whole) any employee
benefit plans as defined in ERISA Section 3(3) that could result in liability
for Buyer.

 



 

(i) The consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will
not (i) entitle any current or former Parent or Acquired Company or Business
Subsidiary employee to severance pay, unemployment compensation or any other
payment, (ii) accelerate the time of payment or vesting, or increase the
amount of any compensation due to any current or former Parent or Acquired
Company or Business Subsidiary employee, or (iii) give rise to the payment of
any amount that would not be deductible pursuant to Code Section 280G.

 



 

(j) The Acquired Companies and Business Subsidiaries do not maintain and are
not otherwise liable in connection with any Employee Benefit Plan or other
benefit arrangement covering any employee or former employee outside of the
United States.

 



 

(k) _Schedule 2.16(k)_ is a true and correct list of all Business Employees.

 



 

(l) All premiums that have fallen due in respect of the Business Benefit Plans
and/or previous Business Benefit Plans or any other pension liabilities or
financial obligations with regard to any of the Business Benefit Plans and/or
previous Business Benefit Plans have been paid by the Parent and the Acquired
Companies and Business Subsidiaries or are adequately provided for in the
accounts of Parent and/or the Acquired Companies and Business Subsidiaries in
accordance with all applicable laws, regulations and practices. There are no
back logs in invoicing by the providers of the Business Benefit Plans or
previous Business Benefit Plans. The Business Benefit Plans apply and the
previous Business Benefit Plans have applied to all eligible employees and
directors and former employees and directors of the Acquired Companies and
Business Subsidiaries, unless they legitimately waived their right to
participate. The current and former employees of the Acquired Companies and
Business Subsidiaries have agreed to all changes to the Business Benefit Plans
and previous Business Benefit Plans.

 



 

(m) The Parties agree that the only representations and warranties of Parent
in this Agreement as to any matters relating to employee benefits are those
contained in this _Section 2.16_.

Company or Business Subsidiary has received any written notice or
communication of any pending action, suit, proceeding, hearing, investigation,
claim, demand or notice relating to the Products or the Businesses alleging
any failure to so comply. Neither Parent nor any Acquired Company or Business
Subsidiary has, since January 1, 2013 conducted an internal investigation
resulting in a finding of an actual violation in any material respect of any
law of any Governmental Entity by any officer or employee of Parent, any
Acquired Company or any Business Subsidiary with respect to the Products or
the Businesses.

 



 

(b) Parent, the Acquired Companies and the Business Subsidiaries,

necessary to allow for the development, marketing, labeling, promotion, sale,
use, handling, or manufacturing of each Product as those activities are
currently conducted with respect to each Product or (ii) otherwise necessary
for Parent, the Acquired Companies and the Business Subsidiaries to conduct
the Businesses and that are material to the Businesses. Neither Parent nor any
Acquired Company or Business Subsidiary is, or since January 1, 2014 has been,
in material violation of or default under any such Permit. As of the date of
this Agreement, no written notice of cancellation or default concerning any
such Permit with respect to each Product has been received by Parent, any
Acquired Company or any Business Subsidiary. Each such Permit is valid and in
full force and effect. All such Permits are either included in the Acquired
Assets or owned by an Acquired Company or Business Subsidiary.

 



 

(c) All material filings, declarations, listings, registrations, reports or
submissions, including adverse event and other safety reports, required to be
filed by Parent, any Acquired Company or any Business Subsidiary with any
Regulatory Authority with respect to any one or more of the Products have been
filed in material compliance with applicable regulatory deadlines. All such
filings, declarations, listings, registrations, reports or submissions were in

this Agreement, no material deficiencies have been asserted in writing by any
applicable Regulatory Authority with respect to any such filings,
declarations, listing, registrations, reports or submissions.

 



 

(d) All preclinical and clinical investigations with respect to any Product
have been, and, are being, conducted in material compliance with applicable

Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009,
and the regulations promulgated thereunder (collectively " _HIPAA_ "), any
applicable state privacy laws, and all other applicable Healthcare Laws. As of
the date of this Agreement, neither Parent nor any Acquired Company or
Business Subsidiary has received any written notice from any Regulatory
Authority with respect to any clinical or pre-clinical studies or tests
concerning any of the Products and requiring the termination,

 



      
 

 



 

suspension or material modification of such studies or tests. No person
involved in any preclinical and clinical investigations concerning any of the
Products has been charged with, or convicted of, any crime or engaged in any
conduct for which debarment is mandated by 21 U.S.C. § 335a(a) or any similar
law or authorized by 21 U.S.C. § 335a(b) or any similar law.

 



 

(e) Parent has made available to Buyer all applications, registrations,
licenses, authorizations, approvals and correspondence submitted to or
received from any Regulatory Authority (including minutes and official contact
reports relating to any communications with any Regulatory Authority) and all
supporting documents and all preclinical studies and other data, relating to
the Products in Parents, any Acquired Companys or Business Subsidiarys
possession or control (" _Regulatory Documentation_ "), in each case to the
extent requested by Buyer or material to the Businesses.

 



 

(f) With respect to each of the Products: (i) each of Parent, the Acquired
Companies and the Business Subsidiaries are in material compliance with all
Healthcare Laws; (ii) have not accepted or received any payments in violation

corrective or remedial action or other compliance or enforcement action
asserted by the FDA; (iv) since January 1, 2014, there has not been a recall
or market withdrawal in respect of any of the Products by Parent, the Acquired
Companies or the Business Subsidiaries whether voluntary or involuntary; and

Business Subsidiary has received any written notification, from the FDA or
other Governmental Entity or Regulatory Authority regarding a potential
violation of any applicable Healthcare Law or contesting the marketing
approval for, uses of the reimbursement of or the labeling of any of the
Products. To Parents knowledge, there are no circumstances currently in
existence that would necessitate a recall or post-sale warning of any of the
Products.

 



 

(g) Since January 1, 2014 and with respect to each of the Products, to
Parents knowledge all serious adverse drug experiences have been reported to
Regulatory Agencies as defined in 21 C.F.R. § 314.80 and there have been no
material events concerning or affecting safety.

 



 

(h) Neither Parent, nor any Acquired Company or Business Subsidiary, or any of
their officers, employees or, to Parents knowledge, agents, has made an
untrue statement of a material fact or a fraudulent statement to any
Governmental Entity or Regulatory Authority or failed to disclose a material
fact required to be disclosed to any Governmental Entity or Regulatory
Authority that, at the time such disclosure or failure to disclose occurred,
would reasonably be expected to provide a basis for the FDA to invoke its
policy respecting Fraud, Untrue Statements of Material Facts, Bribery, and
Illegal Gratuities, set forth in 56 Fed. Reg. 46191 (September 10, 1991). To
Parents knowledge, as of the date of this Agreement, neither Parent nor any
Acquired Company or Business Subsidiary (i) is the subject of any pending or

 



      
 

 



 

threatened investigation by any Regulatory Authority pursuant to its Fraud,
Untrue Statements of Material Facts, Bribery, and Illegal Gratuities policy,
set forth in 56 Fed. Reg. 46191 (September 10, 1991), or (ii) has received any
notification of any such potential investigation.

 



 

(i) Neither Parent, nor any Acquired Company or Business Subsidiary has been
debarred, or been convicted of a crime which would lead to debarment, under 21
U.S.C. § 335a(a) or any similar law or authorized by 21 U.S.C. § 335a(b) or

_ARTICLE VI_, from and after the Closing, Buyer shall indemnify Parent and
its Affiliates (other than any Acquired Company or Business Subsidiary) and

provided by Parent or any of its Affiliates (other than any of the Acquired
Companies or Business Subsidiaries) as of the Closing Date, to the extent
Buyer becomes subject to such obligation in the manner contemplated by
_Section 4.2_.

 



 

6.3 _Claims for Indemnification_.

 



 

(a) _Third-Party Claims_. Subject to _ARTICLE VIII_, all claims for
indemnification made under this Agreement resulting from, related to or
arising out of a third-party claim (a " _Third-Party Claim_ ") against an
Indemnified Party shall be made in accordance with the following procedures. A
Party entitled to indemnification under this _ARTICLE VI_ (an " _Indemnified
Party_ ") shall give prompt written notice to the Party from whom
indemnification is sought (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") of the commencement
of any action, suit or proceeding relating to a Third-Party Claim for which
indemnification may be sought or, if earlier, upon the assertion of any such
claim by a third party. Such written notice shall contain (i) a reasonable

 



      
 

 



 

description and the amount of any Damages incurred by the Indemnified Party
(if and to the extent known), (ii) a statement that the Indemnified Party is
entitled to indemnification under this _ARTICLE VI_ and an explanation in
reasonable detail of the basis therefor, and (iii) a demand for payment in the
amount of such Damages (if and to the extent known). Within 45 days after
delivery of such notification, the Indemnifying Party may, at its own expense,
assume control of the defense of such action, suit, proceeding or claim with
counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, upon written notice
thereof to the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnifying Party does not so
respond to the Indemnified Party within 45 days after delivery of such
notification by the Indemnified Party, the Indemnified Party shall be entitled
to control such defense, provided that the Indemnifying Partys
indemnification obligations hereunder shall continue in accordance with (and
subject to) the terms of this Agreement, including the right of the
Indemnifying Party to dispute any such indemnification obligation. The Party
not controlling such defense may participate therein at its own expense;
provided that if the Indemnifying Party assumes control of such defense and
the Indemnified Party reasonably concludes, based on advice from counsel, that
the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party have conflicting interests
with respect to such action, suit, proceeding or claim, the reasonable fees
and expenses of counsel to the Indemnified Party solely in connection
therewith shall be considered " _Damages_ " for purposes of this Agreement;
provided, however, that in no event shall the Indemnifying Party be
responsible for the fees and expenses of more than one counsel for all
Indemnified Parties. The Party controlling such defense shall keep the other
Party advised of the status of such action, suit, proceeding or claim and the
defense thereof and shall consider recommendations made by the other Party
with respect thereto. The Indemnified Party shall not agree to any settlement
of such action, suit, proceeding or claim without the prior written consent of
the Indemnifying Party. The Indemnifying Party will be entitled to settle,
compromise or discharge such claim without the consent of the Indemnified
Party only to the extent such settlement, compromise or discharge (i)
obligates the Indemnifying Party to pay the full amount of the liability in
connection with such claim, (ii) does not involve any admission of liability
by the Indemnified Party, (iii) constitutes a complete release of the
Indemnified Party from all liability with respect to such claim; and (iv) will
not result in the Indemnified Party becoming subject to material injunctive or
other equitable relief.

 



 

(b) _Procedure for Other Claims_. An Indemnified Party wishing to assert a
claim for indemnification under this _ARTICLE VI_ which is not subject to
_Section 6.3(a)_ shall deliver to the Indemnifying Party a written notice
which contains (i) a reasonably detailed description and the amount of any
Damages (to the extent then known, or a reasonable estimate thereof), incurred
by the Indemnified Party, (ii) a statement that the Indemnified Party is
entitled to indemnification under this _ARTICLE VI_ and a detailed
explanation of the basis therefor, and (iii) a demand for payment of such
Damages. The Indemnifying Party shall have sixty (60) days after receipt of
such notice to notify the Indemnified Party whether or not it disputes its
obligations to indemnify the Indemnified Party with respect to such notice. If
such dispute is not resolved within sixty (60) days following the delivery by
the Indemnified Party of such notice, the Indemnifying Party and the
Indemnified Party shall each have the right to submit such dispute to a court
of competent jurisdiction in accordance with the provisions of _Section
11.16_.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) _Tax Audits_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Parent
shall not settle or resolve (or cause to be settled or resolved) any proposed
Tax adjustment that relates to a Tax period or portion thereof ending on or
prior to the Closing Date if such settlement or resolution could result in a
Tax in a period (or portion thereof) beginning on the day after the Closing
Date without Buyers prior written consent which, shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 



 

6.4 _Survival_.

 



 

(a) The representations and warranties of Parent and Buyer set forth in this
Agreement and the certificates delivered at Closing pursuant to _Sections
5.1(c)_ and _5.2(c)_ shall survive the Closing and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and continue until 18 months following the
Closing Date, at which time they shall expire. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
(i) the Specified Parent Representations and the Specified Buyer
Representations shall survive the Closing and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby until the sixth anniversary of the Closing
Date, at which time they shall expire, (ii) the representations and warranties
of Parent contained in _Section 2.9_ shall expire upon expiration of the
applicable statute of limitations and (iii) the representations and warranties
of Parent contained in _Section 2.12_ shall expire on the third (3rd)
anniversary of the Closing Date.

 



 

(b) The covenants or other agreements contained in this Agreement shall
survive the Closing Date until the date that is sixty (60) days after the
period of performance specified therein or if no period of performance is
specified, until sixty (60) days past the end of any applicable statute of
limitations governing such claim, without giving effect to any tolling or
extension of any statute of limitations that may occur due solely to any
actions or omissions to act by the Indemnified Party.

 



 

(c) Any claim for indemnity pursuant to _Sections 6.1(b)_ through _6.1(e)_
or _Sections 6.2(b)_ through _6.2(d)_ shall survive until sixty (60) days
past the end of any applicable statute of limitations governing such claim, in
each case, without giving effect to any tolling or extension of any statute of
limitations that may occur due solely to any actions or omissions to act by
the Indemnified Party.

 



 

(d) No Party shall have any liability or obligation with respect to a claim
for indemnification asserted under _Section 6.1_ or _Section 6.2_ unless
such claim is properly asserted in writing pursuant to _Section 6.3_ prior to
the expiration of the applicable survival period set forth above in this
_Section 6.4_. Any valid claim that is properly asserted in writing pursuant
to _Section 6.3_ prior to the expiration of the survival period for any such
claim as set forth above in this _Section 6.4_ shall survive until such claim
is finally resolved and satisfied solely for purposes of the resolution
thereof.

 



 

(e) It is the express intent of the Parties that, if the applicable survival
period for a representation and warranty as contemplated by this _Section
6.4_ is shorter than the statute of limitations that would otherwise have been
applicable to such item, then, by contract, the applicable statute of
limitations with respect to such item shall be reduced to the shortened

 



       
 

 



 

survival period contemplated hereby. The Parties further acknowledge that the
time periods set forth in this _Section 6.4_ for the assertion of claims
under this Agreement are the result of arms-length negotiation between the
Parties and that they intend for the time periods to be enforced as agreed by
the Parties.

 



 

6.5 _Limitations_.

 



 

(a) Except as otherwise provided in _Section 1.4_ and except in cases of
willful misconduct, intentional misrepresentation and fraud, from and after
the Closing, the remedies of the Indemnified Parties under this _ARTICLE VI_,
_ARTICLE VIII_ and the other remedies expressly set forth in this Agreement
shall be the sole and exclusive remedies of the Indemnified Parties and their
respective Affiliates with respect to claims resulting from any breach of
representation or warranty or failure to perform any covenant or agreement
contained in this Agreement or otherwise relating to the transactions that are
the subject of this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, in no event shall Buyer or its successors or permitted assigns,
absent manifest fraud be entitled to claim or seek rescission of the
transactions consummated under this Agreement.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, each
of the following limitations shall apply to claims for indemnification
pursuant to this Agreement:

 



 

(i) The aggregate liability of Parent for all Damages under _Section
6.1(a)(i)_ (other than claims for breaches of Specified Parent
Representations, breaches of the representations in _Section 2.9_, breaches
of the representations in _Section 2.12_ or in the event of willful
misconduct, intentional misrepresentation or fraud) and _Section 6.1(d)_
shall not exceed an amount equal to Twelve Million Five Hundred Thousand
Dollars ($12,500,000). The aggregate liability of Parent for all Damages under
_Section 6.1(a)(i)_ (including for breaches of the representations in
_Section 2.12_ but other than claims for breaches of Specified Parent
Representations, breaches of the representations in _Section 2.9_ or in the
event of willful misconduct, intentional misrepresentation or fraud) and
_Section 6.1(d)_ shall not exceed an amount equal to Eighteen Million Five
Hundred Thousand Dollars ($18,500,000). The aggregate liability of Parent for
all other Damages under _Section 6.1_ (including for breaches of Specified
Parent Representations and breaches of the representations in _Section 2.9_)
or in the event of willful misconduct, intentional misrepresentation or fraud
shall not be limited by, and shall not count against, the caps set forth in
the preceding sentences of this _Section 6.5(b)(i)_;

 



 

(ii) Parent shall be liable under _Section 6.1(a)(i)_ (other than claims for
breaches of Specified Parent Representations, breaches of the representations
in _Section 2.9_ or in the event of willful misconduct, intentional
misrepresentation or fraud) and/or _Section 6.1(d)_ for only that portion of
aggregate indemnifiable Damages hereunder that exceeds Six Hundred Twenty-Five
Thousand Dollars ($625,000) (it being understood that Parent shall not be
liable, in any event, for the first Six Hundred Twenty-Five Thousand Dollars
($625,000) of said Damages); and

 



      
 

 



 

(iii) The amount of any Damages for which indemnification is provided under
this Agreement shall be calculated net of any accruals, reserves or provisions
reflected and to the extent provided for in the Final Closing Statement
relating thereto.

 



 

(c) In no event shall any Indemnifying Party be responsible or liable for any
Damages or other amounts under this Agreement that are (i) special or punitive
or (ii) consequential or in the nature of lost profits or diminutions in
value, except to the extent that such Damages are either (x) required to be
paid in connection with a Third-Party Claim or (y) with respect to Damages
described in clause (ii) of this _Section 6.5(c)_ and indemnifiable pursuant
to _Sections 6.1(a)_ , _6.1(b)_ , _6.1(c)_ , _6.1(d)_ or _6.1(e)_ , are
reasonably foreseeable.

 



 

(d) The amount of any Damages for which indemnification is provided under this
Agreement shall be reduced by any related recoveries which the Indemnified
Party receives under insurance policies or from third parties; provided that
nothing herein shall be interpreted as requiring any party to file claims or
otherwise seek recovery under any insurance policies that may provide coverage
with respect to such claims. If an Indemnified Party (or an Affiliate)
receives any insurance or other third-party payment in connection with any
claim for Damages for which it has already received an indemnification payment
from the Indemnifying Party, it shall pay to the Indemnifying Party, within 30
Business Days of receiving such insurance or other third-party payment, an
amount equal to the excess of (i) the amount previously received by the
Indemnified Party under this Agreement with respect to such claim plus the
amount of the insurance or other third-party payment received, over (ii) the
amount of Damages with respect to such claim which the Indemnified Party has
become entitled to receive under this Agreement.

 



 

(e) In no event shall Parent be liable for any Damages arising from or
relating to any act, omission or transaction carried out at the request of
Buyer.

 



 

(f) In no event shall any Parent Indemnified Party be entitled to
indemnification for any matter to the extent a Buyer Indemnified Party is
entitled to indemnification for such matter under this Agreement.

 



 

6.6 _Treatment of Indemnification Payments_. All indemnification payments made
under this Agreement shall be treated by the Parties as an adjustment to the
Adjusted Purchase Price for tax purposes to the extent permitted by law.

Agreement for any reason.

 



 

 **ARTICLE VIII** ** _ 
_****TAX MATTERS**

 



 

8.1 _Preparation and Filing of Tax Returns; Payment of Taxes._

 



 

(a) Parent shall be responsible for the preparation and filing of all Tax
Returns for Parent for all periods and for all income Tax Returns of, or that
include, the Acquired Companies or Business Subsidiaries for all taxable
periods that end on or before the Closing Date. To the extent such Tax Returns
relate to the Acquired Companies or Business Subsidiaries, they shall be
prepared on a basis consistent with the last previous similar Tax Return,
unless otherwise required by law. Parent shall make or cause to be made all
payments required with respect to any such Tax Returns unless such Tax was
included as a current liability of the Businesses in the Final Closing
Adjustment Amount and taken into account in determining

 



      
 

 



 

the Purchase Price in which case, such Tax shall be the responsibility of
Buyer. Buyer shall be responsible for the preparation and filing of all other
Tax Returns relating to the Acquired Companies or Business Subsidiaries for
all taxable periods that end on or before the Closing Date and are filed after
the Closing Date. Such Tax Returns shall be prepared on a basis consistent
with the last previous similar Tax Return, unless otherwise required by law.
Buyer shall provide copies of such Tax Returns to Parent and shall consider in
good faith any adjustments thereto as may be reasonably requested by Parent
prior to filing. Parent shall be liable for all payments required with respect
to any such Tax Returns, unless such Tax was included as a current liability
of the Businesses in the Final Closing Adjustment Amount and taken into
account in determining the Purchase Price. Parent shall provide to Buyer
copies of all income Tax Returns of, or that include, the Acquired Companies
or Business Subsidiaries for all taxable periods that end on or before the
Closing Date that are filed after the Closing Date, provided that in the case
of any Tax Return filed on a consolidated, combined or unitary basis with
Parent or any Parent Affiliate, only the portion of the Tax Return relating to
the Acquired Companies or the Business Subsidiaries and any applicable "tax
packages" containing the information relating to the Acquired Companies and
Business Subsidiaries that was included on such Tax Return shall be provided
to Buyer.

 



 

(b) Buyer shall be responsible for the preparation and filing of all Tax
Returns for the Businesses and the Acquired Companies or Business Subsidiaries
for taxable periods that begin on or before the Closing Date and end after the
Closing Date (" _Straddle Period_ ") which Tax Returns shall be prepared on a
basis consistent with the last previous similar Tax Returns, unless otherwise
required by law. Any Straddle Period Tax Return relating to income Taxes
prepared by Buyer shall be delivered to Parent at least 20 days prior to the
applicable filing due date, and Buyer shall make any adjustments thereto
relating solely to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing
Date as may be reasonably requested by Parent prior to filing, to the extent
such adjustments are consistent with prior similar Tax Returns and are not
contrary to law. Buyer shall be liable for all payments required with respect
to any such Tax Returns; provided, however, that Parent shall reimburse Buyer
within 10 days of the receipt of notification from Buyer of the amount of such
Taxes attributable to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing
Date (as determined pursuant to _Section 8.2(b)_), unless such Tax was
included as a current liability of the Businesses in the Final Closing
Adjustment Amount and taken into account in determining the Purchase Price.

 



 

(c) Buyer and Parent shall each be responsible for one-half (1/2) of the
payment of any transfer, sales, use, excise, stamp, conveyance, value added,
recording, registration, documentary, filing and other fees and charges
(including notary fees) (" _Transfer Tax_ ") arising in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Parent will
file all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to all
such Transfer Taxes and, if required by applicable law, Buyer will join in the
execution of any such Tax Returns and other documentation. The parties shall
jointly determine the proper application of transfer Taxes and similar
requirements to the various components of the transactions contemplated under
this Agreement, including with respect to establishing values or consideration
amounts of individual Acquired Assets consistent with _Section 1.2(a)(iii)_
hereof.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) Buyer shall be responsible for the payment of any and all Taxes of the
Acquired Companies or Business Subsidiaries not incurred in the ordinary
course of business after the Closing on the Closing Date to the extent that
such Taxes are not specifically contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

8.2 _Allocation of Certain Taxes._

 



 

(a) Buyer and Parent agree that if Parent or any Acquired Company or Business
Subsidiary is permitted but not required under applicable foreign, state or
local Tax laws to treat the Closing Date as the last day of a taxable period,
Buyer and Parent shall treat such day as the last day of a taxable period.

 



 

(b) The portion of any Taxes for a Straddle Period allocable to the portion of
such period ending on the Closing Date shall be deemed to equal (i) in the
case of Taxes that (A) are based upon or related to income or receipts or (B)
imposed in connection with any sale or other transfer or assignment of
property, other than Taxes described in _Section 8.1(c)_, the amount which
would be payable if the taxable year ended on the Closing Date, and (ii) in
the case of other Taxes imposed on a periodic basis (including property
Taxes), the amount of such Taxes for the entire period multiplied by a
fraction the numerator of which is the number of calendar days in the period
ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of
calendar days in the entire period. For purposes of the provisions of
_Sections 8.1(b)_ and _8.4_ , each portion of such period shall be deemed to
be a taxable period (whether or not it is in fact a taxable period). For
purposes of computing the Taxes attributable to the two portions of a taxable
period pursuant to this _Section 8.2(b)_, the amount of any item that is
taken into account only once for each taxable period (e.g., the benefit of
graduated tax rates, exemption amounts, etc.) shall be allocated between the
two portions of the period in proportion to the number of days in each
portion.

 



 

8.3 _Tax Indemnification._

 



 

(a) Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless Buyer in respect of and against
(x) Damages resulting from any failure to perform any covenant or agreement of
Parent set forth in this _ARTICLE VIII_, and (y) without duplication, the
following Taxes to the extent such Taxes are not accounted for in determining
the Final Closing Adjustment Amount:

 



 

(i) any Taxes of the Acquired Companies or Business Subsidiaries for any
taxable period as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and for any taxable period ending (or deemed to end pursuant to _Section
8.2(b)_) on or before the Closing Date;

 



 

(ii) any Taxes of Parent, except to the extent allocated to Buyer pursuant to
_Section 8.1(c)_; and

 



 

(iii) any Taxes for which any Acquired Company or Business Subsidiary has any
liability pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6, as a transferee or

 



      
 

 



 

successor, pursuant to any contractual obligation or otherwise, which Tax is
related to the operations of any Acquired Company or Business Subsidiary on or
prior to the Closing Date or an event or transaction occurring before the
Closing.

 



 

(b) Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless Parent in respect of and against
any Damages resulting from failure to perform any covenant or agreement of
Buyer set forth in this _ARTICLE VIII_ or to pay any Taxes allocated to Buyer
pursuant to this _ARTICLE VIII_.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no Buyer Indemnified
Party shall be entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Agreement for any
Damages resulting from, or relating or attributable to Taxes incurred in any
period or portion of a period that begins after the Closing Date (computed in
the case of Straddle Periods, as provided in _Section 8.2_) other than as a
result of the breach of the representations contained in _Section 2.9(i)_,
_(j)_ or _(l)_.

 



 

8.4 _Refunds and Carrybacks._

 



 

(a) Parent shall be entitled to any Tax refunds (including any interest paid
thereon) or credits of Taxes of each Acquired Company or Business Subsidiary
or of Parent with respect to the Businesses that were not accounted for as an
asset in determining the Final Closing Adjustment Amount, in each case,
attributable to taxable periods ending (or deemed to end pursuant to _Section
8.2(b)_) on or before the Closing Date.

 



 

(b) Buyer or its Affiliates, as the case may be, shall be entitled to any Tax
refunds (including any interest paid thereon) or credits of Taxes attributable
to taxable periods beginning (or deemed pursuant to _Section 8.2(b)_ to
begin) after the Closing Date.

 



 

(c) Buyer shall forward to or reimburse Parent for any Tax refunds (including
any interest paid thereon) or credits due to Parent pursuant to _Section
8.4(a)_ after receipt thereof, and Parent shall promptly forward to Buyer or
reimburse Buyer for any Tax refunds (including any interest paid thereon) or
credits due Buyer pursuant to _Section 8.4(b)_ after receipt thereof.

 



 

(d) Buyer and Parent agree that, with respect to any Tax, none of the Acquired
Companies or Business Subsidiaries shall carry back any item of loss,
deduction or credit which arises in any taxable period ending after the
Closing Date to any taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date,
without the prior consent of Parent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.

 



 

8.5 _Cooperation on Tax Matters; Tax Audits._

 



 

(a) Buyer and Parent and their respective Affiliates shall cooperate in the
preparation of all Tax Returns for any Tax periods for which any such Party
could reasonably require the assistance of the other Party in obtaining any
necessary information. Such cooperation shall include furnishing prior years
Tax Returns or return preparation packages to the extent related to the
Businesses illustrating previous reporting practices or containing historical
information relevant to the preparation of such Tax Returns, and furnishing
such other

 



      
 

 



 

information within such Partys possession reasonably requested by the Party
filing such Tax Returns as is relevant to their preparation. Such cooperation
and information also shall include provision of powers of attorney for the
purpose of signing Tax Returns and defending audits and promptly forwarding
copies of appropriate notices and forms or other communications received from
or sent to any applicable Governmental Entity responsible for the imposition
of Taxes (the " _Taxing Authority_ ") which relate to the Businesses, and
providing copies of all relevant Tax Returns to the extent related to the
Businesses, together with accompanying schedules and related workpapers,
documents relating to rulings or other determinations by any Taxing Authority
and records concerning the ownership and Tax basis of property, which the
requested Party may possess. Buyer and Parent and their respective Affiliates
shall make their respective employees and facilities available on a mutually
convenient basis to explain any documents or information provided hereunder.

 



 

(b) Any audit or examination by any Taxing Authority (" _Tax Audit_ ") shall
be treated as a third party claim subject to the provisions of _Section
6.3(a)_.

 



 

(c) Parent shall make an election under Treasury Regulation Section
1.1502-36(d)(6)(i)(A) to reduce Parents basis in Tenaxis stock by the
"attribute reduction amount," as defined in Treasury Regulation Section
1.1502-36(d)(3), so as to avoid a reduction to Tenaxis Tax "attributes" (as
described in Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-36(d)(4)), provided that for
purposes of this _Section 8.5(c)_, any "attribute reduction amount" shall be
computed by assuming that Tenaxis "net inside attribute amount" as defined in
Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-36(d)(3)(iii)(B) does not exceed
$23,500,000.

 



 

8.6 _Termination of Tax Sharing Agreements_. All Tax sharing, Tax indemnity
and Tax allocation agreements or similar arrangements with respect to or
involving the Businesses shall be terminated on or prior to the Closing Date
and, after the Closing Date, Buyer and its Affiliates (including any Acquired
Company or Business Subsidiary) shall not be bound thereby or have any
liability thereunder for amounts due.

 



 

8.7 _Scope of Article VIII_. Any claim by either Party relating to a breach
by the other Party of its obligations under this ARTICLE VIII shall be pursued
in accordance with the procedures for indemnification claims set forth in
_Section 6.3_. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other term or condition
of this ARTICLE VIII, (a) claims for a breach of an obligation under this
ARTICLE VIII may be made by a Party at any time prior to the 60th day after
the expiration of the statute of limitations applicable to the Tax matter to
which the claim relates and (b) to the extent there is any inconsistency
between the terms of ARTICLE VI and this ARTICLE VIII with respect to the
allocation of responsibility between Parent and Buyer for Taxes (and the
procedures with respect thereto), the provisions of this ARTICLE VIII shall

any Taxing Authority relating to the covenant contained in Section 8.5(c) or
that potentially affects the amount of any reduction in the basis of Parent
for its shares of Tenaxis stock as a result of the election referenced in that
covenant shall be considered to be a Third-Party Claim to which the provisions
of Section 6.3(a) apply.

 



      
 

 



 

8.8 _Elections Pursuant to Section 338 of the Code_. Buyer shall not elect,
pursuant to Section 338 of the Code, for the sale of any Acquired Company or
Business Subsidiary by Parent to be treated for United States federal income

OTHER AGREEMENTS**

 



 

9.1 _Access to Information; Record Retention; Cooperation._

 



 

(a) _Access to Information_. Subject to compliance with contractual
obligations and applicable laws and regulations, following the Closing, each
Party shall afford to the other Party and to the other Partys Affiliates,
authorized accountants, counsel and other designated representatives
reasonable access (including using commercially reasonable efforts to give
access to third parties possessing information and providing reasonable access
to its own employees who are in possession of relevant information) and
duplicating rights during normal business hours in a manner so as to not
unreasonably interfere with the conduct of business to all non-privileged
records, books, contracts, instruments, documents, correspondence, computer
data and other data and information (collectively, " _Information_ ") within
the possession of (or readily accessible to) such Party or its Affiliates,
relating to the Businesses prior to the Closing, insofar as such access is
reasonably required by the other Party. Information may be requested under
this _Section 9.1(a)_ for financial reporting and accounting matters,
preparing financial statements, preparing, reviewing and analyzing the Closing
Statement, resolving any differences between the Parties with respect to the
Closing Statement, preparing and filing any Tax Returns, prosecuting any claim
for refunds, defending any Tax claims or assessment, preparing securities law
or exchange filings, prosecuting, defending or settling any litigation,
environmental matter or insurance claim, performing this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, and all other proper business purposes.

 



 

(b) _Access to Personnel_. Following the Closing, each Party shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to make available to the other Party, upon
written request, such Partys and its Affiliates officers, directors,
employees and agents to the extent that such persons may reasonably be
required in connection with any legal, administrative or other proceedings in
which the requesting Party may from time to time be involved relating to the
Businesses prior to the Closing or for any other matter referred to in
_Section 9.1(a)_.

 



 

(c) _Reimbursement_. A Party providing Information or personnel to another
Party under _Section 9.1(a)_ or _Section 9.1(b)_ shall be entitled to
receive from the recipient, upon the presentation of invoices therefor,
payments for such amounts, relating to supplies, disbursements and other out-
of-pocket expenses, as may reasonably be incurred in providing such
Information or personnel; provided, however, that no such reimbursements shall
be required for the salary or cost of fringe benefits or similar expenses
pertaining to employees or directors of the providing Party or its Affiliates.

 



 

(d) _Retention of Records_. Except as otherwise required by law or agreed to
in

 



      
 

 



 

writing by the Parties, Buyer and Parent shall each (and each shall cause its
Affiliates to) use commercially reasonable efforts to preserve all Information
in its possession pertaining to the Businesses prior to the Closing until
December 31, 2022. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in lieu of retaining any
specific Information, any Party may offer in writing to the other Party to
deliver such Information to the other Party and, if such offer is not accepted
within 90 days, the offered Information may be disposed of at any time.

 



 

(e) _Preparation of Parent Financial Statements_. Following the Closing, Buyer
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide to Parent and its
subsidiaries (and its and their respective auditors, attorneys, financial
advisors, bankers and other consultants and advisors) any information
reasonably requested and relating to the Businesses reasonably required by
Parent in (i) preparing, and evaluating and resolving disputes arising out of,
the Closing Statement and (ii) connection with Parent preparing financial
statements of Parent and its subsidiaries for all fiscal periods that precede
or include the Closing Date.

 



 

(f) _Confidentiality_. For a period of five (5) years after the Closing Date,
each of Buyer and Parent (a " _Receiving Party_ ") shall hold, and shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause its Affiliates, consultants and
advisors to hold, in confidence (using the same degree of care as the
Receiving Party would use to protect its own confidential information, but in
no event less than a reasonable degree of care) all Information concerning the
other Party furnished to it by the other Party (the " _Disclosing Party_ ") or
the other Partys Affiliates or representatives at any time prior to Closing
or pursuant to this _Section 9.1_ (except to the extent that the Receiving
Party can demonstrate that such Information (i) is or becomes generally
available to the public other than as a result of a disclosure by the
Receiving Party (or its Affiliates, consultants or advisors) in violation of
the terms of this _Section 9.1,_ (ii) was within the possession of the
Receiving Party prior to it being furnished to the Receiving Party by or on
behalf of the Disclosing Party pursuant hereto, provided that the source of
such information was not known by the Receiving Party at the time of receipt
to be bound by a confidentiality agreement with or other contractual, legal or
fiduciary obligation of confidentiality to the Disclosing Party or any other
party with respect to such information, (iii) is or becomes available to the
Receiving Party from a source other than the Disclosing Party (or its
Affiliates or representatives), provided that such source is not, to the
Receiving Partys knowledge at the time of receipt, bound by a confidentiality
agreement with or other contractual, legal or fiduciary obligation of
confidentiality to the Disclosing Party or any other party with respect to
such information, or (iv) was or is independently developed by the Receiving
Party without utilizing any Information or violating any of the Receiving
Partys obligations under this Agreement), and the Receiving Party shall not
release or disclose such Information to any other person, except its auditors,
attorneys, financial advisors, bankers and other consultants and advisors,
unless compelled to disclose such Information by judicial or administrative
process or by other requirements of law or so as not to violate the rules of
any stock exchange; provided, however, that in the case of disclosure
compelled by judicial or administrative process, the Receiving Party shall (to
the extent permitted by applicable law) notify the Disclosing Party promptly
of the request or requirement so that the Disclosing Party may seek an
appropriate protective order or waive compliance with the provisions of this
_Section 9.1(f)_. If, in the absence of a protective

 



      
 

 



 

order or the receipt of a waiver hereunder, the Receiving Party is compelled
to disclose any Information by judicial or administration process, such
Receiving Party may so disclose the Information; provided, however, that at
the written request of the Disclosing Party, the Receiving Party shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, at the expense of the Disclosing
Party, an order or other assurance that confidential treatment will be
accorded to such portion of the Information required to be disclosed. The
Parties agree that irreparable damage may occur in the event any provision of
this _Section 9.1(f)_ were not performed in accordance with its terms and
that the Disclosing Party will be entitled to seek injunctive relief, as
applicable, in addition to any other remedy at law or in equity, without the
necessity of demonstrating the inadequacy of monetary damages and without the
posting of a bond. In the event of any conflict between the terms of this
_Section 9.1(f)_ and any confidentiality, non-disclosure or similar agreement
entered into between the Parties or their Affiliates prior to the date hereof,
the terms of this _Section 9.1(f)_ shall control.

 



 

9.2 _Director and Officer Indemnification_. Buyer shall not take or cause, or
permit to be taken or caused by any person, any action to alter or impair any
exculpatory or indemnification provisions, now existing in the charter or
bylaws or other organizational documents of any Acquired Company or Business
Subsidiary, for the benefit of any individual who served as a director or
officer of any Acquired Company or Business Subsidiary at any time prior to
the Closing Date, except for any changes that may be required to conform with
changes in applicable law and any changes that do not affect the application
of such provisions to acts or omissions of such individuals prior to the
Closing Date.

 



 

9.3 _Retained Marks_. From and after the Closing, except in accordance with
the license to Retained Marks granted to Buyer in _Section 1.1(f)(iii)_,
neither Buyer nor any Acquired Company or Business Subsidiary shall have any
right to use any Retained Mark and Buyer shall (and shall cause each of its
Affiliates (including the Acquired Companies and the Business Subsidiaries)
to) cease all use of each Retained Mark and not hold itself out as having any
affiliations with Parent or any of its Affiliates. Without limitation of the
foregoing, other than in accordance with the license to Retained Marks granted
to Buyer in _Section 1.1(f)(iii)_, from and after the Closing, Buyer shall,
and shall cause each of its Affiliates to, specify in all correspondence,
communications or other dissemination of information regarding the Businesses
or any Acquired Company or Business Subsidiary made by Buyer or any of its
Affiliates that the Businesses, the Acquired Companies and Business
Subsidiaries and their respective Affiliates are not affiliated with Parent. "
_Retained Marks_ " means all business names, trade names, trademarks, trade
dress and domain names of Parent or any Affiliate of Parent (other than an
Acquired Company or Business Subsidiary), any derivative thereof, or any word
that is similar in sound or appearance to any of the foregoing or is otherwise
confusingly similar thereto and, for the avoidance of doubt, shall include all
business names trade names, trademarks and domain names consisting of, or that
include, the name "MEDICINES COMPANY" or "MEDCO"; provided, however, that the

and domain names that are included in the Acquired Assets or that are owned by
any Acquired Company or Business Subsidiary or any trade names, trademarks,
service marks, or trade dress primarily or solely associated with any of the
Product or any one or more of the

9.4 _Certain Employee Benefits Matters_.

 



 

(a) _Pre-Closing Conduct; Other Liabilities_. Neither Parent nor any Acquired
Company or Business Subsidiary shall terminate the employment of any employee
of Parent named on _Schedule 9.4(a)_ or any employee employed by an Acquired
Company or a Business Subsidiary set forth on _Schedule 9.4(a)_ (such
employees of Parent, the Acquired Companies and the Business Subsidiaries
collectively, " _Business Employees_ ") prior to the Closing without the prior
written consent of Buyer other than Termination for Cause. Parent shall retain
all Parent Benefit Plans and all liabilities with respect thereto, and Buyer
shall not assume any Parent Benefit Plans or liabilities in connection
therewith. Except as otherwise provided in _Section 9.4(h)_, Buyer or the
Acquired Companies or Business Subsidiaries shall be responsible for any
severance amounts to which any New Buyer Employee becomes entitled on account
of a termination of employment after the Closing Date, and Parent shall be
responsible for any severance amounts to which any Business Employee becomes
entitled on account of a termination of employment on or before the Closing
Date. For the avoidance of doubt, Parent shall retain any and all liability
with respect to any individual employment, retention, severance, change in
control or similar agreements for persons employed at Parent who become New
Buyer Employees.

 



 

(b) _Offer of Employment; Continuation of Employment_. The Parties hereto
intend that there shall be continuity of employment with respect to all
Business Employees. Buyer shall offer new or confirm continuing employment
commencing on the first day after the Closing Date to all Business Employees,
including those on vacation, military leave, leave of absence (whether paid or
unpaid), disability or layoff, on the terms set forth in _Section 9.4(c)_.
Buyer shall be provided reasonable access to Business Employees prior to the
Closing Date solely for the purpose of encouraging Business Employees to
accept offers of employment or, as applicable, to maintain their continuing
employment through the Closing Date, and Parent shall grant Buyer reasonable
access to the Business Employees to facilitate enrollment in Buyer benefit
plans, with such access in each case to be on terms, timing, and conditions
agreed to by Parent. The term " _New Buyer Employees_ " shall mean the
Business Employees who commence working with Buyer or an Acquired Company or
Business Subsidiary on the first day after the Closing Date or continue to
work with an Acquired Company or Business Subsidiary on the first day after
the Closing Date. With respect to any Business Employee whose employment will
terminate in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
Parent shall pay, or cause to be paid, to such Business Employee the cash
value of any vacation time or other paid time off that such Business Employee
has accrued but not used as of the date of such Business Employees
termination of employment. _Section 9.4_ shall apply to Business Employees
employed outside the United States to the extent practicable, provided that
Buyer shall in any event comply with applicable law and any Acquired Company
agreements covering such employees.

 



 

(c) _Compensation; Employee Benefits; Severance Plans_. Except as otherwise

 



      
 

 



 

provided in this _Section 9.4_ or as otherwise required by applicable law,
the Business Employees shall cease to participate in or accrue further
benefits under the Parent Benefit Plans immediately prior to the Closing.
Beginning on the first day after the Closing Date, Buyer shall, for the period
ending twelve (12) months after the Closing Date, provide each New Buyer
Employee with (i) a base salary and bonus opportunity that is no less in the
aggregate than each such New Buyer Employee was eligible to receive from
Parent or any of its Affiliates (including any Acquired Company or Business
Subsidiary) immediately prior to the Closing and (ii) employee benefit plans,
agreements, programs, policies and arrangements of Buyer (" _Buyer Plans_ ")
that are materially no less favorable in the aggregate than such Buyer Plans
under which applicable similarly situated employees of Buyer participate.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, beginning on the
first day after the Closing Date, Buyer shall, for the period ending twelve
(12) months after the Closing Date, maintain (or cause its subsidiaries to
maintain) a severance pay plan, program or practice for the benefit of each
New Buyer Employee that is similar to the plan, program or practice in effect
immediately prior to the Closing Date with respect to applicable similarly
situated employees of Buyer. All Buyer Plans, vacation or paid time off
accrual rates, and Buyer severance pay plans, programs or practices shall
recognize all credited service of New Buyer Employees with Parent and its
subsidiaries for purposes of eligibility and vesting and level of benefits to
the same extent such service was recognized under similar plans maintained by
Parent or its subsidiaries immediately prior to the Closing Date, except that
the foregoing shall not apply with respect to any accrual of benefits or
otherwise to the calculation of any accrued benefits under any defined benefit
plan. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to provide for Buyers
express or implied assumption of any collective bargaining or works council
agreement or other labor contract of any kind relating to the representation
of any employees of Parent or its subsidiaries, including but not limited to
the Acquired Companies or Business Subsidiaries, by any union or labor
organization.

 



 

(d) _Welfare Plans_. With respect to any Buyer Plan that is a "employee
welfare benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA), Buyer shall (i)
cause to be waived any pre-existing condition limitations or actively-at-work
requirements and (ii) give effect, in determining any deductible and maximum
out-of-pocket limitations, with respect to the plan year of Buyers plans that
includes the Closing Date, to amounts paid by New Buyer Employees with respect
to similar plans maintained by Parent or its subsidiaries for New Buyer
Employees immediately prior to the Closing Date.

 



 

(e) _Paid Time Off_. Buyer shall permit each New Buyer Employee to accrue paid
time off pursuant to the terms of Buyers policies providing for paid time off
that apply to employees of Buyer who are similarly situated to such New Buyer
Employee immediately after the Closing Date.

 



 

(f) _WARN Act, Etc_. Buyer agrees to provide any required notice under any
WARN Laws and to otherwise comply with any such statute with respect to any
"plant closing" or "mass layoff (as defined in WARN Laws) or similar event
affecting employees and occurring or arising after the Closing Date. Buyer
shall indemnify and hold harmless Parent and its subsidiaries with respect to
any liability under any WARN Laws or other similar applicable law

 



      
 

 



 

arising from the actions (or inactions) of Buyer or its Affiliates after the
Closing Date. Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless Buyer with respect to
any liability under any WARN Laws arising from the actions (or inactions) of
Parent or its subsidiaries on or before the Closing Date.

 



 

(g) _COBRA_. Parent shall retain and otherwise be responsible for all
obligations and liability (including, without limitation, with respect to any
notice, benefits and coverage obligations and liabilities) under the
Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (" _COBRA_ ") and any
other similar applicable law (together, " _COBRA Liabilities_ ") with respect
to current and former employees of the Businesses and their spouses,
dependents and beneficiaries, who have a loss of health care coverage due to a
qualifying event on or before the Closing Date. Buyer shall assume or the
Acquired Companies or Business Subsidiaries shall retain all COBRA Liabilities
with respect to New Buyer Employees and their spouses, dependents and
beneficiaries, who have a loss of health care coverage due to a qualifying
event after the Closing Date.

 



 

(h) _Treatment of Certain Employees_. _Schedule 9.4(h)_ sets forth the
agreement of the Parties with respect to certain employees.

 



 

(i) _Limitations_. Nothing contained herein shall (i) be treated as an
amendment or modification of any employee benefit plan or compensatory
arrangement, (ii) give any current or former employee or any other individual
associated therewith or any Employee Benefit Plan or trustee thereof or any
other third party any right to enforce the provisions of this _Section 9.4_,
(iii) modify, if applicable, the at-will nature of any employees employment;
or (iv) obligate Parent, Buyer or the Acquired Companies or Business
Subsidiaries to (A) maintain any particular benefit plan or compensatory
arrangement, (B) refrain from amending or terminating any particular Employee
Benefit Plan or compensatory arrangement, (C) retain the employment of any
particular employee, or (D) refrain from changing the terms and conditions of
employment.

 



 

9.5 _Resignations_. Effective upon the Closing, Parent shall cause all of its
own employees, directors and attorneys and all of its subsidiaries (other
than the Acquired Companies and Business Subsidiaries) employees, directors
and attorneys to resign from the board of directors of the Acquired Companies
and Business Subsidiaries and from all positions as executive officers of the
Acquired Companies and Business Subsidiaries.

 



 

9.6 _Tenaxis Purchase Agreement and ProFibrix Purchase Agreement_. Effective
upon the Closing, Buyer shall comply with all obligations and liabilities of
Parent or any of its Affiliates under (i) the Tenaxis Purchase Agreement (it
being understood that Buyer shall, in accordance with _Section 6.3(b)_
thereof, pay any remaining Contingent Consideration (as defined therein)), and
(ii) the ProFibrix Purchase Agreement.

 



 

9.7 _Covenant Not to Compete._

 



 

(a) For the period ending on the third (3rd) anniversary of the Closing Date
and anywhere in the world, neither Parent nor any other Restricted Party,
directly or indirectly,

 



      
 

 



 

shall engage in any Competitive Activities. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Buyer hereby agrees that the covenant set forth in the immediately preceding
sentence shall not be deemed to prohibit any of the following: (i) any
Restricted Party from providing services to the Buyer or its Affiliates (or
otherwise performing such Restricted Partys obligations) under the terms of
this Agreement or any agreement delivered in connection herewith or otherwise
taking actions in connection with the winding up of the Businesses, (ii) the
ownership or acquisition by any Restricted Party of any firm, person or entity
which engages, directly or indirectly, in Competitive Activities if such
Competitive Activities account for less than twenty percent (20%) of such
persons consolidated annual revenues in any given calendar year, (iii) any
Restricted Party engaging in any business (other than the Businesses) in which
any Restricted Parties are currently engaged, whether or not any one or more
products or services associated with such business activities might be deemed
to be competitive in some manner with the Competitive Activities, (iv) the
acquisition by any Restricted Party of rights to any product (whether by
purchase, license or otherwise) that may be used for Competitive Activities,
as long as either such product is not so employed or is a product that falls
within the exception set forth in clause (ii) of this sentence as if any such
product was an acquired entity or person for purposes of such clause (ii), or
(v) the acquisition or ownership by any Restricted Party of securities of a
Person whose securities are publicly traded on a recognized securities
exchange or quotation system representing not in excess of five percent (5%)
of any class of such securities. In the event that any Restricted Party
acquires any firm, person or entity which is engaged in Competitive Activities
in excess of the threshold permitted by clause (ii) of the immediately
preceding sentence, the acquisition and ownership of such a firm, person or
entity shall not violate this _Section 9.7_ so long as such Restricted Party
makes commercially reasonable efforts to divest any portion of that firm,
person or entity that is involved in such Competitive Activities within twelve
(12) months after such acquisition. For the avoidance of doubt, this _Section
9.7(a)_ shall not bind any purchaser of all or substantially all of Parents
capital stock or assets.

 



 

(b) Without limiting the remedies available, the Parties agree that damages at
law would be an insufficient remedy in the event of breach of this _Section
9.7_ by Parent or its Affiliates and that Buyer shall be entitled to seek
injunctive relief or other equitable remedies in the event of any such breach
without the necessity of posting a bond or other form of financial assurance.

 



 

(c) If any of the provisions of this _Section 9.7_ are held to be
unenforceable in any jurisdiction, then, as to such jurisdiction, such
provision shall be ineffective to the extent of its unenforceability in such
jurisdiction, without affecting the remaining provisions of this _Section
9.7_ in such jurisdiction, or affecting in any other jurisdiction the validity
or enforceability of such provision or of this _Section 9.7_.

 



 

9.8 _Consents_.

 



 

(a) During the period prior to the Closing, Parent shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates to, subject to the terms of this Agreement, use reasonable best
efforts (a) to obtain all consents under the contracts identified on _Schedule
9.8(a)_ that are required to be obtained from

 



      
 

 



 

third parties in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (the " _Specified Consents_ ") and (b) (i) to obtain the consent of
any third party required for the assignment or transfer of the rights and
obligations under the contracts identified on _Schedule 9.8(b)_ (solely to
the extent such rights and obligations are related to the Businesses) (the "
_Shared Consents_ "). During such period, Buyer shall provide all reasonable
assistance to Parent in obtaining such consents. For the avoidance of doubt,
the failure to obtain any Specified Consent or Shared Consents or
Arrangements, in and of itself, shall not constitute a breach of this _Section
9.8_ or constitute a Business Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(b) If any Specified Consent or Shared Consent is not obtained prior to the
Closing, then during the period until such consent is obtained not to exceed
one (1) year after the Closing, Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to
cooperate with Buyer to obtain such Specified Consent or Shared Consent and
Parent and Buyer shall cooperate in all reasonable respects, in any lawful and
commercially reasonable arrangement reasonably proposed by Buyer under which
(A) Buyer would obtain (without infringing upon the legal rights of any third
party) the economic claims, rights and benefits thereof and (B) Buyer would
assume any and all related economic burden with respect to such Shared
Contract, to the extent related to the Businesses (collectively, the consents
and arrangements described in clause (a) and this clause (b), the " _Shared
Consents or Arrangements_ ").

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Party nor any of its respective
Affiliates shall have any obligation to (1) pay sums of money or provide any
guarantee or other consideration, or agree to any undertaking, in connection
with obtaining the consents or approvals referred to in this _Section 9.8_ or
otherwise agree to any action that would adversely affect either Party, or its
or its Affiliates businesses or operations, or any right or obligation of
such Party or any of its Affiliates under any contract related to such
Specified Consent or Shared Consents or Arrangements; (2) waive or discharge
any liabilities or obligations owing to either Party or its Affiliates by any
counterparty under any such contract; (3) waive any rights of either Party or
its Affiliates under any such contracts; or (4) amend, modify, supplement or
otherwise change in any material respect (including any change that adversely
affects pricing) the terms of any such contract.

 



 

(d) Parent shall reimburse Buyer for any reasonable out-of-pocket costs and
expenses, subject to Buyer providing reasonable supporting documentation for
such costs and expenses to Parent, incurred in connection with obtaining the
Specified Consents and Shared Consents up to a maximum aggregate amount equal
to [**] Dollars ($[**]).

 



 

 **ARTICLE X** ** 
POST-CLOSING COMMERCIALIZATION AND REGULATORY COVENANTS**

 



 

10.1 _Commercialization Effort_. From and after the Closing, Buyer will use
commercially reasonable efforts to market, sell and promote the Products;
[**]. For purposes of the immediately preceding sentence, "commercially
reasonable efforts" shall mean those efforts that a branded dosage
pharmaceutical business would reasonably employ to market, sell and promote
any similar branded dosage pharmaceutical product taking into account all
relevant

 



      
 

 



 

circumstances, including (with respect to any Product and without limitation)
[**]. As part of its commercially reasonable efforts to market, sell and
promote the Products, Buyer does not represent, warrant or covenant to Parent
that [**].

 



 

10.2 _Net Sales Reporting_. Within thirty (30) days of the end of each
Calendar Quarter, Buyer shall provide to Parent a statement (the " _Net Sales
Statement_ "), showing in reasonably specific detail for such Calendar Quarter
and for the period comprising such Calendar Quarter and the three (3)
consecutive Calendar Quarters immediately preceding such Calendar Quarter (i)
the amount of Net Sales for each Product, (ii) taking into account all
appropriate deductions, an itemized calculation of Net Sales for each Product
and (iii) the amount of the milestone payments due to Parent pursuant to
_Section 1.2(a)(i)_, if any. Upon Parents reasonable request, Buyer shall
provide to Parent back-up information used to prepare such Net Sales
Statement. Buyer shall keep such records (and shall require its Affiliates,
licensees, sublicensees, assignees and other transferees to keep such records)
as shall be reasonably necessary to support the calculations of Net Sales as
set forth in each Net Sales Statement. Such records shall be available for
inspection and audit by Parent or its respective authorized representatives,
at reasonable times and on reasonable advance notice, for a period of three
(3) years after Parents receipt of any Net Sales Statement to which such
records relate. Each Net Sales Statement and all records of Buyer, its
Affiliates, licensees, sublicensees, assignees and other transferees subject
to inspection pursuant to this _Section 10.2_ shall be deemed to be the
Confidential Information of Buyer subject to the confidentiality obligations
of _Section 9.1(f)_. If, as a result of any such audit or inspection, Parent
reasonably concludes that Buyer has underreported the Net Sales for any
audited period, Parent shall inform Buyer of the Net Sales for such audited
period as calculated by Parent in a written notice setting forth Parents
calculation of such Net Sales in reasonable detail. Unless and to the extent
Buyer reasonably disputes Parents calculation of Net Sales set forth in such
notice, Net Sales for such audited period shall be deemed to be the amount set
forth in such notice and if, based upon such calculation, any amounts are due
to Parent in accordance with _Section 1.2(a)(i)_, Buyer will pay such amounts
to Parent within ten (10) Business Days of its receipt of such notice from
Parent. In the event Buyer disputes Parents calculation of Net Sales as set
forth in such notice within thirty (30) days after receipt of such notice,
Buyer will so notify Parent in writing within such thirty (30) day period and
the Parties will attempt thereafter to resolve such dispute amicably and, if
they cannot do so, they will submit the dispute for resolution to an
independent third party accounting firm jointly selected by the Parties (the "
_Independent Arbiter_ "). The decision of the Independent Arbiter as to the
amount of Net Sales for such audited period shall be final. Parent shall pay
the cost of any such inspection and audit (including, if applicable, the fees
and expenses of any Independent Arbiter), unless the results of such
inspection demonstrate any underreporting of Net Sales of two percent (2%) or
more with respect to the period in dispute, in which event Buyer shall bear
the cost of such inspection and audit and the fees and expenses of any
Independent Arbiter.

 



 

10.3 _Technology Transfer_. Parent, with the cooperation of Buyer, will effect
an orderly transfer to Buyer or its designated Affiliate, as soon as possible
following the Closing, of the Know-How included in the Acquired Assets and of
the Licensed Product Technology, if any, that, in each case, is not in the
possession of any of the Acquired Companies or Business

 



      
 

 



 

Subsidiaries at the Closing (the " _Transferred Technology_ ") as soon as
practicable following the Closing. Parent will provide all reasonable
cooperation and assistance requested by Buyer in connection with such
transfer, including such assistance as may be reasonably requested by Buyer to
enable Buyer (or its Affiliate or any one or more designated third party
manufacturer, as applicable) to manufacture the Products in accordance with
the current applicable Regulatory Approvals at the facility or facilities
designated by Buyer. Such assistance shall include providing all reasonably
requested documentation of the Transferred Technology constituting material
support, performance advice, shop practice, standard operating procedures,
specifications as to materials to be used and control methods, in each case
that is reasonably necessary or useful to enable Buyer (or its Affiliate or
any one or more designated third party manufacturer, as applicable) to
manufacture the Products in accordance with the current applicable Regulatory
Approvals. In addition, Parent shall cause all appropriate employees and
representatives of Parent and its Affiliates to meet with employees or
representatives of Buyer (or its Affiliate or any one or more designated third
party manufacturer, as applicable) at the applicable manufacturing facility or
facilities at mutually convenient times to assist with the establishment and
use of the applicable Transferred Technology for the manufacture of the
Products in accordance with the current applicable Regulatory Approvals and
with the training of the personnel of Buyer (or its Affiliate or any one or
more designated third party manufacturer, as applicable) to the extent
reasonably necessary or useful to enable Buyer (or its Affiliate or any one or
more designated third party manufacturer, as applicable) to use and practice
the Transferred Technology for the manufacture of the Products in accordance
with the current applicable Regulatory Approvals. Buyer will bear its own
costs incurred by it and its Affiliates in connection with its activities
undertaken under this _Section 10.3_. The services of Parent performed
pursuant to this _Section 10.3_ shall constitute a Service (as defined in the
Transition Services Agreement) and Buyer shall pay to Parent a Service Fee
determined in accordance with _Section 2.5_ thereof, on the terms set forth
in the Transition Services Agreement; provided, that no Service Fee shall be
payable with respect to any Services (as defined in the Transition Services
Agreement) provided by employees of ProFibrix to the extent Buyer is
responsible for the salary and benefits of such employees pursuant to
_Schedule 9.4(h)_. The Parties acknowledge and agree that it is in their

any one or more designated third party manufacturer, as applicable) in the
jurisdictions in which Regulatory Approvals have been granted. Without
limiting the foregoing, (i) with respect to all such Regulatory Approvals of
the FDA, (A) Parent shall file all documents required pursuant to 21 C.F.R.
part 314.72 and (B) to the extent not provided prior to the Closing, Parent
shall provide to Buyer a complete copy of such Regulatory Approvals, including
supplements and records that are required to be kept under 21 C.F.R. part
314.81, (ii) with respect to all such Regulatory Approvals of Regulatory

required notifications of the transfer of the Regulatory Approvals with the
applicable Regulatory Authorities and (iii) Parent shall take all other
actions required to be taken by Parent, as the current owner of the Regulatory
Approvals, that are necessary to effect such transfer within the five (5) day
period after the Closing. Prior to the transfer of the Regulatory Approvals to
Buyer, Parent shall remain responsible, at Buyers sole expense, for all
regulatory responsibilities related to the Regulatory Approvals as holder of
such Regulatory Approvals. From and after the Closing, all decisions regarding

shall be at its sole cost. Parents NDC Numbers. Buyer covenants and agrees
that following the Closing Date (if permitted by law), Buyer shall (if not
already applied for) use commercially reasonable efforts to establish a new
NDC for each Recothrom Product sold under an NDC of Parent (each a " _Parent
NDC Number_ ") as soon as possible after the Closing and Parent covenants and
agrees to provide commercially reasonable assistance toward such efforts as
Buyer may reasonably request. Buyer will be permitted to sell Recothrom
Product using Parents NDC (i) for any Recothrom Product inventory that Buyer
acquires from Parent that bears Parents NDC until the date such inventory is
exhausted and (ii) for Recothrom Product manufactured after the Closing, but
only to prevent a stock-out or shortage of Recothrom Product for sales of such
Recothrom Product occurring during the twelve (12) month period immediately
following the Closing; provided, however, that Buyer shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to exhaust Recothrom Product inventory that Buyer acquires
from Parent prior to using Parents NDC on Recothrom Product manufactured
after the Closing. Promptly upon receipt by Buyer of a Buyer NDC Number for a
Product, Buyer shall file any necessary documentation to establish Buyer as
the party responsible for all reporting obligations to a Governmental Entity
with respect to such Recothrom Product.

 



 

10.6 _Trade Returns, Medicaid Rebates, Chargebacks_.

 



 

(a) Parent shall be responsible for processing returns of all Recothrom
Products submitted for return prior to the Return Changeover Date and shall be
responsible for all costs associated therewith. From and after the Return
Changeover Date, Buyer shall process all returns of Recothrom Products that
are made in compliance with Buyers returned goods policy, irrespective of the
NDC or seller of such returned Recothrom Product and, except as provided
below, shall be responsible for all costs associated therewith. To the extent
that a return is made to Parent after the Return Changeover Date, if such
return relates to a Recothrom Product sold by Parent, then Parent shall refer
any such Recothrom Product return to Buyer for

 



      
 

 



 

processing, regardless of whether or not such return relates to Recothrom
Products sold by Parent prior to the Return Changeover Date. If any amount
paid or credited by Buyer in respect of any return it processes is an Excluded
Liability, Parent will reimburse Buyer for such amount upon receipt of an
invoice accompanied by all reasonable requested supporting documentation.

 



 

(b) Buyer will be responsible for processing and paying any and all Payment
Claims for Recothrom Products bearing a Buyer NDC Number. With respect to any
Recothrom Products bearing a Parent NDC Number, the following shall apply:

 



 

(i) From and after the Transition Date until the Rebate/Chargeback Termination
Date (or, with respect to any Government Reimbursements and Rebates, for such
longer period as may be required by applicable law (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, any Healthcare Law or law of any Regulatory Authority),
Parent shall process all Payment Claims for any Recothrom Product bearing
Parents NDC Number in accordance with the terms of the applicable contract or
applicable law, as the case may be, and shall make all payments required in
connection therewith. From and after the Rebate/Chargeback Termination Date
(or, if later, from and after the date Parent is no longer obligated to do so,
with respect to any Government Reimbursements and Rebates), Buyer shall
process all Payment Claims for any Recothrom Product bearing Parents NDC
Number in accordance with the terms of the applicable contract or applicable
law, and shall make all payments required in connection therewith.

 



 

(ii) Parent shall be financially responsible for all Payment Claims that, as
applicable, are directed to (1) Recothrom Product bearing Parents NDC Number
sold by a wholesaler or distributor to an end purchaser customer prior to the
Rebate/Chargeback Termination Date (based on the date reflected on the invoice
date in the applicable Payment Claims data or report), (2) Recothrom Product
bearing Parents NDC Number dispensed by a pharmacy or other entity prior to
the Rebate/Chargeback Termination Date (based on the date reflected on the
applicable Payment Claims data or report), or (3) utilization of any Recothrom
Product bearing Parents NDC Number occurring prior to the Rebate/Chargeback
Termination Date (based on any applicable Payment Claims data or report of any
applicable Governmental Entity). Buyer shall be financially responsible for
all Payment Claims that, as applicable, are directed to (1) Recothrom Product
bearing Parents NDC Number sold by a wholesaler or distributor to an end
purchaser customer on or after the Rebate/Chargeback Termination Date (based
on the date reflected on the invoice date in the applicable Payment Claims
data or report), (2) Recothrom Product bearing Parents NDC Number dispensed
by a pharmacy or other entity on or after the Rebate/Chargeback Termination
Date (based on the date reflected on the applicable Payment Claims data or
report), or (3) utilization of any Recothrom Product bearing Parents NDC
Number on or after the Rebate/Chargeback Termination Date (based on any
applicable Payment Claims data or report of any applicable Governmental
Entity).

 



 

(iii) To the extent Parent is required to and does process and pay any Payment
Claims for which Buyer is financially responsible, as provided above, Buyer
will reimburse Parent for such Payment Claims upon receipt of an invoice
accompanied by all reasonably requested supporting documentation. To the
extent Buyer is required to and does

 



      
 

 



 

process and pay any Payment Claims for which Parent is financially
responsible, as provided above, Parent will reimburse Buyer for such Payment
Claims upon receipt of an invoice accompanied by all reasonably requested
supporting documentation to the extent such Payment Claims exceed the amount
of all reserves therefor reflected on the Final Closing Statement. For
invoices for Payment Claims that include periods for which both Parties are
financially responsible, the financial responsibility for such Payment Claim
will be split pro rata based on the number of days in the period and the Party
who did not pay such Payment Claim shall reimburse the Party who did pay such
Payment Claim upon receipt of an invoice accompanied by all reasonably
requested supporting documentation.

 



 

(c) Promptly following the Closing, Buyer and Parent shall coordinate and use
commercially reasonable efforts to: (i) (x) add the Recothrom Products to
Buyers contracts with its wholesalers, government buyers, group purchasing
organizations and similar customers and (y) add the Recothrom Products to
Buyers FSS Program, in each case, to coincide, where possible, with removal
of the Recothrom Products from Parents Contracts with such customer or
programs, as the case may be, and to cause such additions to occur as close to
the Transition Date as possible and (ii) enable Buyer to process Payment
Claims for any Recothrom Product bearing Parents NDC Number associated with
purchases by the PHS 340B Program covered entities after the Transition Date.

 



 

(d) In the event that any pricing change made by Buyer after the Closing Date
has the effect of increasing any chargeback or similar liability or payment
obligation owed by Parent to any third party with respect to sales by or on
behalf of Parent before the Rebate/Chargeback Termination Date to an amount
greater than the amount such chargeback or similar liability or payment
obligation would have been in the absence of such pricing change, Buyer shall
reimburse Parent for such increase in liability or payment obligation incurred
by Parent.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, all of Parents
obligations under this _Section 10.6_ shall expire on the second (2nd)
anniversary of the Closing Date.

 



 

10.7 _Adverse Experience Reports_. Parent, the Acquired Companies or the
Business Subsidiaries, as the case may be, shall continue to be responsible
for adverse experience reporting to all applicable Regulatory Authorities
until the Closing and, prior to the Closing, shall provide Buyer with copies
of all adverse experience reports contemporaneously with submittal to the FDA
or any other Regulatory Authority. On and after the Closing and, with respect
to the Recothrom Products, the subsequent transfer of the Regulatory Approvals
(as provided in _Section 10.5_), Buyer shall be responsible for adverse
experience reporting to the FDA and any other Regulatory Authority in respect
of the Products. Parent shall at all times until the second (2nd) anniversary
of the Closing Date provide to Buyer all adverse drug experience information
and customer complaints brought to the attention of Parent in respect of the
Products manufactured by or for Parent or any of the Acquired Companies or
Business Subsidiaries, as well as any material events and matters concerning
or affecting safety of the

 



       
 

 



 

Products manufactured by or for Parent or any of the Acquired Companies or
Business Subsidiaries. At and after the Closing until the second (2nd)
anniversary of the Closing, Parent shall promptly cooperate with Buyers
reasonable requests regarding adverse experience information in respect of the
Products to ensure that all adverse experience data is transferred to Buyer or
its designated Affiliate. After the Closing until the second (2nd) anniversary
of the Closing, Parent will submit to Buyer all adverse drug experience
information and customer complaints brought to the attention of Parent in
respect of any of the Products, as well as any material events and matters
concerning or affecting safety of any of the Products. After the Closing until
the second (2nd) anniversary of the Closing, any new adverse experience
reports or information, customer complaints, or any follow-up adverse
experience reports or information received by Parent relating to any Product
will be forwarded to Buyer, together with any source documents, within five
(5) calendar days after receipt by Parent. Unless notified otherwise in
writing by Buyer, Parent shall forward such reports to such address as Buyer
may specify by written notice to Parent.

 



 

10.8 _Information and Reporting._

Transition Date, Parent will remain responsible for reporting pricing for
Recothrom Products that are determined by Parent to be a "covered outpatient
drug" as defined by 42 U.S.C. § 1396r-8(k)(3) sold prior to the Transition
Date that bear Parents NDC Numbers in the Drug Data Reporting for Medicaid
system of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. The Parties will
reasonably cooperate with respect to transition of such reporting obligations
to Buyer and, prior to and after the Transition Date, Parent shall provide
Buyer any information reasonably requested by Buyer related to Parents NDC
Number to enable Buyer to comply with its reporting and pricing obligations
under applicable law. Without limiting the forgoing, with respect to the
Parties reporting responsibilities in respect of Recothrom Products bearing
Parents NDC Numbers, the Parties agree to cooperate and use commercially
reasonable efforts to provide on a timely basis all pricing information
requested by each Party that the reporting Party is required to report under
any applicable law and to otherwise cooperate and provide any other
documentation as each Party may reasonably request from time to time to assist
in the matters described in this _ARTICLE X_, as well as to provide any other
cooperation and documentation required by such Party to meet its reporting
obligations with respect to Products to Regulatory Authorities. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, (i) within ten (10) days following
the end of the month during which the Closing occurs, each Party shall provide
to the other Party, in a customary format reasonably agreed upon, all such
data or other information regarding sales, timing and pricing for the
Recothrom Products as is necessary or as a Party may reasonably request to
enable such Party to accurately calculate, for appropriate periods, an
"average manufacturer price" or "best price" for Recothrom Products, as
applicable and (ii) with respect to any such information to be provided
pursuant to this _Section 10.8_ for periods following the Closing, such
information shall be provided within twenty (20) days after the end of the
applicable calendar month or quarter. Without limiting the foregoing, any and
all pricing information furnished by either Party that will be relied upon by
the other Party to meet its reporting obligations with respect to Products to
Regulatory Authorities pursuant to this

 



      
 

 



 

subsection shall be certified in the same format provided to such Regulatory
Authority, or in a format otherwise mutually agreed upon by the Parties. Buyer
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to establish its own NDC numbers
with respect to the Recothrom Products as soon as practicable (and in any
event within sixty (60) days) after the Closing Date.

 



 

(b) Any delays, errors, or omissions in data provided or required to be
provided by Buyer to Parent pursuant to this _Section 10.8_ that result in
fines, penalties, interest or other charges to Parent shall be the sole
responsibility of Buyer and Buyer shall reimburse Parent for any such
payments. Any delays, errors, or omissions in data provided or required to be
provided by Parent to Buyer pursuant to this _Section 10.8_ that result in

payments. All such reimbursements shall be made within thirty (30) days after
written request by the Party to be reimbursed, attaching all documentation
necessary to support such amounts.

Parent or its Affiliates (other than any Acquired Company or Business
Subsidiary), customers who are a party to a written contract with Parent or
its Affiliates related to the purchase of Recothrom Product that is not an
Acquired Asset and all other third parties engaged by Parent and Buyer or its
Affiliates in the acquisition and distribution of Product (i) of the transfer
of the Acquired Assets and Assumed Liabilities to Buyer and (ii) that all
purchase orders for Recothrom Products received by Parent prior to the Closing
but not shipped prior to 11:59 p.m. (EST) on the date of the Closing will be
transferred to Buyer or its designated Affiliate (provided, that, to the
extent that any purchase order cannot be so transferred, Parent and Buyer
shall cooperate with each other to ensure that such purchase order is filled
and that Buyer receives the same economic benefit and assumes the same
liability associated with filling such purchase order as if such purchase
order had been so transferred) and (iii) that all purchase orders for
Recothrom Product received after the date of Closing should be sent to Buyer
at such address as Buyer may specify in a written notice to Parent.

Either Party may give any notice, request, demand, claim, or other
communication hereunder using any other means (including personal delivery,
expedited courier, messenger service, telex, ordinary mail, or electronic
mail), but no such notice, request, demand, claim or other

actually is received by the Party for whom it is intended. Either Party may
change the address to which notices, requests, demands, claims and other
communications hereunder are to be delivered by giving the other Party notice

11.9 _Amendments and Waivers_. Authorized representatives of the Parties may
mutually amend or waive any provision of this Agreement at any time. No
amendment or waiver of any provision of this Agreement shall be valid unless
the same shall be in writing and signed by authorized representatives of each
of the Parties.

 



 

11.10 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid
or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect the
validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or the
validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any other
situation or in any other jurisdiction, unless the invalid or unenforceable
term or provision is of such importance to one or both Parties that it would
be reasonable to presume that such Party or Parties would not receive the
benefit of its bargain if such term or provision is absent. If the final
judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction declares that any term or
provision hereof is invalid or unenforceable, the Parties agree that the body
making the determination of invalidity or unenforceability shall have the
power to reduce the scope, duration or area of the term or provision, to
delete specific words or phrases, or to replace any invalid or unenforceable
term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and
that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable
term or provision, and this Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified
after the expiration of the time within which the judgment may be appealed
unless, even after such deletion, replacement or other modification such Party
or Parties would not receive the benefit of its bargain if such term or
provision is so deleted, replaced or otherwise modified.

 



 

11.11 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise specifically provided to the contrary in
this Agreement, each of the Parties shall bear its own costs and expenses
(including legal fees and expenses) incurred in connection with this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

11.12 _Foreign Exchange Conversions_. If any amount to be paid, transferred,
allocated, indemnified, reimbursed or calculated pursuant to, or in accordance
with, the terms of this Agreement or any Exhibit or Schedule (including the
Disclosure Schedule) referred to herein (including the calculation, payment or
reimbursement of Damages under _ARTICLE VI_ hereof) is originally stated or
expressed in a currency other than United States Dollars, then, for the
purpose of determining the amount to be so paid, transferred, allocated,
indemnified, reimbursed or calculated, such amount shall be converted into
United States Dollars at the exchange rate between those two currencies most
recently quoted in The Wall Street Journal in New York as of the Business Day
immediately prior to (or, if no such quote exists on such Business Day, on the
closest Business Day prior to) the day on which the Party required to make
such payment, transfer, indemnification, reimbursement or calculation first
becomes obligated to do so hereunder (or, in the case of _ARTICLE VI_ hereof,
would have first become obligated to do so but for the operation of _Section
6.5(b)_ hereof); provided, however, that nothing in this

 



      
 

 



 

 _Section 11.12_ shall be deemed to require either Party to make any foreign
currency conversion or other similar calculation that violates or conflicts
with, or otherwise causes a Party to violate, applicable law or GAAP.

 



 

11.13 _Bulk Transfer Laws_. Buyer acknowledges that Parent will not comply
with the provisions of the bulk transfer laws of any jurisdiction in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and Buyer
agrees that it shall not make or permit to be made any filings under or with
respect to any such laws in any jurisdiction.

 



 

11.14 _Specific Performance_. Each Party acknowledges and agrees that the
other Party would be damaged irreparably in the event any of the provisions of
this Agreement are not performed in accordance with their specific terms or
otherwise are breached. Accordingly, each Party agrees that the other Party
may be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of the
provisions of this Agreement and to enforce specifically this Agreement and
the terms and provisions hereof in any action instituted in any court of the
United States or any state or jurisdiction thereof having jurisdiction over
the Parties and the matter.

 



 

11.15 _Governing Law_. Subject to the provisions of certain Exhibits hereto
regarding the application of local law, this Agreement shall be governed by
and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of New York
without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule
(whether of the State of New York or any other jurisdiction) that would cause
the application of laws of any jurisdiction other than those of the State of
New York.

 



 

11.16 _Submission to Jurisdiction; Process Agent_.

 



 

(a) Subject to the provisions of certain Exhibits hereto regarding the
submission of actions and proceedings arising out of or relating to such
Exhibits to courts of local jurisdictions, each Party (a) submits to the
exclusive jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York or, if unavailable on jurisdictional grounds, any state
court sitting in the City of New York, New York in any action or proceeding
arising out of or relating to this Agreement, (b) agrees that all claims in
respect of such action or proceeding may be heard and determined only in any
such court, and (c) agrees not to bring any action or proceeding arising out
of or relating to this Agreement in any other court. Each Party waives any
defense of inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any action or proceeding
so brought and waives any bond, surety or other security that might be
required of the other Party with respect thereto. Either Party may make
service on the other Party by sending or delivering a copy of the process to
the Party to be served at the address and in the manner provided for the
giving of notices in _Section 11.8_. Nothing in this _Section 11.16_,
however, shall affect the right of either Party to serve legal process in any
other manner permitted by law.

 



 

(b) Buyer hereby agrees that service of all writs, process and summonses in
any actions or proceedings arising out of this Agreement may be made upon CT
Corporation (the " _Process Agent_ ") and hereby irrevocably appoints the
Process Agent as its true and lawful agent for the service of process in its
name, place and stead to accept such service of any and all such writs,
process and summonses, and agrees that the failure of the Process Agent to
give to Buyer

 



      
 

 



 

any notice of such service of such writs, process or summonses shall not
impair or affect the validity of such service or of any judgment based
thereon. Buyer agrees to maintain at all times the agent aforesaid in the
State of New York, and to give Parent advance written notice of any change of
such Process Agent. Nothing in this _Section 11.16(b)_ shall be deemed in any
way to limit the ability of Parent to serve any such writs, process or
summonses in any other manner permitted by law or to obtain jurisdiction over
Buyer in such other jurisdictions, and in such manner, as my be permitted by
applicable law.

 



 

11.17 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. To the extent permitted by applicable law, each
Party hereby irrevocably waives all rights to trial by jury in any action,
proceeding or counterclaim (whether based on contract, tort or otherwise)
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby or the actions of either Party in the negotiation, administration,
performance and enforcement of this Agreement.
