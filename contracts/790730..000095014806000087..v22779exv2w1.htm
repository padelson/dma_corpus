Sellers is subject to the terms of a confidentiality agreement dated October&nbsp;12, 2005 between Buyer
and Sellers (the &#147;Confidentiality Agreement&#148;) and the Access Agreement, the terms of which are
incorporated herein by reference. Effective upon, and only upon, the Closing, the Confidentiality
Agreement will terminate; <U><I>provided</I></U><I>, </I><U><I>however</I></U>, that Buyer acknowledges that the

herein, if Buyer, through settlement, enforcement of a judgment or otherwise, receives payments
that are attributable to damages suffered by Sellers prior to the Closing by reason of
infringement, misappropriation or other violation of any Intellectual Property by a third Person,
Buyer shall pay over to Sellers seventy-five percent (75%) of the amount of such payment promptly
after receipt. If any Seller requests in a writing delivered to Buyer after the Closing that Buyer
bring a legal action against a third Person on account of any infringement, misappropriation or
other violation of Intellectual Property prior to Closing, and if Buyer does not commence a legal
action against such third Person on account of such infringement, misappropriation or other
violation within ninety (90)&nbsp;days after such Seller delivers such written request, or if Buyer
commences such legal action within such 90-day period, but thereafter does not continue the
prosecution of legal action (other than by reason of a settlement), such Seller shall have the
exclusive right to commence or continue such legal action, in its own name or in the name of Buyer,
and to recover solely for its own account any and all damages suffered by such Seller or any other
Seller prior to the Closing by reason of any such infringement, misappropriation or other
violation. Buyer agrees to cooperate with such Seller in the event such Seller brings any such
legal action, including authorizing such Seller to bring such action in the name of Buyer.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Governmental Authority conditions the grant of any consent or
approval which is necessary to lawfully consummate the Transactions under any Antitrust Laws on (i)
Buyer agreeing to divest itself of any portion of the Business, or (ii)&nbsp;Buyer agreeing, at its

otherwise adversely affect the rights of Sellers or Buyer under such Contract, or would not assign

use all reasonable efforts to provide Buyer with all such rights. To the extent that any such
consents and waivers are not obtained, or until the impediments to such assignment are resolved,
Sellers shall use all reasonable efforts (without the expenditure, in the aggregate, of any
material sum) to (i)&nbsp;provide to Buyer, at the request of Buyer, the benefits of any such Contract
to the extent related to the Business, (ii)&nbsp;cooperate in any lawful arrangement designed to provide

the limitations set forth in Section&nbsp;8.1), each party will use all reasonable efforts to cause the
Closing to occur. Each of Sellers and Buyer will promptly notify the other promptly after learning
of the occurrence of any event or circumstance which would reasonably be expected to cause any
condition to Closing not to be satisfied or be delayed.

Indemnified Person, (ii)&nbsp;if there is a reasonable probability that a Third-Party Claim may

included in the period commencing on the day after the Closing Date (&#147;Post-Closing Tax Period&#148;).
Sellers shall be liable to Buyer for the proportionate amount of such Taxes that is attributable to
the Pre-Closing Tax Period, and Buyer shall be liable to Sellers for the proportionate amount of
such Taxes that is attributable to the Post-Closing Tax Period. Buyer and Sellers each covenant to
timely file such Tax Returns as either may be required to file with respect to such Taxes, and
within a reasonable period, Sellers and Buyer shall present a statement to the other setting forth
the amount of reimbursement to which each is entitled under this Section&nbsp;11.1, together with such
supporting evidence as is reasonably necessary to calculate the proration amount. The proration
amount shall be paid by the party owing it to the other party within ten (10)&nbsp;days after delivery
of such statement. Any payment required under this Section&nbsp;11.1 and not made within ten (10)&nbsp;days
after delivery of the statement shall bear interest at the rate per annum determined, from time to
time, under the provisions of Section&nbsp;6621(a)(2) of the Code for each day until paid.

provide Buyer with a statement containing an allocation (the &#147;Purchase Price Allocation&#148;) of the
total consideration paid by Buyer to Sellers in exchange for the Purchased Assets (including all

applicable comparable provisions of state, local and foreign tax law. The Purchase Price
Allocation shall be subject to the approval of Buyer, not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed,

specific Purchased Asset, if any, giving rise to the adjustment. If any such adjustment does not
relate to a specific Purchased Asset, such adjustment shall be allocated among the Purchased Assets

proceeding or otherwise, except that Buyer&#146;s cost for the Purchased Assets may differ from the
amount so allocated to the extent necessary to reflect Buyer&#146;s capitalized acquisition costs other
than the amount realized by Sellers. In the event that the Purchase Price Allocation is disputed
by any taxing authority, the party receiving notice of the dispute shall promptly notify the other
parties hereto of such dispute and the parties hereto shall cooperate in good faith in responding
to such dispute in order to preserve the effectiveness of the Purchase Price Allocation.

court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall,
as to that jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity, illegality or
unenforceability, without affecting in any way the remaining provisions hereof in such jurisdiction

shall be, after the Closing, so held to be invalid, void or unenforceable by a court of competent

or unenforceable provision and, if such court shall fail to decline to do so, the parties shall
negotiate in good faith in an effort to agree upon such a suitable and equitable provision. If for
any reason any term or provision containing a restriction set forth herein is held to cover an area

broad or to any extent invalid, such term or provision shall not be determined to be null, void and
of no effect, but to the extent the same is or would be valid or enforceable under applicable Law,
any court of competent jurisdiction shall construe and interpret or reform this Agreement to
provide for a restriction having the maximum enforceable area, time period and other provisions
(not greater than those contained herein) as shall be valid and enforceable under applicable Law.
