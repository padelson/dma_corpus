The Closing Balance Sheet shall be accompanied by a report of BDO Seidman, LLP, independent public accountants, stating that the Closing Balance Sheet was determined in accordance with this Section 2.6(a). Buyer shall use its best efforts to cause such report to be delivered within ninety (90) days after the Closing Date. Each party shall provide the other party and its Representatives with reasonable access to books and records and relevant personnel during the preparation of the Closing Balance Sheet and the resolution of any disputes that may arise under this Section 2.6. 

   

 (b) If Sellers disagree with the determination of the Closing Net Assets as shown on the Closing Balance Sheet, Sellers shall notify Buyer in writing of such disagreement within thirty (30) Business Days after delivery of the report of BDO Seidman, LLP referenced in Section 2.6(a), which notice shall describe the nature of any such disagreement in reasonable detail, identify the specific items involved and the dollar amount of each such disagreement. After the end of such 30-Business Day period, Sellers may not introduce additional disagreements with respect to any item in the Closing Balance Sheet or increase the amount of any disagreement, and any item not so identified shall be deemed to be agreed to by Sellers and   ##### 

  

  

  

will be final and binding upon the parties. Similarly, a disagreement by
Sellers does not provide any right to Buyer to introduce any changes to net
assets not directly related to the disputed item. During the 30-Business Day
period of its review, Sellers and their Representatives shall have
reasonable access to any documents, schedules or workpapers used in the
preparation of the Closing Balance Sheet. 

   

 (c) Buyer and Sellers agree to negotiate in good faith to resolve any such disagreement. If Buyer and Sellers are unable to resolve all disagreements properly identified by Sellers pursuant to Section 2.6(b) within sixty (60) days after delivery to Buyer of written notice of such disagreement, then such disagreements shall be submitted for final and binding resolution to KPMG, and if KPMG should decline such engagement, such other internationally recognized accounting firm as Buyer and Sellers shall mutually agree (the "Accounting Arbitrator"). The Accounting Arbitrator so selected will only consider those items and amounts set forth in the Closing Balance Sheet as to which Buyer and Sellers have disagreed within the time periods and on the terms specified above and must resolve the matter in accordance with the terms and provisions of the Agreement. The Accounting Arbitrator shall be instructed to deliver to Buyer and Sellers, as promptly as practicable and in any event within one hundred and twenty (120) days after its appointment, a written report setting forth the resolution of any such disagreement determined in accordance with the terms of the Agreement. The Accounting Arbitrator shall make its determination based solely on presentations and supporting material provided by the parties and not pursuant to any independent review. The determination of the Accounting Arbitrator shall be final and binding upon Buyer and Sellers. The fees, expenses and costs of the Accounting Arbitrator shall be borne one-half by Buyer and one-half by Sellers. 

   

 (d) The Closing Balance Sheet shall be deemed final for the purposes of this Section 2.6 upon the earliest of (i) the failure of Sellers to notify Buyer of a dispute within thirty (30) Business Days of Buyers delivery of the Closing Balance Sheet to Sellers, (ii) the resolution of all disputes, pursuant to Section 2.6(c), by Buyer and Sellers, or (iii) the resolution of all disputes, pursuant to Section 2.6(c), by the Accounting Arbitrator. 

   

 (e) If the Closing Net Assets as finally determined on the Closing Balance Sheet in accordance with this Section 2.6 are less than the Target Amount, the Purchase Price shall be decreased by the amount of such deficit, and if the Closing Net Assets are greater than the Target Amount, the Purchase Price shall be increased by the amount of such excess. 

   

 (f) If any adjustment under this Section 2.6 results in a reduction in the Purchase Price, Sellers shall pay to Buyer the amount of such reduction, and if any adjustment results in an increase in the Purchase Price, Buyer shall pay to Sellers the amount of such increase, in each case, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by the party receiving payment within five (5) Business Days after the final determination of the amount of such reduction or increase in Purchase Price, plus interest on the amount of such reduction or increase from the Closing Date to the final determination date at the prime rate of Bank of America, N.A., as in effect from time to time, and from the final determination date until the date of such payment thereof at the rate of ten percent (10%) per annum.

If, in any judicial proceeding, the court shall refuse to enforce covenants contained in Sections 6.11(a) and (b) hereof because they are more extensive (whether as to geographic area, scope of business or otherwise) than necessary to protect the business and goodwill of Buyer, it is expressly understood and agreed between the parties hereto that for purposes of such proceeding the geographic area, scope of business or other aspect shall be deemed reduced to the extent necessary to permit enforcement of such covenants. 

   

 (e) Sellers acknowledge that a breach of Sections 6.11(a) and (b) hereof would cause irreparable damage to Buyer, and in the event of Sellers or any of their respective Affiliates actual or threatened breach of the provisions of Sections 6.11(a) and (b) hereof, Buyer shall be entitled to a temporary restraining order and an injunction restraining Sellers and their respective Affiliates from breaching such covenants without the necessity of posting bond or proving irreparable harm, such being conclusively admitted by Sellers.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if Buyer, through settlement, enforcement of a judgment or otherwise, receives payments that are attributable to damages suffered by Sellers prior to the Closing by reason of infringement, misappropriation or other violation of any Intellectual Property by a third Person, Buyer shall pay over to Sellers seventy-five percent (75%) of the amount of such payment promptly after receipt. If any Seller requests in a writing delivered to Buyer after the Closing that Buyer bring a legal action against a third Person on account of any infringement, misappropriation or other violation of Intellectual Property prior to Closing, and if Buyer does not commence a legal action against such third Person on account of such infringement, misappropriation or other violation within ninety (90) days after such Seller delivers such written request, or if Buyer commences such legal action within such 90-day period, but thereafter does not continue the prosecution of legal action (other than by reason of a settlement), such Seller shall have the exclusive right to commence or continue such legal action, in its own name or in the name of Buyer, and to recover solely for its own account any and all damages suffered by such Seller or any other Seller prior to the Closing by reason of any such infringement, misappropriation or other violation. Buyer agrees to cooperate with such Seller in the event such Seller brings any such legal action, including authorizing such Seller to bring such action in the name of Buyer. 

  

 7.4 _Further Assurances_. From time to time including following the Closing Date, without further consideration, Buyer will, at its own expense, execute and deliver such documents as Sellers may reasonably request in order to effectively consummate the Transactions and to perfect the assumption by Buyer of the Assumed Liabilities.

ARTICLE VIII 

   

 _MUTUAL COVENANTS_   

  

 Each Seller and Buyer covenant and agree as follows: 

  

 8.1 _Antitrust Law Filings; Permits; Novations and Consents_. 

  

 (a) Sellers and Buyer will as promptly as practicable make any required filing pursuant to the antitrust laws of any Governmental Authority which may be applicable (the applicable antitrust laws of any Governmental Authority being referred to herein as the "Antitrust Laws"). Sellers and Buyer shall furnish to the other such necessary information and reasonable assistance as the other may request in connection with its preparation of any filing or submission which is necessary under the Antitrust Laws. Sellers and Buyer shall keep each other apprised of the status of any communications with, and inquiries or requests for additional information under the Antitrust Laws, and shall comply promptly with any such inquiry or request. Sellers and Buyer will use all reasonable efforts to obtain any clearance required under the Antitrust Laws for the Transactions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Governmental Authority conditions the grant of any consent or approval which is necessary to lawfully consummate the Transactions under any Antitrust Laws on (i) Buyer agreeing to divest itself of any portion of the Business, or (ii) Buyer agreeing, at its option, to divest itself of any other assets or businesses of Buyer, then in either such case Buyer shall consent to such condition in order to obtain such required consent or approval. The parties agree that all filing fees required for compliance with the Antitrust Laws will be borne one-half by Sellers and one-half by Buyer. 

   

 (b) As promptly as practicable after the date hereof, Buyer and Sellers shall make all other filings with Governmental Authorities, and use all reasonable efforts to obtain all permits, approvals, authorizations and consents of all third parties, required to consummate the Transactions. Buyer and Sellers shall furnish promptly to each other all information that is not otherwise available to the other party and that such party may reasonably request in connection with any such filing. Buyer and Sellers shall use reasonable efforts to obtain such consents to the assignment of the Contracts as may be required; __provided__ , __however__ , that Sellers shall not be required to commence any litigation or offer or grant any accommodation (financial or otherwise) to any third party in order to obtain any such consent. 

   

 (c) In the event that any and all novations, transfer or other agreements, consents, approvals or waivers necessary for the assignments, transfer or novation of any Contract listed on Schedule 4.1(c), or any claim, right or benefit arising thereunder or resulting therefrom, shall not have been obtained prior to the Closing Date, then as of the Closing, this Agreement, to the extent permitted by law, shall constitute full and equitable assignment by Sellers to Buyer of all of Sellers right, title and interest in and to, and all of Sellers obligations and liabilities under, such Contracts, and Buyer shall be deemed Sellers agent for purpose of completing, fulfilling and discharging all of Sellers liabilities under any such Contract, but only if and to the extent Buyer obtains the benefits of the Sellers under such Contracts. The parties shall take all necessary steps and actions to provide Buyer with the benefits of such Contracts, and to relieve Sellers of the performance and other obligations thereunder, including entry into   ##### 

  

  

  

subcontracts for the performance thereof; __provided__ , __however__ , that
Buyer shall have no obligation to perform under any such Contract pursuant to
this Section 8.1(c) if Buyer would incur any obligation, duty, liability or
cost which is in excess of or more burdensome than the obligations, duties,
liabilities or costs that would have been incurred by Sellers if Sellers were
to continue to perform its obligations thereunder, unless Sellers reimburse
Buyer for such excess. 

   

 (d) In the event Sellers shall be unable to make the equitable assignment described in Section 8.1(c), or if such attempted assignment would give rise to any right of termination, or would otherwise adversely affect the rights of Sellers or Buyer under such Contract, or would not assign all Sellers rights thereunder at the Closing, Sellers and Buyer shall continue to cooperate and use all reasonable efforts to provide Buyer with all such rights. To the extent that any such consents and waivers are not obtained, or until the impediments to such assignment are resolved, Sellers shall use all reasonable efforts (without the expenditure, in the aggregate, of any material sum) to (i) provide to Buyer, at the request of Buyer, the benefits of any such Contract to the extent related to the Business, (ii) cooperate in any lawful arrangement designed to provide such benefits to Buyer; (iii) enforce, at the request of and for the account of Buyer, any rights of Sellers arising from any such Contract against any third Person (including any Governmental Authority), including the right to elect to terminate in accordance with the terms thereof upon the advice of Buyer; and (iv) in the case of the Minority Shares, to vote such shares as instructed by Buyer. To the extent that Buyer is provided the benefits of any Contract referred to in this Section 8.1(d) (whether from Seller or otherwise), Buyer shall perform, to the extent permitted by applicable Law and each of the parties to such Contract, at the direction of Sellers and for the benefit of any third Person (including any Governmental Authority) the obligations of Sellers thereunder or in connection therewith, and Buyer agrees to pay, perform and discharge, and indemnify Sellers pursuant to Section 10.2(f) against and hold Sellers harmless from, all obligations and liabilities of Sellers relating to such performance or failure to perform (the "Equitable Assignment Obligations"). 

   

 8.2 _Reasonable Efforts_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including the limitations set forth in Section 8.1), each party will use all reasonable efforts to cause the Closing to occur. Each of Sellers and Buyer will promptly notify the other promptly after learning of the occurrence of any event or circumstance which would reasonably be expected to cause any condition to Closing not to be satisfied or be delayed. 

  

 8.3 _Publicity_. Sellers and Buyer agree that, from the date hereof through the Closing Date, no public release or announcement concerning the Transactions shall be issued without the prior consent of each party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), except as such release or announcement may be required by any Law or the rules of any stock exchange on which such partys securities (or its Affiliates securities) are listed, in which case the party required to make the release or announcement shall allow the other party reasonable time to comment on such release or announcement in advance of such issuance. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Sellers shall provide Buyer access to, and facilitate meetings with, the employees of the Business for the purposes of making announcements concerning, and preparing for the consummation of, the Transactions. 

   ##### 

  

  

 8.4 _VAT and GST_. Sellers and Buyer agree to cooperate in minimizing any value added and/or goods and services tax that may be due at the time of Closing, including, but not limited to, cooperation in securing any available VAT and GST exemptions; _provided_ , _however_ , that Sellers shall not be obligated to make any expenditures in order to comply with this Section 8.4. 

  

 8.5 _Cooperation After Closing_. Buyer and Sellers shall cooperate with each other and shall cause their respective Representatives to cooperate with each other after the Closing to ensure the orderly transition of the Business to Buyer and to minimize any disruption to the respective businesses of Sellers or the Business that might result from the Transactions. Neither party shall be required by this Section 8.5 to take any action that would unreasonably interfere with the conduct of its business. 

  

 8.6 _Records_. On the Closing Date, Sellers shall deliver or cause to be delivered to Buyer all Records and all other materials that would be Records if located at a Business Property which are material to and used primarily in the Business (to the extent not then in the possession of the Business), except any Records relating to Excluded Liabilities (including, without limitation, to Sellers Tax liability or to any litigation or claim not assumed by Buyer hereunder). After the Closing, upon reasonable written notice and at Buyers sole expense, Sellers agree to furnish or cause to be furnished to Buyer and its Representatives (including its auditors), access at reasonable times and during normal business hours to such information relating to the Business in such Sellers possession as is reasonably necessary for financial reporting, accounting and tax matters, and will permit Buyer or such Representatives to make abstracts from, or copies of, any of such information, or to obtain temporary possession of any thereof as may be reasonably required by Buyer at Buyers sole cost and expense; __provided__ _,_ _ _however__ , that such access does not unreasonably disrupt the normal operations of such Seller. For a period of seven (7) years following the Closing, Sellers will retain all of such information relating to the Business. 

  

 8.7 _Access to Former Business Records and Employees_. For a period of the later of (a) ten (10) years following the Closing and (b) the final non-appealable judgment or settlement of the later of (i) the Sable Lawsuit, (ii) the Dominion Lawsuit, (iii) any lawsuit involving any Seller relating to the Business or (iv) any lawsuits related to the Purchased Assets, Buyer will retain all Records. During such period, upon reasonable written notice and at Sellers sole expense Buyer will afford authorized Representatives of Ameron (including its auditors) access to such Records in Buyers possession at reasonable times and during normal business hours at the principal business office of the Business, or at such other location or locations at which such Records may be stored or maintained from time to time, and will permit such Representatives to make abstracts from, or copies of, any of such Records, or to obtain temporary possession of any thereof as may be reasonably required by Sellers at such Sellers sole cost and expense; __provided__ _,_   _ _however__ , that such access does not unreasonably disrupt the normal operations of Buyer. During such period, Buyer will, at Sellers expense (limited, however, to Buyers reasonable out-of-pocket expenditures without regard to any employee cost or other overhead expenses), cooperate with Seller in furnishing information, evidence, testimony, and other reasonable assistance, including, without limitation, making its employees reasonably available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any material 

   ##### 

  

    

provided hereunder, in connection with any action, proceeding, Tax audit, or
investigation to which such Seller or any of its Affiliates is subject
relating to the business of the Business prior to the Closing.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, while the existence of an adversarial
proceeding between the parties will not abrogate or suspend the provisions
of this Section 8.7, as to Records or information directly pertinent to such
dispute, the parties may not utilize this Section 8.7 but rather, absent
agreement, must utilize the available rules of discovery. 

  

 8.8 _Use of Trademark and Trade Names_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Buyer may continue to use the trademarks and trade names of Sellers, including the name "Ameron," only to the extent provided for in the Trademark License Agreement and the Domain Name Agreement. 

  

ARTICLE IX 

   

 _EMPLOYEE BENEFIT MATTERS_   

  

 9.1 _Offer of Employment_. At the Closing Date Buyer shall offer employment to each Business Employee listed on Schedule 1.1(b), as updated in accordance with Section 6.10(b). All such Business Employees who become employed by Buyer on or following the Closing Date are referred to herein as "Transferred Employees." Sellers agree to provide to Buyer, in a complete, diligent and timely manner, all relevant information as Buyer may reasonably request with respect to compensation, service, and other information relating to the employment of the Transferred Employees. 

  

 9.2 _Participation in Seller Plans_. Except as provided herein, as of the Closing Date, Transferred Employees and their beneficiaries and dependents shall cease to participate in all Seller Plans. Except as provided herein, Buyer shall not assume sponsorship, maintenance or administration of any Seller Plan or receive or assume any assets or liabilities in connection with any such plan. 

  

 9.3 _Salary, Benefits and Participation in Buyer Plans_. Following the Closing Date, each Transferred Employee who is not a member of a collective bargaining unit or is not covered by a collective bargaining agreement will be provided with the same salary or hourly wage rate as in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date, and with employee benefits which are comparable in the aggregate to those provided to similarly situated employees of Buyer, __provided__ _,_   _ _however__ , that any such Transferred Employee residing in the United Kingdom or Australia shall be provided with employee benefits which (a) are comparable in the aggregate to either (i) those provided to similarly situated employees of Buyer or (ii) those employee benefits that such Transferred Employee enjoys immediately prior to the Closing with Ameron, and (b) fully comply with the applicable Law in such respective country. Following the Closing Date, each Transferred Employee who is a member of a collective bargaining unit or is covered by a collective bargaining agreement will, at the minimum, be provided with the same salary or hourly wage rate as in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date, and with employee benefits which are comparable in the aggregate to those provided to similarly situated employees of Buyer,  _ _provided__ _,_ _ _however__ , that any such Transferred Employee residing in the United Kingdom or Australia shall be provided with employee benefits which (a) are comparable in the aggregate 

   ##### 

  

    

to either (i) those provided to similarly situated employees of Buyer or (ii)
those employee benefits that such Transferred Employee enjoys immediately
prior to the Closing with Ameron, and (b) fully comply with the applicable
Law in such respective country. In connection therewith, Buyer and its
Affiliates and successors shall provide credit under Buyers plans
to Transferred Employees for their service with Sellers and their
predecessors and Affiliates for all purposes other than benefit accrual under
Buyers pension plans; provided that Buyer shall not be obligated to provide
credit for severance benefits which would result in the Transferred
Employees receiving severance benefits that are greater than those severance
benefits that would have otherwise been provided under the existing terms of
Sellers severance plans as of the Closing. For purposes of such Buyer plans,
Buyer shall recognize all amounts applied to deductibles, co-payments and out
of pocket maximums with respect to Transferred Employees under the Seller
Plans during the plan year in which the Closing Date occurs, and will not
impose any limitations on coverage for pre-existing conditions. Subject to
compliance with applicable Law, Seller will provide the Buyer with amounts
for each participant as soon as reasonably available after Closing, and, will
provide monthly updates for three months after the Closing. 

  

 9.4 _Assumption of Union Agreements_. Effective as of the Closing Date, Buyer shall assume the collective bargaining agreements disclosed on Schedule 9.4. Promptly after the date hereof, Sellers shall advise each union which is a party to such collective bargaining agreements of such proposed assumption. 

  

 9.5 _Disposition of Ameron 401(k) Retirement and Savings Plan_. All U.S. Transferred Employees with account balances under the Ameron 401(k) Retirement and Savings Plan (the "Ameron Plan") shall be entitled to either (i) an immediate distribution of their account balances in accordance with the terms of such plan, or (ii) maintain such amounts in the Ameron Plan in accordance with its terms. Buyer shall cause one or more defined contribution plans established or designated by Buyer (each, a "Buyer Savings Plan") each of which is designed and intended to qualify under Code Section 401(a) to accept a direct or indirect rollover of all or any portion of a distribution (within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code including, in the case of a direct rollover, any promissory note included in such distribution), provided the Employees total vested account balance is transferred to the Buyers Plan. Buyer shall provide to Sellers a copy of the most recent determination letter issued by the Internal Revenue Service with respect to each Buyer Savings Plan. 

  

 9.6 _Welfare Plans_. 

  

 (a) Sellers shall be responsible in accordance with their applicable Employee Benefit Plans in effect prior to the Closing Date for all welfare benefit claims for expenses incurred prior to the Closing Date by Business Employees, Former Business Employees and their dependents. Reimbursement of said employees and their dependents for welfare benefit expenses associated with such claims (including claims submitted on behalf of disabled employees and their dependents) shall be determined in accordance with the terms of Sellers Employee Benefit Plans and Employee Benefit Arrangements as in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date. Sellers shall terminate coverage of Transferred Employees and their dependents effective for claims for expenses incurred on and after the Closing Date. Effective as of the Closing Date, Buyer shall be responsible in accordance with its applicable welfare plans in   ##### 

  

  

  

effect on and after the Closing Date for all medical and similar claims for
expenses incurred on and after the Closing Date by Transferred Employees
and their dependents. Buyer shall take all steps necessary such that each of
the applicable employee benefit plans of Buyer that provide for medical and
similar benefits constitutes "another group health plan" for purposes of
Treas. Reg. § 54.4980B-7 QandA 2. For purposes of this Agreement, a claim for
medical and similar benefits will be deemed to have been incurred on the date
on which the related medical service or material was rendered to or received
by the individual claiming such benefit. 

   

 (b) Effective as of the Closing Date, Buyer shall be responsible for any long-term and short term disability income benefits payable in respect of claims asserted on or after the Closing Date for Transferred Employees who become disabled on or after the Closing Date under Buyers applicable Employee Benefit Plans. Sellers shall be responsible for all long-term and short-term disability income benefits payable in respect of claims asserted by Transferred Employees who become disabled before the Closing Date, including continuation of any Seller welfare and pension benefits, and any other applicable benefits made available to actively employed employees of Sellers employed after the Closing Date. 

   

 (c) Effective as of the Closing Date, Buyer shall be responsible for any life insurance claims of Transferred Employees and their dependents for losses incurred by such employees or dependents on and after the Closing Date under any group life, travel and accident, and accidental death and dismemberment insurance policies under Buyers applicable Employee Benefit Plans. Sellers shall be solely responsible for claims for such losses incurred prior to the Closing Date. For purposes of this Agreement, a claim will be deemed to have been incurred upon the occurrence of the event giving rise to such claim. 

   

 (d) Effective as of the Closing Date, Buyer shall have established a cafeteria plan (or designate an existing plan) subject to Code Section 125 with features which are comparable to those contained in Sellers cafeteria plan applicable to Transferred Employees immediately prior to the Closing Date. Effective as of the Closing Date, Buyer shall, pursuant to such Buyer cafeteria plan, assume responsibility for administering all benefit or reimbursement claims of Transferred Employees in respect to calendar year 2006, whether arising before, on or after the Closing Date, under the cafeteria plan applicable to such individuals at such time. Seller shall cause to be transferred to Buyer an amount in cash equal to the sum of all contributions to the various reimbursement accounts under Sellers cafeteria plan prior to the Closing Date, reduced by the sum of all claims paid with respect to such accounts prior to the Closing Date (regardless of whether the amount paid to any participant exceeded such participants reimbursement account balance), and by any amount accrued as a liability in respect of such plan on the Closing Balance Sheet. In the event that the sum of all claims paid with respect to the various reimbursement accounts under Sellers cafeteria plan prior to the Closing Date, plus any amount accrued as a liability in respect of such plan on the Closing Balance Sheet exceeds the sum of all contributions to such accounts prior to the Closing Date, Buyer shall cause to be transferred to Seller an amount in cash equal to the amount of such excess. 

   

 (e) Effective on and after the Closing Date, Sellers shall maintain one or more group health plans through which Sellers will provide continued group health coverage to the extent required by Section 4980B of the Code and Sections 601 through 608 of ERISA and the 

    ##### 

  

 

regulations thereunder with respect to individuals who lost coverage under
the Sellers group health plans prior to the Closing Date or who, other than
Business Employees, as a result of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, lose coverage under the Sellers group health plans on the
Closing Date. Such coverage shall be provided in such manner and for such
time as may be necessary for Buyer to avoid liability for such coverage of
such individuals under Section 4980B of the Code, including
Treasury Regulation Section 54.4980B-9 and Sections 601 through 608 of
ERISA. 

   

 9.7 _Severance_. It is the understanding of Buyer and Sellers that the Transactions shall not constitute a severance or termination of employment for purposes of the Sellers severance policy. 

  

 9.8 _Vacation and Sick Pay_. Buyer shall assume responsibility for accrued vacation and sick pay attributable to Transferred Employees as of the Closing Date, to the extent such amounts should be accrued as a liability on the Closing Balance Sheet pursuant to the Accounting Principles. 

  

 9.9 _Foreign Plans_. Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, Buyer shall to the maximum extent permitted by the law of the applicable jurisdiction not assume any liabilities under a Seller Plan maintained for any Business Employees in foreign jurisdictions. 

  

 9.10 _Consultation, Notice and Approval Requirements_. 

  

 (a) Buyer and Sellers shall consult with Transferred Employees and unions to comply with all consultation, notice and approval requirements applicable in the jurisdiction of each Seller, including, but not limited to, the Employment Relations Act 2000 in New Zealand, the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 2006 in the United Kingdom, and works council matters in The Netherlands. 

   

 (b) The Agreement has been signed under the condition that the following conditions shall have been fulfilled on, or prior to, the Closing Date: all advice requests, notices and consultations which have to be made, filed or held by virtue of any laws and public regulations (including but not limited to the Works Council Statute, the so-called Merger Code of the Social Economic Council and any binding union contract) will have been made, filed and held and no constraints by virtue thereof exist at the Closing Date. The parties explicitly establish that nothing in this Agreement in any way affects the freedom of decision which they have to maintain under the said laws and regulations prior to the completion of these requests, notices and consultations. 

   

 (c) Buyer further agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to enter into a mutually agreeable collective employment agreement with the union representing the Transferred Employees in New Zealand.

ARTICLE X 

   

 _INDEMNIFICATION_   

  

 10.1 _Indemnification by Seller_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Article X, Sellers, jointly and severally, shall indemnify and defend Buyer and each of its Affiliates, officers, directors, employees and agents against, and hold them harmless from, any Loss suffered or incurred by any such Indemnified Person to the extent arising from (a) if the Closing occurs, any breach of any representation or warranty of Sellers contained in this Agreement or any of the other Transaction Documents which survives the Closing or in any certificate, instrument or other document delivered pursuant hereto or thereto, (b) any nonperformance or breach of any covenant of Sellers contained in this Agreement or any of the other Transaction Documents, (c) if the Closing occurs, the existence of, or the failure of Sellers to pay, perform and discharge when due, any of the Excluded Liabilities (including, without limitation, any Losses as a result of the failure of Sellers to comply with any Bulk Sales Laws referred to in Section 7.2) or (d) if the Closing occurs, those product liability claims relating to a product that was sold by any of the Sellers to any third party prior to the Closing Date ("Product Liability Claim") which individually results in actual Losses (the amount of such Losses for each such Product Liability Claim, the "Shared Cost Product Liability Amount") (excluding, for the purposes of this Section 10.1(d), any Losses related to out-of-pocket expenses, reasonable attorneys, experts and accountants fees and other disbursements and costs of investigation or defense) in excess of Two Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($2,500,000) (the "Shared Cost Product Liability Threshold Amount"); __provided__ _,_   _ _however__ , that (i) Sellers shall have no liability under Section 10.1(a) unless the aggregate of all Losses relating thereto for which Seller would, but for this proviso, be liable exceeds Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000) (and then from the first dollar such liability), (ii) Sellers aggregate liability under Section 10.1(a) shall in no event exceed Twelve Million Dollars ($12,000,000) and (iii) Sellers shall only be liable under Section 10.1(d) for, and shall make payments to Buyer with respect to (A) half of the first Eight Million Dollars ($8,000,000) of any individual Shared Cost Product Liability Amount and (B) all amounts in excess of the first Eight Million Dollars ($8,000,000) of any individual Shared Cost Product Liability Amount, which such amounts for the purposes of this clause (iii) shall include out-of-pocket expenses, reasonable attorneys, experts and accountants fees and other disbursements and costs of investigation or defense. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Sellers shall not be liable for any Taxes related to the Acquired Properties as a result of the breach of any representation or warranty contained in Section 4.5 to the extent that such Taxes are for any period after the Closing Date. 

  

 10.2 _Indemnification by Buyer_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Article X, Buyer shall indemnify and defend Sellers and each of its Affiliates, officers, directors, employees and agents against, and hold them harmless from, any Loss suffered or incurred by any such Indemnified Person to the extent arising from (a) if the Closing occurs, any breach of any representation or warranty of Buyer contained in this Agreement which survives the Closing or in any certificate, instrument or other document delivered pursuant hereto, (b) any nonperformance or breach of any covenant of Buyer contained in this Agreement or any of the 

   ##### 

  

    

other Transaction Documents requiring performance after the Closing Date, (c)
if the Closing occurs, the existence of, or the failure of Buyer to pay,
perform and discharge when due, any of the Assumed Liabilities, (d) if the
Closing occurs, any claim for severance or similar benefits made or brought by
any Transferred Employees, (e) if the Closing occurs, ownership and operation

_however__ , that Buyer shall have no liability under Section 10.2(a) unless
the aggregate of all Losses relating thereto for which Buyer would, but for
this proviso, be liable exceeds on a cumulative basis Five Hundred Thousand
Dollars ($500,000) (and then from the first dollar such liability). 

  

 10.3 _Losses Net of Insurance and Tax Benefit, Etc._  

  

 (a) The amount of any Loss for which indemnification is provided under this Article X shall be net of (i) any amounts actually recovered by the Indemnified Person or its Affiliates (or, solely with respect to Section 10.1(d) hereof, the Indemnifying Person) under insurance policies with respect to such Loss and of any related reserve in respect thereof reflected on the final Closing Balance Sheet and (ii) any Tax benefit available to the Indemnified Person or its Affiliates arising in connection with the accrual, incurrence or payment of any such Loss (including, without limitation, the net present value of any Tax benefit arising in subsequent taxable years). Similarly, if the Indemnified Person incurs any tax obligation as a consequence of an indemnification payment, the payment will be grossed up so that the Indemnified Person receives as part of the indemnification amount, a sufficient amount to avoid the tax consequence. 

   

 (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary elsewhere in this Agreement, no Indemnifying Person shall, in any event, be liable to the other party for any consequential damages, including, but not limited to, loss of revenue or income, cost of capital, diminution in value, or loss of business reputation or opportunity relating to the breach or alleged breach of this Agreement. Each party agrees that it will not seek punitive damages as to any matter under, relating to or arising out of the Transactions. 

   

 (c) Except as expressly set forth in Section 12.5 as to equitable remedies, the parties hereto agree that the indemnification provisions of this Article X are intended to provide the exclusive remedy as to all Losses the parties may incur arising from or relating to the Transactions, and each party hereby waives any other rights or remedies, and releases any claims, to the extent they may do so, that may arise under any applicable statute, rule or regulation. 

   

 10.4 _Termination of Indemnification_. The obligations to indemnify and hold harmless a party hereto, pursuant to Sections 10.1(a) and 10.2(a), shall terminate when the applicable representation or warranty terminates pursuant to Section 10.6; __provided__ _,_ _ _however__ , that such obligations to indemnify and hold harmless shall not terminate with respect to any item as to which the person to be indemnified shall have, before the expiration of the applicable period, previously made a claim by delivering a notice (stating in reasonable detail the basis of such claim) to the Indemnifying Person. 

   ##### 

  

  

 10.5 _Procedures Relating to Indemnification_. 

  

 (a) In order for an Indemnified Person to be entitled to any indemnification provided for under this Agreement in respect of, arising out of or involving a claim or demand, including without limitation a Product Liability Claim, made by any Person against the Indemnified Person (a "Third-Party Claim"), such Indemnified Person must notify the Indemnifying Person in writing, and in reasonable detail, of the Third-Party Claim within ten (10) Business Days after receipt by such Indemnified Person of written notice of the Third-Party Claim; __provided__ _,_ _ _however__ , that failure to give such notification shall not affect the indemnification provided hereunder except to the extent the Indemnifying Person shall have been actually prejudiced as a result of such failure (except that the Indemnifying Person shall not be liable for any Losses incurred during the period in which the Indemnified Person failed to give such notice). Thereafter, the Indemnified Person shall deliver to the Indemnifying Person, within five (5) Business Days after the Indemnified Persons receipt thereof, copies of all notices and documents (including court papers) received by the Indemnified Person relating to the Third-Party Claim. 

   

 (b) Subject to Section 10.5(c) which governs Product Liability Claims, if a Third-Party Claim is made against an Indemnified Person, the Indemnifying Person will be entitled to participate in the defense thereof and, if it so chooses, to assume the defense thereof with counsel selected by the Indemnifying Person and reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person. Should the Indemnifying Person so elect to assume the defense of a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Person will not be liable to the Indemnified Person for legal fees and expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Person in connection with the defense thereof. If the Indemnifying Person assumes such defense, the Indemnified Person shall have the right to participate in the defense thereof and to employ counsel, at its own expense, separate from the counsel employed by the Indemnifying Person, it being understood that the Indemnifying Person shall control such defense. The Indemnifying Person shall be liable for the fees and expenses of counsel employed by the Indemnified Person for any period during which the Indemnifying Person has not assumed the defense thereof (other than during any period in which the Indemnified Person shall have failed to give notice of the Third-Party Claim as provided above). If the Indemnifying Person chooses to defend or prosecute any Third-Party Claim, all the parties hereto shall cooperate in the defense or prosecution thereof. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the Indemnifying Persons request) the provision to the Indemnifying Person of records and information which are reasonably relevant to such Third-Party Claim, and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 10.5(b), in the event a Third-Party Claim is made against an Indemnified Person as to which such Indemnified Person is entitled to seek indemnification hereunder and (i) such Indemnified Person reasonably concludes that the Indemnifying Person lacks the financial and personnel resources to vigorously defend such Indemnified Person, or that the Indemnifying Person is not diligently defending such Indemnified Person, (ii) if there is a reasonable probability that a Third-Party Claim may materially and adversely affect an Indemnified Person other than as a result of money damages or money payments or (iii) the Indemnified Party determines in its reasonable judgment that a conflict of interest makes 

    ##### 

  

    

separate representation by the Indemnified Partys own counsel advisable, then
in each such case the Indemnified Person may elect to retain and control the
defense of such Third-Party Claim with counsel selected by such Indemnified
Party and reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnifying Party and will be
entitled to be reimbursed by the Indemnifying Person for its Losses incurred
in such defense, such expenditures to be reimbursed promptly after submission
of invoices therefor. Whether or not the Indemnifying Person shall have
assumed the defense of a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnified Person shall not
admit any Liability with respect to, or settle, compromise or discharge, such
Third-Party Claim without the Indemnifying Persons prior written consent
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). No Indemnifying
Party shall settle or compromise any Third-Party Claim in which any relief
other than the payment of money damages is sought against the Indemnified
Party unless the Indemnified Party consents in writing to such settlement or
compromise. 

   

 (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to a Product Liability Claim seeking damages in excess of Eleven Million Dollars ($11,000,000), Sellers shall have the right to assume the defense thereof, and with respect to a Product Liability Claim seeking less than Eleven Million Dollars ($11,000,000) in damages, Buyer shall have the right to assume the defense thereof. The party not assuming the defense of a Product Liability Claim pursuant to this Section 10.5(c) (the "Non-Assuming Party") shall have the right to participate in the defense thereof and to employ counsel, at its own expense, separate from the counsel employed by the party assuming the defense pursuant to this Section 10.5(c) (the "Assuming Party"), it being understood that the Assuming Party shall control such defense. The Assuming Party shall be liable for the fees and expenses of counsel employed by the Non-Assuming Party for any period during which the Assuming Party has not assumed the defense thereof (other than during any period in which the Non-Assuming Party shall have failed to give notice of the Third-Party Claim as provided in Section 10.5(a)). All the parties hereto shall cooperate in the defense or prosecution of any Product Liability Claim. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the Assuming Partys request) the provision to the Assuming Party of records and information which are reasonably relevant to such Product Liability Claim, and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide testimony, additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder. In the event Sellers assume the defense of a Product Liability Claim in accordance with this Section 10.5(c) and the actual Losses ultimately incurred with respect to such Product Liability Claim do not equal or exceed the Shared Cost Product Liability Threshold Amount, then Sellers shall be entitled to be reimbursed by Buyer for their out-of-pocket expenses, reasonable attorneys, experts and accountants fees and other disbursements and costs of investigation or defense thereof, such expenditures to be reimbursed promptly after submission of invoices therefore. Neither Seller nor Buyer shall admit any Liability with respect to, or settle, compromise or discharge, such Product Liability Claim without the prior written consent of such other party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). 

   

 10.6 _Survival of Representations and Agreements_. The representations and warranties made by Sellers in Sections 4.5 _(Taxes)_ , 4.6 (as to the first sentence only) _(Title)_ , 4.17 _(Effect of Transfer)_ and 4.25 ( _Brokers_ ) of this Agreement and the representation and warranty made by Buyer in Section 5.3 ( _Brokers_ ) of this Agreement shall survive the Closing until the expiration of 

   ##### 

  

    

the statute of limitations period applicable to claims that may be asserted
against Buyer or the Purchased Assets or, in the case of Section 5.3, against
any Seller, in respect of the matters covered thereby; the representations
and warranties made by Sellers in Section 4.12 _(Environmental)_  and Section
4.14 _(Compliance With Law; Permits)_ shall survive the Closing for a period
of five (5) years from the Closing Date; all other representations and
warranties made by Sellers or Buyer shall survive the Closing for a period of
two (2) years from the Closing Date, in each case regardless of any
investigation that may have been made or may be made at any time by or on
behalf of Buyer or Sellers. The covenant and agreement of Sellers to
indemnify Buyer for Product Liability Claims pursuant to Section 10.1(d)
hereof shall only survive the Closing for a period of the earlier of (i)
three (3) years from the date on which any equipment or other item coated
with Product that was sold by Sellers prior to the Closing Date is put into
service or (ii) four (4) years from the Closing Date. The other covenants and
agreements of each party contained in this Agreement (including this Article
X) and in each of the Ancillary Agreements shall survive for the periods
specified therein, and if not specified, indefinitely. 

  

ARTICLE XI 

   

 _TAX MATTERS_   

  

 11.1 _Liability and Indemnification for Certain Taxes_. All Taxes and similar ad valorem and similar Tax obligations levied with respect to the Purchased Assets for a taxable period that includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date applicable to the Purchased Assets shall be apportioned between Sellers and Buyer as of the Closing Date based on the number of days of such taxable period included in the period through and including the Closing Date ("Pre-Closing Tax Period") and the number of days of such taxable period included in the period commencing on the day after the Closing Date ("Post-Closing Tax Period"). Sellers shall be liable to Buyer for the proportionate amount of such Taxes that is attributable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period, and Buyer shall be liable to Sellers for the proportionate amount of such Taxes that is attributable to the Post-Closing Tax Period. Buyer and Sellers each covenant to timely file such Tax Returns as either may be required to file with respect to such Taxes, and within a reasonable period, Sellers and Buyer shall present a statement to the other setting forth the amount of reimbursement to which each is entitled under this Section 11.1, together with such supporting evidence as is reasonably necessary to calculate the proration amount. The proration amount shall be paid by the party owing it to the other party within ten (10) days after delivery of such statement. Any payment required under this Section 11.1 and not made within ten (10) days after delivery of the statement shall bear interest at the rate per annum determined, from time to time, under the provisions of Section 6621(a)(2) of the Code for each day until paid. 

  

 11.2 _Purchase Price Allocation_. 

  

 (a) As soon as practicable after the date hereof and prior to the Closing Date, Sellers shall provide Buyer with a statement containing an allocation (the "Purchase Price Allocation") of the total consideration paid by Buyer to Sellers in exchange for the Purchased Assets (including all consideration attributable to the portion of the Assumed Liabilities which are treated as Purchase Price for tax purposes) to the Purchased Assets in accordance with the applicable provisions of Section 1060 of the Code and the U.S. Treasury regulations   ##### 

  

  

  

promulgated thereunder and any applicable comparable provisions of state,
local and foreign tax law. The Purchase Price Allocation shall be subject to
the approval of Buyer, not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed, and the
parties shall negotiate in good faith any dispute regarding the Purchase Price
Allocation. The Purchase Price Allocation made pursuant to this Section
11.2(a) shall be binding on Buyer and Sellers for all Tax reporting purposes.
To the extent required, each party agrees to timely file an IRS Form 8594
reflecting the Purchase Price Allocation for the taxable year that includes
the Closing Date and to make any timely filing required by applicable
foreign, state or local laws. 

   

 (b) Any indemnification payment treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price or any payment under Section 2.6 of this Agreement shall be reflected as an adjustment to the price allocated to a specific Purchased Asset, if any, giving rise to the adjustment. If any such adjustment does not relate to a specific Purchased Asset, such adjustment shall be allocated among the Purchased Assets in accordance with the Purchase Price Allocation method provided in Section 11.2(a). 

   

 (c) Each party hereto shall adopt and utilize the Purchase Price Allocation for purposes of all Tax Returns filed by them and shall not voluntarily take any position inconsistent with the foregoing in connection with any examination of any Tax Return, any refund claim, any litigation proceeding or otherwise, except that Buyers cost for the Purchased Assets may differ from the amount so allocated to the extent necessary to reflect Buyers capitalized acquisition costs other than the amount realized by Sellers. In the event that the Purchase Price Allocation is disputed by any taxing authority, the party receiving notice of the dispute shall promptly notify the other parties hereto of such dispute and the parties hereto shall cooperate in good faith in responding to such dispute in order to preserve the effectiveness of the Purchase Price Allocation. 

   

 11.3 _Transfer Taxes_. Buyer and Sellers shall cooperate in preparing, executing and filing use, sales, real estate, transfer and similar Tax returns relating to the purchase and sale of the Purchased Assets and shall further cooperate in minimizing any such transfer Taxes. Buyer shall bear seventy percent (70%) of such transfer Taxes, including any penalties, interest and additives to tax, incurred in connection with the purchase and sale of the Purchased Assets, and Sellers shall bear thirty percent (30%) of such transfer Taxes, including any penalties, interest and additives to tax, incurred in connection with the purchase and sale of the Purchased Assets;  _ _provided__ , __however__ , Sellers Liability under this Section 11.3 shall not exceed One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000). Buyer shall reimburse each Seller for any transfer Taxes paid by such Seller beyond Sellers obligation within five (5) days of such Sellers written request.

Nothing in this Section 12.3 shall be deemed to release either party from any liability for any breach by such party of the terms and provisions of this Agreement or to impair the right of either party to compel specific performance by the other party of its obligations under this Agreement. 

   

 (d) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Sellers pursuant to Section 12.3(a)(ii)(A) or by either party pursuant to Section 12.3(a)(iv), Buyer shall promptly (i) pay to Sellers a termination fee in the amount equal to Seven Million, Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($7,500,000) (the "Termination Fee") concurrently with the termination of this Agreement and (ii) reimburse Sellers for all reasonable costs, fees and expenses incurred by or on behalf of Sellers in connection with this Agreement, the Transactions and the consummation of all other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including fees payable to legal counsel, brokers, finders, financial and other service providers) (the "Expense Reimbursement") upon submission of one or more statements therefore, accompanied by reasonable supporting documentation.

 12.5 _Equitable Relief_. The parties hereto agree that in the event of either partys breach of its obligations to consummate the Transactions, damages may prove insufficient and the non-breaching party should be entitled to the remedy of specific performance.

 12.8 _Interpretation; Exhibits and Schedules_. The headings contained in this Agreement, in any Exhibit or Schedule hereto and in the table of contents to this Agreement, are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Information set forth in each Schedule specifically refers to the article and section of this Agreement to which such information is responsive, and such information shall not be deemed to have been disclosed with respect to any statement in any article and section that is not qualified by reference to the pertinent Schedule with respect to any other article or section of this Agreement or for any other purpose. The Schedules shall not vary, change or alter the language of the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement. All Exhibits and Schedules annexed hereto or referred to herein are hereby incorporated in and made a part of this Agreement as if set forth in full herein.

 12.10 _Severability_. Any provision of this Agreement which, after the Closing, is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability, without affecting in any way the remaining provisions hereof in such jurisdiction or rendering that or any other provisions of this Agreement invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any other jurisdiction; __provided__ , that if any provision hereof or the application thereof shall be, after the Closing, so held to be invalid, void or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, then such court may substitute therefor a suitable and equitable provision in order to carry out, so far as may be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of the invalid, void or unenforceable provision and, if such court shall fail to decline to do so, the parties shall negotiate in good faith in an effort to agree upon such a suitable and equitable provision. If for any reason any term or provision containing a restriction set forth herein is held to cover an area or to be for a length of time which is unreasonable, or in any other way is construed to be too broad or to any extent invalid, such term or provision shall not be determined to be null, void and of no effect, but to the extent the same is or would be valid or enforceable under applicable Law, any court of competent jurisdiction shall construe and interpret or reform this Agreement to provide for a restriction having the maximum enforceable area, time period and other provisions (not greater than those contained herein) as shall be valid and enforceable under applicable Law. 

  

 12.11 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of Delaware applicable to agreements made and to be performed entirely within such State, without regard to the conflicts of law principles of such State.

   ##### 

  

    

consultant representing or purporting to represent Sellers, to whomever made
or given, directly or indirectly, orally or in writing, unless specifically
set forth in this Agreement or in the Access Agreement. Sellers

contained in the disclaimers and waivers set forth herein, none of such
disclaimers or waivers shall in any way affect, diminish, waive or otherwise
impair Buyers rights and remedies under the Access Agreement.

 EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE PROVIDED IN THIS AGREEMENT AND THE ACCESS AGREEMENT, BUYER HEREBY RELEASES SELLERS (AND SELLERS RESPECTIVE AFFILIATES, SUBSIDIARIES, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, SHAREHOLDERS, EMPLOYEES AND AGENTS) FROM ANY AND ALL CLAIMS, LOSSES, LIABILITIES, COSTS OR DAMAGES THAT BUYER MAY SUFFER ARISING FROM ANY HAZARDOUS MATERIALS IDENTIFIED OR DISCOVERED ON, IN, OR UNDER THE ACQUIRED PROPERTY AFTER THE CLOSING DATE. 

  

 AS PART OF THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION 12.12, BUT NOT AS A LIMITATION THEREON, BUYER HEREBY AGREES, REPRESENTS AND WARRANTS THAT, EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE PROVIDED IN THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ACCESS AGREEMENT, THE MATTERS RELEASED HEREIN ARE NOT LIMITED TO MATTERS WHICH ARE KNOWN OR DISCLOSED, AND BUYER HEREBY WAIVES WITH RESPECT TO THE MATTERS RELEASED HEREIN ANY AND ALL RIGHTS AND BENEFITS WHICH IT NOW HAS, OR IN THE FUTURE MAY HAVE CONFERRED UPON IT, BY VIRTUE OF THE PROVISIONS OF FEDERAL, STATE OR LOCAL LAW, RULES OF REGULATIONS, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, SECTION 1542 OF THE CIVIL CODE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA, WHICH PROVIDES AS FOLLOWS: 

   

A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW
OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH
IF KNOWN BY HIM MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS SETTLEMENT WITH THE
DEBTOR. 

  

 12.13 _Waiver of Compliance; Consents_. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, any failure of the parties to comply with any obligation, covenant, agreement or condition herein may be waived by the party entitled to the benefits thereof only by a written instrument signed by the party granting such waiver, but such waiver or failure to insist upon strict compliance with such obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure. Whenever this Agreement requires or permits consent by or on behalf of a party, such consent shall be given in writing in a manner consistent with the requirements for a waiver of compliance as set forth in this Section 12.13.

This Agreement, including the exhibits hereto and the documents, schedules, certificates and instruments referred to herein, and the Confidentiality Agreement embodies the entire agreement and understanding of the parties hereto in respect of the Transactions.
