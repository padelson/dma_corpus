would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect.
Each Seller is duly qualified or licensed to do business as a foreign entity
and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the
business conducted by it makes such qualification or licensing necessary,
except where the failure to be so duly qualified, licensed and in good

company power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to
carry on its business as it is now being conducted, except where the failure

The Purchaser is duly qualified or licensed to do business as a foreign
entity and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the
business conducted by it makes such qualification or licensing necessary,

Purchaser of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby have been duly
authorized by all requisite Delaware limited liability company action of the
Purchaser. This Agreement and each such Ancillary Document have been duly and
validly executed and delivered by the Purchaser and (assuming this Agreement
and each such Ancillary Document constitute a valid and binding obligation of
the Sellers) constitute a valid and binding obligation of the Purchaser
enforceable against the Purchaser in accordance with their terms, subject to
the Bankruptcy and Equity Exceptions.

 

Section 4.3 _Consents and Approvals_. No consent, approval or authorization
of, or declaration, filing or registration with, any Governmental Entity is
required to be made or obtained by the Purchaser or its Affiliates in
connection with the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and
the Ancillary Documents and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby, except (a) for consents, approvals,
authorizations, declarations, filings or registrations which, if not made or
obtained, would not, individually or in the aggregate, materially impair or
materially delay the Purchasers ability to perform its obligations under
this Agreement or (b) those described in _Section 3.4_ of this Agreement.

 

Section 4.4 _No Violations_. Assuming that the consents, approvals,
authorizations, declarations, filings and registrations referred to in
_Sections 3.4_ and _4.3_ have been made or obtained and remain in full force
and effect and the conditions set forth in _Section 6.1_ have been satisfied,
neither the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement or the

assets are bound, (c) result in the creation or imposition of any Encumbrance
other than Permitted Encumbrances on any properties or assets of the
Purchaser or (d) violate any Order or Law applicable to the Purchaser or its
properties or assets, except in the case of clauses (b), (c) and (d), for

Section 4.5 _Brokers_. No Person is entitled to any brokerage, financial
advisory, finders or similar fee or commission in connection with the

with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the " _Financing_ ").
The Commitment Letter is in full force and effect and is a legal, valid and
binding obligation of the Purchaser and, to the knowledge of the Purchaser,
the Sponsors, subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exceptions. All commitment
fees required to be paid thereunder have been paid in full or, if not yet due,
will be duly paid in full when due, and no event has occurred which, with or
without notice or lapse of time or both, would result in any breach or
violation of or constitute a default or give rise to any right of termination
thereunder. The aggregate proceeds of the Financing will be sufficient to
enable the Purchaser to pay in cash all amounts required to be paid by it at
the Closing in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the Purchase Price and all payments, fees and expenses
of the Purchaser related to or arising out of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. Assuming the accuracy of the Sellers representations and
warranties contained in this Agreement, compliance by the Sellers with
their covenants and agreements hereunder, the satisfaction of any conditions
to the Closing for the benefit of the Purchaser set forth in _Sections 6.1_,
_6.2_ and _6.3_ and the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in
the Commitment Letter related to any of the foregoing, the Purchaser is not
aware of any fact, occurrence or condition that makes any of the assumptions
or statements set forth in the Commitment Letter inaccurate or that would
reasonably be expected to cause the Financing to be terminated or rendered
ineffective or any of the conditions contained therein not to be met.

Agreement and the Ancillary Documents (including the payment of the Purchase
Price, and the payment of all related fees and expenses), (i) the Purchaser
will not have incurred debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as they

at a fair valuation will exceed its debts (including the probable amount of
all contingent liabilities) and (iv) the Purchaser will not have unreasonably
small capital to carry on its business as proposed to be conducted following
the Closing Date. No transfer of property is being made and no obligation is
being incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, in
either case, with the intent to hinder, delay or defraud either present or
future creditors of the Purchaser.

"affiliates" or "associates" has been an "interested stockholder" of the
Parent at any time within three (3) years of the Effective Date, as those

consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise, the sale or disposition of
or the agreement to limitations with respect to, such of its assets
or businesses, or of the assets or businesses to be acquired by it pursuant
to this Agreement, as may be required in order to avoid the entry of, or to
effect the dissolution of, any Order that would otherwise have the effect of
materially impairing or materially delaying the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In addition, the parties hereto
agree to take promptly any and all steps necessary to defend any proceedings
challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and to attempt to vacate or lift any Order relating to

in respect of the Acquisition).

 

(c) Each of the Sellers and the Purchaser shall give prompt notice to the
other of the occurrence or failure to occur of an event that would, or with
or without notice or lapse of time or both would, cause any condition to the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby for the benefit of the
other party hereto not to be satisfied.

 

Section 5.4 _Additional Matters_. Subject to the terms and conditions herein
provided, each of the parties hereto agrees to use all reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all action and to do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws to
consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
as promptly as practicable; provided, that the obligations of the parties
hereto to obtain any consent, approval or waiver from the Bankruptcy Court
shall be governed exclusively by _Section 5.7_.

 

Section 5.5 _Further Assurances_. In addition to the provisions of this
Agreement, from time to time after the Closing Date, the Sellers and the
Purchaser shall use reasonable best efforts to execute and deliver such other
instruments of conveyance, transfer or assumption, as the case may be, and
take such other action as may be reasonably requested to implement
more effectively the conveyance and transfer of the Acquired Assets to the
Purchaser and the assumption of the Assumed Liabilities by the Purchaser;
provided, that nothing in this _Section 5.5_ shall (a) require the Sellers or
any of their Affiliates to make any expenditure or incur any obligation on
their own or on behalf of the Purchaser (unless funds in the full amount
thereof are advanced to the Sellers in cash) or (b) prohibit or delay the
Sellers or any of their Affiliates from ceasing operations or winding up its
affairs following the Closing.

in the Acquired Assets.

 



20 Section 5.7 _Bankruptcy Court Approval_.

 

(a) The Sellers and the Purchaser acknowledge that this Agreement and the sale
of the Acquired Assets are subject to Bankruptcy Court approval. The Sellers
and the Purchaser acknowledge that (i) to obtain such approval, the Sellers
must demonstrate that they have taken reasonable steps to obtain the highest
or otherwise best offer possible for the Acquired Assets, including giving
notice of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to creditors and
certain other interested parties as ordered by the Bankruptcy Court, and, if
necessary, conducting an auction in respect of the Acquired Assets (the "
_Auction_ "), and (ii) the Purchaser must provide adequate assurance of future
performance under the Assigned Contracts included in the Acquired Assets.

 

(b) Intentionally omitted.

 

(c) The Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain entry of
the Sale Order.

 

(d) In the event an appeal is taken or a stay pending appeal is requested,
from the Sale Order, the Sellers shall promptly notify the Purchaser of such
appeal or stay request and shall promptly provide to the Purchaser a copy of
the related notice of appeal or order of stay. The Sellers shall also provide
the Purchaser with written notice of any motion or application filed
in connection with any appeal from either of such orders.

(e) From and after the Effective Date, the Sellers shall not take any action
that is intended to result in, or fail to take any action the intent of which
failure to act would result in, the reversal, voiding, modification or staying
of the Sale Order.

 

(f) If an Auction is conducted and the Purchaser is not the Successful Bidder
at the conclusion of such Auction, the Purchaser shall be required to serve
as the back-up bidder if the Purchaser is the next highest or otherwise next
best bidder at the Auction (such party that is the next highest or otherwise
best bidder at the Auction, the " _Back-Up Bidder_ ") and, if the Purchaser
is the Back-Up Bidder, the Purchaser shall be required to keep their bid to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement on the terms and
conditions set forth in this Agreement (as the same may be improved upon by
the Purchaser in the Auction) open and irrevocable until the earliest to
occur of (i) 5:00 p.m. (prevailing Eastern Time) on the date that is sixty
(60) days after the date of entry of a sale order with respect to the
Business, which date will be extended for an additional sixty (60) days if
the only condition to closing the transaction with the Successful Bidder that
remains outstanding on the sixtieth (60th) day after entry of such sale order
is satisfaction of regulatory approvals required under the acquisition
agreement between the Sellers and the Successful Bidder, (ii) the closing of
the transaction with the Successful Bidder and (iii) the date on which this
Agreement is terminated in accordance with  _Section 7.1_. The Purchaser
agrees that if the Purchaser is the Back-Up Bidder, any order approving a sale
of some or all of the Acquired Assets to the Successful Bidder shall, subject
to approval by the Bankruptcy Court, provide that if the Successful Bidder
fails to consummate the sale transaction, the Purchaser shall be deemed to
have the new prevailing bid, and the Sellers shall be authorized, without
further order of the Bankruptcy Court, to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement on the terms and conditions set
forth in this

 



21  Agreement (as the same may be improved upon by the Purchaser in the Auction)
with the Purchaser.

 

(g) The Purchaser agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
approval of this Agreement and the sale of the Acquired Assets by the
Bankruptcy Court, including by providing adequate assurance of future
performance under the Assigned Contracts included in the Acquired Assets;
provided, that the Purchaser shall not be required pursuant to this _Section
5.7(g)_ to pay any fee, cost or expense or incur any other liability to a
counterparty to an Assigned Contract in order to provide such adequate
assurance of future performance.

 

Section 5.8 _Bankruptcy Filings_. From and after the Effective Date, the
Sellers shall use reasonable efforts to provide such prior notice as may be
reasonable under the circumstances before filing any papers in the Chapter 11
Cases that relate, in whole or in part, to this Agreement or to the Purchaser.
The Sellers inadvertent failure to comply with this  _Section 5.8_ shall
not constitute a breach under this Agreement.

Section 5.9 _Intentionally omitted_.

 

Section 5.10 _Bidding Procedures; Superior Offers_. The bidding procedures to
be employed with respect to this Agreement shall be those reflected in the
Bidding Procedures Order. Subject to _Section 5.20_, the Purchaser agrees and

may continue soliciting inquiries, proposals or offers for the Business and
the Acquired Assets in connection with alternative transactions pursuant to
the terms of the Bidding Procedures Order and agree and acknowledge that the

be supplemented by other customary procedures not inconsistent with the
matters otherwise set forth herein and the terms of this Agreement.

 

Section 5.11 _Communications with Customers and Suppliers_. Prior to the
Closing, the Purchaser shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates and
representatives not to, contact, or engage in any discussions or otherwise
communicate with, the Sellers customers, suppliers, licensors, licensees and
other Persons with which the Sellers have material commercial
dealings without obtaining the prior consent of the Sellers (other than any
such communication in the ordinary course of business of the Purchaser and its
Affiliates without reference to or any purpose relating to the Business, the
Acquired Assets, the Assumed Liabilities or the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement).

Section 5.12 _Post-Closing Books and Records_. For a period of seven (7)
years after the Closing Date (or such longer period as may be required by any
Governmental Entity, applicable Order or Law or any ongoing Action):

 

(a) the Purchaser shall not dispose of or destroy any of the business records
and files relating to the Business transferred to it hereunder; and

(b) the Purchaser shall allow the Sellers and any of their directors,
officers, employees, financial advisors, legal counsel, accountants,
consultants and other authorized representatives access to all business
records and files of the Sellers or the Business that are transferred to the
Purchaser hereunder, which are reasonably required by the Sellers for purposes
related to the Chapter 11 Cases, the wind-down of the operations of the
Sellers, the

 



22  functions of any trusts or other successors to the Sellers, Tax matters and
other reasonable business purposes, during regular business hours and upon
reasonable prior notice, and the Sellers shall have the right to make copies
of any such records and files.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, during such period, the Purchaser may dispose
of any such business records or files of the Business which are offered to,
but not accepted by, the Sellers within ninety (90) days of receipt of such
offer.

 

Section 5.13 _Parent Confidentiality Agreements; Post-Closing
Confidentiality_.

 

(a) As of the Closing, the Purchasers obligations under the Confidentiality
Agreement related to (i) non-use, non-disclosure and return or destruction of
Evaluation Material (as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement) to the
extent related to the Business, the Acquired Assets and the Assumed
Liabilities shall terminate and (ii) non-solicitation of employees of
the Sellers shall terminate. All other provisions of the Confidentiality
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with their
terms.

 

(b) Effective at the Closing, the Parent hereby assigns to the Purchaser the
rights under the Parent Confidentiality Agreements to enforce the non-use,
non-disclosure and return or destruction of Evaluation Material (as such term
is defined in the Parent Confidentiality Agreements) to the extent related to
the Business, the Acquired Assets and the Assumed Liabilities; provided,
that the Parent retains all other rights and remedies thereunder. The Parent
expressly disclaims any representation or warranty as to the enforceability of
any of such assigned provisions.

 

(c) For a period of five (5) years following the Closing Date, the Sellers
shall not, and shall cause their Affiliates and their respective directors
and officers not to, disclose to any Person other than the directors,
officers, employees and authorized representatives of the Purchaser and its
Affiliates, or use or otherwise exploit for their benefit, any
Confidential Information, except (i) pursuant to any Order, as required in
any Action or as otherwise required by applicable Law, (ii) to enforce its
rights and remedies under this Agreement or (iii) disclosure of Confidential
Information in connection with the Chapter 11 Cases shall not constitute a
breach of this _Section 5.13(c)_. " _Confidential Information_ " shall mean
any proprietary or confidential information to the extent related to the
Business, the Acquired Assets or the Assumed Liabilities, excluding any
information that (x) is (as of the Closing Date) or becomes generally
available to the public other than as a result of a breach of this _Section
5.13(c)_ or (y) becomes available to the Sellers, their Affiliates or their
respective directors and officers after the Closing Date on a non-confidential
basis from a source other than the Purchaser or its Affiliates, provided that
such source is not, to the knowledge of the Sellers, bound by a
confidentiality agreement with or other contractual, legal or fiduciary
obligation of confidentiality to the Purchaser or its Affiliates or any other
party with respect to such information.

 

Section 5.14 _Payments Received_. The Sellers and the Purchaser each agree
that after the Closing they will hold and will promptly transfer and deliver
to the other, from time to time as and when received by them or their
respective Subsidiaries, any cash, checks with appropriate endorsements (using
their best efforts not to convert such checks into cash) or other 

 



23  property that they may receive on or after the Closing which properly
belongs to the other party hereto or its Subsidiaries and will account to the
other for all such receipts.

 

Section 5.15 _Use of Names and Marks_. The Purchaser acknowledges and agrees
that, notwithstanding the transfer of Intellectual Property included in the
Acquired Assets, (a) the Sellers will continue using their current corporate
names during the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases and any additional time
during which the Sellers wind down their affairs, and (b) the Sellers shall
be entitled to refer to names and marks included in the Acquired Assets in
filings with Governmental Entities, for factual or historical reference and
for any other purposes that do not constitute trademark infringement and are
not otherwise prohibited by applicable Law.

Section 5.16 _Excess Sales_. In the event that (a) net sales, determined as
of immediately prior to the Closing in a manner consistent with the Sellers
past practices, recognized with respect to sales of Krystexxa during the
period from August 1, 2013 through and including the Closing Date exceeds (b)
the product of (i) the number of days elapsed during the period from August
1, 2013 through and including the Closing Date and (ii) $115,000.00 (the
amount of any such excess, the " _Excess Sales Amount_ "), the Purchaser
may reduce the Purchase Price by the Excess Sales Amount.

Section 5.17 _Marketing Authorization_. Notwithstanding any other provision
of this Agreement, the parties hereto shall use their respective commercially
reasonable efforts, and cooperate with each other, to effect the transfer by
Savient Pharma Ireland Limited (as the holder of the centralized
marketing authorization) (or any liquidator appointed with respect to Savient
Pharma Ireland Limited), of the marketing authorization already granted by the
European Commission with respect to the drug product Krystexxa to the
Purchaser or its designee at or following the Closing, for $10,000, to be
paid concurrently with such transfer by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to an account or accounts designated by Savient Pharma Ireland Limited
(or any liquidator appointed with respect to Savient Pharma Ireland Limited),
pursuant to a sale document that includes an agreement of the transferor to
execute and deliver such other instruments of conveyance, transfer or
assumption, as the case may be, and take such other action as may
be reasonably requested to implement more effectively the conveyance and
transfer of the marketing authorization to the transferee; provided that (a)
the inability or failure to effect such transfer as of the Closing shall in no
event delay the Closing or be deemed to result or contribute to the failure
of any condition to Closing; (b) nothing in this _Section 5.17_ shall
prohibit or delay the Sellers or any of their Affiliates from ceasing
operations or winding up its affairs following the Closing or implementing
any of the matters set forth at item 1 of _Section 5.1_ of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule. In furtherance of the foregoing sentence, the parties
hereto shall cooperate with each other in communicating with the European
Medicines Agency with the goal of preventing suspension or termination of the
marketing authorization already granted by the European Commission with
respect to the drug product Krystexxa; provided that neither Seller nor any
of its Affiliates shall be required to pay any fee, cost or expense or incur
any other liability in connection with such cooperation (unless any such fee,
cost or expense is paid directly or advanced by the Purchaser).

 



24 Section 5.18 _Financing_.

 

(a) The Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the
Financing on the terms and conditions set forth in the Commitment Letter (or
terms, including with respect to the conditionality thereof, not materially
less favorable to the Purchaser than the terms and conditions in the
Commitment Letter), including by (i) maintaining in effect the Commitment
Letter, (ii) ensuring the accuracy of all representations and warranties of
the Purchaser set forth in the Commitment Letter, (iii) complying with all
covenants and agreements of the Purchaser set forth in the Commitment
Letter, (iv) satisfying on a timely basis all conditions applicable to the
Purchaser set forth in the Commitment Letter that are within its control and
(v) consummating the Financing at or prior to the Closing. In the event that
the conditions to the Purchasers obligations under this Agreement have been
satisfied or waived (or will be satisfied as of the Closing), the Purchaser
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Sponsors to fund on the
Closing Date the Financing required to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise enforce its rights under the
Commitment Letter.

(b) The Purchaser shall keep the Sellers reasonably informed concerning
material developments relating to the Financing and shall give the Sellers
prompt notice of any material adverse change with respect to the Financing.
Without limiting the foregoing, the Purchaser agrees to notify the Sellers
promptly, and in any event within one (1) Business Day, if at any time prior
to the Closing Date (i) the Commitment Letter expires or is terminated for any
reason (or if any person attempts or purports in writing to terminate the
Commitment Letter, whether or not such attempted or purported termination is
valid), (ii) a Sponsor refuses to provide or expresses an intent to refuse to
provide all or any portion of the Financing contemplated by the Commitment
Letter on the terms set forth therein or (iii) the Purchaser no longer
believes in good faith that it will be able to obtain all or any portion of
the Financing on substantially the terms described in the Commitment Letter.
Without the prior written consent of the Sellers, the Purchaser shall not, nor
shall it permit any of its Affiliates to, enter into any merger, acquisition,
joint venture, disposition or debt or equity financing that would reasonably
be expected to impair, delay or prevent consummation of all or any portion of
the Financing. Without the prior written consent of the Sellers, the Purchaser
shall not amend or alter, or agree to amend or alter, the Commitment Letter
in any manner that would reasonably be expected to impair, delay or prevent
the Closing or make the funding of the Financing less likely to occur. If all
or any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and
conditions contemplated in the Commitment Letter, the Purchaser shall use its
reasonable best efforts to arrange to promptly obtain such Financing from
alternative sources on terms, including with respect to the conditionality
thereof, not materially less favorable to the Purchaser than the terms and
conditions in the Commitment Letter and in an amount sufficient, when added to
the portion of the Financing that is otherwise available, to pay in cash all
amounts required to be paid by it in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the Purchase Price and all payments,
fees and expenses of the Purchaser related to or arising out of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(c) The Sellers shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to provide the
Purchaser with such cooperation in connection with the arrangement of the
Financing or any debt financing sought by the Purchaser in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby as may be reasonably requested by the
Purchaser, provided that (i) such 

 



25  requested cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the operations of
the Sellers or the administration of the Chapter 11 Cases and (ii) neither
Seller nor any of its Affiliates shall be required to pay any fee, cost or
expense or incur any other liability in connection with the Financing or any
such debt financing (unless any such fee, cost or expense is paid directly or
advanced by the Purchaser). All non-public or otherwise confidential
information regarding the Sellers or the Business obtained pursuant to this
_Section 5.18(c)_ shall be kept confidential in accordance with the
Confidentiality Agreement.

 

Section 5.19 _Assistance with Transition of the Business_. Subject to
applicable Law, from and after the Closing through and including January 31,
2014, the Sellers covenant and agree to provide to the Purchaser and its
officers, employees, legal counsel, accountants, consultants and other
authorized representatives, such reasonable support services in
connection with the transfer of the Acquired Assets and the Assumed
Liabilities and the transition of the Business related thereto to the
Purchaser, including associated transition of knowledge and information,
access to historical financial information, data bases and information
technology systems and assistance with communications to regulatory
authorities; provided, that nothing in this Section 5.19 shall require the
Sellers or any of their Affiliates to make any expenditure or incur
any obligation on their own or on behalf of the Purchaser, other than the
Sellers cost of retaining the employees identified on _Schedule 5.19_ ,
unless funds in the full amount thereof are advanced to the Sellers in cash.
The Purchaser understands that the only employees of the Sellers whom the
Sellers are endeavoring to retain following the Closing Date are the employees
identified on _Schedule 5.19_ (which employees have been provided with an
incentive arrangement with the goal of retaining them until January 31,
2014).

Section 5.20 _Exclusivity_. If an Auction is conducted and the Purchaser is
the Successful Bidder at the conclusion of such Auction, then from and after
the conclusion of such Auction, unless otherwise required pursuant to the
Sellers fiduciary duties, none of the Sellers shall, and Sellers shall cause
each of their respective Affiliates, representatives, officers, employees,
directors and agents not to, directly or indirectly, (i) submit, solicit,
initiate, encourage or discuss any proposal or offer from any Person (other
than the Purchaser and its Affiliates in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby) or enter into any agreement or accept any offer relating
to or consummate any purchase or sale of any assets of the Business (other
than the purchase and sale of inventory in the ordinary course of business)
or any similar transaction or business combination involving the Business or
its assets (each of the foregoing transactions, a " _Business Transaction_ ")
or (ii) furnish any information with respect to, assist or participate in or
facilitate in any other manner any effort or attempt by any Person (other than
the Purchaser and its Affiliates) to do or seek to do any of the foregoing,
except in each case to the extent necessary to seek approval of the Back-Up
Bidder as the Back-Up Bidder. The Sellers agree to notify the Purchaser
immediately if any Person makes any proposal, offer, inquiry or contact with
respect to a Business Transaction.

Acquired Asset (all such periods of time being hereinafter called " _Proration
Periods_ "). The Periodic Taxes described in this _Section 8.1(c)_ shall be
apportioned between the Sellers and the Purchaser as of the Closing Date,
with the Purchaser liable for that portion of the Periodic Taxes equal to the
Periodic Tax for the Proration Period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator
of which is the number of days remaining in the applicable Proration Period
on and after the Closing Date, and the denominator of which is the total
number of days covered by such Proration Period. The Sellers shall be liable
for that portion of the Periodic Taxes for a Proration Period for which the
Purchaser is not liable under the preceding sentence. The Purchaser and the
Sellers shall pay or be reimbursed for Periodic Taxes (including instances in
which such Periodic Taxes have been paid before the Closing Date) on this
prorated basis at Closing. To the extent the liability for Periodic Taxes for
a certain Proration Period or pre-Closing Tax period is not determinable at
the time of Closing or such Periodic Taxes are charged in arrears, such
Periodic Taxes shall be prorated for such Proration Period, or, in the case
of Periodic Taxes for a pre-Closing Tax period, the amount shall be determined
for purposes of this Agreement, based on the most recent ascertainable full
tax year without adjustment. The party hereto responsible under applicable
Law for paying a Tax described in this _Section 8.1(c)_ shall be responsible
for administering the payment of such Tax. For purposes of this _Section
8.1(c)_, the Proration Period for ad valorem Taxes and real and personal
property Taxes shall be the fiscal period for which such Taxes were assessed
by the applicable Tax jurisdiction.

(d) The Sellers, on the one hand, or the Purchaser, on the other hand, as the
case may be (the " _Reimbursing Party_ "), shall provide reimbursement for any
Tax paid by the

 



30  other (the " _Paying Party_ "), all or a portion of which is the
responsibility of the Reimbursing Party in accordance with the terms of this
_Section 8.1_ or which represents an overpayment for Taxes by the Paying
Party. Within a reasonable time prior to the payment of any such Tax, the
Paying Party shall give notice to the Reimbursing Party of the Tax payable and
the Paying Partys and Reimbursing Partys respective liability therefor,
although failure to do so will not relieve the Reimbursing Party from its
liability hereunder except to the extent the Reimbursing Party is prejudiced
thereby.

 

Section 8.2 _Bulk Sales_. The Purchaser hereby waives compliance by the
Sellers and their Affiliates with the requirements and provisions of any
"bulk-transfer" laws of any jurisdiction that may otherwise be applicable with
respect to the sale of any or all of the Acquired Assets to the Purchaser.

 

Section 8.3 _Survival of Representations, Warranties and Covenants_. No
representations or warranties in this Agreement or in any Ancillary Document
shall survive the Closing. No covenants in this Agreement or in any Ancillary
Document shall survive the Closing except to the extent the terms thereof
expressly contemplate performance following the Closing.

 

Section 8.4 _Public Announcements_. Unless otherwise required by applicable
Law or by obligations of the Sellers or the Purchaser or their respective
Affiliates pursuant to any listing agreement with or rules of any securities
exchange, the Sellers and the Purchaser shall consult with each other before
issuing any other press release or otherwise making any public statement
with respect to this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby or the
activities and operations of the other and shall not issue any such release or
make any such statement without the prior written consent of the other (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

Section 8.5 _Notices_. All notices, requests, claims, demands or
other communications hereunder shall be deemed to have been duly given and
made if in writing and (a) at the time personally delivered if served by
personal delivery upon the party hereto for whom it is intended, (b) at the
time received if delivered by registered or certified mail (postage prepaid,
return receipt requested) or by a national courier service (delivery of which

Section 8.6 _Descriptive Headings; Interpretative Provisions_. The headings
contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not
affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. The words
"hereof", "herein" and "hereunder" and words of like import used in this
Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular
provision of this Agreement. References to Articles, Sections, Exhibits and

 



32  Schedules are to Articles, Sections, Exhibits and Schedules of this
Agreement unless otherwise specified. All Exhibits and Schedules annexed
hereto or referred to herein are hereby incorporated in and made a part of
this Agreement as if set forth in full herein. Any capitalized terms used in
any Exhibit or Schedule but not otherwise defined therein, shall have the
meaning as defined in this Agreement. Any singular term in this
Agreement shall be deemed to include the plural, and any plural term the
singular. Where a word or phrase is defined herein, each of its other
grammatical forms shall have a corresponding meaning. Whenever the words
"include", "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall
be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation", whether or not
they are in fact followed by those words or words of like import. Whenever the
last day for the exercise of any right or the discharge of any duty under
this Agreement falls on other than a Business Day, the party hereto having
such right or duty shall have until the next Business Day to exercise such

Section 8.7 _No Strict Construction_. The Sellers and the Purchaser
participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement, and,
in the event an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this
Agreement shall be construed as jointly drafted by the Sellers and the
Purchaser, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
disfavoring any party hereto by virtue of the authorship of any provision of
this Agreement. Without limitation as to the foregoing, no rule of strict
construction construing ambiguities against the draftsperson shall be applied
against any person with respect to this Agreement.

 

Section 8.8 _Entire Agreement; Assignment_. This Agreement, the Ancillary
Documents and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement
and supersede all other prior agreements and understandings, both written and
oral, among the parties hereto or any of them, with respect to the subject
matter hereof and thereof. Neither this Agreement nor any of the
rights, interests or obligations under it may be directly or indirectly
assigned, delegated, sublicensed or transferred by any of the parties hereto,
in whole or in part, to any other Person by operation of law or otherwise,
without the prior written consent of the other parties, and any attempted or
purported assignment in violation of this _Section 8.8_ will be null and
void. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon,
inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns.

Section 8.9 _Governing Law; Submission of Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury
Trial_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with
the laws of the State of Delaware without regard to the rules of conflict of
laws of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction. Each of the parties
hereto irrevocably and unconditionally consents to submit to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court for any litigation arising out of or
relating to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby (and
agrees not to commence any litigation relating thereto except in the
Bankruptcy Court), and waives any objection to the laying of venue of any such
litigation in the Bankruptcy Court. Each party hereto hereby consents to
service of process in the manner and at the address set forth in _Section
8.5_. EACH PARTY HERETO IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT
MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION ARISING OUT OF OR

 



33  RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

 

Section 8.10 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein,
whether or not the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are
consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated thereby shall be paid by the party hereto
incurring such expenses.

instrument in writing signed on behalf of all the parties hereto.

Section 8.12 _Waiver_. At any time prior to the Closing, the parties hereto
may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or
other acts of the other parties hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties contained herein or in any document delivered
pursuant hereto and (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or
conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to
any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument
in writing signed on behalf of such party.

 

Section 8.13 _Counterparts; Effectiveness_. This Agreement may be executed in
two or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original but
all of which shall constitute one and the same agreement.

Section 8.14 _Severability; Validity; Parties in Interest_. If any provision
of this Agreement or the application thereof to any Person or circumstance is
held invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement, and the
application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances, shall not be
affected thereby, and to such end, the provisions of this Agreement are agreed
to be severable. Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to
confer upon any Person not a party to this Agreement any rights or remedies
of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.

Section 8.15 _Specific Performance_. Each of the parties hereto recognizes
that if the other party breaches this Agreement or refuses to perform under
the provisions of this Agreement, monetary damages alone would not be adequate
to compensate the non-breaching party for its injuries. The Sellers and the
Purchaser shall therefore be entitled, in addition to any other remedies that
may be available, to obtain specific performance of the terms of this
Agreement, without posting bond or other undertaking. If any action is brought
by the Sellers or the Purchaser to enforce this Agreement, the Purchaser or
the Sellers, as applicable, shall waive the defense that there is an adequate
remedy at Law.
