2.5a)_. If the Notice of Disagreement shall be duly delivered pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 2.5b)_, Buyer REIT and Seller Holdings shall, during the
thirty (30) days following such delivery, work in good faith to resolve any
differences that they may have with respect to the matters in the Notice of
Disagreement. If Seller Holdings does not deliver a Notice of Disagreement to
Buyer REIT within forty-five (45) days after Buyer REIT delivers the Closing
Statement, then Seller Holdings shall be deemed to have agreed with all items
and amounts contained in the Closing Statement.

 

(c) _Closing Statement Dispute Resolution_. If Buyer REIT and Seller Holdings
are unable to reach such agreement during the thirty (30) days following
Seller Holdings delivery of the Notice of Disagreement pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 2.5b)_, then such disputes shall be referred to PricewaterhouseCoopers
or another firm of independent accountants of internationally recognized
standing reasonably satisfactory to Buyer REIT and Seller Holdings (the "
_Accountant_ "). Buyer REIT and Seller Holdings shall each enter into a
customary engagement letter with the Accountant. Buyer REIT and Seller
Holdings shall furnish the Accountant with a statement setting forth the items
from the Notice of Disagreement which are still in dispute (the " _Accountant
Dispute Notice_ ") and the position, including the specific amount proposed,
of each of Buyer REIT and Seller Holdings with respect to each such disputed
item. In resolving such dispute, the Accountant shall (i) consider only those
items or amounts in the Closing Statement as to which Seller Holdings has
disagreed in the Notice of Disagreement, (ii) act as an arbitrator and not as
an expert ( _provided_ that the determination of the Accountant shall be fully
enforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement) and (iii) make a final determination based solely on
written materials submitted by Buyer REIT and Seller Holdings in accordance
with this Agreement (i.e., not on the basis of an independent review). The
Accountant shall be instructed by Buyer REIT and Seller Holdings to use its
commercially reasonable efforts to deliver to Buyer REIT and Seller Holdings,
as promptly as practicable, in any event no more than forty-five (45) days
after referral, a report setting forth its determination of the appropriate
amount of each of the line items in the Closing Statement as to which there is
disagreement as specified in the Accountant Dispute Notice, including a
description of the basis for such determination. In the absence of fraud, bad
faith or manifest error, such report shall be final and binding upon the
parties. With respect to each disputed line item, such determination, if not
in accordance with the position of either Buyer REIT or Seller Holdings,
shall not be in excess of the higher, nor less than the lower, of the amounts
advocated by Buyer REIT and Seller Holdings in the Accountant Dispute Notice
with respect to such disputed line item. For the avoidance of doubt,
the Accountant shall not review any line items or make any determination with
respect to any matter other than those matters in the Accountant Dispute
Notice that are in dispute. Buyer REIT and Seller Holdings shall, and shall
cause their respective Representatives to, cooperate and assist in such
review conducted by the Accountant, including making available books, records
and personnel. Neither the Buyers, the Sellers, the Company Entities nor any
of their respective Representatives shall engage in any ex parte
communications with the Accountant. The fees and expenses of the Accountant
shall be paid by the Sellers, on the one hand, and by the Buyers, on the other
hand, based upon the percentage that the amount actually contested but not
awarded to the Sellers or the Buyers, respectively, bears to the aggregate
amount actually contested by Buyer REIT and Seller Holdings.

applicable Law, including United States federal, state, local or foreign Tax
Law, _provided_ that if the Buyers reasonably believe that any withholding is
required with respect to a payment under this Agreement, other than the
withholding described in the immediately following sentence, then the Buyers

prior to making such payment and shall cooperate to the extent commercially
reasonable with the Sellers to reduce or eliminate any required withholding.
If the Buyers, the Companies or the Escrow Agent so withhold and pay such
withheld amounts to the applicable Governmental Authority, any amounts
withheld shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the Person in respect of whom the Buyers, the Companies or the Escrow
Agent, as applicable, made such deduction and withholding. Notwithstanding the

2.1_ and to otherwise comply with their respective obligations under this
Agreement; _provided_ , in each case that such agreements and instruments
shall serve purely to effect the legal transfer of the applicable Equity
Interests (or the Specified Australia Property) and shall not have any effect
on the terms and conditions contemplated hereby, or in any way modify, amend
or constitute a waiver of any provision of this Agreement or any Ancillary
Agreement. Each of the Buyers, on the one hand, and the Sellers, on the other
hand, shall pay 50% of the fees and costs of recording or filing applicable
conveyancing instruments as described in the immediately preceding sentence.

3.9 _Tax Treatment_ (a) . Such Seller has no knowledge of any facts,
agreements, plan or other circumstances and has not taken or agreed to take

waiver of any attorney-client privilege, the disclosure of any protected
Intellectual Property of any third party, the violation of any Law or of
their or its obligations with respect to confidentiality, or the loss of the

_further_ , that the Companies shall only be obligated to deliver such

85

    

 reasonably obtained from the books and records of the Company Entities
without undue effort or expenses and, in no event shall such information be
deemed to include, or shall the Company Entities otherwise be required to
provide, pro forma financial statements or pro forma adjustments related to
the Financing, _provided_ that, the Company Entities shall provide customary
financial information reasonably requested by Buyers necessary for any Buyer
to prepare its pro forma financial statements or pro forma adjustments;
_provided_ that no Company Entity shall be responsible in any manner to
provide information relating to (x) the proposed aggregate amount of debt
and/or equity financing (as applicable), together with assumed interest

indebtedness of the Company Entities in connection therewith and (z) any post-
Closing or pro forma assumed cost savings, synergies and similar adjustments
(and the assumptions relating thereto) (all of which adjustments and
assumptions shall be the responsibility of Buyers).

 

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement shall require any
Company Entity to (1) take or permit the taking of any action that (A) would
require the Company Entity to pass resolutions or consents to approve or
authorize the execution of the Financing or execute or deliver any
certificate, document, instrument or agreement or agree to any change
or modification of any existing certificate, document, instrument or
agreement, in each case, that is effective prior to the Closing, or that would
be effective if the Closing does not occur, (B) would cause any representation
or warranty in this Agreement to be breached, (C) would require any Company
Entity to pay any commitment or other similar fee, reimburse any third-party
expense, provide any indemnities or incur any other expense, liability or
obligation in connection with the Financing that is not, subject to the
limitations therein, subject to reimbursement or is not otherwise indemnified
by Buyers, (D) would cause any director, officer or employee or stockholder or
equity holder of any Company Entity to incur any personal liability or (E)
would reasonably be expected to result in a material violation or breach of,
or a default under, any Material Contract to which any Company Entity is a
party, the organizational documents of the Company Entity or any Law, (2)
provide access to or disclose information that any Company Entity reasonably
determines would jeopardize any attorney-client privilege of such Company
Entity, jeopardize the trade secret status of any Company Entity trade
secrets, or violate any of their or its obligations with respect to
confidentiality or (3) deliver or cause to be delivered any opinion of counsel
or negative assurance letter. Nothing contained in this _Section_ __ _ 6.6_
or otherwise shall require any Company Entity, prior to Closing, to be an
issuer, borrower, guarantor or other obligor with respect to the Financing.

 

(c) Buyers shall, promptly upon written request by the Companies, reimburse
the Companies for all out-of-pocket costs (including attorneys fees) incurred
by the Company Entities in connection with the Financing or performing their
obligations under this _Section_ __ _ 6.6_, whether or not the Transactions
are consummated or this Agreement is terminated. Buyers shall indemnify and
hold harmless the Company Entities and their equity holders, Affiliates and
Representatives from and against any and all Liabilities, losses, damages,
claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards, judgments and penalties and amounts
paid in settlement (including all interest, assessments and other charges paid
or payable in connection with or in respect of any thereof) suffered or
incurred by the Company Entities arising therefrom. All non-public or other

 



86

    

 confidential information provided by the Company Entities pursuant to this _
Section_ __ _ 6.6_ shall be kept confidential in accordance with the
Confidentiality Agreement, except that Buyers shall be permitted to disclose
such information to potential financing sources and to ratings agencies during
the syndication and marketing of any Financing, subject to customary
confidentiality undertakings by such potential financing sources. None of the
representations, warranties or covenants of the Companies set forth in this
Agreement shall be deemed to apply to, or deemed breached or violated by, any
of the actions taken by the Companies at the request of Buyers pursuant to
this _Section_ __ _ 6.6_.

(d) To the extent that this _Section_ __ _ 6.6_ requires any Company
Entitys cooperation with respect to any of the obligations of Buyers relating
to Financing, the Companies shall be deemed to have complied with this
_Section_ __ _ 6.6_ for purposes of _Article VII_  if the Companies have
provided Buyers with the assistance required under this _Section_ __ _ 6.6_
with respect to the Financing. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, the condition set forth in _Article VII_ , as it applies to
the Companies obligations under this _Section_ __ _ 6.6_, shall be deemed
satisfied unless the Financing has not been obtained primarily as a result of
the Companies material breach of its obligations under this _Section_ __ _
6.6_, which breach is a consequence of an act or failure to act by the
Companies with the actual knowledge that the taking of such act or failure to
take such act would cause such breach. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, Buyers acknowledge and agree that the obtaining of
the Financing is not a condition to the Closing.

 

(e) Buyers shall, upon the request of Sellers, keep Sellers informed on a
current basis of the status of the Financing and material developments with
respect thereto and provide Sellers promptly (and in no event later than
within one (1) Business Day) with copies of any material definitive agreements
related to the Financing.

 

6.7 _Debt Financing_.

(a) Buyers shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, use reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange, obtain and
consummate the Debt Financing or any Substitute Debt Financing on the terms
and conditions specified in the Debt Commitment Letter (and, in any event, no
later than the time at which the Closing is required to occur pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 2.3_), including using its reasonable best efforts to (i)(A)
maintain in effect the Debt Commitment Letter and comply with all of their
respective covenants and obligations thereunder, (B) negotiate and, assuming
all conditions to Closing set forth in  _Article VII_ hereof have been
satisfied, enter into and deliver definitive agreements with respect to the
Debt Financing reflecting the terms and conditions contained in the Debt
Commitment Letter, so that such agreements are in effect no later than the
time at which the Closing is required to occur pursuant to _Section_ __ _
2.3_ and (C) enforce its rights under the Debt Commitment Letter and (ii)
satisfy on a timely basis all the conditions to the Debt Financing and the
definitive agreements related thereto that are in such Buyers (or its
Affiliates) control. In the event that all conditions set forth in _Article
VII_ have been satisfied or waived or, upon funding shall be satisfied or
waived, and the Closing should otherwise occur pursuant to _Section_ __ _
2.3_, each Buyer and its Affiliates shall use their reasonable best efforts to
cause the Debt Financing Sources to fund the Debt Financing at Closing.

 



87

    

(b) Buyers shall promptly (and in no event later than one (1) Business Day)
after obtaining knowledge thereof, give Sellers written notice (i) of any
breach or default by such Buyer, its Affiliates, any Debt Financing Source or
any other party to the Debt Commitment Letter or any definitive document
related to the Debt Financing (or any event or circumstance, with or without
notice, lapse of time, or both, would give rise to any breach or default) that
would be reasonably likely to result in the failure of any Debt Financing
Source to comply with its funding obligations under the Debt Commitment
Letter or that would prevent the Debt Financing from being consummated at
Closing, (ii) of receipt of written notice of any threatened or actual
withdrawal, repudiation, expiration, intention not to fund or termination of
or relating to the Debt Commitment Letter or the Debt Financing or (iii) of
any material dispute or disagreement between or among any parties to the Debt
Commitment Letter or any definitive document related to the Debt
Financing (other than ordinary course of business negotiations) that would be
reasonably likely to result in the failure of any Debt Financing Source to
comply with its funding obligations under the Debt Commitment Letter or that
would prevent the Debt Financing from being consummated at Closing. Buyer may
amend, modify, terminate, assign or agree to any waiver under the Debt
Commitment Letter without the prior written approval of Sellers; _provided_
that no Buyer shall, without Sellers prior written consent, permit any such
amendment, modification, assignment, termination or waiver to be made to, or
consent to or agree to any waiver of, any provision of or remedy under the
Debt Commitment Letter which would (A) reduce the aggregate amount of the
Debt Financing (including by increasing the amount of fees to be paid or
original issue discount (except as set forth in any "flex" provisions existing
on the Effective Date)), (B) impose new or additional conditions to the Debt
Financing or otherwise expand, amend or modify any of the conditions to the
Debt Financing or (C) otherwise expand, amend, modify or waive any provision
of the Debt Commitment Letter or the Debt Financing in a manner that in the
case of this clause (C) would reasonably be expected to (I) delay, prevent or
make less likely the consummation of the Transactions hereunder or the funding
of the Debt Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions to the
Debt Financing) at Closing, (II) adversely impact the ability of any Buyer to
enforce its rights against the Debt Financing Sources or any other parties to
the Debt Commitment Letter or the definitive agreements with respect thereto
or (III) adversely affect the ability of any Buyer to timely consummate the
Transactions; _provided_ , _further_ , that the Debt Commitment Letter may be
amended, supplemented or otherwise modified to add additional Debt Financing
Sources who are not parties to the Debt Commitment Letter as of the date
hereof. In the event that new commitment letters and/or fee letters are
entered into in accordance with any amendment, replacement, supplement or
other modification of the Debt Commitment Letter permitted pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 6.7(b)_, such new commitment letters and/or fee letters shall
be deemed to be a part of the "Debt Financing" and deemed to be the "Debt
Commitment Letter" for all purposes of this Agreement. Buyers shall promptly
(and in any event no later than one (1) Business Day) deliver to Sellers true,
correct and complete copies of any termination, amendment, modification or
replacement of the Debt Commitment Letter. If funds in the amounts set forth
in the Debt Commitment Letter, or any portion thereof, become unavailable,
Buyers shall, and shall cause its Affiliates, as promptly as practicable
following the occurrence of such event, to (x) notify Sellers in writing
thereof, (y) use their respective reasonable best efforts to obtain substitute
debt financing sufficient to replace any Debt Financing that ceases to be
available (the " _Substitute Debt Financing_ ") on terms and conditions that
are not less favorable (taken as a whole) to Buyers than the terms and
conditions (taken as a whole) set forth in the

 



88

    

 Debt Commitment Letter and (z) use their respective reasonable best efforts
to obtain a new financing commitment letter that provides for such Substitute
Debt Financing and, promptly after execution thereof (and, in any event, no
later than one (1) Business Day), deliver to Sellers true, complete and
correct copies of the new commitment letter and the related fee letters
(redacted in a similar manner as described in  _Section_ __ _ 5.8(a)_
hereof) and related definitive financing documents with respect to such
Substitute Debt Financing. Upon obtaining any commitment for any such
Substitute Debt Financing, such financing shall be deemed to be a part of the
"Debt Financing" and any commitment letter for such Substitute Debt Financing
shall be deemed the "Debt Commitment Letter" for all purposes of this
Agreement.

 

(c) Buyers shall pay, or cause to be paid, as the same shall become due and
payable, all fees and other amounts that become due and payable under the
Debt Commitment Letter.

(d) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary,
Buyers expressly acknowledges and agrees that none of the Buyers obligations
hereunder are conditioned in any manner upon any Buyer obtaining the Debt
Financing, any Substitute Debt Financing or any other Financing or financing.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary,
including _Section_ __ _ 6.7(b)_, Buyers may terminate the Debt Commitment
Letter or amend the Debt Commitment Letter to modify the size of the Facility
(as such term is defined in the Debt Commitment Letter) if Buyers (i)
determine reasonably and in good faith that Buyers otherwise have sufficient
funds to consummate the Transactions without the use of all or part of the
Debt Financing and (ii) Buyers deposit an amount equal to the full amount
necessary to fund the payments required to be made by Buyers under _Article
II_  at the Closing (or an amount which, when combined with the Facility,
shall constitute the such full amount) into a restricted, secured or escrowed
account. If Buyers decide to terminate or amend the Debt Commitment Letter,
Buyers shall deliver prior written notice of such termination or amendment to
Sellers, accompanied with evidence of the funding into a restricted, secured
or escrowed account as contemplated by the foregoing sentence. Upon the
Sellers reasonable satisfaction that sufficient funds have been deposited
into such restricted, secured or escrowed account, Buyers may deliver notice
of termination or amendment of the Debt Commitment Letter to the Debt
Financing Sources.

 

6.8 _Tax Matters_. The following provisions shall govern the allocation of
responsibility as between Buyers and the Sellers for certain Tax matters:

(a) _Certain_ _Taxes_. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration and other such Taxes, and all conveyance fees, recording charges
and other fees and charges (including any penalties and interest) incurred in
connection with the consummation of the Transactions (including costs of
filing necessary Tax Returns and other documentation in connection with such
Taxes) (collectively, " _Transfer Taxes_ ") shall be paid when due one hundred
percent (100%) by Buyers, to the extent fifty percent (50%) of which are taken
into account in the calculation of Indebtedness, or otherwise shall be borne
and paid when due fifty percent (50%) by Buyers and fifty percent (50%) by
Sellers; _provided_ , _however_ , that Transfer Taxes shall not include any
Taxes required to be deducted and withheld from any payments made by Buyers
to Sellers in

 



89

    

 connection with the Transactions pursuant to Section 1445 of the Code or
analogous or similar provisions of any state, local or foreign Tax Law ("
_FIRPTA Taxes_ "); for the avoidance of doubt, any such FIRPTA Taxes shall be
governed by _Section_ __ _ 2.6(a)_ or _Section_ __ _ 6.8(i)_, as applicable.
The Sellers will file all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation in
connection with such Taxes and, if required by applicable Law, Buyers will
join in the execution of any such Tax Returns and other documentation. Seller
Holdings, Buyers and the Company Entities shall, upon written request, use
their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any certificate or other
document from any Governmental Authority or any other Person as may be
necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Transfer Tax that could be
imposed.

 

(b) _Preparation and Filing of Tax Returns; Tax Contests_.

 

(i) Seller Holdings shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, and file, or cause
to be filed, all Pass-Through Tax Returns for the Company Entities, in each
case, for all Tax periods beginning on or before the Closing Date that are
filed after the Closing Date (collectively, " _Seller-Prepared Tax Returns_
"). Such Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner consistent with past
practice, except to the extent otherwise required by applicable Law. Seller
Holdings shall deliver to Buyers, for their review and comment, a draft of
each such Tax Return at least fifteen (15) days prior to the
applicable filing deadline of such Tax Return and shall consider any
reasonable comments from Buyers in good faith. If Buyers and Seller Holdings
are unable to resolve any disputes with respect to Buyers comments through
negotiation in good faith within five (5) days of Seller Holdings receipt of
Buyers comments, unless Buyers and Seller Holdings agree to continue to
attempt to resolve any such dispute in good faith, such dispute shall be
submitted to the Accountant for resolution, which resolution shall be final
and binding upon the parties hereto.

(ii) Buyers, at their sole cost and expense, shall prepare, or cause to be
prepared, and file, or cause to be filed, all Tax Returns of the Company
Entities that are filed after the Closing Date which, in each case, are not
Tax Returns prepared, or caused to be prepared, by Seller Holdings pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 6.8b)i)_ (collectively, " _Buyer-Prepared Tax Returns_ ").

 

(iii) Buyers will promptly notify Seller Holdings in writing of any proposed
Tax assessment or claim or the commencement of any audit or Proceeding
involving any Company Entities that relates to a Tax period beginning on or
before the Closing Date (" _Seller Tax Contest_ "). Such notice shall contain
factual information to the extent known describing the asserted Tax Liability
in reasonable detail and shall include copies of any notice or other document
received from any Tax Authority in respect of any such asserted Tax Liability.
Seller Holdings shall have the sole right to control the conduct of any
Seller Tax Contest; _provided_ , that, Seller Holdings shall keep Buyers
informed regarding the progress and substantive aspects of each such Seller
Tax Contest, and shall provide Buyers with copies of all written
correspondence with a Governmental Authority relating to the proceedings.
Buyers, at their expense, shall be entitled to participate in any such Seller
Tax Contest, and Seller Holdings shall not compromise or settle any such
Seller Tax Contest, if such compromise and settlement would adversely affect
any Buyer, without obtaining such Buyers prior written consent, which shall
not be unreasonably

 



90

    

 withheld, delayed, or conditioned. If any proposed Tax assessment, claim,
audit or Proceeding involving any Company Entities (A) relates to a Buyer-
Prepared Tax Return, or (B) could reasonably be expected to result in Taxes
being imposed on any Company Entities following the Closing for which the
Buyers would be economically responsible (a " _Regarded Tax Contest_ "), the
Buyers shall have the sole right to control the conduct of any Regarded Tax
Contest at their sole expense, _provided_ that if the outcome of such Regarded
Tax Contest would reasonably be expected to adversely affect any Seller, Buyer
shall keep Seller Holdings informed regarding the progress and substantive
aspects of such Regarded Tax Contest, and shall provide Seller Holdings with
copies of all written correspondence with a Governmental Authority relating to
the proceedings, Seller Holdings shall, at the expense of Sellers, be
entitled to participate in any such Regarded Tax Contest, and Buyers shall not
compromise or settle any such Regarded Tax Contest in a manner that has a
disproportionate and materially adverse effect on the Sellers without
obtaining Seller Holdings prior written consent, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed, or conditioned.

(iv) From and after the Closing, Buyers and Seller Holdings shall reasonably
cooperate and provide each other with such information as either of them
reasonably may request of the other in filing any Tax Return, amended Tax
Return or claim for refund ( _provided_ that such filing or claim is not
prohibited by the terms of this Agreement), determining a Tax Liability or a
right to a refund of Taxes or participating in or conducting any audit or
other Proceeding with respect to Taxes.

 

(c) _Post-Closing Actions_. Following the Closing, except with the prior
written consent of Seller Holdings, Buyers shall not, and shall cause their
respective Affiliates not to (i) amend, refile, revoke or otherwise modify any
Pass-Through Tax Return for a Tax period beginning on or before the Closing
Date, (ii) make any Tax election or change any accounting period or method
with retroactive effect with respect to any Pass-Through Tax Return for such
Tax period beginning on or before the Closing Date, (iii) take any action to
extend the applicable statute of limitations with respect to any Pass-Through
Tax Return for a Tax period beginning on or before the Closing Date or (iv)
initiate any discussion or enter into any voluntary disclosure program (or
similar program or agreement) with a Governmental Authority regarding any
Pass-Through Tax Return with respect to a Tax period beginning on or before
the Closing Date. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
Buyers shall make elections under Section 338(g) of the Code with respect to
the purchase and sale of the Equity Interests of each of the Non-US Company
Entities (other than AM Global).

(d) For purposes of this Agreement, in the case of any Taxes that are imposed
on a periodic basis and are payable for a Straddle Period, the portion of such
Tax that relates to the portion of such Straddle Period ending on the Closing
Date will (A) in the case of any Taxes other than Taxes based upon or related
to income or receipts, be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire
Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number
of days in the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator
of which is the number of days in the entire Straddle Period, and (B) in the
case of any Tax based upon or related to income or receipts, be deemed equal
to the amount which would be payable if the relevant Taxable period ended on
the Closing Date. Any credits relating to a Straddle Period that begins before
and ends after the Closing Date will be taken into account as though the
relevant Taxable period ended on the Closing Date.

 



91

    

(e) _Tax Treatment; Purchase Price Allocation_.

 

(i) As soon as practicable after the Effective Date and prior to the Closing
Date, the parties to this Agreement shall cooperate in good faith to prepare
an allocation schedule (the " _Allocation Schedule_ "), which will provide the
manner in which the Non-US Purchase Price is allocated among the Sellers. 

(ii) Buyers, the Sellers, Seller Holdings and the Companies intend that, for
U.S. federal income Tax purposes, (i) the AMNA Merger qualify as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code (the "
_Transaction Tax Treatment_ "), and (ii) this Agreement is intended to be, and
is hereby adopted as, a "plan of reorganization" for purposes of Section 354
and 361 of the Code and Treasury Regulations Section 1.368-2(g)
and 1.368-3(a), to which Buyer REIT and AMNA Holdings are parties under
Section 368(b) of the Code. Buyers, the Sellers, Seller Holdings and the
Companies shall not (and shall cause their respective Affiliates not to) take
any position on any Tax Return or any other filings, declarations or reports
with the Internal Revenue Service and/or other taxing authorities that is
inconsistent with the Transaction Tax Treatment unless otherwise
required pursuant to a final determination (within the meaning of Code
Section 1313(a)) or corresponding provision of state, local or foreign Tax
Law.

 

(iii) If requested by any party prior to the delivery of the Estimated Closing
Statement pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2.2_, Buyers, the Sellers, Seller
Holdings and the Companies shall cooperate in good faith to mutually agree on
an adjustment to the Base US Purchase Price and Base Non-US Purchase Price,
without changing the sum of the Base US Purchase Price and Base Non-US
Purchase Price, to reflect any updated understanding of the relative values of
the US Company Entities and the Non-US Company Entities following the date
hereof.

(iv) Buyers, the Sellers, Seller Holdings and the Companies shall act in good
faith to agree upon an allocation of the Final Non-US Purchase Price (and any
amounts treated as purchase price for Tax purposes) among the Equity Interests
of the Non-US Companies and, if applicable, further allocated among the assets
of each Non-US Company Entity, for federal, state, local and foreign Tax
purposes in accordance with Sections 338 and 1060 of the Code, if applicable,
and analogous provisions of state, local and foreign Tax Laws. Seller Holdings
shall provide its proposed updated Allocation Schedule to Buyers not later
than the date that is one-hundred and eighty (180) days after the Closing
Statement is finalized pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.5_. Within thirty (30)
days after receipt of the updated Allocation Schedule, Buyers shall notify
Seller Holdings in writing of any objections to the updated Allocation
Schedule, and shall include a summary of the calculations and reasoning
underlying such objections. Buyers and Seller Holdings shall seek in good
faith to resolve any objections to the updated Allocation Schedule and to
make any agreed modifications to the updated Allocation Schedule within thirty
(30) days of Seller Holdings receipt of Buyers notification of objections.
If Seller

 



92

    

 Holdings and Buyers agree on the updated Allocation Schedule, then each
party agrees to file all U.S. federal, state and local Tax Returns, in all
respects and for all purposes consistent with the updated Allocation
Schedule. If Seller Holdings and Buyers are unable to agree on the updated
Allocation Schedule within such thirty (30) day period, then each party shall
file all U.S. federal, state and local Tax Returns based on each partys own
determination of the proper allocations of the Final Non-US Purchase Price.

 

(f) The parties hereto agree that in connection with the filing of any income
Tax Returns of or with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, to
the extent permitted by Law, the deductions for Transaction Expenses shall be
claimed by the Sellers in a period ending on or prior to the Closing Date.

 

(g) Any Tax sharing agreement, Tax indemnity obligation or similar Contract or
practice with respect to Taxes (other than Contracts entered into in the
Ordinary Course of Business the primary purpose of which is not Taxes) with
respect to or involving any Company Entity will be terminated as of the
Closing Date and will have no further effect for any taxable year (whether the
current year, a future year, or a past year).

(h) Prior to Closing, Sellers shall repay or otherwise extinguish, using
reasonable best efforts to do so in a manner that does not give rise to
taxable income for any of the Company Entities, the convertible loan notes and
other Intercompany Loans set forth on _Section_ __ _ 6.8(h) of the __Company
Disclosure Schedules_. 

(i) _FIRPTA Taxes_.

 

(i) As soon as practicable following the date hereof, Seller Holdings shall
submit an application to the Internal Revenue Service for a certificate under
Treasury Regulations Section 1.1445-3 providing that (x) no withholding is
required under Section 1445 of the Code in connection with the AMNA Merger
and (y) seeking an early refund of any amounts required to be withheld in the
event no such certificate is obtained prior to the Closing (a " _Section_ __ _
1445 Certificate_").

 

(ii) Seller Holdings shall provide a copy of the application for such Section
1445 Certificate to Buyer REIT at least five (5) days prior to submitting
such application to the Internal Revenue Service for Buyer REITs review and
comment, and Seller Holdings shall incorporate all of Buyer REITs reasonable
comments in good faith.

 

(iii) Seller Holdings shall keep Buyer REIT informed of the status of such
application and any correspondence with the Internal Revenue Service relating
to such application and the Section 1445 Certificate.

(iv) In the event a valid Section 1445 Certificate completely exempting any
and all withholding under Section 1445 of the Code in connection with the AMNA
Merger is not obtained by Seller Holdings and delivered to Buyer REIT prior to
the Closing, Buyer REIT shall hold the maximum amount that Buyer REIT may be
required to withhold under Section 1445 of the Code in connection with the
AMNA Merger (the " _Potential Section_ __ _ 1445 Withholding Amount_") in
escrow until the actual amount of required withholding under Section 1445 of
the Code is determined (the " _Actual Section_ _1445 Withholding Amount_ ,"
which may be upon the issuance by the Internal Revenue Service of a
valid Section 1445 Certificate or at such other time as indicated by Seller
Holdings).

 



93

    

(v) Upon determination of the Actual Section 1445 Withholding Amount, Buyer
REIT shall remit any such amount that is due to the Internal Revenue Service
in accordance with applicable Law and shall pay the excess of the Potential
Section 1445 Withholding Amount over the Actual Section 1445 Withholding
Amount over to Seller Holdings.

6.9 _Books and Records_.

 

(a) From and after the Closing, the Buyers and the Companies shall, and shall
cause their respective Affiliates to, retain all books and records relating
to the Company Entities for a period of seven (7) years after the Closing
Date. In addition to the foregoing, from and after the Closing, the Buyers and
the Companies shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, afford
to the Sellers, their controlling Affiliates and their respective counsel,
accountants and other authorized agents and Representatives, during normal
business hours, upon reasonable notice and upon the execution and delivery of
a confidentiality and non-disclosure agreement in customary form and
substance (which shall include appropriate exceptions for disclosure relating
to Tax matters), reasonable access to the personnel, books, records and other
data relating to the Company Entities, at the expense of such requesting
party, and the right to make copies and extracts therefrom, to the extent that
such access may be reasonably required by the requesting party (i)
to facilitate the investigation, litigation and final disposition of any
claims or audits which may have been or may be made against any such party or
its Affiliates (other than in the case of any claims or disputes between the
parties), (ii) for the preparation of Tax Returns and other documents and
reports that such party or its Affiliates are required to file with
Governmental Authorities or Tax Authorities, (iii) for accounting purposes and
(iv) in connection with the such partys financial statements, reporting
obligations and compliance with applicable Laws. The foregoing shall not
require any party to permit any inspection, or to disclose any information,
that in its reasonable judgment, upon the advice of outside counsel, is
reasonably likely to result in the waiver of any attorney-client privilege.

(b) The Sellers may retain (i) copies of the materials prepared in connection
with the negotiation of this Agreement and the Transactions, together with
copies of all documents referred to in such materials, (ii) all internal
correspondence and memoranda, valuations, investment banking presentations
and bids received from other Persons in connection with the negotiation of
this Agreement and the Transactions (which, to the extent in the possession of
the Company Entities as of the Closing, shall be transferred by the Company
Entities to the Sellers at the Closing or otherwise destroyed by the Company
Entities at the Closing and no copy thereof shall be retained by the Company
Entities from and after the Closing) and (iii) copies of all consolidated
and combined financial information and all other accounting records prepared
or used in connection with the preparation of the Financial Statements.

 



94

    

6.10 _Confidentiality_. From the Effective Date until the second anniversary
of the Closing Date (or such later date to the extent required by applicable
Law), the Sellers shall, and shall direct each of their respective Affiliates
to, keep confidential and not disclose for any purpose other than as permitted
by this Agreement any and all non-public information of the Company Entities
unless compelled to disclose such information by judicial, regulatory or
administrative process (including by interrogatories, subpoena,

similar process) or by Law; _provided_ that in the event of any disclosure
pursuant to judicial, regulatory or administrative process or Law, the
Sellers, unless legally restricted from doing so, first inform the Buyers of

the representations and warranties expressly set forth in this Agreement (as
modified by the Seller Disclosure Schedules and the Company Disclosure
Schedules), no other statutory, express or implied representation or warranty,
whether written or oral, concerning the Companies respective Equity
Interests, the Closing or the business, assets or Liabilities of the Company
Entities, the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement or the
Ancillary Agreements or any other matter, including any implied warranties of
merchantability and implied warranties of fitness for a particular purpose, is
or has been made. Nothing set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 10.1_ shall
relieve any party hereunder of any liability for Fraud actually committed
(either by action, inaction or omission) by such party.

10.2 _Survival_. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of the parties contained
in this Agreement shall terminate effective as of the Closing and there shall
be no Liability in respect thereof, whether such Liability has accrued prior
to or after the Closing, on the part of any party, its Affiliates or any of
their respective general partners or other Representatives, except for those
covenants and agreements that by their terms apply or are to be performed in
whole or in part at or after the Closing, for which such post-Closing
obligations shall survive in accordance with their terms and, if no term is
specified, then for the longest period permitted by Law and _Article_ __ _
XI_. Furthermore, without limiting the generality of this _Section_ __ _
10.2_, no Proceeding will be brought, encouraged, supported or maintained by,
or on behalf of, the Buyers or their Affiliates or the Company Entities (after
the Closing Date) against any of the Sellers or the Sellers Affiliates or
their respective general partners or other Representatives, and no recourse
will be sought or granted against any of them, by virtue of, or based upon,
any alleged misrepresentation or inaccuracy in, or breach of, any of the
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the Sellers, the
Companies or any other Person set forth or contained in this Agreement or any
other document contemplated hereby or any certificate, instrument, opinion,
agreement or other document of the Sellers, the Companies or any other Person
delivered hereunder, the subject matter of this Agreement or any other
document contemplated hereby, the Transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, the business, the ownership, operation, management, use or control
of the business of the Company Entities, any of their assets, or any actions
or omissions at, or prior to, the Closing Date, except with respect to those
covenants and agreements that by their terms apply or are to be performed in
whole or in part at or after the Closing, for which such post-Closing
obligations shall survive in accordance with their terms and, if no term is
specified, then for the longest period permitted by Law and _Article_ __ _
XI_.

11.3 _Entire_ _Agreement_. This Agreement, including the Exhibits
and Schedules attached hereto, the Seller Disclosure Schedules, the Company
Disclosure Schedules, the Buyer Disclosure Schedules, the Confidentiality

all other prior covenants, agreements, undertakings, obligations, promises,
arrangements, communications, representations and warranties, whether oral or

11.4 _Specific Performance_.

 

(a) The parties agree that irreparable damage, for which monetary damages,
even if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event
that the parties hereto do not perform the provisions of this Agreement
(including failing to take such actions as are required of them hereunder to
consummate the Closing) in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise
breach such provisions. Accordingly, the parties hereto acknowledge and
hereby agree that in the event of any breach or threatened breach by the
Sellers or the Companies, on the one hand, or the Buyers, on the other hand,
of any of their respective covenants or obligations set forth in this
Agreement, the Sellers or the Companies, on the one hand, and the Buyers, on
the other hand, shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement by the other
(as applicable), and to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this
Agreement to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of, or to
enforce compliance with, the covenants and obligations of the other (as
applicable) under this Agreement, without proof of actual damages or
inadequacy of legal remedy and without bond or other security being required.

(b) The parties hereby further acknowledge and agree that prior to the
Closing, each party shall be entitled to specific performance to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of, and to prevent or cure breaches of
this Agreement by the other parties and to cause the other parties to
consummate the Transactions contemplated hereby, including to effect the
Closing in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.3_, on the terms and subject to
the conditions in this Agreement. The remedies available to each party
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 11.4_ shall be in addition to any other
remedy to which it is entitled at law or in equity, and the election to pursue
an injunction or specific performance shall not restrict, impair or otherwise
limit such party from seeking to obtain such other remedies. For the avoidance
of doubt, the parties hereto further agree that (i) by seeking the equitable
remedies provided for in this  _Section_ __ _ 11.4_, a party shall not in
any respect waive its right to seek at any time any other form of relief that
may be available to a party in accordance with this Agreement in the event
that this Agreement has been terminated or in the event that the equitable
remedies provided for in this _Section_ __ _ 11.4_ are not available or
otherwise are not granted and (ii) nothing set forth in this _Section_ __ _
11.4_ shall require any party hereto to institute any Proceeding for (or
limit any partys right to institute any Proceeding for) specific performance
under this _Section_ __ _ 11.4_ prior or as a condition to exercising any
termination right under _Article_ __ _ IX_ after such termination to the
extent permitted in accordance with this Agreement, nor shall the commencement
of any legal Proceeding pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 11.4_ or
anything set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 11.4_ restrict or limit any
partys right to terminate this Agreement in accordance with the terms of
_Article_ __ _ IX_ or pursue any other remedies otherwise available
under this Agreement.

 



108

    

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, each
of the parties hereto: (1) except for claims by any Buyer against any Debt
Financing Source pursuant to the Debt Commitment Letter and any definitive
documents related thereto, (A) none of the parties hereto nor any of their
respective subsidiaries, Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents,
partners, managers, members or shareholders shall have any rights or claims
against any Debt Financing Source in any way relating to this Agreement or any
of the Transactions contemplated hereby, or in respect of any oral
representations made or alleged to have been made in connection herewith or
therewith, including any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the
Debt Commitment Letter or the performance thereof or the financings
contemplated thereby, whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or
otherwise and (B) no Debt Financing Source shall have any liability (whether
in contract, in tort or otherwise) to any party hereto or any of their
respective subsidiaries, Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents,
partners, managers, members or shareholders for any obligations or liabilities
of any party hereto under this Agreement or for any claim based on, in respect
of, or by reason of, the Transactions contemplated hereby or in respect of
any oral representations made or alleged to have been made in connection
herewith or therewith, including any dispute arising out of or relating in any
way to the Debt Commitment Letter or the performance thereof or the
financings contemplated thereby, whether at law or equity, in contract, in
tort or otherwise, and any such actions are disclaimed and released in full,
and (2)(i) agrees that it will not bring or support any Person in any
Proceeding, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim of any
kind or description, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in
tort or otherwise, against any of the Debt Financing Sources in respect of
the Transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including, but not limited
to, any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the Debt Commitment
Letter or the performance thereof or the Debt Financing, in any forum other
than the federal and New York State courts located in the Borough of
Manhattan of the City of New York; (ii) agrees that, except as specifically
set forth in the any Debt Commitment Letter, all claims or causes of action
(whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) against any
Debt Financing Source, in any way relating to a Debt Commitment Letter, or the
performance thereof or the financings contemplated thereby, shall be
exclusively governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of
the State of New York; and (iii) hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
waives any right such party may have to a trial by jury in respect of any
litigation (whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or
otherwise) directly or indirectly arising out of or relating in any way to
the Debt Commitment Letter or the performance thereof or the financings
contemplated thereby. Each Debt Financing Source is an intended third party
beneficiary of this  _Section_ __ _ 11.4(c)_ and shall be entitled to the
protections of this provision.

11.5 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement,
whether or not the Transactions are consummated, each party hereto shall pay
its own fees, costs and expenses incident to the negotiation, preparation,
drafting, execution, delivery, performance and closing of this Agreement and
the Transactions, including the fees and expenses of its own counsel,
accountants and other experts.

 



109

    

11.6 _No Right of Set-Off_. The Buyers, for themselves and for their
Affiliates, successors and permitted assigns, hereby unconditionally and
irrevocably waives any rights of set-off, netting, offset, recoupment or
similar rights that the Buyers or any of their Affiliates, successors and
permitted assigns has or may have with respect to any payment to be made by
the Buyers pursuant to this Agreement or any agreement, certificate,
instrument or other document executed and delivered by any Buyer
in connection herewith.

11.7 _Amendments_. This Agreement may be amended or otherwise modified only by
a written instrument duly executed and delivered by each of (i) Buyer REIT
(on behalf of the Buyers and, following the Closing, the Companies) and (ii)
Seller Holdings (on behalf of the Sellers and, prior to the Closing, the
Companies). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, this
_Section_ __ _ 11.7_, _Section_ __ _ 11.4(c)_, and the last sentence of
_Section_ __ _ 11.8(b)_, (such sections, the " _Lender Designated Sections_
") and any definitions used in such Sections of this Agreement, to the extent
a modification, waiver or termination of such definition would modify the
substance of any Lender Designated Section, may not be modified, waived
or terminated in a manner that is adverse in any respect to any Debt
Financing Source without the prior written consent of such Debt Financing
Source.

 

11.8 _Assignments; No Third-Party Rights_.

 

(a) No party hereto may assign, in whole or in part, any of its rights,
interest or obligations under this Agreement without the prior
written consent of the other parties hereto and any purported assignment
without such consent shall be void; _provided_ , _however_ , (x) that the
Buyers may, without the prior written consent of any party, (i) assign any or
all of their rights hereunder to any lender of the Buyers or any of their
Subsidiaries for collateral security purposes and (ii) so long as the economic
or legal substance of the Transactions is not affected in any manner
materially adverse to any party hereto (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, as a result of causing or increasing any withholding or deduction under
_Section_ __ _ 2.6_, or other Tax consequences), assign this Agreement or any
rights or duties under this Agreement following the Closing to any Affiliate
of the Buyers, _provided_ that no such assignment shall relieve the Buyers of
any of their obligations hereunder and (y) following the Closing, each Seller
may assign any or all of its rights and obligations hereunder to their
successors or controlling Affiliates (including Seller Parent) in connection
with the dissolution, winding up or liquidation of such Seller; _provided_
that no such assignment shall relieve any Seller of any of its obligations
hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Debt Financing Source shall be
an express and intended third party beneficiary of the Lender Designated
Sections and each of such Sections shall expressly inure to the benefit of
the Debt Financing Source and each Debt Financing Source (and its successors
and assigns) shall be entitled to rely on and enforce the provisions of such
Sections.

 

(b) Except with respect to _Section_ __ _ 11.17_ and _Section_ __ _ 11.18_,
nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer
upon any Person other than the parties hereto any legal or equitable right,
benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this
Agreement or any provision of this Agreement, except as expressly set forth
herein (including in _Section_ __ _ 6.5_). This Agreement and all of its
provisions and conditions are binding upon, are for the sole and exclusive
benefit of, and are enforceable by, the parties hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns.

 



110

    

11.9 _Waiver_. No breach of any provision hereof shall be deemed waived
unless expressly waived in writing by the party hereto who may assert such
breach. No waiver that may be given by a party hereto shall be applicable
except in the specific instance for which it is given. No waiver of any
provision hereof shall be deemed or shall constitute a waiver of any other
provisions hereof (whether or not similar), nor shall any such waiver
constitute a continuing waiver, unless otherwise expressly provided therein.
Except where a specific period for action or inaction is provided in this
Agreement, neither the failure nor any delay on the part of any party hereto
in exercising any right, power or privilege under this Agreement shall operate
as a waiver thereof, nor shall any waiver on the part of any party hereto
of any such right, power or privilege, nor any single or partial exercise of
any such right, power or privilege, preclude any other or further exercise
thereof or the exercise of any other such right, power or privilege. Except as
expressly set forth herein, the rights and remedies of the parties hereto are
cumulative and not alternative.

11.10 _Severability_. In case any one or more of the provisions contained in
this Agreement shall, for any reason, be held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any respect, such provision or provisions shall be
ineffective only to the extent of such invalidity, illegality
or unenforceability, without invalidating the remainder of such provision or
provisions or the remaining provisions of this Agreement, and so long as the
economic or legal substance of the Transactions is not affected in any manner
materially adverse to any party hereto, this Agreement shall be construed as
if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision or provisions had never
been contained herein. Upon such a determination that any term or other
provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or unenforceable under
applicable Law, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify
this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely
as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the Transactions are
consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible.

11.11 _Governing_ _Law_ _; Jurisdiction; Venue; No Trial by Jury_.

(a) THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE
LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE APPLICABLE TO CONTRACTS MADE AND TO BE
PERFORMED ENTIRELY WITHIN SUCH STATE. Except as set forth in _Section_ __ _
11.4b)_, any and all claims, controversies, and causes of action arising out
of or relating to this Agreement, whether sounding in contract, tort, or
statute, shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, including its
statutes of limitations, without giving effect to any conflict-of-laws or
other rule that would result in the application of the laws of a different
jurisdiction. Each of the parties hereto (i) shall submit itself to the
exclusive jurisdiction of any federal court located in the State of Delaware
or any Delaware state court having subject matter jurisdiction in the event
any dispute or claim that arises out of this Agreement, (ii) agrees that venue
will be proper as to Proceedings brought in any such court with respect to
such a dispute, (iii) will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal
jurisdiction or venue by motion or other request for leave from any such court
and (iv) agrees to accept service of process at its address for notices
pursuant to this Agreement in any such action or Proceeding brought in any
such court. With respect to any such action, service of process upon any
party hereto in the manner provided in _Section_ __ _ 11.2_ for the giving of
notices shall be deemed, in every respect, effective service of process upon
such party. Each of the parties hereto irrevocably waives any immunity to
jurisdiction to which it may be entitled or become entitled (including
sovereign immunity, immunity to pre-award attachment, post-award attachment
or otherwise) in any Proceedings against it arising out of or based on this
Agreement or the Transactions.

 



111

    

(b) EACH PARTY HERETO ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY
ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT
ISSUES AND, THEREFORE, EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY
WAIVES TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY
MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY ACTION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY
ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, ANY
ANCILLARY AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS. EACH PARTY HERETO CERTIFIES AND
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY
HERETO HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD
NOT, IN THE EVENT OF SUCH ACTION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (B)
EACH SUCH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS
WAIVER, (C) EACH SUCH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (D) EACH SUCH
PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS,
THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS  _SECTION_ __ _ 11.11(B)_.

11.12 _Time of Essence_. With regard to all dates and time periods set forth
or referred to in this Agreement, time is of the essence. The parties hereto
acknowledge that each will be relying upon the timely performance by the other
of its obligations hereunder as a material inducement to such partys
execution of this Agreement. 

11.13 _Construction_. This Agreement shall be deemed to have been drafted
jointly by the parties hereto. Every term and provision of this Agreement
shall be construed simply according to its fair meaning and not strictly for
or against any party hereto.

11.14  _Incorporation by Reference_. Each Annex, Exhibit and Schedule
attached hereto and referred to herein is incorporated in this Agreement by
reference and shall be considered part of this Agreement as if fully set forth
herein, unless this Agreement expressly otherwise provides.

11.15 _Headings_. The descriptive headings used in this Agreement have been
inserted for convenience of reference only, and are not intended to describe,
interpret, define or limit the scope, extent or intent of this Agreement or
any provision hereof.

 

11.16 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed (including by facsimile
transmission or by email of a .pdf attachment) in any number of counterparts,
each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall
constitute one and the same instrument. The parties hereto agree and
acknowledge that delivery of a signature by facsimile shall constitute
execution by such signatory and will have the same effect as physical
delivery of the paper document bearing the original signature.

 



112

    

11.17 _Non-Recourse_. Notwithstanding anything that may be expressed or
implied in this Agreement, any Ancillary Agreement or any document or
instrument delivered in connection herewith, by its acceptance of the benefits
of this Agreement, except for Fraud actually committed (either by
action, inaction or omission) by a party hereunder, each Buyer covenants,
agrees and acknowledges that no Persons other than the Sellers have any
Liabilities, obligations, commitments (whether known or unknown or whether
contingent or otherwise) hereunder, and that, notwithstanding that the
Sellers or their respective general partners may be partnerships or limited
companies, such Buyer has no right of recovery under this Agreement, or any
claim based on such Liabilities, obligations, commitments against, and no
personal Liability shall attach to, the former, current or future equity
holders, controlling persons, directors, officers, employees, agents,
Affiliates, members, managers or general or limited partners of the Sellers or
any former, current or future stockholder, controlling person, director,
officer, employee, general or limited partner, member, manager, Affiliate or
agent of any of the foregoing (collectively, but not including the Sellers,
each, a " _Non-Recourse Party_"), through the Sellers or otherwise, whether by
or through attempted piercing of the corporate veil, by or through a claim by
or on behalf of any Company against any Non-Recourse Party, by the enforcement
of any assessment or by any legal or equitable Proceeding, by virtue of any
statute, regulation or Law or otherwise. Without limiting the foregoing, no
claim will be brought or maintained by any Buyer or any of their Affiliates
or any of their respective successors or permitted assigns against any Non-
Recourse Party that is not otherwise expressly identified as a party to
this Agreement, and no recourse will be brought or granted against any of
them, by virtue of or based upon any alleged misrepresentation or inaccuracy
in or breach or nonperformance of any of the representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements of any party hereto set forth or contained in this
Agreement, any Ancillary Agreement, any exhibit or schedule thereto, any other
document contemplated hereby or thereby or any certificate, instrument,
opinion, agreement or other document of the Sellers, the Companies or any
other Person delivered hereunder or thereunder.

11.18 _Representation_. Each Buyer agrees, on its own behalf and on behalf of
each of its respective directors, officers, managers, employees and
Affiliates, that, following the Closing, each of the law firms listed on
_Section_ __ _ 11.18 of the Company Disclosure Schedules_ (each, a " _Prior
Counsel_ ") may serve as counsel to the Sellers and their controlling
Affiliates in connection with any matters related to this Agreement and the
contemplated Transactions, including any litigation, claim or
obligation arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the contemplated
Transactions notwithstanding any representation by such Prior Counsel prior to
the Closing Date of the Company Entities. The Buyers and the Company Entities
hereby (a) waive any claim they have or may have that any Prior Counsel has a
conflict of interest or is otherwise prohibited from engaging in such
representation and (b) agree that, in the event that a dispute arises either
before or after the Closing between either the Buyers and the Sellers or the
Sellers controlling Affiliates related to this Agreement and the contemplated
Transactions, such Prior Counsel may represent the Sellers and their
controlling Affiliates in such dispute even though the interests of such
Person(s) may be directly adverse to the Buyers or the Company Entities and
even though such Prior Counsel may have represented the Company Entities in a
matter substantially related to such dispute. The Buyers and the Companies
also further agree that, as to all communications prior to Closing among any
Prior Counsel and, the Sellers or the Company Entities, that relate in any way
to the Transactions contemplated hereby, the attorney-client privilege and
the expectation of client confidence belongs to the Sellers and may be
controlled by the Sellers and shall not pass to or be claimed by the Buyers or
the Company Entities.

 



113

    

 Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a dispute arises between
the Buyers, the Company Entities and a third party other than a party to this
Agreement after the Closing, the applicable Company(ies) may assert the
attorney-client privilege to prevent disclosure of confidential communications
by any Prior Counsel to such third party; _provided_ , _however_ , that such
Company(ies) may not waive such privilege without the prior written consent
of Seller Holdings or a controlling Affiliate thereof.
