Services Payable is approved by the Buyer), in each case by providing written
notice of such designation to the Seller, in which case Schedule 2.3 shall be
deemed to be amended accordingly.

Section 2.4 _Excluded Liabilities_. Neither the Buyer nor any Buyer Affiliate
shall assume or be obligated to pay, perform or otherwise discharge any
Liabilities of the Selling Entities or their Affiliates other than the Assumed
Liabilities (all such Liabilities that neither the Buyer nor any Buyer

Liabilities_ "). The Excluded Liabilities include the following, whether

(g) any other Liability that is not expressly included among the
Assumed Liabilities.

Section 2.5 _Assumption and Assignment of Certain Contracts_. The Sale Order
shall provide for the assumption by the Selling Entities, and the Sale Order
shall, to the extent permitted by law, provide for the assignment by the
Selling Entities to the Buyer and/or (in the Buyers sole discretion) a Buyer
Affiliate, effective upon the Closing, of the Assumed Agreements on the terms
and conditions set forth in the remainder of this Section 2.5.

(a) At the Closing, the Selling Entities shall assume and assign to the Buyer
and/or (in the Buyers sole discretion) a Buyer Affiliate the Assumed
Agreements. The Seller shall identify the Assumed Agreements by the effective
date of the Assumed Agreement (if available), the parties to the Assumed
Agreement and the address (if available) of any parties that are not Selling
Entities. _Schedule 2.5(a)_ sets forth the Sellers good-faith estimate (on a
vendor by vendor basis) as of the date of this  



 

-11-  Agreement of the amounts necessary to cure defaults, if any, with respect to
each counterparty to any of the Assumed Agreements set forth on
_Schedule 2.1(e)_ as determined by the Seller based on the Sellers books and
records and good faith judgment. The Seller shall provide an update of such
good faith estimate not less than three Business Days prior to the Closing
Date.

(b) In the case of any amendment by the Buyer of _Schedule 2.1(e)_ , the
Seller shall give notice to the other parties to any Contract to which such
amendment relates of the removal or addition of such Contract from _Schedule
2.1(e)_ within three Business Days of the Buyer notifying the Seller of such
amendment or such lesser time as is approved by the Bankruptcy Court. 

(c) At any time, before or after Closing and prior to the liquidation and
dissolution of the Selling Entities, subject to providing the Buyer with not
less than five Business Days prior written notice (" _Contract Notice Period_
"), the Seller may move to reject any Contract which is not an Assumed
Agreement; _provided, however,_ the Buyer may, at any time during the
Contract Notice Period, add such Contract to _Schedule 2.1(e)_ and require the
Seller not to reject such Contract.

(d) As part of the Motions (or, as necessary in one or more separate motions),
the Selling Entities shall request that by virtue of a Selling Entity
providing notice of its intent to assume and assign any Contract, the
Bankruptcy Court deem the non-debtor party to such Contract to have given any
required Consent to the assumption of the Contract by the Selling Entity and
assignment to the Buyer and/or (in the Buyers sole discretion) a Buyer
Affiliate if, and to the extent that, pursuant to the Sale Order or other
Bankruptcy Court Order, the applicable Selling Entity is authorized to assume
and assign the Contract to the Buyer and/or (in the Buyers sole discretion) a
Buyer Affiliate and the Buyer and/or (in the Buyers sole discretion) a Buyer
Affiliate is authorized to accept such Assumed Agreement pursuant to section
365 of the Bankruptcy Code.

(e) To the extent that any Assumed Agreement is subject to a cure pursuant to
section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code, the Buyer shall be responsible for such
cure and to pay any amounts related to such cure obligations (the " _Cure
Payments_ ").

(f) The Seller shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain an
order of the Bankruptcy Court to assign the Assumed Agreements to the Buyer
and/or (in the Buyers sole discretion) a Buyer Affiliate. In the event the
Seller is unable to assign any such Assumed Agreement to the Buyer and/or (in
the Buyers sole discretion) a Buyer Affiliate pursuant to an order of the
Bankruptcy Court, the Buyer and the Seller shall, and shall cause their
respective Affiliates to, use commercially reasonable efforts prior to the
Closing to obtain, and to cooperate in obtaining, all Consents and
Governmental Authorizations from Governmental Authorities and third parties
necessary to assume and assign such Assumed Agreement to the Buyer and/or (in
the Buyers sole discretion) a Buyer Affiliate; _provided, however_ , that,
other than the payment of Cure Payments as contemplated by Section 2.5(e), the
parties shall not be required to pay or commit to pay any amount to (or incur
any material obligation in favor of) any Person from whom any such Consent or
Governmental Authorization may be required.

Section 2.6 _Post-Closing Assignment of Contracts_.

(a) With respect to any Contract which is not set forth on _Schedule 2.1(e)_
(as amended from time to time as contemplated in the definition of "Assumed
Agreements") as of the Closing, provided such Contract has not been rejected
by the Seller pursuant to section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code, following the
Closing and until the dissolution and liquidation or reorganization of the
Selling Entities, upon written notice(s) from the Buyer, the Selling Entities
shall, at the Buyers sole cost and expense including with respect to Cure
Payments, use commercially reasonably efforts to assume and assign to the
Buyer and/or (in the Buyers sole discretion) a Buyer Affiliate pursuant to
section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code as soon as practicable any Contract(s) set
forth in the Buyers notice(s), and any Cure Payments applicable thereto
shall be borne by the Buyer; _provided_ that, for the avoidance of doubt, the
standard of commercial reasonableness shall be interpreted in light of the
then current resources of the Selling Entities.



 

-12- (b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, on the date
any Contract is assumed and assigned to the Buyer pursuant to this Section
2.6, such Contract shall be deemed an Assumed Agreement and deemed scheduled
on _Schedule 2.1(e)_ for all purposes under this Agreement.

this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(b) (a " _Buyer Default Termination_ ").
At the Closing, the Deposit (and any interest accrued thereon) shall be
delivered to the Seller and credited toward payment of the Purchase Price in
the manner specified in Section 3.1. In the event the Deposit becomes payable
to the Seller by reason of a Buyer Default Termination, the Seller and the

(or a Person designated by the Seller prior to the Closing) (the " _Seller
Escrow Representative_ ") prior to any settlement of the matters set forth in
part (a) of _Schedule 3.3_ (the " _Specified Tax Matters_ ") and shall provide
the Seller Escrow Representative with such non-privileged information
regarding any settlement discussions and any material developments in such
discussions as the Seller Escrow Representative may reasonably request,
subject to the Seller Escrow Representative executing a confidentiality
agreement containing terms reasonably satisfactory to the Buyer relating to
such information. The Buyer shall, subject to a requirement that it must act
in good faith and seek a reasonable resolution of the Specified Tax Matters:
(a) have complete control over the resolution of each of the Specified
Tax Matters; and (b) be entitled to instruct the Escrow Holder to release to

such matter or otherwise received at or prior to the time such matter is
satisfied), plus the reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of the Buyer and its
subsidiaries (including the reasonable fees and out-of-pocket expenses of
their respective advisers) related to such resolution; provided that if any
tax credit or refund referred to in part (b) of Schedule 3.3 is received
after amounts are released to the Buyer in respect of item 1 in part (a) of
Schedule 3.3, then an amount equal to the lesser of: (i) the amount so
released to the Buyer in respect of item 1 in part (a) of Schedule 3.3 (the "
_Previously Released Amount_ "); and (ii) (A) the amount of such tax credit or
refund, less (B) the amount, if any, by which the sum of any amounts paid to
satisfy item 1 in part (a) of Schedule 3.3 and the reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses of the Buyer and its subsidiaries (including the reasonable fees and
expenses of their respective advisers) related to such matter exceeded the
Previously Released Amount, less (C) the reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of
the Buyer and its subsidiaries (including the reasonable fees and expenses of
their respective advisers) related to such tax credit or refund referred to in
part (b) of Schedule 3.3 (it being understood that if the amount determined
by part (ii) of this proviso is a negative amount, no deposit shall be made),
shall be deposited into the escrow and become part of the Tax Escrow Funds to
be held and released in accordance with this Section 3.3. If, following the
resolution of all of the Specified Tax Matters in accordance with this Section
3.3, or if, on the date five years from the Closing Date, there are no pending
Proceedings relating to the Specified Tax Matters, then after deducting the
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of the Buyer and its subsidiaries (including
the reasonable fees and expenses of their respective advisers) related to the
Specified Tax Matters (and the resolution thereof), any portion of the Tax
Escrow Funds (including any interest accrued thereon) remains in the escrow
account, the Buyer and the Seller Escrow Representative shall jointly instruct
the Escrow Holder to release all of the remaining Tax Escrow Funds to
a Person designated by the Seller Escrow Representative (it being understood
that if no portion of the Tax Escrow Deposit remains in escrow after the final
resolution of the Specified Tax Matters, no amount shall be due to the Seller
or to any other Person pursuant to this Section 3.3) and that none of the
Seller, any other Selling Entity, the Seller Escrow Representative or any
Affiliates thereof shall have any liability or obligation with respect to the
Specified Tax Matters in the event that the amounts necessary to finally
resolve the Specified Tax Matters (and the related expenses of the Buyer and
its Affiliates (including the Acquired Subsidiaries and their subsidiaries)
exceeds the amount of the Tax Escrow Funds. All income and other earnings on
the Tax Escrow Funds will be reported as having been earned by the Buyer.

required by any Legal Requirement or order of the Bankruptcy Court; (ii) under
the circumstances in which the Buyer is expressly permitted by the
Confidentiality Agreement to make such disclosures; or (iii) as is consistent
with any communications plan  



 

-24-  mutually agreed to by the Buyer and the Seller. For the avoidance of doubt,
statements made by the Buyer to any customer, supplier, licensor, dealer
or distributor of, or others having business relationships with, any of the
Selling Entities, the Acquired Subsidiaries or any of the subsidiaries of the
Acquired Subsidiaries with whom the Buyer has a pre-existing business
relationship (in direct discussions with any such Person) shall not require
the consent of the Seller or be deemed to be a breach of this Section 7.5(b).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Buyer and the Seller shall: (1) agree upon
a pre-Closing communications plan, including plans for contacting Persons
having business relationships with the Selling Entities or the Acquired
Subsidiaries (or the subsidiaries of the Acquired Subsidiaries) (including
suppliers, licensors, dealers, distributors and customers), and, in connection
therewith, disclosing to such Persons the identity of the Selling Entities,
the Acquired Subsidiaries (and the subsidiaries of the Acquired Subsidiaries)
and the status and terms of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby (and any such disclosure shall not be deemed a breach of the
Confidentiality Agreement or this Agreement); and (2) cooperate
and coordinate with each other with respect to contacting any such Persons
and developing and implementing any such plans.

Section 7.6  _Governmental Authority Approvals and Cooperation_.

(a) _Governmental Authority Approvals_. Prior to the Closing, each of the
Selling Entities and the Buyer shall (and the Selling Entities shall cause the
Acquired Subsidiaries and the subsidiaries of the Acquired Subsidiaries to)
use its commercially reasonable efforts to make any filings and notifications,
and to obtain any Consents from Governmental Authorities, required to be made
and obtained under applicable Legal Requirements in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as practicable.

(b) _HSR_. If applicable, each of the Buyer and the Seller shall, as promptly
as practicable after the date of this Agreement, file with the United States
Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ ") and the United States Department of
Justice (the " _DOJ_ ") the notification and report form, if any, required for
the transactions contemplated hereby and any supplemental information
requested in connection therewith pursuant to the HSR Act. Any such
notification and report form and supplemental information shall be in
substantial compliance with the requirements of the HSR Act. Each of the Buyer
and the Seller shall furnish to the other such necessary information and
reasonable assistance as the other may request in connection with its
preparation of any filing or submission which is necessary under the HSR Act.
The Seller and the Buyer shall keep each other apprised of the status of any
communications with, and any inquiries or requests for additional information
from, the FTC and the DOJ. If such a filing is made, each of the Buyer and the
Seller shall seek early termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act
and use its reasonable best efforts to obtain any clearance as promptly as
possible required under the HSR Act for the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby.

(c) _Cooperation_. Subject to any restrictions under applicable Legal
Requirements, each party hereto: (i) shall cooperate with each other party
hereto in connection with the filings and Consents contemplated by Section
7.6(a); (ii) shall promptly inform each other party hereto of any
communication received by such party from any Governmental Authority
concerning this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby and any
filing, notification or request for Consent related thereto; and (iii) shall
permit each other party hereto to review in advance any proposed written
communication or information submitted to any such Governmental Authority in
response thereto. In addition, subject to any restrictions under applicable
Legal Requirements, none of the Selling Entities or the Buyer shall (and the
Selling Entities shall ensure that the Acquired Subsidiaries and the
subsidiaries of the Acquired Subsidiaries do not) agree to participate in any
meeting with any Governmental Authority in respect of any filings,
investigation or other inquiry with respect to this Agreement, the
transactions contemplated hereby or any such filing, notification or request
for Consent related thereto unless it consults with the other party hereto in
advance and, to the extent permitted by any such Governmental Authority and
applicable Legal Requirements, gives the other party hereto the opportunity
to attend and participate  



 

-25-  thereat, in each case to the maximum extent practicable. Subject to any
restrictions under applicable Legal Requirements, the Selling Entities and the
Buyer shall furnish (and the Selling Entities shall cause the Acquired
Subsidiaries and the subsidiaries of the Acquired Subsidiaries to furnish) the
Buyer or the Selling Entities, as the case may be, with copies of all
correspondence, filings and communications between it and its Affiliates (and
their respective Representatives) on the one hand, and the Governmental
Authority or members of its staff on the other hand, with respect to this
Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby or any such filing,
notification or request for Consent related thereto (in each case, excluding
documents and communications which are subject to preexisting confidentiality
agreements or to the attorney-client privilege or work product
doctrine). Subject to any restrictions under applicable Legal Requirements,
each of the Selling Entities and the Buyer shall also furnish each other party
hereto with (and the Selling Entities shall cause the Acquired Subsidiaries
and the subsidiaries of the Acquired Subsidiaries to furnish the Buyer with)
such necessary information and assistance as such other party and its
Affiliates may reasonably request in connection with its preparation of
necessary filings, registrations or submissions of information to any
Governmental Authority in connection with this Agreement, the transactions
contemplated hereby and any such filing, notification or request for Consent
related thereto.

Section 7.7 _Employee Matters_.

(a) At least two Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Buyer shall
provide the Seller with a list of any Employees (the " _Specified Employees_
") to whom the Buyer intends to make an offer of employment (it
being understood that, except as described on Annex A, the terms and
conditions of any offer of employment shall be determined by the Buyer in its
sole discretion). If the Closing occurs, the Buyer shall be liable for any
employment law violations that arise from the Buyers actions taken in
selecting Employees for the list of Specified Employees. Prior to the Closing,
the Buyer shall make the offers of employment described on Annex A.

(b) The Selling Entities shall terminate, as of the Closing, any Specified
Employee who does not become a Transferred Employee as of the Closing and
such termination shall be deemed to have been made at the request, and with
the consent of, the Buyer.

(c) After receipt of the list of Specified Employees described in Section
7.7(a) above, but prior to the Closing Date, the Selling Entities shall
terminate, effective as of a time prior to the Closing, all Persons who would
otherwise be Employees as of the Closing other than: (i) the Specified
Employees; and (ii) any Employees who are not Specified Employees and whom the
Selling Entities decide to retain following the Closing (" _Retained
Employees_ "), and such termination shall be deemed to have been made at the
request, and with the consent, of the Buyer. An Employee who satisfies the
conditions described in any of clauses "(A)" through "(C)" of this sentence is
referred to as a " _Terminated Employee_ ": (A) such Employee is terminated
pursuant to the preceding sentence, (B) such Employee is terminated at any
other time on or after the Petition Date and prior to the Closing at the
direction or with the consent of the Buyer (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld in the case of a proposed termination for "cause"); or
(C) such Employee is a Specified Employee who does not become a Transferred
Employee as of the Closing. 

(d) If the Closing occurs, the Buyer shall process (or if it is not
practicable for the Buyer to process, the Seller shall process on the Buyers
behalf with the Buyer providing reasonable assistance to the Seller) the
payroll for, and pay (or provide funds to pay), the base wages, base salary
and ordinary course sales commissions accrued during the payroll period in
which the Closing Date falls (the " _Closing Payroll Period_ ") with respect
to each Employee employed at any time during the Closing Payroll Period other
than Retained Employees. For the avoidance of doubt, the Closing
Payroll Period shall extend from the final payroll date preceding the Closing
through and including the Closing Date. In connection therewith, the Buyer
shall withhold and remit, on behalf of the Selling Entities, all applicable
payroll taxes as required by law.



 

-26- (e) With respect to each Specified Employee who accepts the offer of
employment from the Buyer or its subsidiary (the " _Transferred Employees_
"), if the Closing occurs, the Buyer shall assume the Selling Entities
liability for all unused vacation earned and/or accrued by such Transferred
Employee (it being understood that benefits under the Selling Entities
sabbatical program shall not constitute unused vacation).

(f) With respect to each Terminated Employee and any Specified Employee who
does not become a Transferred Employee or a Retained Employee, if the Closing
occurs, the Buyer shall assume and pay the Selling Entities Liabilities: (i)
for all unused vacation earned and/or accrued by such Terminated Employee;
and (ii) except with respect to persons listed on Annex A and executive
officers of the Seller (as to whom the Buyer shall not assume or pay any
severance, change of control, bonus or similar payment or obligation, whether
pursuant to any individual employment, severance or similar agreement or
otherwise), for severance obligations that arise as a result of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, but only to the extent such
severance obligations arise pursuant to the Sellers severance plan(s)
disclosed to the Buyer prior to the date of this Agreement (and not pursuant
to any individual employment, severance or similar agreement). For the
avoidance of doubt, any Employee of the Selling Entities whose employment is
terminated by the Selling Entities without the consent of the Buyer shall not
be deemed to be a "Terminated Employee" for purposes of this Section 7.7(e).

(g) With respect to Employees other than persons listed on Annex A, executive
officers of the Seller and other than Retained Employees, if the Closing
occurs, the Buyer shall assume and pay the Selling Entities Liabilities under
the WARN Act (provided that, to the extent that the WARN Act is applicable to
any Terminated Employee, the Selling Entities shall comply with
all procedural aspects thereof through the Closing Date).

(h) If the Closing occurs, the Buyer shall assume Selling Entities Liability
under Section 4980B of the Code ("COBRA"); _provided, however,_ that,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Buyer shall
not assume any Liability for making COBRA premium payments (whether or not
any Selling Entity has any Liability to make such payments pursuant to any
Contract, benefit plan or otherwise), except to the extent required by
applicable Legal Requirements. Buyer hereby acknowledges that it will be
a "successor employer" for purposes of Treasury Regulations Section
54.4980B-9.

(i) With respect to any medical, dental or other welfare benefits that are
provided at any time to Transferred Employees under any other plan within the
calendar year of the Closing, the Buyer shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause any applicable pre-existing condition exclusions and waiting
periods (except to the extent such limitations or waiting periods are already
in effect with respect to such employees and have not been satisfied
immediately prior to the Closing Date) to be waived, and each Transferred
Employee shall be provided with credit for any co-payments and deductibles
paid prior to the Closing Date in satisfying any applicable deductible or out-
of-pocket requirements under any equivalent welfare plans in which an
employee participates except to the extent that such a credit would cause
duplication of benefits.

Section 7.8 _Taxes_. The Selling Entities shall prepare and file all
necessary Tax Returns and other documentation relating to Transfer Taxes that
they are required to file under applicable Legal Requirements and shall
provide the Buyer with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such
Tax Returns (and in any event not fewer than three Business Days) prior to the
filing thereof. The Buyer shall bear and pay any Transfer Taxes. The Buyer and
the Selling Entities shall cooperate with each other to the extent legally
permitted to minimize any such Transfer Taxes. The Buyer shall, within 30
days after the Closing, provide the Seller with an allocation of the sum of
the Purchase Price and the Assumed Liabilities (and any adjustments thereof)
among the Purchased Assets as of the Closing Date (the "Allocation") in
accordance with Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations
thereunder. Except as otherwise required by applicable Legal Requirements, the
Buyer and the Seller shall report for all Tax purposes all transactions
contemplated by this Agreement in a manner consistent with the  



 

-27-  Allocation, if any, and shall not take any position inconsistent therewith
in any Tax Return, in any refund claim, in any litigation or otherwise.
Real property, personal property and other ad valorem Taxes with respect to
the Purchased Assets that are due after the Closing Date shall be paid by the
Buyer.

Section 7.9 _Submission for Bankruptcy Court Approval_. (a) Each of the
Selling Entities shall file voluntary petitions under Chapter 11 of the
Bankruptcy Code no later than April 1, 2009. On the Petition Date (or as soon
thereafter as is reasonably practicable but in no event later than April 3,
2009), the Selling Entities shall file a motion or motions (the " _Motions_ ")
and supporting papers seeking: (i) the entry of the Bidding Procedures Order
(including the scheduling of the Auction); (ii) the Bankruptcy Courts
approval of this Agreement, each of the Selling Entitys performance under
this Agreement and the assumption and the assignment of the Assumed
Agreements pursuant to section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code; and (iii) the entry
of an order in the form of _Exhibit C_ approving this Agreement, which order
shall be a Final Order in a form and substance reasonably acceptable to the
Buyer and not subject to Rules 6004(h) and 6006(d) of the Federal Rules of
Bankruptcy Procedure (the " _Sale Order_ "). The Buyer shall take such actions
as are reasonably requested by the Seller to assist the Seller in obtaining a
finding by the Bankruptcy Court that the Buyer is deemed to have purchased the
Purchased Assets in good faith pursuant to section 363(m) of the Bankruptcy
Code and that it has the necessary qualifications to show adequate assurance
of future performance with respect to the Assumed Agreements as required by
section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code. The Bidding Procedures Order and the Sale
Order may, at the Sellers option, be sought under one combined set of
motion papers, which shall be in form and substance reasonably acceptable to
the Buyer. All parties hereto shall use their commercially reasonable efforts
to have the Bankruptcy Court enter the Bidding Procedures Order within three
Business Days following the filing of the motion therefor, to have the Sale
Hearing no later than 30 days after the Petition Date and to have the Sale
Order entered no later than 32 days after the Petition Date. The Selling
Entities shall give notice under the Bankruptcy Code of the request for the
relief specified in the Motions to any Person as to whom any Selling Entity
has received notice that such Person has or may have, and to any Person who to
the Sellers Knowledge, might assert, a claim against or with respect to, or
interest in, any of the Purchased Assets or Assumed Liabilities, and other
appropriate notice, including such additional notice as the Bankruptcy Court
shall direct or as the Buyer may reasonably request, and provide
appropriate opportunity for hearing, to all parties entitled thereto, of all
motions, orders, hearings, or other proceedings relating to this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby. The Selling Entities shall be
responsible for making all appropriate filings relating thereto with the
Bankruptcy Court, which filings shall be submitted, to the extent practicable,
to the Buyer at least two Business Days prior to their filing with the
Bankruptcy Court for the Buyers prior review and approval, which shall not
be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

(b) A list of the Assumed Agreements shall be filed as an exhibit to the Sale
Motion, or, if required by the Bankruptcy Court, a motion to assume and assign
the Assumed Agreements, and otherwise shall be described in sufficient detail
to provide adequate notice to the non-debtor party to such Contracts. Upon
revision of _Schedule 2.1(e)_ by the Buyer, the Seller shall add any Assumed
Agreements to the exhibit or remove Assumed Agreements from the exhibit, as
applicable. Such exhibit shall set forth the amounts necessary to cure
defaults under each of such Assumed Agreements as reasonably determined in
good faith by the Seller. In cases in which the Seller is unable to establish
that a default exists, the relevant cure amount shall be set at $0.00.

(c) Each Selling Entity and the Buyer shall consult with one another regarding
pleadings which any of them intends to file with, or positions any of them
intends to take before, the Bankruptcy Court in connection with, or which
might reasonably affect the Bankruptcy Courts approval of, the Bidding
Procedures Order or the Sale Order. Each Selling Entity shall
promptly provide the Buyer and its counsel with copies of all notices,
filings and orders of the Bankruptcy Court (and other courts) that such
Selling Entity has in its possession (or receives) pertaining to the motion
for approval of the Bidding Procedures Order, the Sale Order or any other
order related to any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, but
only to the extent such papers are not publicly available on the Bankruptcy
Courts docket.



 

-28- (d) If the Bidding Procedures Order, the Sale Order or any other orders of the
Bankruptcy Court relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby shall be appealed by any Person (or if any petition for certiorari or
motion for reconsideration, amendment, clarification, modification, vacation,
stay, rehearing or reargument shall be filed with respect to the Bidding
Procedures Order, Sale Order or other such order), subject to rights otherwise
arising from this Agreement, the Selling Entities and the Buyer shall use
their commercially reasonable efforts to prosecute such appeal, petition or
motion and obtain an expedited resolution of any such appeal, petition or
motion.

Section 7.10  _Overbid Procedures_. The Buyer and the Selling Entities
acknowledge that the Selling Entities must take reasonable steps to
demonstrate that they have sought to obtain the highest or otherwise best
price for the Purchased Assets, including giving notice thereof to the
creditors of the Selling Entities and other interested parties, providing
information about the Selling Entities business to prospective bidders
(subject to confidentiality agreements no less restrictive than
the Confidentiality Agreement), entertaining higher and better offers from
such prospective bidders, and, in the event that additional qualified
prospective bidders desire to bid for the Purchased Assets, conducting an
auction (the " _Auction_ "). The Selling Entities and the Buyer agree, and
the motion to approve the Bidding Procedures Order shall reflect the fact that
the provisions of this Agreement, including this Section 7.10 and Section
7.11, are reasonable, were a material inducement to the Buyer to enter into
this Agreement and are designed to achieve the highest and best price for the
Purchased Assets.

Section 7.11 _Break-Up Fee and Expense Reimbursement_. If: (a) (i) the Buyer
is not identified as the successful bidder following completion of the actions
contemplated by Section 7.10; (ii) at the time the successful bidder is
identified, the Buyer is not in material breach of any material provision of
this Agreement; (iii) the Buyer has not terminated this Agreement (other than
pursuant to Sections 9.1(c) or 9.1(e)); and (iv) a sale of all or a material
part of the Purchased Assets to a party or parties (collectively, a " _Third-
Party_ ") other than the Buyer (the " _Third-Party Sale_ ") is consummated;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that a stand-alone reorganization, including a
reorganization under which the Sellers secured lenders receive substantially
all the equity and/or debt in the reorganized Sellers, shall not constitute a
Third-Party Sale; (b) (i) a Third-Party Sale is consummated (whether in the
Chapter 11 Case or, if converted into a case under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy
Code, such Chapter 7 case) within six months of the approval of the Bidding
Procedures Order; (ii) at the time of the Third-Party Sale, the Buyer is not
in material breach of any material provision of this Agreement; and (iii) the
Buyer has not terminated this Agreement (other than pursuant to Sections
9.1(c) or 9.1(e) or (c) one or more Selling Entities files a Chapter 11 plan
contemplating the sale or retention of a material portion of the Purchased
Assets by the Selling Entities in a manner substantially inconsistent with the
terms of this Agreement in circumstances in which the Sellers secured
lenders receive more than 50% of the equity and/or debt in the reorganized
Seller or any other successor entity (an " _Inconsistent Plan_ "), then the
Buyer will be entitled to receive, without further order of the Bankruptcy
Court, from the Seller, or, in the event of a Third-Party Sale, out of the
deposit from such Third-Party and the proceeds of the consummated sale: (A) a
"break-up fee" of $1,000,000 (" _Break-Up Fee_ "); _plus_ (B) the amount of
all of the Buyers documented out-of-pocket expenses (including expenses of
outside counsel, accountants and financial advisers) incurred since December
7, 2007 in connection with its evaluation, consideration and negotiation of a
possible transaction with the Buyer and in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby, in any case up to $1,000,000 (the " _Expense
Reimbursement_ ", together with the Break-Up Fee, the " _Termination Payment_
"). Such Termination Payment shall be made by wire transfer of immediately
available U.S. funds to an account designated by the Buyer from the Seller or,
in the event of a Third-Party Sale, from the Seller, the deposit from such
Third-Party and the proceeds of a Third-Party Sale, with such payment to be
made on or before the first Business Day after the consummation of the Third-
Party Sale or the filing of an Inconsistent Plan, as applicable. In the event
of a Third Party Sale in which one or more of the secured lenders (or their
agents or affiliates) of the Selling Entities is the acquiring party, if the
cash proceeds from such sale and other funds of the Selling Entities will be
insufficient to pay the Termination Payment, such secured lender shall be
required to pay any portion of the Termination Payment that cannot be paid in
cash from the proceeds of such sale or such other funds to the Buyer (after
taking into account the Carve-Out (as defined in the cash collateral order
entered in the Chapter 11 Case) as a condition precedent to the closing of
such Third Party Sale (it being understood that the remainder of the
Termination Payment will be paid from the proceeds of such sale or other
funds after taking into account the Carve-Out). The claim of the Buyer in
respect of the Termination Payment



 

-29-  shall constitute a super-priority administrative expense claim, senior to
all other administrative expense claims of the Selling Entities, as
administrative expenses under sections 503 and 507(b) of the Bankruptcy Code
in the Chapter 11 Case, senior to all administrative expense claims of the
Selling Entities secured lenders, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
any Bankruptcy Court orders approving the Selling Entities use of cash
collateral, paid, in cash, from the deposit and/or the sale proceeds generated
by the sale or sales of the Purchased Assets paid by a Third-Party Sale and
paid to the Buyer, in cash, prior to delivery of any sale proceeds to any of
the secured lenders. As part of any motion seeking entry of the Bidding
Procedures Order, the Seller shall seek approval by the Bankruptcy Court of
this Section 7.11 (and that the substance of this Section 7.11 be in the Bid
Procedures Order), which may be approved by the Bankruptcy Court separately
from the remainder of this Agreement.

Section 7.12 _Transfer of Purchased Assets_.

(a) The Selling Entities and the Buyer agree that unless otherwise requested
by the Buyer in writing, any of the Purchased Assets (including software)
that can be transmitted to the Buyer electronically will be so delivered to
the Buyer or a Buyer Affiliate promptly following the Closing and will not be
delivered to the Buyer or a Buyer Affiliate on any tangible medium. Promptly
following any electronic transmission, the Selling Entities shall execute and
deliver to the Buyer a certificate in a form reasonably acceptable to the
Buyer and containing, at a minimum, the following information: (i) the date
of transmission; (ii) the time the transmission was commenced and concluded;
(iii) the name of the individual who made the transmission; (iv) the signature
of such individual; and (v) a general description of the nature of the items
transmitted sufficient to distinguish the transmission from other
transmissions.

(b) The Buyer will make all necessary arrangements for the Buyer or a Buyer
Affiliate to take possession of the Purchased Assets, and, at the Buyers
expense, to transfer same to a location operated by the Buyer or a Buyer
Affiliate, as promptly as practicable following the Closing.

(c) After the Closing, if any Selling Entity receives any payment, refund or
other amount which is a Purchased Asset or which is otherwise properly due and
owing to the Buyer or a Buyer Affiliate, such Selling Entity shall promptly
remit, or shall cause to be remitted, such amount to the Buyer or a Buyer
Affiliate. The Selling Entities shall promptly endorse and deliver to the
Buyer or a Buyer Affiliate any notes, checks, negotiable instruments or other
documents which are Purchased Assets or otherwise properly due and owing to
the Buyer or a Buyer Affiliate, and the Buyer shall have the right and
authority to endorse, without recourse, the name of the Selling Entities on
any such instrument or document.

Section 7.13 _Resignations, Minute Books and Stock Certificates_. Except to
the extent otherwise determined by the Buyer and communicated to the Seller
prior to the Closing, the Seller shall use commercially reasonable
efforts: (a) to deliver at the Closing written resignations of all officers
and directors of the Acquired Subsidiaries (and subsidiaries of the Acquired
Subsidiaries), effective as of the Closing, and the minute books of all
Acquired Subsidiaries (and the subsidiaries of the Acquired Subsidiaries);
and (b) to facilitate the transfer of director qualifying shares and similar
shares of the Acquired Subsidiaries (and subsidiaries of the Acquired
Subsidiaries) that are not owned by either a Selling Entity or Acquired
Subsidiary to a person designated by Buyer, effective as of the Closing.

Section 7.14 _Post-Closing Operation of the Seller; Name Changes_. From and
after the Closing, the Seller Entities will cease operations that are in any
manner competitive with the business being transferred to the Buyer hereunder.
Nothing contained herein shall preclude the Selling Entities from conducting
any non-competitive business activities, selling Excluded Assets or enforcing
their rights and performing their obligations under this Agreement and the
other Transaction Documents. Promptly after the Closing, the Selling Entities
shall take all necessary action to change their names to names bearing no
resemblance to Silicon Graphics, SGI or any variation thereof and will file
such documents as are necessary to reflect such name change in the states in
which the Seller Entities are incorporated and the other jurisdictions where
the Selling Entities are qualified to do business as a foreign entity and
filing  



 

-30-  an application with and obtaining an order from the Bankruptcy Court
requiring a change to the caption of all pleadings and documents to be filed
in the Chapter 11 Case from the names of the Seller and the Selling Entities
to names bearing no resemblance to Silicon Graphics, SGI or any variation
thereof. The Selling Entities agree to promptly notify the Buyer of such name
changes and the name chosen by the Selling Entities. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Seller may refer to Silicon Graphics, SGI and variations
thereof as a former name for legal and noticing purposes in the Chapter 11
Case and other legal documents.

warranties contained in this Agreement shall be inaccurate as of the date of
