1.1 _The Merger_.



(a) _Merger_. Subject to the other terms and conditions of this Agreement,
including those set forth in Article 7 hereof, and in accordance with
California Law, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and
into the Company, and as a result of the Merger, the separate corporate
existence of Merger Sub shall cease and the Company shall continue as the
surviving corporation of the Merger (the " _Surviving Corporation_ ").



(b) _Closing; Effective Time_. Subject to the fulfillment or waiver of all of
the conditions contained in Article 7, as soon as is reasonably practicable
following the satisfaction or waiver of all of the conditions contained in

other place as the parties may agree). The date on which the Closing is
actually held is referred to herein as the " _Closing Date_." On the Closing
Date, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall cause the Merger to be
consummated by filing an agreement of merger with the California Secretary of
State, substantially in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit A_ , and with
such changes as may be made after review by the California Secretary of State
(the " _Merger Document_ "). The term " _Effective Time_ " means the date and
time of the filing of the Merger Document with the California Secretary of
State (or such later time as may be agreed by each of the parties hereto and
specified in the Merger Document in accordance with California Law). In the
event of a conflict between the Merger Document and this Agreement, the terms
of this Agreement shall govern.



1.2 _Effect of the Merger_. At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger
shall be as provided in the Merger Document and as provided by the applicable
provisions of California Law. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, and subject thereto, upon the consummation of the Merger, all the
property (including, but not limited to, Intellectual Property and licenses
to Intellectual Property), rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the
Company and the Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all
debts, liabilities, obligations, restrictions, disabilities and duties of
each of those corporations shall become the debts, liabilities, obligations,
restrictions, disabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.



1.3 _Charter; Bylaws_.



(a) At the Effective Time, the Articles of Incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation (the " _Surviving Corporation Charter_ ") shall be the
Articles of Incorporation of the Company, as amended by the Merger Document.



(b) At the Effective Time, the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be
the bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, until thereafter amended as provided by California Law, the
Surviving Corporation Charter and such bylaws.



1.4 _Directors and Officers_. The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be the initial directors of the
Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with the Surviving
Corporation Charter and the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, and until
their respective successors are duly elected and qualified or until their
earlier death, disability, resignation or removal. The officers of Merger Sub
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial officers of the

elected or appointed and qualified or until their earlier death, disability,
resignation or removal.



1.5 _Closing Date Consideration; Initial Escrow Amount; Representative
Reimbursement Amount_.



(a) The consideration to be paid by Parent to the Participating Rights Holders
at the Closing in connection with the Merger shall be the amount of
the Closing Payment Amount in cash allocated to each of such Participating
Rights Holders pursuant to Section 2.1.



(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, a portion of the Closing Payment Amount
payable to the Participating Rights Holders equal to $27,500,000 (the "
_Initial Escrow Amount_ "), shall not be paid to the Participating Rights
Holders at the Closing, but shall instead be deposited with Sovereign Bank or
such other escrow agent as shall be mutually agreed-upon by Parent and

 



 

-2- the Company (the " _Escrow Agent_ "), to be held in trust by the Escrow Agent
pursuant to an Escrow Agreement, substantially in the form of the attached
_Exhibit B_ , and with such changes as may be reasonably requested by the
Escrow Agent (the " _Escrow Agreement_ "), and distributed in accordance
therewith. At the Closing, Parent, the Shareholder Representative and the
Escrow Agent will execute and deliver the Escrow Agreement.



(c) In addition, a portion of the Closing Payment Amount otherwise payable to
the Participating Rights Holders equal to $250,000 (the " _Representative
Reimbursement Amount_ "), shall not be paid to the Participating Rights
Holders at the Closing, but shall instead be deposited in cash with the
Shareholder Representative, to be held by the Shareholder Representative for
the payment of expenses incurred by the Shareholder Representative in
performing its duties pursuant to this Agreement. Any of the Representative
Reimbursement Amount originally deposited with the Shareholder Representative
at the Closing that has not been consumed by the Shareholder Representative
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement on or prior to the end of the period
in which Parent, the Surviving Corporation and their Affiliates may make
claims for indemnification pursuant to Section 9.2 or, if later, the date on
which all indemnification claims of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any
of their Affiliates outstanding at the end of such period have been discharged
in full, shall be distributed by the Shareholder Representative to the Escrow
Agent for further distribution by the Escrow Agent to the Participating Rights
Holders _pro rata_ based on their respective rights to participate in receipt
of the remaining Escrowed Funds, if any. Notwithstanding the delivery of any
remaining portion of the Representative Reimbursement Amount to the Escrow
Agent, such remaining portion shall not be deemed part of the Initial Escrow
Amount or part of the Escrowed Funds and shall not be available to
satisfy indemnification or other obligations to Parent hereunder.



ARTICLE 2

CONVERSION OF SECURITIES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES; PAYMENTS



2.1 _Conversion of Securities_.



(a) _Common Stock_. Each share of the Company Common Stock issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by
Participating Rights Holders will be converted at the Effective Time into the
right to receive from Parent, in cash, an amount equal to the Per Share Common
Closing Payment. All such shares of Company Common Stock, when so converted,
shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and
retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate
representing any such shares of Company Common Stock shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Per Share Common
Closing Payment upon the surrender of such certificate in accordance with
Section 2.2 and this Section 2.1. Notwithstanding the foregoing, portions
of the Closing Payment Amount attributable to the Company Common Stock shall
be deposited in escrow and a portion of the Closing Payment Amount shall be
paid to the Shareholder Representative as the Representative Reimbursement
Amount in accordance with Section 1.5.



(b) _Preferred Stock_. Each share of each series, if any, of Company
Preferred Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
and held by Participating Rights Holders will be converted at the Effective
Time into the right to receive, in cash, an amount equal to the Per Share
Preferred Closing Payment associated with such series of Company Preferred
Stock. All shares of Company Preferred Stock, when so converted, shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and retired and
shall cease to exist,



 

-3- and each holder of a certificate representing any such shares of Company
Preferred Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except
the right to receive the Per Share Preferred Closing Payment associated with
the applicable class of Company Preferred Stock upon the surrender of such
certificate in accordance with Section 2.2 and this Section
2.1. Notwithstanding the foregoing, portions of the Closing Payment Amount
attributable to the Company Preferred Stock shall be deposited in escrow and a
portion of the Closing Payment Amount shall be paid to the Shareholder
Representative as the Representative Reimbursement Amount in accordance with
Section 1.5. For avoidance of doubt, shares of Company Preferred Stock
converted into Company Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time in
connection with the Merger shall not be entitled to consideration under this
Section 2.1(b), but instead shall be entitled to consideration on an as-
converted basis as Company Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.1(a).



(c) _Exchange of Options and Warrants_.



(i) _Options_. Each option to purchase Company Common Stock issued under the
CompanyÂ’s 1997 Stock Option Plan (the " _Company Option Plan_ ") or otherwise
listed in Section 3.2(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, whether or not
exercisable, whether or not vested, and whether or not performance-based,
which is outstanding at the Effective Time (each a " _Company Option_ "),
shall not be assumed by the Surviving Corporation or Parent, but shall instead
be converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive payment as of the
Closing of an amount in cash equal to the excess, if any, of the aggregate
Per Share Common Closing Payment that would be payable with respect to all
shares of Company Common Stock that would be issuable upon exercise of such
Company Option (regardless of whether or not any such Company Option is then
"vested" or exercisable) (the " _Option Shares_ ") over the aggregate exercise
price per share otherwise payable by the holder thereof to acquire such Option
Shares. Notwithstanding the foregoing, portions of the Closing Payment Amount
attributable to the Company Options shall be deposited in escrow and a portion
of the Closing Payment Amount shall be paid to the Shareholder Representative
as the Representative Reimbursement Amount in accordance with Section 1.5.



(ii) _Warrants_. Any unexercised rights, warrants or options that are not
described in Section 2.1(c)(i) above to purchase shares of Company Common
Stock or Company Preferred Stock and that are outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (each a " _Company Warrant_ ") and are tendered to Parent
for payment at the Closing in compliance with Section 2.2(a) shall be
discharged by Parent out of the aggregate merger consideration for an amount
equal to the excess, if any, of the aggregate Per Share Common
Closing Payment that would be payable with respect to all shares of Company
Common Stock that would be issuable upon exercise of such Company Warrant (the
" _Warrant Shares_ ") over the aggregate exercise price otherwise payable by
the holder to acquire such Warrant Shares. For the purposes of the
calculating the portion of the Closing Payment Amount to be paid to the holder
of a Company Warrant to purchase Company Preferred Stock, such Company Warrant
shall be deemed exercisable for that number of shares of Company Common Stock
equal to the number of shares of Company Preferred Stock for which such
Company Warrant may be exercised _multiplied by_ the applicable conversion
rate for the series of Company Preferred Stock specified in such Company
Warrant. In addition, the per share exercise price for such Company Warrant
shall be deemed to be the per share exercise price specified in the Company
Warrant divided by the applicable conversion rate for the series of Preferred
Stock specified in such Company Warrant.



 

-4- For avoidance of doubt, the intent of the foregoing provisions regarding
Company Warrants exercisable for Company Preferred Stock is the effect the
exchange of such Company Warrants for a portion of the aggregate merger
consideration on an as-converted to Company Common Stock basis.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, portions of the Closing Payment
Amount attributable to the Company Warrants shall be deposited in escrow and
a portion of the Closing Payment Amount shall be paid to the Shareholder
Representative as the Representative Reimbursement Amount in accordance with
Section 1.5.



(d) _Treasury Stock_. Each share of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred
Stock held in the treasury of the Company or held by any Subsidiary of the
Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and
extinguished at the Effective Time without any conversion thereof and no
payment shall be made with respect thereto.



(e) _Stock Held by Parent_. Each share of Company Common Stock or Company
Preferred Stock held by Parent or any Affiliate of Parent shall be cancelled
and extinguished at the Effective Time without any conversion thereof and no
payment shall be made with respect thereto. 



(f) _Stock of Merger Sub_. Each share of common stock of Merger Sub issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted
into one (1) validly issued fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock
of the Surviving Corporation.



2.2 _Exchange of Certificates and Instruments for Closing Payment Amount_.



(a) _Exchange Procedures_.



(i) Within a reasonable period of time prior to the Closing, Parent
will deliver to the Company forms of the transmittal materials which Parent
will reasonably require from those Participating Rights Holders entitled to
receive a portion of the Closing Payment Amount in respect of their shares of
Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock, or in respect of their
Company Options or Company Warrants, which materials may include any
certifications Parent may request with respect to compliance with any
withholding obligations of Parent or the Surviving Corporation under the
Code. The Company will distribute such materials to eligible Participating
Rights Holders. As promptly as practicable following the Effective Time,
Parent will deliver to each Participating Rights Holder who has completed such
transmittal materials and returned them to Parent at or prior to the Closing,
together with the certificate or certificates representing outstanding shares
of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock (the " _Certificates_ "),
or certificates or instruments representing outstanding Company Options or
Company Warrants (" _Derivative Instruments_ "), a check (or, at the election
of the Shareholder Representative, a wire transfer to the extent that the
aggregate amount owed to any such holder is in excess of $1,000,000)
representing that portion of the Closing Payment Amount that such
Participating Rights Holder is entitled to receive in cash. The (i) delivery
of such checks (or wire transfers, as applicable) by Parent to the
Participating Rights Holders and (ii) deposit of the Initial Escrow Amount
with the Escrow Agent and (iii) delivery of the Representative Reimbursement
Amount to the Shareholder Representative shall be deemed, for all purposes, to
have satisfied in full ParentÂ’s Closing Payment Amount obligations to such
Participating Rights Holders and Parent shall have no further obligation for
such payments. Parent shall not be required to pay any amount of the Closing
Payment Amount



 

-5- to a particular Participating Rights Holder until receipt from such
Participating Rights Holder of properly completed and executed transmittal
materials in the form prepared by Parent. Parent shall be entitled to rely
entirely on the information contained in the Capitalization Certificate and
any transmittal materials delivered hereunder for purposes of
satisfying ParentÂ’s obligation to deliver the Closing Payment Amount.



(ii) As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent will send to
each Participating Rights Holder who does not submit completed transmittal
materials to Parent at or before the Closing, as permitted by Section
2.2(a)(i) above, transmittal materials for use in exchanging his, her or its
Certificates or Derivative Instruments for the applicable portion of the
Closing Payment Amount into which such shares of Company Common Stock or
Company Preferred Stock (other than any Dissenting Shares) or Company Options
or Company Warrants, have been converted. Until surrendered as contemplated by
this Section 2.2, each Certificate or Derivative Instrument shall be deemed at
any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon
such surrender the applicable portion of the Closing Payment Amount payable
pursuant to Section 2.1. Upon receipt of the completed transmittal materials
and the applicable Certificates and Derivative Instruments from
a Participating Rights Holder, Parent will deliver to such Participating
Rights Holder a check (or, at the election of the Shareholder Representative,
a wire transfer to the extent that the aggregate amount owed to any such
holder at the Closing is in excess of $1,000,000) representing that portion
of the Closing Payment Amount that such Participating Rights Holder is
entitled to receive in cash.



(b) _No Further Rights in Certificates or Derivative Instruments_. After the
Effective Time, holders of Company Common Stock, Company Preferred Stock,
Company Options or Company Warrants outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time will cease to be, and will have no rights as, shareholders or
rightsholders of the Company or the Surviving Corporation, other than (i) in
the case of Company Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock (other than
Dissenting Shares), and Company Options and Company Warrants, the rights to
receive the applicable portion of the Closing Payment Amount; (ii) in the case
of Dissenting Shares, the rights afforded to the holders thereof under
Sections 1300-1312 of California Law, as applicable, and (iii) rights under
this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement.



(c) _No Liability_. Neither Parent, the Surviving Corporation nor the Company
shall be liable to any holder of Company Common Stock, Company Preferred
Stock, Company Options or Company Warrants for any portion of the Closing
Payment Amount delivered to an appropriate public official pursuant to any
abandoned property, escheat or similar law.



(d) _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall
be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Company Common Stock, Company
Preferred Stock, Company Options or Company Warrants such amounts as it is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the
extent that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as
the case may be, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to such holder in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as
the case may be.



(e) _Lost Instrument or Certificate Procedure_. If a Certificate
or Derivative Instrument held by a Participating Rights Holder has been lost,
destroyed or mutilated, in lieu of



 

-6- receipt of the original instrument, the Parent will accept from such
Participating Rights Holder a lost certificate affidavit in a form reasonably
satisfactory to Parent attesting that such loss, destruction or mutilation has
occurred and agreeing to indemnify and hold harmless the Parent for any losses
in connection therewith.



2.3 _Stock Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books
of the Company shall be closed and there shall be no further registration of
transfers of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock thereafter on the
records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of
certificates representing such shares outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares
except as otherwise provided herein or by any applicable laws.



2.4 _Dissenting Shares_.



(a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock that are
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and which are held by
shareholders who shall have not voted in favor of the Merger or consented
thereto in writing and who shall have exercised dissentersÂ’ rights or rights
of appraisal for such shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred
Stock in accordance with California Law, if any, and who, as of the Effective
Time, have not effectively withdrawn or lost such dissentersÂ’ rights
(collectively, the " _Dissenting Shares_ "), shall not be converted into or
represent the right to receive any portion of the amounts to be paid pursuant
to Section 2.1, but the holders thereof shall only be entitled to such rights
as are granted by California Law, if any. All Dissenting Shares held by
shareholders who shall have failed to perfect or who effectively shall have
withdrawn or lost their dissentersÂ’ rights shall thereupon be deemed to have
been converted into and to have become exchangeable for, as of the later of
the Effective Time or the occurrence of such event, the right to receive an
appropriate portion of the amounts to be paid pursuant to Section 2.1, without
any interest thereon, upon surrender, in the manner provided in Section 2.2,
of the Certificates that formerly evidenced such shares.



(b) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any demands for fair
value of shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock received
by the Company, withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments served
pursuant to California Law, if any, and received by the Company, and (ii) the
opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands
for fair value under California Law, if any. The Company shall not, except
with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to any
demands for the fair value of shares of Company Common Stock or Company
Preferred Stock or settle or offer to settle any such demands other than by
operation of law or pursuant to a final order of a court of competent
jurisdiction.



2.5 _Shareholder Representative_.



(a) _Appointment of Shareholder Representative_. By virtue of the adoption of
this Agreement and the approval of the Merger by the Company Shareholders,
each Participating Rights Holder (regardless of whether or not such
Participating Rights Holder votes in favor of the adoption of the Agreement
and the approval of the Merger, whether at a meeting or by written consent in
lieu thereof) shall be deemed to have appointed, effective from and after the
Effective Time of the Merger, David Clapper and Edward Unkart (each a " _Joint
Representative_ ") to act jointly as the Shareholder Representative under this
Agreement in accordance with the terms of this Section 2.5 and the Escrow
Agreement. For clarity, each Joint Representative,



 

-7- acting jointly, shall be deemed the Shareholder Representative, and all
actions required or permitted to be approved by the Shareholder
Representative shall be deemed approved when approved by both Joint
Representatives. If either David Clapper or Edward Unkart resigns, is removed
or is no longer able to perform duties as a Joint Representative, the
remaining Joint Representative shall continue as a sole Shareholder
Representative, with the authority to act alone and to exercise all powers of
the Shareholder Representative without the approval or joint action of another
person. In the event that both David Clapper and Edward Unkart have resigned,
are removed or are no longer able to perform duties as Joint Representative or
as sole Shareholder Representative, as the case may be, a successor
Shareholder Representative shall be selected from the following list, in the
order specified, to serve as the sole Shareholder Representative, with power
to act alone as the Shareholder Representative: (1) Michael Kaplan, (2)
Barclay Phillips and (3) Ross Jaffee. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement: (i) unless removed,
with the consent of the next enumerated successor named in the foregoing list,
an outgoing sole Shareholder Representative may designate a successor
Shareholder Representative different than such enumerated successor; (ii) if
no enumerated successors remain in the foregoing list, an outgoing sole
Shareholder Representative, unless removed, may designate a successor without
the consent of any other person or Participating Rights Holder; provided,
such outgoing Shareholder Representative shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to provide notice of the name and address of such successor to the
Participating Rights Holders representing at least three-fourths of
the Escrowed Funds then in possession of the Escrow Agent. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, or anything else to the contrary in the Agreement or the Escrow
Agreement, the Participating Rights Holders entitled to a majority in amount
of the Escrowed Funds then in the possession of the Escrow Agent may by
written action remove a Joint Representative or sole Shareholder
Representative or appoint a new Shareholder Representative, whether or not
named above, or may change the order of succession specified above. Any
person appointed to replace a former Joint Representative or sole Shareholder
Representative shall execute a statement agreeing to perform the duties set
forth in this Section 2.5 and such appointment shall become effective
upon delivery of such statement to the Parent and the Surviving Corporation.



(b) _Authority After the Effective Time_. From and after the Effective Time,
the Shareholder Representative shall be authorized to:



(i) take all actions required by, and exercise all rights granted to, the
Shareholder Representative in this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement; 



(ii) receive all notices or other documents given or to be given to the
Shareholder Representative by Parent pursuant to this Agreement or the Escrow
Agreement;



(iii) negotiate, undertake, compromise, defend, resolve and settle any suit,
proceeding or dispute under this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement; 



(iv) execute and deliver all agreements, certificates and documents required
by the Shareholder Representative in connection with any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including executing and delivering the Escrow
Agreement);



(v) engage special counsel, accountants and other advisors and incur such
other expenses in connection with any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement;



 

-8- (vi) apply the Representative Reimbursement Amount to the payment of (or
reimbursement of the Shareholder Representative for) expenses and liabilities
which the Shareholder Representative may incur pursuant to this Section 2.5;
and



(vii) take such other action as is necessary on behalf of the Participating
Rights Holders as is necessary in connection with this Agreement, the
Escrow Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including:



(A) taking any actions required or permitted under the Escrow Agreement; and



(B) all such other matters as the Shareholder Representative may deem
necessary or appropriate to carry out the intents and purposes of this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement.



(c) _Reimbursement of Expenses_. The Shareholder Representative shall
be entitled to receive reimbursement from any Representative Reimbursement
Amounts retained on behalf of the Shareholder Representative and then,
immediately prior to its distribution to the Participating Rights Holders,
against the consideration held as Escrowed Funds pursuant to the Escrow
Agreement, for any and all expenses, charges and liabilities, including
reasonable attorneysÂ’ fees, incurred by the Shareholder Representative in the
performance or discharge of its rights and obligations under this Agreement
(the " _SR Expenses_ ").



(d) _Release from Liability; Indemnification; Authority of Shareholder
Representative_. By virtue of the adoption of this Agreement and the approval
of the Merger by the Company Shareholders, each Participating Rights Holder
shall be deemed to hereby release the Shareholder Representative from, and
each Participating Rights Holder shall be deemed to have agreed to indemnify
the Shareholder Representative against, liability for any action taken or not
taken by him, her or it in his, her or its capacity as such agent, except for
the liability of the Shareholder Representative to a Participating Rights
Holder for loss which such holder may suffer from fraud committed by the
Shareholder Representative in carrying out his, her or its duties hereunder.
By virtue of the adoption of this Agreement and the approval of the Merger by
the Company Shareholders, each Participating Rights Holder (regardless of
whether or not such Participating Rights Holder votes in favor of
the adoption of the Agreement and the approval of the Merger, whether at a
meeting or by written consent in lieu thereof) shall be deemed to have
appointed, as of the Agreement Date, the Shareholder Representative as his,
her or its true and lawful agent and attorney-in-fact to enter into any
agreement in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
to exercise all or any of the powers, authority and discretion conferred on
him under any such agreement, to give and receive notices on their behalf and
to be his, her or its exclusive representative with respect to any matter,
suit, claim, action or proceeding arising with respect to any transaction
contemplated by any such agreement, including, without limitation,
the defense, settlement or compromise of any claim, action or proceeding for
which Parent or the Surviving Corporation may be entitled to indemnification.
All actions, decisions and instructions of the Shareholder Representative
shall be conclusive and binding upon all of the Participating Rights Holders.



(e)  _Acceptance_. By virtue of his approval and execution of this Agreement,
the Shareholder Representative hereby agrees to act as, and to undertake the
duties and responsibilities of, the Shareholder Representative as set forth in
this Section 2.5.

any outstanding Indebtedness or any instrument relating thereto, nor is there
any event which, with the passage of time or giving of notice, or both, would

copies of all instruments (including all amendments, supplements, waivers and
consents) relating to any Indebtedness of the Company or its Subsidiaries have
been furnished to the Parent or its counsel.

the Company or its Subsidiaries, their use in connection with the CompanyÂ’s
business of any information or techniques allegedly proprietary to any of
their former employers, or their obligations under any agreements with prior
employers. The Company has not received any communication from any third party
that could reasonably lead the Company to believe that any such action, suit,
proceeding or investigation is forthcoming. The Company and its Subsidiaries
are not a party or subject to the provisions of any order, writ, injunction,
judgment or decree of any court or government agency or instrumentality. There
is no action, suit, or proceeding by the Company or any of its

intends to initiate or is investigating whether to initiate.



3.9 _Intellectual Property_.



(a) Section 3.9(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a complete
and accurate list of (i) all registered Intellectual Property owned,
licensed or used by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, all applications
therefor, and all written licenses and assignments (excluding assignments of
patent applications by inventors to the Company) to which the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries is a party, and (ii) all licenses relating to technology,
know-how and processes which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has
licensed or authorized for use by others.



(b) To the knowledge of the Company, the operation of the Principal Business
of the Company and its Subsidiaries as presently conducted and as the Company
and its Subsidiaries currently propose it be conducted does not interfere
with, conflict with, infringe upon, misappropriate or otherwise violate the
Intellectual Property rights of any third party. Section 3.9(b) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a complete and accurate list of third
party Intellectual Property rights for which the Company or one of its
Subsidiaries has sought a legal opinion regarding any potential interference
with, conflict with infringement upon, misappropriation of or other violation
of such third party Intellectual Property rights by the Company or its
Subsidiaries. After informally applying a similar standard to all other third
party Intellectual Property rights of which the Company has knowledge, the
Company has determined not to seek opinions of counsel regarding such other
third party Intellectual Property.



(c) The Company is the sole owner of the entire right, title and interest in
and to all Company Owned Intellectual Property and has sufficient
title, ownership or interest in and to, or has a valid license or other legal
right under the Company Licensed Intellectual Property used in or necessary to
the operation of its Principal Business as presently conducted and as the
Company currently proposes it be conducted, subject to the terms of the
license agreements governing the Company Licensed Intellectual Property.



(d) Except as set forth in Section 3.9(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
there are no outstanding options, licenses, or agreements of any
kind relating to the Company Owned Intellectual Property and neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has granted any license or other right to
any third party with respect to the Company Licensed Intellectual Property or
Company Owned Intellectual Property. Except as set forth in Section 3.9(d) of
the Company Disclosure Schedule, neither the Company nor its Subsidiaries are
bound by or a party to any options, licenses or agreements of any kind with
respect to the patents, trademarks, service marks, trade names, copyrights,
trade secrets, licenses, information, proprietary rights and processes of any
other person.



 

-13- (e) The Company has no present knowledge from which it could reasonably
conclude that the Company Owned Intellectual Property and any Intellectual
Property licensed to the Company under the Company Licensed Intellectual
Property, are invalid or unenforceable, and the same have not been adjudged
invalid or unenforceable in whole or in part. To the knowledge of the
Company, the Company Owned Intellectual Property and the Company Licensed
Intellectual Property constitute all of the Intellectual Property necessary
for the operation of the Principal Business of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as presently conducted and as the Company and its Subsidiaries
currently propose it be conducted. To the knowledge of the Company, the
Company has complied with all of its obligations of confidentiality in respect
of the claimed trade secrets or proprietary information of others and knows
of no violation of such obligations of confidentiality as are owed to it.



(f) Except as set forth in Section 3.9(f) of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
no claims or actions have been asserted, are pending or, to the knowledge
of the Company, threatened against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (i)
based upon or challenging or seeking to deny or restrict the ownership by or
license rights of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of any of the Company
Owned Intellectual Property or Company Licensed Intellectual Property, (ii)
alleging that any services provided by, processes used by, or products
manufactured or sold by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the
operation of the Principal Business of the Company and its Subsidiaries as
presently conducted and as the Company and its Subsidiaries currently propose
it be conducted, interferes with, conflicts with, infringes upon,
misappropriates or otherwise violates any Intellectual Property right of
any third party, or (iii) alleging that the Company Licensed Intellectual
Property is being licensed or sublicensed in conflict with the terms of any
license or other agreement, and, the Company has not received any
communication from any third party that could reasonably lead the Company to
believe that such a claim or action is forthcoming and, to the knowledge of
the Company, there is no reasonable basis for such a claim or action. The
Company and its Subsidiaries have not received any offers of licenses to
patents that may cover any of the Company Products.



(g) As of the Agreement Date, to the knowledge of the Company, no person is
engaging or has engaged in any activity that infringes or misappropriates the
Company Owned Intellectual Property or Company Licensed Intellectual Property.
Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has ever delivered any
communication to any party (each, a " _Notified Party_ ") that could
reasonably lead any such Notified Party to believe that the Company or its
Subsidiaries allege that any services provided by, processes used by, or
products manufactured or sold by such Notified Party, or the operation of such
Notified PartyÂ’s actual or proposed business, interferes with, conflicts with,
infringes upon, misappropriates or otherwise violates any Company Owned
Intellectual Property or Company Licensed Intellectual Property. The
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by the Company will not
breach, violate or conflict with any instrument or agreement concerning the
Company Owned Intellectual Property, will not cause the forfeiture or
termination or give rise to a right of forfeiture or termination of any of the
Company Owned Intellectual Property or materially impair the right of the
Parent to license or dispose of, or to bring any action for the infringement
of, any material Company Owned Intellectual Property.



 

-14- (h) The Company has made available to the Parent or its counsel correct and
complete copies of all the licenses of the Company Licensed Intellectual
Property, other than licenses of commercial off-the-shelf computer software.
With respect to each such license:



 

(i) such license is valid and binding and in full force and effect and
represents the entire agreement between the respective licensor and
licensee with respect to the subject matter of such license;



(ii) such license will not cease to be valid and binding and in full force
and effect on terms identical in all material respects to those currently in
effect as a result of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, nor will the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement constitute a material breach or default under such license or
otherwise so as to give the licensor or any other person a right to terminate
such license;



(iii) neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has (A) received
any notice of termination or cancellation under such license, (B) received
any notice of breach or default under such license, which breach has not been
cured, or (C) granted to any other third party any rights, adverse or
otherwise, under such license that would constitute a material breach of such
license; and



(iv) neither the Company nor, to the knowledge of the Company, any other party
to such license (including any Subsidiaries of the Company) is in material
breach or default thereof, and, to the knowledge of the Company, no event has
occurred that, with notice or lapse of time, would constitute such a material
breach or default or permit termination, modification or acceleration under
such license.



 

(i) Except as set forth in Section 3.9(i) of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has knowledge that any of its
respective employees, officers, directors, agents or consultants is (i)
subject to confidentiality restrictions in favor of any third person the
breach of which could subject the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any
liability, or (ii) obligated under any contract (including licenses,
covenants or commitments of any nature) or other agreement, or subject to any
judgment, decree or order of any court or administrative agency, that would
interfere with their duties to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, as
applicable, or that would conflict with the Principal Business of the Company
and its Subsidiaries as the Company and its Subsidiaries currently propose it
be conducted. Each employee and consultant to the Company and any of
Subsidiaries of the Company has executed a proprietary information and
inventions agreement in substantially the form of _Exhibit C_ attached hereto.
No current or former employee or officer of or consultant to the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries that has contributed to the development of registered
Company Owned Intellectual Property has excluded works or inventions made
prior to his or her employment or relationship with the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries from his or her assignment of inventions to the Company pursuant
to such employeeÂ’s, officerÂ’s or consultantÂ’s proprietary information and
inventions agreement. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has taken
reasonable steps in accordance with normal industry practice to maintain the
confidentiality of its trade secrets and other confidential Intellectual
Property.



(j) To the knowledge of the Company:



(i) there has been no misappropriation of any material trade secrets or other
material confidential Company Owned Intellectual Property by any person; 



 

-15- (ii) no employee, independent contractor or agent of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries has misappropriated any trade secrets of any other person in the
course of such performance as an employee, independent contractor or agent;
and



(iii) no employee, independent contractor or agent of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries is in material default or breach of any term of
any employment agreement, non-disclosure agreement, assignment of invention
agreement or similar agreement or contract relating in any way to the
protection, ownership, development, use or transfer of Company Owned
Intellectual Property.



(k) To the CompanyÂ’s knowledge, neither the execution nor delivery of this
Agreement, nor the carrying on of the Principal Business by the employees of
and consultants to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, as the case may be,
nor the conduct of Principal Business of the Company and its Subsidiaries as
presently conducted or as the Company and its Subsidiaries currently propose
it be conducted, would, to the knowledge of the Company, conflict with or
result in a breach of the terms, conditions or provisions of, or constitute a
default under, any contract, covenant or instrument under which any of such
employees or consultants is now obligated. Except to the extent already
assigned to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries believes that it is or will be necessary to utilize
any inventions or proprietary information of any of its respective employees
(or people it currently intends to hire) made prior to their employment by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, as the case may be.



3.10 _Compliance with Other Instruments_. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries are in violation or default of any provision of its Articles of
Incorporation (or equivalent document) or bylaws (or equivalent document) or,
to the CompanyÂ’s knowledge, of any provision of any federal or state statute,
rule or regulation applicable to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(excluding Environmental Laws, which are covered by Section 3.15, laws and
regulations relating to Company Products, FDA matters and similar laws and
regulations, which are covered by Section 3.14 and Section 3.21, laws and
regulations relating to Company Benefit Plans, which are covered by Section
3.20, and Tax Law, which is covered by Section 3.24). Neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries are in violation or default of any mortgage,
indenture, contract, agreement, instrument, judgment, order, writ, decree or
contract to which it is a party or by which it is bound that has resulted in
or could reasonably be expected to result in a material financial penalty or
loss to the Company or would otherwise result in a Material Adverse Effect on
the Company. The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the
Company and the consummation of the Merger, (i) will not result in any
violation or default described in the preceding two sentences, (ii) result in
the creation of any mortgage, pledge, lien, charge or encumbrance upon any of
the properties or assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or (iii)
result in the suspension, revocation, impairment, forfeiture, or non-renewal
of any material permit, license, authorization or approval applicable to the
Principal Business, operations or any of the assets or properties of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

indemnification by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to
infringements of proprietary rights (other than indemnification obligations

business), (v) any supply agreements, or (vi) other agreements that are
otherwise material to the Principal Business of the Company.

knowledge of the Company, is considered to be in breach or non-compliance by

the Company Disclosure Schedule, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has received notice of any default or threat thereof with
respect to any such contract, agreement or other arrangement and neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has a reasonable basis for suspecting that
any such default exists or will be forthcoming. Subject to obtaining any
necessary consents by the other party or parties to any such contract,
agreement or other



 

-17- arrangement (as further set forth in Section 3.11(c) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule), no contract, agreement or other arrangement listed in Section 3.11

party thereto, or terminate or lapse by reason of, the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.



(d) For the purposes of Section 3.11(b), all liabilities, agreements,
understandings, instruments, contracts and proposed transactions involving the

that employees, officers or directors of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and members of their immediate families may own stock in

the Company Benefit Plans (the " _Company Participants_ ") (including without

any Parent subsidiary or Affiliate) after the Effective Time to be eligible
for the same benefits in the aggregate as those received by Parent
employees with similar positions and responsibilities, _provided_ , that
nothing in this Section 6.10(a) shall be deemed to require Parent to offer any
particular Company Participants any particular benefit. Each Company
Participant shall, to the extent permitted by law, applicable tax
qualification requirements and the existing terms of the applicable employee
benefit plans, and subject to any applicable break in service or similar rule,
receive credit for all purposes including, without limitation, for
eligibility to participate, matching contributions, and vesting under Parent
employee benefit plans for years of service with the Company (and its
Subsidiaries and predecessors) prior to the Effective Time. If applicable
and permitted by the relevant plan, Parent shall cause any and all pre-

waiting periods and evidence of insurability requirements under any Parent
employee benefit plans to be waived with respect to such Company Participants
and their eligible dependents and shall provide them with credit for any co-
payments, deductibles, and offsets (or similar payments) made during the plan
year including the Effective Time for the purposes of satisfying any
applicable deductible, out-of-pocket, or similar requirements under any Parent

officers specified in _Schedule 6.11_ to execute and deliver a non-competition

ParentÂ’s efforts to borrow an amount of funds at least equal to $250,000,000

termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8, Parent shall not enter

period for any Antitrust Filing filed with respect to the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

or been discovered by Company since the Agreement Date which could reasonably
be expected to result in the Parent being unable to consummate the Merger in
accordance with the terms hereof on or before the Final Termination Date; and



 

-40- (d) Bingham McCutchen LLP will have issued a legal opinion in the form
attached hereto as _Exhibit F_.



ARTICLE 8

TERMINATION.



8.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated and the Merger may be
abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time, notwithstanding
any requisite approval and adoption of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby by the Company Shareholders:



(a) by duly authorized mutual written consent executed by each of Parent,
Merger Sub and the Company;



(b) by the Company if the Parent has not consummated the Debt Financing,
or otherwise obtained cash in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate
amount payable in respect of the Merger at the Closing, on or before the later
of the 30th day following the Agreement Date or the fifth (5th) business
day following the date on which the conditions under Sections 7.1 and
7.2(a)(i), (b)(i), (c), (d), (h) and (j) have been satisfied and the Company
has certified to the Parent that it could, as of such date, deliver each
certificate or other document required from the Company by Sections
7.2(a)(ii), (b)(ii), (f), (g) and (k) (or in the case of Section 7.2(e), that
Wilson Sonsini Goodrich and Rosati could deliver the document required by such
section) (the " _Company Financing Termination Date_ "), _provided_ , that
the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 8.1(b) shall not be
available to the Company if it is not exercised by the Company prior to the
end of the day on the fifth business day following the Financing Termination
Date.



(c) by Parent, if the Parent has not consummated the Debt Financing, or
otherwise obtained cash in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate amount
payable in respect of the Merger at the Closing, on or before the 30th day
following the Agreement Date (the " _Parent Financing Termination Date_ "),
_provided_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section
8.1(b) shall not be available to Parent unless the Debt Financing shall not
have been consummated prior to the Financing Termination Date because Morgan
Stanley shall have elected not to enter into the MS Credit Agreement or
otherwise not consummate the Debt Financing as a result of either of the
events described in clauses (b), (c) (as it relates to the Company only), and
(d) of the last paragraph of page 2 of the MS Commitment Letter or any similar
provision in the MS Credit Agreement.



(d) by Parent, or by the Company, if the Effective Time shall not have
occurred before the 90th day following the Agreement Date (the " _Final
Termination Date_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) in the event that one
or both of Parent and the Company (or any shareholder thereof) are required or
deem it advisable to make an Antitrust Filing under the HSR Act, or under
similar foreign statutes or regulations, or seek any other governmental
approvals or authorizations as may be reasonably necessary in connection with
the closing of the Merger, including any filings or notifications as may be
reasonably necessary that are to be made under California Law, the Final
Termination Date shall be delayed, without further action of the parties,
until the tenth (10th) business day after, with respect to _each_ necessary
approval or authorization, (x) the date on which any applicable waiting
periods thereunder have expired or



 

-41-  been terminated so that such approval or authorization is no longer required
or (y) the date on which the necessary approval and authorization is
received, as applicable and (ii) the right to terminate this Agreement under
this Section 8.1(d) shall not be available to Parent in the event that the
failure of the Effective Time to occur on or before such date arises out of or
is related to ParentÂ’s failure to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement
and the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 8.1(d) shall not
be available to the Company in the event that the failure of the Effective
Time to occur on or before such date arises out of or is related to the
failure by the Company to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement;



(e) automatically if there shall be any law that makes consummation of the
Merger illegal or otherwise prohibited or if any court of
competent jurisdiction or Governmental Authority shall have issued an order,
decree, ruling or taken any other action restraining, enjoining or otherwise
prohibiting the Merger and such order, decree, ruling or other action shall
have become final and non-appealable;



(f) by Parent, by giving written notice to the Company at any time prior to
the Closing in the event that the Company has given Parent any notice pursuant
to Section 6.5 above, if the breach or breaches described in such notice
would, individually or in the aggregate, render any condition to the Merger
contained in Sections 7.1 or 7.2 hereof impossible of being satisfied;



(g) by the Company, by giving written notice to Parent at any time prior to
the Closing in the event that Parent has given the Company any notice pursuant
to Section 6.5 above, if the breach or breaches described in such notice
would, individually or in the aggregate, render any condition to the Merger
contained in Sections 7.1 or 7.3 hereof impossible of being satisfied; or



(h) automatically, in the event that Parent or Company delivers notice of
abandonment of its efforts under the HSR Act in accordance with Section
6.3(c).



8.2 _Effect of Termination_. Except as provided in Section 8.1 hereof, in the
event of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1, this
Agreement shall forthwith become void, there shall be no liability under this
Agreement on the part of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company or any of their
respective officers, directors, or shareholders, and all rights and
obligations of any party hereto shall cease, except for liabilities arising
from a breach of this Agreement prior to such termination. 



ARTICLE 9

INDEMNIFICATION



9.1 _Indemnification by Parent and the Surviving Corporation_.



(a) Subject to the limitations set forth in Section 9.5 hereof, from and after
the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation, jointly and
severally, will indemnify, defend and hold harmless each of the Company
Shareholders, the Participating Rights Holders and each of their respective
directors, officers, employees, representatives and other Affiliates
(each such Indemnified Person a " _Rights Holder Indemnitee_ "), from and
against any and all Damages related to or arising out of or in connection with
any breach by Parent or Merger Sub of any representation, warranty, covenant,
agreement, obligation, or undertaking made by Parent or Merger Sub in this
Agreement (including any schedule or exhibit hereto), or any other agreement,
instrument, certificate or other document delivered by or on behalf of Parent
or Merger Sub in connection with this Agreement, the Merger, or any of the
other transactions contemplated hereby.



 

-42- (b) At all times after the Effective Time, each Company Shareholder and
Participating Rights Holder shall be entitled to rely as third-party
beneficiaries on the mutual promises of Parent and Merger Sub pursuant to this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement.



9.2 _Indemnification of Parent by Resort to Escrow_. Subject to the
limitations set forth in Section 9.5 hereof, from and after the Effective
Time, Parent, the Surviving Corporation, and each of their respective
directors, officers, employees, representatives and other Affiliates (each
such Indemnified Person a " _Parent Indemnitee_ ") shall be entitled to
recover from the Escrowed Funds any and all Damages suffered by such Parent
Indemnitee related to or arising out of or in connection with:



(a) any breach by the Company of any representation, warranty, covenant,
agreement, obligation or undertaking made by such party in or pursuant to
this Agreement, or any other agreement, instrument, certificate or other
document delivered by or on behalf of the Company in connection with this
Agreement, the Merger, or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby,
including but not limited to the Capitalization Certificate;



(b) any actual liability of the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of
its Affiliates for death or injury to person or property related to or arising
out of the complaints described in _Schedule 9.2(b)_ hereto only to the extent
such Damages are not covered by insurance obtained by the Company prior to
the Effective Time (collectively, " _Product Liability Claims_ ");



(c) any payments made by Parent, the Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation
after the Effective Time with respect to any Dissenting Shares to the
extent that such payments exceed the portion of the Closing Payment Amount to
which the holders of such Dissenting Shares would have been entitled had such
Dissenting Shares not been Dissenting Shares, with any claims made pursuant to
this Section 9.2(c) being referred to hereafter as the " _Appraisal Claims_
";



(d) any lawsuit filed before the first anniversary of the Closing Date
asserting claims or allegations that the development, manufacture, marketing,
distribution or sale of the Company Products infringes or violates any patent
rights or patents of third parties (collectively " _Specified Intellectual
Property Claims_ "); or



(e) any amounts which the Parent is required to pay in respect of fees,
expenses and other costs incurred in respect of professional advisors engaged
by the Company in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, or the CompanyÂ’s efforts to consummate an initial public
offering of the Company Common Stock (including any fees and expenses of legal
counsel, outside auditors and financial advisors retained by the Company or
its Board of Directors); but only to the extent that such costs and expenses
exceed the aggregate total of the maximum amounts specified in the Transaction
Cost Certificate (such aggregate total being the " _Aggregate Maximum
Transaction Cost_ " and such claims collectively constituting the "
_Transaction Cost Claims_ ").



  

-43- 9.3 _Third-Party Claims_.



(a) In the event that any Rights Holder Indemnitee desires to make a claim
against an Indemnifying Party (which term shall be deemed to include all
Indemnifying Parties if more than one) or in the event that any Parent
Indemnitee desires to make a claim against the Escrowed Funds in connection
with any third-party litigation, arbitration, action, suit, proceeding,
claim or demand at any time instituted against or made upon it for which it
may seek indemnification hereunder (a " _Third-Party Claim_ "), the
Indemnified Person will promptly notify the Indemnification Control Person of
such Third-Party Claim and of its claims of indemnification with respect
thereto; _provided_ , that failure to promptly give such notice will not
relieve the Indemnifying Party of its indemnification obligations under this
Section 9.3, except to the extent, if any, that the person or persons
represented by the Indemnification Control Person have actually been
prejudiced thereby.



(b) The Indemnification Control Person will have the right to assume the
defense of the Third-Party Claim with counsel of its choice
reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person by written notice to the
Indemnified Person within twenty (20) days after the Indemnification Control
Person has received notice of the Third-Party Claim; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the Indemnification Control Person must conduct the defense of the
Third-Party Claim actively and diligently thereafter in order to preserve the
rights of the person or persons represented by the Indemnification Control
Person in this regard; and  _provided_ , _further_ , that the Indemnified
Person may retain separate co-counsel at its sole cost and expense and
participate in the defense of the Third-Party Claim.



(c) The Indemnification Control Person will not consent to the entry of any
judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to the Third-Party Claim
without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Person (which consent
will not be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed) unless the judgment
or proposed settlement (i) includes an unconditional release of all liability
of each Indemnified Person with respect to such Third-Party Claim, and (ii)
involves only the payment of money damages that are fully covered by the
Indemnifying Party (or fully covered by amounts paid pursuant to Section 9.4
by distribution of amounts to Parent Indemnitees from Escrowed Funds) and
does not impose an injunction or other equitable relief upon the Indemnified
Person. So long as the Indemnification Control Person has assumed and is
conducting the defense of the Third-Party Claim in accordance with Section
9.3(b) above, the Indemnified Person will not consent to the entry of any
judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to the Third-Party Claim
without the prior written consent of the Indemnification Control Person
(which consent will not be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed).



(d) In the event that the Indemnification Control Person fails to assume the
defense of the Third-Party Claim in accordance with Section 9.3(b) above,
(i) the Indemnified Person may defend against, and consent to the entry of
any judgment or enter in to any settlement with respect to, the Third-Party
Claim in any manner it reasonably may deem appropriate (and the Indemnified
Person need not consult with, or obtain any consent from, the Indemnification
Control Person in connection therewith), and (ii) the Indemnifying Party will
remain responsible (or, as applicable, the Parent Indemnitee may claim and
recover from the Escrowed Funds) for any Damages the Indemnified Person may
suffer as a result of such Third-Party Claim to the extent subject to
indemnification under this Article 9.



 

-44- (e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall
be responsible for the prosecution and defense of any claims relating to the
Intellectual Property of the Company (collectively, the " _Parent-Handled
Claims_ "). Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall pursue in good faith,
through counsel of their selection, the prosecution or defense of all Parent-
Handled Claims until such time, if any, that Parent shall elect not to pursue
indemnification with respect to such Third-Party Claim.



(f) Parent shall, to the extent that Parent and the Surviving Corporation are
entitled to indemnification for Damages pursuant to this Article 9 and it
could reasonably be expected that Parent may recover a substantial portion of
the Damages relating to such Parent-Handled Claim pursuant to this Article 9,
(i) provide the Shareholder Representative with access to appropriate
employees of Parent and the Surviving Corporation for the purpose of
discussing matters relating to Parent-Handled Claims as the Shareholder
Representative may from time to time reasonably request, (ii) permit the
Shareholder Representative, upon its reasonable request, to participate in
the process of any settlement or other resolution of any Parent-Handled Claims
pursuant to this Article 9; and (iii) secure the written consent of the
Shareholder Representative before settling any Parent-Handled Claim (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned).



9.4 _Payment of Claims_. In the event of any bona fide claim for
indemnification hereunder, the Indemnified Person will advise the
Indemnification Control Person in writing, advising the Indemnification
Control person of the amount of the claim and, with reasonable specificity,
the circumstances surrounding the claim. With respect to liquidated claims for
Damages, if within thirty (30) days the Indemnification Control Person has
neither objected nor contested to such claim in writing, the Indemnifying
Party will pay the full amount thereof (or in the case of a claim by an Parent
Indemnitee against the Escrowed Funds, such Parent Indemnitee shall recover
the full amount thereof from the Escrowed Funds), subject to the limitations
set forth in Section 9.5. If the Indemnification Control Person objects to
such claim in writing within such thirty-day period, the objection will be
resolved pursuant to the procedures in the Escrow Agreement. All recoveries
from Escrowed Funds shall be made on a _pro rata_ basis from the amounts that
would otherwise be released from the Escrowed Funds to the Participating
Rights Holders. The parties agree that to the greatest extent possible the
payment of any indemnity hereunder shall be treated as an adjustment to the
Closing Payment Amount paid by Parent hereunder for Tax purposes.
Indemnification obligations of Parent and the Merger Sub shall be satisfied
by the Parent in cash. Except in the case of fraud, resort to indemnification
pursuant to this Article 9 through claims against the Escrowed Funds shall be
the sole remedy of Parent and Merger Sub and any other Parent Indemnitee with
respect to any and all Damages related to or arising out of or in connection
with (i) any breach by Company of any representation, warranty, covenant,
agreement, obligation or undertaking made by the Company in or pursuant
to this Agreement or any other agreement, instrument, certificate or other
document delivered by or on behalf of the Company in connection with this
Agreement, or (ii) any other claim, for indemnification or otherwise, arising
out of or related to the subject matter of this Agreement or any other
agreement, instrument, certificate or other document delivered by or on behalf
of the Company in connection with this Agreement.



9.5 _Limitations of Liability_.



(a) _Deductible_. No Indemnifying Party will be required to indemnify an
Indemnified Person and no claim may be made against the Escrowed Funds
hereunder until such



 

-45- time as the amount of Damages for which (i) all Parent Indemnitees, on the one
hand, or (ii) all Rights Holder Indemnitees, on the other hand, are otherwise
entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Agreement exceeds $500,000 in the
aggregate for all such Damages, and then only to the extent such aggregate
amount exceeds $500,000. No Indemnifying Party will be required to indemnify
any Rights Holder Indemnitee hereunder with respect to any claim for Damages
unless the amount of Damages for which all Rights Holder Indemnitees are
entitled for such claim exceeds $50,000 in the aggregate. No claim may be
made against Escrowed Funds by any Parent Indemnitee unless the amount of
Damages for which all Parent Indemnitees are entitled from such claim exceeds
$50,000 in the aggregate. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Section 9.5, the minimum claim limit and deductible imposed by this Section
9.5(a) shall not apply to any Damages arising out of or in connection with (A)
any breach by the Company of any Special Representations, (B) any Special
Claims, or (C) fraud, nor shall any such Damages be counted against the
foregoing deductible.



(b) _Maximum Recovery_.



(i) The parties specifically agree that, notwithstanding any provision of
this Agreement to the contrary, the maximum aggregate recovery by all Parent
Indemnitees from the Escrowed Funds for indemnification under this Article 9,
except in the case of fraud, will not exceed a maximum amount equal to the
amount of the Initial Escrow Amount originally deposited into escrow pursuant
to the Escrow Agreement. The parties specifically agree that, notwithstanding
any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the maximum recovery of all
Rights Holder Indemnitees from the Parent under this Article 9, except in the
case of fraud, will not exceed a maximum amount equal to the amount of the
Initial Escrow Amount originally deposited into escrow pursuant to the Escrow
Agreement.



(ii) As a further limitation, any claims of Parent Indemnitees against the
Escrowed Funds for indemnification under this Article 9 with respect to
Specified Intellectual Property Claims shall not exceed $10,000,000 in the
aggregate for all such Specified Intellectual Property Claims (the "
_Specified Intellectual Property Claims Cap_ "), and as a further limitation,
shall not exceed $7,000,000 with respect to Specified Intellectual Property
Claims related to any single third party (taken together with all of
its affiliates and related persons and entities) (the " _Specified
Intellectual Property Claims Per Claim Cap_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the Specified Intellectual Property Claims Cap shall be reduced to $7,000,000,
until such time (if ever) before the first anniversary of the Closing Date
that a third party specified on _Schedule 9.2(d)_ hereto files a lawsuit that
results in a Specified Intellectual Property Claim; after such a claim is
filed (if ever), the Specified Intellectual Property Claims Cap shall be
increased to $10,000,000, however, the Specified Intellectual Property Claims
Per Claim Cap will remain at $7,000,000.



 

(iii) As a further limitation, with respect to any Product Liability Claims,
Parent and the Surviving Corporation must use commercially reasonable efforts
to seek reimbursement from applicable insurance policies and first apply
insurance proceeds from applicable insurance policies to any Damages related
to Product Liability Claims; thereafter, once such insurance proceeds, if any,
are exhausted, any Parent Indemnitee may make a claim against the Escrowed
Funds for Damages related to Product Liability Claims; _provided_ , however
that Parent Indemnitees shall not be entitled to recover an amount with
respect to such claims in excess of $5,000,000 in the aggregate (the "
_Product Liability Claims Cap_ "). Notwithstanding the



 

-46- foregoing, unless an insurance carrier has paid the Product Liability Claims
to the extent of insurance coverage limits or confirmed in writing that it
will cover the Known Claims to the extent of insurance coverage limits,
without reservations other than customary limited exclusions that do not
reference specific facts or circumstances that the applicable carrier has
identified as a potential basis for the denial of coverage, after making
claims for indemnification that would exceed the Product Liability Claims Cap,
any Parent Indemnitee may make a further claim against the Escrowed Funds for
Damages related to any Product Liability Claim not defended by an insurance
carrier; _provided_ , however that such claims shall be limited to a portion
of the Escrowed Funds (distinct from and in addition to the Product Liability
Claims Cap portion) not to exceed an additional $5,000,000 in the aggregate,
less any amounts that have been paid by insurance in respect of Product
Liability Claims (the " _Supplemental Product Liability Claims Cap_ "). For
avoidance of doubt, the purpose of the Supplemental Product Liability Claims
Cap portion of the Escrowed Funds is to provide a remedy for the Parent if the
CompanyÂ’s existing insurance carriers determine pursuant to applicable
insurance policies not to cover the Product Liability Claims to the extent of
insurance coverage limits, and it is the intent of the parties that such
Supplemental Product Liability Claims Cap will not be available to Parent if
insurance coverage for Product Liability Claims is available.

 



(c) _Time Limit_. All representations and warranties in this Agreement shall
survive the Closing and shall expire on, and no Indemnifying Party will be
liable for any Damages hereunder and no claim may be made against the Escrowed
Funds with respect to a breach of such representations and warranties unless
a written claim for indemnification is given by the Indemnified Person to the
Indemnification Control Person with respect thereto prior to, the first
anniversary of the Closing Date (the " _Claim Deadline_ "). The right to make
claims for indemnification, shall expire as of the Claim Deadline, except
with respect to claims (i) that have been duly noticed before Claim Deadline
and (ii) for which a reserve from the Escrowed Funds has been duly
established, each of (i) and (ii) in accordance with this Agreement and the
Escrow Agreement, as applicable, _provided_ , that notwithstanding the
foregoing, the right of Parent to make claims for indemnification with respect
to a Product Liability Claim shall survive until the sixtieth (60th) day
following the final resolution, including but not limited to by way of final
settlement agreement of all of the parties or issuance of an order of a court
having jurisdiction over the matter which is final and not subject to further
court proceedings or appeal, of the matter underlying such Product Liability
Claim.



(d) _No Liability of Company Shareholders, Participating Rights Holders
or Shareholder Representative_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement and for purposes of clarification, except in the case of fraud,
the liability of the Participating Rights Holders, including indemnification
obligations, under this Agreement shall be limited to the Escrowed Funds;
and, once amounts held pursuant to the Escrow Agreement are released to the
Participating Rights Holders pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement,
Parent, the Surviving Corporation and any Affiliates thereof and any other
Parent Indemnitees shall have no further claim to the amount thereof from the
Participating Rights Holders, except in the case of fraud. Without limiting
the ability of the Parent to recover from the Escrowed Funds in accordance
with this Article 9, and except in the case of fraud, nothing in this
Agreement shall cause the Shareholder Representative or Participating Rights
Holders to become personally liable for any indemnification claim pursuant to
the provisions of this Article 9.



 

-47- 9.6 _Right to Bring Action; No Contribution_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Article 9 or elsewhere in this Agreement to the contrary, only the
Shareholder Representative shall have the right, power and authority to
commence any action, suit or proceeding, including any arbitration proceeding,
by and on behalf of any or all Participating Rights Holders against Parent or
the Surviving Corporation or any other Indemnified Person in connection with
the Agreement and the Escrow Agreement and the transactions contemplated
herebyand thereby, and in no event shall any Participating Rights Holder
himself, herself or itself have the right to commence any action, suit or
proceeding, including any arbitration proceeding, against Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, or any other Indemnified Person in such connection. By
virtue of the adoption of this Agreement and the approval of the Merger by
the Company Shareholders, each Participating Rights Holder (regardless of
whether or not such Participating Rights Holder votes in favor of the adoption
of the Agreement and the approval of the Merger, whether at a meeting or by
written consent in lieu thereof) shall be deemed to have waived, and shall be
deemed to have acknowledged and agreed that such Participating Rights Holder
shall not have and shall not exercise or assert (or attempt to exercise or
assert), any right of contribution, right of indemnity or other right or
remedy against Surviving Corporation in connection with any indemnification
obligation or any other liability to which he may become subject under or
in connection with this Agreement.
