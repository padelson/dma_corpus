this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the Delaware General
Corporation Law, as amended (the " _DGCL_ "), at the Effective Time, Merger
Sub shall be merged with and into the Company and the separate corporate
existence of Merger Sub shall thereupon cease. The Company shall be
the surviving corporation in the Merger (sometimes hereinafter referred to as

shall continue unaffected by the Merger, except as set forth in _Article II_.
The Merger shall have the effects specified in the DGCL, this Agreement and
the Certificate of Merger (as defined in _Section_ __ _ 1.3_).

and Parent, the closing for the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place
at the offices of Cleary Gottlieb Steen and Hamilton LLP, One Liberty Plaza, New
York, New York, 10006 at 8:30 a.m. (New York City time) on the third (3rd)
business day following the day on which the last to be satisfied or waived of
the conditions set forth in _Article VII_ (other than those conditions that by
their nature are to be satisfied at or immediately prior to the Closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions at or immediately
prior to the Closing) shall be satisfied or waived in accordance with this
Agreement; _provided_ , that in the event that the Marketing Period has not
ended at the time of the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth
in _Article VII_ (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at or immediately prior to the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of those conditions at or immediately prior to
the Closing), the Closing shall occur on the earlier of (x) a date during the
Marketing Period specified by Parent in writing on no fewer than three (3)
business days prior written notice to the Company and (y) the second (2nd)
business day following the final day of the Marketing Period, but subject, in
each case, to the satisfaction or waiver of all applicable conditions set
forth in _Article VII_ (other than those conditions that by their nature are
to be satisfied at or immediately prior the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of those conditions at or immediately prior to the
Closing). The date on which the Closing actually occurs is referred to herein
as the " _Closing Date_ ". For purposes of this Agreement, except as
otherwise provided herein, the term " _business day_ " means any day other
than Saturday or Sunday or a day on which commercial banks are authorized or
required by Law (as defined in _Section_ __ _ 5.1(i)_) to be closed in New
York City.

1.3 _Effective Time_. At the Closing, the Company and Parent will cause a
certificate of merger complying with the requirements of the DGCL (the "

Secretary of State of the State of Delaware as provided in Section 251 of the
DGCL and shall make all other filings or recordings required under the DGCL in
connection with the Merger. The Merger shall become effective at the time when

writing and specified in the Certificate of Merger (the " _Effective Time_ ").

4.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, as a result of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any capital stock
of the Company or on the part of the sole stockholder of Merger Sub:

 

(a) _Merger Consideration_. Each share of the Companys common stock, par
value $0.01 per share (each, a " _Share_ "), issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time other than (i) Shares owned by Parent,
Merger Sub or any other direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent
and Shares owned by the Company or any direct or indirect wholly-owned
Subsidiary of the Company, including Shares held in treasury by the Company,
in each case not held on behalf of third parties and (ii) Shares ("
_Dissenting Shares_ ") that are owned by stockholders (" _Dissenting
Stockholders_ ") who are entitled to, and who have timely perfected and not
withdrawn a demand for (or lost their right to), appraisal rights pursuant to
Section 262 of the DGCL (each Share referred to in clause _(i)_ or clause
_(ii)_ of this _Section_ __ _ 4.1(a)_ being an " _Excluded Share_ " and,
collectively, " _Excluded Shares_ ") shall be converted into the right to
receive an amount in cash equal to $145 per Share (the " _Per Share Merger
Consideration_ "), without interest. At the Effective Time, all of the Shares
(other than Excluded Shares) shall

   ##### Table of Contents

   

 

 cease to be outstanding, shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and
each certificate (a " _Certificate_ ") formerly representing any of the Shares
(other than Excluded Shares) and each non-certificated Share represented by
book-entry (a " _Book_ _-Entry Share_") (other than Excluded Shares) shall
thereafter represent only the right to receive the Per Share Merger
Consideration, without interest, and each Certificate formerly representing
Shares and each Book-Entry Share owned by Dissenting Stockholders shall
thereafter only represent the right to receive the payment to which reference
is made in _Section_ __ _ 4.2(f)_.

 

(b) _Treatment of Excluded Shares_. Each Dissenting Share, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, shall cease
to be outstanding, shall be cancelled without payment of any consideration
therefor and shall cease to exist, subject to any rights the holder thereof
may have under _Section_ __ _ 4.2(f)_. Each Share that is an Excluded Share
pursuant to clause _(i)_ of _Section_ __ _ 4.1(a)_ shall remain outstanding
and shall be unaffected by the Merger.

 

(c) _Merger Sub_. At the Effective Time, each share of common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be converted into one share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

 

4.2 _Exchange of Shares_.

 

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to or simultaneously with the Effective Time, Parent
shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with a nationally recognized
financial institution selected by Parent with the Companys prior approval
(such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) (the " _Paying
Agent_ "), in trust for the benefit of the Companys stockholders, a cash
amount in immediately available funds necessary for the Paying Agent to make
the payments contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 4.1(a)_ (such cash being
hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Paying Agent shall
also act as the agent for the Companys stockholders for the purpose of
receiving and holding their Certificates and Book-Entry Shares and shall
obtain no rights or interests in the Shares represented thereby. The Paying
Agent agreement pursuant to which Parent shall appoint the Paying Agent (the "
_Paying Agent Agreement_ ") shall be in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to the Company and Parent. Any interest and other income resulting
from investment of the Exchange Fund by the Paying Agent, such investment to
be made pursuant to and in accordance with the Paying Agent Agreement, shall
become a part of the Exchange Fund, and any amounts in excess of the amounts
payable under _Section_ __ _ 4.1(a)_ shall be promptly returned to the
Surviving Corporation. To the extent that there are any losses with respect to
any such investments, or the Exchange Fund diminishes for any reason below
the level required for the Paying Agent to make prompt cash payment under
_Section_ __ _ 4.1(a)_, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, promptly replace or restore the cash in the Exchange Fund so
as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all times maintained at a level
sufficient for the Paying Agent to make such payments under _Section_ __ _
4.1(a)_. Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to make, and the Paying Agent
shall make, delivery of the aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration out of
the Exchange Fund in accordance with this Agreement. The Exchange Fund shall
not be used for any purpose that is not expressly provided for in this
Agreement.

(b) _Exchange Procedures_.

 

(i) Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any event within one (1)
business day thereafter), the Surviving Corporation shall, or shall cause the
Paying Agent to, mail to each holder of record of a Certificate representing
Shares (other than holders of Excluded Shares) (A) a letter of transmittal in
customary form specifying that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss
and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in _Section_
__ _ 4.2(e)_) to the Paying Agent, such letter of transmittal to be in such
form and have such other provisions as Parent and the Company may reasonably
agree, and (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in  _Section_
__ _ 4.2(e)_) in exchange for the Per Share Merger Consideration. Upon
surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as provided
in _Section_ __ _ 4.2(e)_) to the Paying Agent in accordance with the terms
of such letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such Certificate
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a cash amount in immediately
available funds (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as
provided in _Section_ __ _ 4.2(g)_) equal to (x) the number of Shares
represented by such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as
provided in _Section_ __ _ 4.2(e)_)  _multiplied_ by (y) the Per Share
Merger Consideration, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be
cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due
surrender of the Certificates. In the event of a transfer of ownership of
Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, a check
for any cash to be exchanged upon due surrender of the Certificate may be
issued to such transferee if the Certificate formerly representing
such Shares is presented to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents
reasonably required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that
any applicable stock transfer or similar Taxes have been paid or are not
applicable.

 

(ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any holder of
Book-Entry Shares shall not be required to deliver a Certificate or an
executed letter of transmittal to the Paying Agent to receive the Per Share
Merger Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to this
_Article IV_. In lieu thereof, each holder of record of one or more Book-
Entry Shares whose Shares were converted into the right to receive the Per
Share Merger Consideration shall, upon receipt by the Paying Agent of an
"agents message" in customary form (or such other evidence, if any, as the
Paying Agent may reasonably request), be entitled to receive, and Parent shall
cause the Paying Agent to pay and deliver as promptly as reasonably
practicable after the Effective Time, the Per Share Merger Consideration in
respect of each such Share (after giving effect to any required Tax
withholdings as provided in _Section_ __ _ 4.2(g)_), and the Book-Entry
Shares of such holder shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid
or accrued on any amount payable to a holder of Book-Entry Shares.

 

(c) _Transfers_. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of the Shares that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, any Certificate or Book-Entry Share is presented to the Surviving
Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent for transfer, it shall be cancelled
and exchanged for the cash amount in immediately available funds to which the
holder thereof is entitled pursuant to this _Article IV_.

   ##### Table of Contents

   

 

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains unclaimed by
the Companys stockholders by the first anniversary of the Effective Time
shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation. Any holder of Shares (other
than Excluded Shares) who has not theretofore complied with this _Article IV_
shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of the Per
Share Merger Consideration (after giving effect to any required Tax
withholdings as provided in  _Section_ __ _ 4.2(g)_) upon due surrender of
its Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in
_Section_ __ _ 4.2(e)_) or Book-Entry Shares, without any interest thereon.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Surviving Corporation, Parent, the
Paying Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any former stockholder of
the Company for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant
to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws. For the purposes of
this Agreement, the term " _Person_ " shall mean any individual, corporation
(including not-for-profit), general or limited partnership, limited liability
company, joint venture, estate, trust, association, organization, Governmental
Entity or other entity or group (which term will include a "group" as such
term is defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) of any kind or
nature.

(e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the record owner thereof and, if required by Parent, the posting
by such record owner of a bond in customary amount and upon such terms as may
be reasonably required by Parent as indemnity against any claim that may be
made against it or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Certificate,
the Paying Agent shall deliver, in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate, a check in the amount (after giving effect to any
required Tax withholdings as provided in _Section_ __ _ 4.2(g)_) equal to (i)
the number of Shares represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate _multiplied_ by (ii) the Per Share Merger Consideration (without
any interest thereon).

(f)  _Appraisal Rights_. No Person who has properly perfected a demand for
appraisal rights pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL shall be entitled to
receive the Per Share Merger Consideration with respect to the Shares owned by
such Person unless and until such Person shall have effectively withdrawn or
lost such Persons right to appraisal under the DGCL or a court of competent
jurisdiction has determined that such holder is not entitled to the relief
provided by Section 262 of the DGCL. Each Dissenting Stockholder shall be
entitled to receive only the payment provided by Section 262 of the DGCL with
respect to Shares owned by such Dissenting Stockholder. The Company shall give
Parent (i) prompt notice of any demands for appraisal, withdrawals, attempted
withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to the
DGCL that are received by the Company relating to the rights of appraisal of
the Companys stockholders and (ii) the opportunity to participate in (and
shall consult with Parent with respect to) all negotiations and proceedings
with respect to any such demand for appraisal under the DGCL. The Company
shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment
with respect to any demands for appraisal, settle any such demands, or waive
any failure to timely deliver a written demand for appraisal in accordance
with the DGCL in respect of the Dissenting Shares, or agree to do any of the
foregoing. If any Dissenting Stockholder shall have effectively waived,
withdrawn or lost its rights under Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to any
Dissenting Shares, or if a court of competent jurisdiction has determined
that such holder is not entitled to the relief provided by Section 262 of the
DGCL with respect to any Dissenting Shares, such Dissenting Shares shall
thereupon be treated as though they had been converted into the applicable
Per Share Merger Consideration, without interest, pursuant to this _Article
IV_.

   ##### Table of Contents

   

 

(g) _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, the
Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from any amount otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement
(including the consideration otherwise payable to any holder of Shares,
Company Options, RSUs and PSUs (each as defined in _Section_ __ _ 4.3_))
such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the
making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the " _Code_ ") (or the vesting of any RSU or PSU), or any other applicable
state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted
and withheld by the Company, the Surviving Corporation, Parent, Merger Sub or
the Paying Agent, as the case may be, such deducted and withheld amounts (i)
shall be remitted by the Company, Parent, the Surviving Corporation, Merger
Sub or the Paying Agent, as applicable, to the applicable Governmental Entity,
and (ii) shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made
by the Company, the Surviving Corporation, Parent, Merger Sub or the Paying
Agent, as the case may be.

 

4.3 _Treatment of Stock Plans_.

 

(a) _Company Options_. At the Effective Time, each outstanding option to
purchase Shares granted under the Stock Plans (each, a " _Company Option_ "),
whether vested or unvested, shall, automatically and without any required
action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and converted into only
the right to receive (without interest) an amount in cash (less applicable
withholdings) equal to the product of (i) the excess, if any, of (A) the Per
Share Merger Consideration over (B) the exercise price per share of such
Company Option, and (ii) the number of Shares underlying such Company Option,
which amount shall be paid by Parent or the Surviving Corporation as soon as
reasonably practicable (but in any event within ten (10) business days)
following the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that any such Company
Option with respect to which the exercise price per share of such Company
Option is equal to or greater than the Per Share Merger Consideration shall be
cancelled in exchange for no consideration or payment.

 

(b) _RSUs_. At the Effective Time, (A) any vesting conditions applicable to
each outstanding restricted stock unit or phantom unit granted under the
Stock Plans that is not a PSU (each, an " _RSU_ ") shall, automatically and
without any required action on the part of the holder thereof, accelerate in
full, and (B) each RSU shall, automatically and without any required action
on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and shall only entitle the
holder of such RSU to receive (without interest), an amount in cash (less
applicable withholdings) equal to (x) the number of Shares subject to such

granted under the Stock Plans that is subject to any vesting condition

prior to such event and as so adjusted shall, from and after the date of such
event, be the Per Share Merger Consideration;  _provided_ , _however_ ,
nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 4.4_ shall be construed to permit the Company,
any Subsidiary of the Company or any Person to take any action except to the

limitations on the review undertaken in preparing such opinion as set forth
therein, the Per Share Merger Consideration to be paid to the holders of
Shares (other than Excluded Shares and Shares held by any Affiliate of

the Applicable Date and those filed or furnished by the Company subsequent to

Each of the Company Reports, at the time of its filing or being furnished,

respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange
Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder (the " _Sarbanes_ _-Oxley Act_") applicable to the
Company Reports. As of their respective dates (or, if amended prior to the
date hereof, as of the

 date of such amendment), the Company Reports did not, and any Company
Reports filed with or furnished to the SEC subsequent to the date hereof will
not, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact required to be stated or incorporated by reference therein or
necessary to make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances
in which they were made, not misleading. Except as would not, individually or
in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect, as of the date hereof, (A) there are no outstanding or unresolved
comments in comment letters received from the SEC or its staff, (B)
the Company has not received notice from the SEC that any of the Company
Reports is subject to ongoing review, outstanding comment or outstanding
investigation by the SEC and (C) none of the Subsidiaries of the Company is
subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the
Exchange Act.

(ii) The Company is in compliance in all material respects with
the applicable listing and corporate governance rules and regulations of the
NYSE.

(iii) (A) Each of the consolidated balance sheets included in or incorporated
by reference into the Company Reports filed prior to the date hereof
(including the related notes and schedules) presents fairly, in all material
respects, and, in the case of Company Reports filed after the date hereof,
will present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial
position of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of its date and
(B) each of the Companys consolidated statements of income (loss),
consolidated cash flows and changes in stockholders equity included in or
incorporated by reference into the Company Reports filed prior to the date
hereof (including any related notes and schedules) presents fairly, in all
material respects, and, in the case of Company Reports filed after the date
hereof, will present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
results of its operations, its consolidated cash flows and changes in
stockholders equity, as the case may be, of the Company and its consolidated
Subsidiaries for the periods set forth therein (subject, in the case of
unaudited statements, to notes and normal year-end adjustments), in the case
of each of clause _(A)_ and clause  _(B)_ , in accordance with GAAP applied
on a consistent basis during the periods included (subject, in the case of
unaudited statements, to the absence of notes and normal year-end audit
adjustments that will not be material in amount or effect). The Company has
been and is in material compliance with the applicable provisions of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

 

(iv) The Company has established and maintains, and at all times since the
Applicable Date has maintained, "disclosure controls and procedures" and
"internal control over financial reporting" (in each case as defined pursuant
to Rule 13a-15 and Rule 15d-15 promulgated under the Exchange Act) as
required by Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act. The Companys disclosure
controls and procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that all (i)
material information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports
and other documents that it files or furnishes pursuant to the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in the rules and forms of the SEC; and (ii) such material information is
accumulated and communicated to the Companys management as appropriate to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the
certifications required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act. The Companys independent registered public accountant has issued
(and not subsequently withdrawn or qualified) an attestation report concluding
that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2017. Since December 31, 2017, no

 events, facts or circumstances have occurred such that management would not
be able to complete its assessment of the effectiveness of the Companys
internal control over financial reporting in compliance with the requirements
of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act when next due and for the fiscal year
ending December 31, 2018, and conclude, after such assessment, that such
system was effective and did not identify (i) any material weaknesses in its
internal controls over financial reporting and (ii) any allegation of fraud
that involves management of the Company or any other employees of the Company
and its Subsidiaries who have a significant role in the Companys internal
controls over financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures. Since
January 1, 2016, the principal executive officer and principal financial
officer of the Company have made all certifications required by the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act. Neither the Company nor its principal executive officer or
principal financial officer has received notice from any Governmental
Entity challenging or questioning the accuracy, completeness, form or manner
of filing of such certifications.

(v) Since the Applicable Date, neither the Company nor, to the Companys
Knowledge, the Companys independent registered public accounting firm has
identified or been made aware of (A) any significant deficiency or material
weakness in the system of internal control over financial reporting utilized
by the Company and its Subsidiaries; or (B) any fraud that involves the
Companys management or other employees who have a role in the preparation of
financial statements or the internal control over financial reporting
utilized by the Company and its Subsidiaries.

than according to, the ordinary course of such businesses. Since December
31, 2017 and through the date of this Agreement, there has not been any
Company Material Adverse Effect or any Effect that, individually or in the
aggregate, has had or would reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect or that, subject to the qualifications set forth in clauses

prevent, materially delay or materially impair the ability of the Company to
consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

(ii) Since June 30, 2018 through the date of this Agreement, the Company
has not taken, or agreed, authorized or committed to take, any action that

Companys Knowledge, threatened against the Company, any of its Subsidiaries
or any of its or their respective assets or properties and (B) neither the

 Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or subject to the
provisions of any judgment, order, writ, injunction, decree or award of any

Subsidiaries which, in the case of each of (A) or (B), either are (1)
reasonably expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect or (2) reasonably likely, individually or in the
aggregate, to prevent, materially delay or materially impair the ability of
the Company to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated

Litigation brought after the date hereof.

(ii) The Company does not have any liabilities or obligations of any nature
(whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise) required by GAAP to be

liabilities and obligations (A) set forth in the Companys consolidated
balance sheet (and the notes thereto) included in the Company Reports filed
prior to the date of this Agreement, (B) incurred in the ordinary course of
business since June 30, 2018, (C) incurred in connection with the Merger or

The term " _Company s Knowledge_" shall mean the actual knowledge of those

(h) _Employee Benefits_.

 

(i) _Section_ __ _ 5.1(h)(i)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth an
accurate and complete list of each material Benefit Plan. For purposes of
this Agreement, " _Benefit Plan_ " means all benefit and compensation plans,
contracts, policies or arrangements (whether or not in writing) covering any
current or former director, officer, employee or individual independent
contractor of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (each, a " _Service
Provider_ ") maintained, sponsored or contributed to by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or under which the Company has or would reasonably expect to
have any liability or obligation, including, but not limited to, "employee
benefit plans" within the meaning of Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (" _ERISA_ "), whether or not subject
to ERISA, and deferred compensation, severance, termination, stock option,
stock purchase, stock appreciation rights, stock-based, incentive,
retention, change in control, retirement, profit sharing, fringe benefit and
welfare plans, contracts, policies or arrangements. True and complete copies
of all Benefit Plans (other than any Benefit Plan mandated by applicable Law)
listed on  _Section_ __ _ 5.1(h)(i)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter have
been made available to Parent. To the extent applicable, with respect to each
material Benefit Plan (other than any Benefit Plan that is maintained
primarily for Service Providers working outside of the United States (each a
" _Non_ _-U.S. Benefit Plan_")), the Company has made available to Parent
true, correct and complete copies of (1) the most recent determination

established, maintained, funded and administered in compliance with its terms
and ERISA, the Code and other applicable Laws, except as would not,
individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect. Each Benefit Plan that is subject to ERISA (an "
_ERISA Plan_ ") that is an "employee pension benefit plan" within the meaning
of Section 3(2) of ERISA intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the
Code has been determined by the IRS to be so qualified, and to the Companys
Knowledge, nothing has occurred that would be reasonably expected to adversely
affect the qualification or tax exemption of any such Benefit Plan. Neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries or, to the Companys Knowledge, any
of their respective directors, officers, employees or agents, has engaged in a
transaction or breach of fiduciary duty with respect to any ERISA Plan that is
reasonably expected to subject the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to a
material tax or penalty imposed by Section 4975 of the Code or Sections 409 or
502(i) of ERISA.

(iii) Each Non-U.S. Benefit Plan has been established, maintained, funded and
administered in compliance with its terms and with the requirements prescribed
by any applicable Laws except as would not, individually or in the aggregate,
be reasonably expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Each
Non-U.S. Benefit Plan required to be registered or that is intended to receive
favorable tax treatment under applicable tax Laws has been registered, and to
the extent applicable, determined to satisfy the requirements of such tax
Laws. Except as required by applicable Law or maintained by a Governmental
Entity, no material Non-U.S. Benefit Plan is a defined benefit pension plan.

(iv) Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has any current or
contingent liability or obligation in respect of a plan that is subject to
Section 412 or 302 of the Code or Title IV of ERISA. With respect to each such
Benefit Plan(A) the Company and its ERISA Affiliates have complied in all
respects with the minimum funding requirements of Sections 412 of the Code and
302 of ERISA except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, be
reasonably expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, and no waiver
from minimum funding standards (as described in Section 412(c) of the Code or
Section 302(c) of ERISA) is in effect, (B) there have been no violations of
the applicable benefits restrictions under Section 436 of the Code except
as would not, individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably expected to
have a Company Material Adverse Effect, (C) no lien on the assets of the
Company or any ERISA Affiliate has arisen under ERISA or Section 430(k) of the
Code, nor does the Company or any ERISA Affiliate expect such lien to arise,
(D) since the Applicable Date, there have been no events described in Sections
4043 or 4062(e) of ERISA, nor does the Company or any ERISA Affiliate expect
such events to occur, except in each case with respect to any such event for
which reporting is waived, and (E) the premiums described in Section 4006 of
ERISA payable to the PBGC under Section 4007 of ERISA have been timely paid
except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably expected
to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. For purposes of this Agreement, "
_ERISA Affiliate_ " means any corporation or trade or business (whether or not
incorporated) that would be treated together with the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries as a "single employer" within the meaning of Section 414 of the
Code.

(v) Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has maintained, established,
participated in or contributed to, or is or has been obligated to contribute
to, or has otherwise incurred any obligation or liability (including any
contingent liability) under, any plan that is a "multiemployer plan" within
the meaning of Section 3(37) of ERISA or a "multiple employer plan" (as
defined in Section 4063 or Section 4063 of ERISA).

(vi) No Benefit Plan provides post-termination or retiree life insurance,
health or other welfare benefits to any person, except as may be required by
Section 4980B of the Code or any similar Law. Except as would not,
individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect, the Company has adequately reserved the right to
amend or terminate each such Benefit Plan to reflect the changes made
since December 31, 2014, and those anticipated to be effective January 1,
2019 under the plans set forth in items 2 and 3 on _Section_ __ _ 5.1(h)(vi)_
of the Company Disclosure Letter.

 

(vii) As of the date hereof, there is no pending or, to the Companys

Material Adverse Effect.

 

(viii) None of the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the
consummation of the Merger will, either alone or in conjunction with

accelerate the time of payment or vesting of, any payment (including
severance, change in control, stay or retention bonus or otherwise) becoming
due under any Benefit Plan (other than severance pay required by any Law);
(B) materially increase any benefits otherwise payable under any Benefit Plan;
or (C) result in the acceleration of the time of funding, payment or vesting
of any such benefits under any Benefit Plan. No payment or benefit that will
be made by the Company or any Subsidiary will be characterized as a parachute
payment within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code, and neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any obligation to gross-up or
indemnify any individual with respect to any Tax.

(ix) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, each arrangement subject
to Section 409A of the Code (if any) has been maintained and administered in
compliance with Section 409A of the Code and all applicable regulatory
guidance (including proposed and final regulations, notices and rulings)
thereunder such that no Taxes or interest will be due at or after the Closing
in respect of such arrangement failing to be in compliance therewith. Neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any obligation to "gross-up" or
otherwise indemnify any individual for the imposition of the excise tax under
Section 409A of the Code.

and its Subsidiaries have not been since the Applicable Date, and are not

not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably expected to have a Company

clauses (G), (L) and (M) of the definition of "Company Material Adverse
Effect", reasonably be expected to prevent, materially delay or materially
impair the ability of the Company to consummate the Merger and the

franchises, variances, exemptions and orders issued or granted by a
Governmental Entity necessary to conduct its business as presently conducted,

 obligation of Parent and Merger Sub and, to Parents knowledge, the other
parties thereto, and there are no conditions precedent or contingencies
(including pursuant to any "market flex" and "securities demand" provisions)
related to the funding of the full amount of the Financing pursuant to the
Commitment Letters, other than as expressly set forth in the Commitment
Letters. Assuming the satisfaction of the conditions contained in _Section_

Financing, together with available cash of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
if any (it being acknowledged that the Company makes no representation or

Commitment Letters. Subject to the satisfaction of the conditions contained
in  _Section_ __ _ 7.1_ and _Section_ __ _ 7.2_ and the completion of the
Marketing Period, Parent has no reason to believe that any of the conditions
to the Financing will not be satisfied or that the full amount of the
Financing will not be available to Parent and Merger Sub on the Closing Date.
Except for Fee Letters with respect to fees and related arrangements with
respect to the Debt Financing, of which Parent has delivered correct and

to Parent and Merger Sub from the Debt Financing, there are no side letters or
other Contracts or arrangements related to the funding of the full amount of
the Financing necessary to fund the Required Payments other than as expressly
set forth in the Commitment Letters and delivered to the Company prior to the

be paid all commitment fees or other fees required to be paid on or prior to
the date hereof in connection with the Financing. For the avoidance of doubt,
the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub under this Agreement are not subject
to any conditions regarding the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to obtain
financing (or obtain financing on terms acceptable to Parent or Merger Sub)
for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(iii) None of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates has

circumstances under which such statements have been made, (B) the financial
statements and other financial information included in such Required
Information are sufficient to permit the Companys independent auditors to
issue customary "comfort" letters with respect to such financial statements
and financial information to the financing sources providing the portion of
the Financing consisting of debt securities (including "negative assurance"

recent financial statements are not more than 135 days old) in order to

day of the Marketing Period, (C) the Companys independent auditors have not
withdrawn, or have not advised the Company or its Subsidiaries in writing that

Companys independent auditors or another independent accounting firm
reasonably acceptable to Parent have delivered an unqualified audit opinion
with respect to such financial statements), and (D) the Company shall not have
publicly announced its intention to or determined that it is required to
restate any financial statements contained in the Required Information (it
being understood that the Required Information will satisfy this clause (D) if
such restatement is completed and the applicable Required Information has been
amended or the Company has announced or determined that no restatement shall
be required, as applicable).

As used in this Agreement, the term " _Marketing Period_ " means the

satisfaction or waiver of such conditions at or immediately prior to the
Closing) and during which: (a) Parent has the Required Information from the
Company that is Compliant; _provided_  that (x) if the Company in good faith
reasonably believes it has provided such Required Information, it may deliver
to Parent a written notice to that effect (stating when it believes it
completed such delivery), in which case the Company shall be deemed to have
provided the Required Information on the date specified in the notice (which

the filing by the Company of such required financial statements in its Annual

(ii) such information and data reasonably requested by Parent that is already
prepared by the Company and its Subsidiaries in the form requested, is in the
possession of the Company and its Subsidiaries and not in the possession of
Parent or its Affiliates and that is necessary for Parent to prepare the pro

Company and its Subsidiaries that is reasonably available and as may be

by this Agreement, including the funding of the Financing and any Alternative

_claim_ " means any (i) right to payment, whether or not such a right is
reduced to judgment, liquidated, unliquidated, fixed, contingent, matured,

and (ii) right to an equitable remedy for breach of performance if such
breach gives rise to a payment, whether or not such right to an equitable
remedy is reduced to judgment, fixed, contingent, matured, unmatured,
disputed, undisputed, secured or unsecured; provided, however, that, for
purposes of any contingent or unmatured claims, the amount of "debt" shall be
deemed the maximum estimated amount of liabilities reasonably likely to result
from such contingent or unmatured claims. 

(f) _Limited Guarantees_. Concurrently with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, Parent has delivered to the Company true, correct and complete

owning 20% or more of the total voting power of any class of equity securities
of the Company or 20% or more of the consolidated total assets or revenues of
the Company and its Subsidiaries or (ii) any direct or indirect acquisition
by any Person resulting in, or proposal or offer, which if consummated would
result in, any Person becoming the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly,
in one or a series of related transactions, of 20% or more of the total
voting power or of any class of equity securities of the Company, or 20% or
more of the consolidated total assets (including equity securities of its
Subsidiaries) or revenues of the Company, in the case of each of clause (i)

" _Excluded Person_ " means any Person from whom the Company or any of its
Representatives has received after the execution of this Agreement and prior

 constitutes a Superior Proposal or is reasonably likely to lead to a
Superior Proposal; _provided_ that (x) any Person shall cease to be an
Excluded Person if, at any time after the Go-Shop Period End Date, the
Acquisition Proposal submitted by such Person is withdrawn or terminated (it
being understood that any amendment, modification or replacement of such
Acquisition Proposal shall not be deemed a withdrawal of such Acquisition
Proposal if the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation
with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that such Acquisition
Proposal, as so amended, modified or replaced, constitutes or is reasonably
likely to lead to a Superior Proposal) and (y) no investment fund or financial
sponsor with whom the Company has executed a confidentiality agreement in
connection with a potential Acquisition Proposal or private investment in the
Company during the period beginning on December 28, 2017 and ending on the

be considered an Excluded Person. For the avoidance of doubt, an Excluded
Person, together with its Affiliates, shall all be deemed the same Excluded
Person.

" _Intervening Event_ " means any event, occurrence, development or state of
facts or circumstances (but specifically excluding any Acquisition Proposal or
Superior Proposal) occurring after the date hereof and that was neither known
to, nor reasonably foreseeable by, the Company Board prior to the date
hereof, but becomes known to the Company Board after the date of this
Agreement.

" _Superior Proposal_ " means a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that
does not arise out of or result from a material violation by the Company of

owner, directly or indirectly, of more than 50% of the total assets (on a
consolidated basis) or more than 50% of the total voting power of the equity
securities of the Company that the Company Board or any duly constituted
committee thereof has determined in its good faith judgment after
consultation with outside legal counsel and its financial advisor (after
taking into account any revisions to the terms of the transaction contemplated
by _Section_ __ _ 6.2_) is reasonably likely to be consummated in accordance
with its terms, taking into account all legal, regulatory and financial
(including as to financing), timing and other aspects of the proposal and
would, if consummated, result in a transaction more favorable to
the Companys stockholders (in their capacities as such) from a financial
point of view than the Merger (after taking into account any revisions to this
Agreement made or proposed by Parent in accordance with  _Section_ __ _
6.2(g)_).

any communication made in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 6.2(h)_, or the
failure by the Company Board or any committee thereof to take a position with
respect to such tender offer or exchange offer, shall not be deemed a Change
of Recommendation if such communication is made or such position is taken
prior to the tenth (10th) business day after the commencement (within the

exchange offer (any action described in clauses _ (A)_ through _(D)_ , a "

with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law, or may terminate
this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.3(b)_ to enter into an
Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to such a Superior Proposal;

__ _ 6.2(d)_ with respect to such Superior Proposal;

(iii) the Company shall have, and shall have caused its financial and legal
advisors to be available, during the Notice Period, for negotiations with
Parent and its Representatives in good faith (to the extent Parent desires to

accordance with _Section_ __ _ 6.2(g)(iii)_), the Company Board shall have
determined in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and
outside legal counsel, that, in the case of a Change of Recommendation in
connection with a Superior Proposal, such Acquisition Proposal remains a
Superior Proposal (including taking into account any adjustments in the terms
of this Agreement proposed by Parent in connection with _Section_ __ _
6.2(g)(iii)_ above) and that failure to take such action would continue to be
inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law (taking
into account any revisions to this Agreement made or proposed in writing by
Parent prior to the end of the latest Notice Period pursuant to clause (iii)
above); and

 

(v) in the event of a termination of this Agreement to enter into an

taking the actions set forth on _Section_ __ _ 6.5(c)(iv)_ of the Parent

contemplated hereby, and each of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges that this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby are not contingent
on Parent or Merger Subs achieving CFIUS Approval.

Governmental Entity, gives the other Party the opportunity to attend
and participate in such meeting or substantive telephone discussion.

the Company shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) afford Parents

the Company shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) furnish promptly to
Parent all information concerning its business, properties and personnel as
may reasonably be requested;  _provided_ , that no investigation pursuant to

, that the foregoing shall not require the Company or its Subsidiaries to
permit any inspection, or to disclose any information, that in the reasonable
judgment of the Company would (a) unreasonably interfere with the Companys
business operations, (b) result in a waiver or otherwise jeopardize the
protection of any applicable privilege (including attorney-client privilege)
or other immunity or protection or (c) contravene any Law applicable to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective businesses or, in any
material respect, any Contract to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries

provide such information and (ii) implement appropriate and mutually agreeable
measures to permit the disclosure of such information in a manner to remove
the basis for the objection. All requests for access or information made

issue any press releases or otherwise make any public announcements or make
any filings with any third party and/or any Governmental Entity (including any
national securities exchange or interdealer quotation service) with respect to
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement without
the prior written consent of, in the case of Merger Sub or Parent, the
Company, and, in the case of the Company, Parent, except as may be required by
Law or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with or rules of any
national securities exchange or interdealer quotation service or by the
request of any Governmental Entity; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Parties
may make disclosures to the extent consistent with prior public disclosures by
the Parties made in accordance with this  _Section_ __ _ 6.8_. For the
avoidance of doubt, this _Section_ __ _ 6.8_ shall not be interpreted to

6.9 _Employee Benefits_.

 

(a) As of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation or one of its
Subsidiaries will continue the employment of the individuals employed by the
Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to Effective Time (the "
_Continuing Employees_ "). Parent agrees that during the one-year period
immediately following the Effective Time (or, if shorter, during a Continuing
Employees period of employment), Parent shall provide, or shall cause to be
provided, to each Continuing Employee (1) base salary or base wages that are
no less than the base salary or base wages provided by the Company and its
Subsidiaries to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective
Time, (2) target annual cash bonus opportunities provided to each Continuing
Employee that are no less than the target annual cash bonus opportunities
provided by the Company and its Subsidiaries to such Continuing Employee
immediately prior to the Effective Time and (3) employee benefits (other than
equity-based benefits, nonqualified pension and deferred compensation
benefits, retiree health and other post-employment welfare benefits and,
solely with respect to Continuing Employees primarily based in the U.S.,
defined benefit pension benefits) that, taken as a whole, are substantially
similar in the aggregate to the employee benefits (other than equity-based
benefits, nonqualified pension and deferred compensation benefits, retiree
health and other post-employment welfare benefits and, solely with respect to
Continuing Employees primarily based in the U.S., nonqualified pension
benefits and defined benefit pension benefits) provided to such Continuing
Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in the immediately preceding sentence, in the event Closing
occurs on or prior to December 31, 2018, with respect to Continuing Employees
primarily based in the U.S. for the period of time between and including
Closing and December 31, 2018, retiree health and other post-employment
welfare benefits shall be deemed included into each reference to "employee
benefits" in clause (3) of the immediately preceding sentence.

 

(b) Parent agrees that for at least the period of time set forth next to the
applicable Benefit Plan on  _Section_ __ _ 6.9(b)_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter, Parent shall provide, or shall cause to be provided, to each
Continuing Employee severance benefits that are no less favorable in the
aggregate than the severance benefits set forth on _Section_ __ _ 6.9(b)_ of
the Company Disclosure Letter with respect to the severance plan(s) in which
such Continuing Employee participated immediately prior to the Closing.

 

(c) For purposes of vesting, determination of benefit level (including,
without limitation, with respect to severance, vacation and sick time credit,
but, unless required by Law with respect to Continuing Employees primarily
based outside of the U.S., excluding benefit accrual or benefit levels under
any defined benefit pension plan) and eligibility to participate under the
employee benefit plans, programs and policies of Parent and its Subsidiaries
providing benefits to any Continuing Employee after the Effective Time
(including the Benefit Plans) (the " _New Plans_ "), each Continuing Employee
shall be credited with his or her years of service with the Company and its
Subsidiaries and their respective predecessors before the Effective Time, to

 the same extent and for the same purpose as such Continuing Employee was
entitled, before the Effective Time, to credit for such service under any
similar Benefit Plan in which such Continuing Employee participated or was
eligible to participate immediately prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ ,
that the foregoing shall not apply to the extent that its application would
result in a duplication of benefits with respect to the same period of
service. In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) cause each Continuing
Employee to be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time,
in any and all New Plans to the extent coverage under such New Plan is
replacing comparable coverage under a Benefit Plan in which such Continuing
Employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time (such plans,
collectively, the " _Old Plans_ "), and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan
providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any
Continuing Employee, cause any evidence of insurability requirements,
all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of
such New Plan to be waived for such Continuing Employee and his or her
covered dependents, to the extent such conditions were inapplicable or waived
under the comparable Old Plan. Parent shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause any eligible expenses incurred by any Continuing Employee and
his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old
Plan ending on the date such Continuing Employees participation in the
corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into account under such New Plan for
purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket
requirements applicable to such Continuing Employee and his or her covered
dependents for the applicable plan year.

(d) Parent hereby acknowledges that a "Change in Control" or other event with
similar import, within the meaning of the Benefit Plans that contain such
terms, will occur upon the Effective Time.

(e) The Company, and the Company Board, shall, to the extent necessary, take
appropriate action, prior to or as of the Effective Time, to approve, for
purposes of Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act, the disposition and
cancellation or deemed disposition and cancellation of Shares, Company
Options, RSUs and PSUs pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement by applicable individuals and to cause such dispositions and/or
cancellations to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange
Act.

(f) The Company and its Subsidiaries shall satisfy in all material respects
all notification, consultation and other processes necessary to effectuate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, which shall include any
required notifications and consultation and other processes with respect to
any works council, economic committee, union or similar body as required to
either (i) obtain an opinion or acknowledgment from any works council,
economic committee, union or similar body or (ii) establish that the Parties
are permitted to effect the Closing without such opinion or
acknowledgment. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the
contrary, nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 6.9_ express or implied, shall limit
or otherwise prevent or restrict the Company or its Subsidiaries from
providing compensation, benefits, and other employment terms and conditions
to Continuing Employees in accordance with the requirements of applicable Law
or Contract with any labor union, works council or other labor organization.

Affiliates to, determine annual bonuses under such Bonus Plan in a manner
consistent with  _Section_ __ _ 6.9(g)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter and

(h) Following the date hereof, Parent and the Company will cooperate
expeditiously and in good faith to establish a retention plan to incentivize
and retain designated Service Providers to remain employed by the Company, it
being understood that Parent will exercise reasonable best efforts to
facilitate the development of such retention plan within (10) business
days following the date hereof and Parent and the Company will cooperate to
begin to communicate with Service Providers designated to participate in such
retention plan promptly thereafter.

 

(i) The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.9_ are solely for the benefit of
the Parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this Agreement, whether express
or implied, is intended to, or shall, (i) constitute the establishment or
adoption of or an amendment to any employee benefit or compensation plan,
program, agreement or arrangement or otherwise be treated as an amendment or
modification of any Benefit Plan, New Plan or other benefit plan, agreement or
arrangement, (ii) limit the right of Parent, the Company or their respective
Subsidiaries to amend, terminate or otherwise modify any Benefit Plan,
New Plan or other benefit plan, agreement or arrangement following the
Effective Time, (iii) create any third-party beneficiary or other right
(including, but not limited to, a right to employment) in any Person,
including any current or former employee of the Company or any Subsidiary of
the Company, any participant in any Benefit Plan, New Plan or other benefit
plan, agreement or arrangement (or any dependent or beneficiary thereof)
or (iv) guarantee employment for any period of time for, or preclude the
ability of Parent, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries to
terminate any Continuing Employee for any reason.

 

6.10 _Expenses_. The Surviving Corporation shall pay all charges and expenses,
including those of the Paying Agent, in connection with the transactions

incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the Party
incurring such expense.

 

6.11 _Financing and Cooperation_.

 

(a) Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall use its reasonable best efforts to
arrange the Financing on the terms and conditions described in the Commitment
Letters (including any "market flex" and/or "securities demand" provisions
applicable thereto) and shall not permit any amendment or modification to be
made to, any replacement of all or any portion of any facilities (or
commitments thereof) described in, or any waiver of any provision or remedy
under, the Commitment Letters, if such amendment, modification, replacement or
waiver (i) reduces the aggregate amount of the Financing available to
Parent (including by changing the amount of fees to be paid or original issue
discount except by operation of the "market flex" and/or "securities demand"
provisions) to an amount below the amount required for the Required
Payments, (ii) imposes new or additional conditions or otherwise expands or
amends or modifies

receipt of any portion of the Financing that is required to fund the Required
Payments or (iii) would or would reasonably be expected to (A) materially
delay or prevent the Closing, (B) make the funding of the Financing (or
satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the Financing) in an amount
required for the Required Payments less likely to occur or (C) adversely
impact the ability of either Parent or Merger Sub, as applicable, to enforce
its rights against other parties to the Commitment Letters or the Definitive
Agreements (as defined below), in any material respect (collectively, the "
_Prohibited Amendments_ "). Subject to the limitations set out in the first
sentence of this _Section_ __ _ 6.11(a)_, either Parent and Merger Sub may
amend, supplement, modify or replace the Commitment Letters as in effect as
of the date of this Agreement to add or replace lenders, lead arrangers,
bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities who had not executed the
Debt Commitment Letter or Preferred Commitment Letters as of the date of this
Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that, no such addition shall relieve the
original Financing Sources of their obligations under the Commitment Letters
prior to the funding of the Financing, except as set forth in the Commitment
Letters. Parent shall promptly deliver to the Company copies of any such
amendment, modification, replacement or waiver. For purposes of this Agreement
(other than with respect to any representations made by either Parent or
Merger Sub), (x) the term " _Financing_ " shall be deemed to include the
financing contemplated by the Commitment Letters as permitted to be amended,
modified or replaced pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.11_ (including
any Alternative Financing (as defined below) and (y) the term " _Commitment
Letters_ " shall be deemed to include the Commitment Letters as may be
permitted to be amended, modified or replaced pursuant to this  _Section_ __
_ 6.11_ and any commitment letters with respect to any Alternative Financing
and any related fee letters.

 

(b) Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall use its reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary, proper or advisable to obtain the proceeds of the Financing
on the terms and conditions described herein and in the applicable Commitment
Letter at or prior to the Closing, including using their reasonable best
efforts to: (i) maintain in effect the Commitment Letters pursuant to their
respective terms (except for amendments not prohibited by _Section_ __ _
6.11(a)_) until the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
the Merger, are consummated, (ii) negotiate and enter into definitive
agreements with respect to the Financing on the terms and conditions
(including any "market flex" and/or "securities demand" provisions applicable
thereto) contained in the Commitment Letters (" _Definitive Agreements_ ") or
on other terms not less favorable to Parent, in the aggregate, than the terms
and conditions (including any "market flex" and/or "securities demand"
provisions applicable thereto) contained in the respective Commitment Letters,
(iii) satisfy on a timely basis (or obtain the waiver of) all conditions to
funding in the Commitment Letters applicable to either Parent or Merger
Sub that are within their control and consummate the Financing at or prior to
the Closing in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Commitment
Letters at or prior to the Closing and otherwise comply with its obligations
thereunder, and (iv) enforce their rights under the Commitment Letters in a
timely and diligent manner in the event of a breach or other failure to fund
the Financing required to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the Merger, on the Closing Date by the Financing
Sources; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall not be required to take
any enforcement action unless all conditions precedent set forth in _Section_
__ _ 7.1_ and  _Section_ __ _ 7.2_ have been satisfied (other than those
conditions that, by their nature, are to be satisfied at or immediately prior
to the Closing, but which are then capable of being satisfied) and the Company
stands ready, willing and able to consummate the Merger and the transactions
contemplated hereby.

(c) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of Parent and
Merger Sub shall give the Company prompt notice: (i) of any breach or default
(or any event or circumstance that, with or without notice, lapse of time or
both, could reasonably be expected to give rise to any breach or default) by
any party to the Commitment Letters or any Definitive Agreement of which they
become aware; (ii) of the receipt of any written notice or other written
communication from any Financing Source with respect to any actual or
threatened breach, default, termination or repudiation by any party to the
Commitment Letters or any Definitive Agreement or any provisions of the
Commitment Letters or any Definitive Agreement that would result in the
Financing not being available or that would or would reasonably be expected
to prevent, delay or impede the Closing; and (iii) if for any reason either
Parent or Merger Sub believes in good faith that there is any material
possibility that they will not be able to obtain all or any portion of the
Financing necessary to fund the Required Payments on the terms, in the
manner, or from the sources contemplated by the Commitment Letters or the
Definitive Agreements. At the written request of the Company, Parent shall
inform the Company in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to
arrange the Debt Financing or Preferred Financing.

(d) In the event any portion of the Debt Financing or Preferred Financing
becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated in the Debt
Commitment Letter or Preferred Commitment Letters, each of Parent and Merger
Sub shall use its reasonable best efforts to, as promptly as
practicable following the occurrence of such event, take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper
or advisable to arrange and obtain alternative financing from the same or
alternative sources (i) on terms and conditions not materially less favorable
to Parent than those contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter or Preferred
Commitment Letters (and with respect to any replacement of the Debt Financing,
with conditions to the funding of such alternative financing not more
onerous, when taken as a whole, than those conditions and terms contained in
the Debt Commitment Letter as of the date of this Agreement) and (ii) in an
amount sufficient (when taken together with the Equity Financing and the
available portion of the Debt Financing and Preferred Financing) to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to pay related fees and
expenses (such alternative financing, the " _Alternative Financing_ ");
_provided_ that, Parent shall have no obligation to pay any fees in excess of
what it was obligated to pay under the original Debt Commitment Letter or
Preferred Commitment Letters (taking into account any "market flex" and/or
"securities demand" provisions applicable thereto) nor obtain Debt Financing
or Preferred Financing on terms materially worse than the terms contained in
the original Debt Commitment Letter or Preferred Commitment
Letters (including any "market flex" and/or "securities demand" provisions
applicable thereto). Parent shall promptly deliver to the Company true and
complete copies of all agreements pursuant to which any such alternative
source shall have committed to provide Parent and Merger Sub with any portion
of the Financing necessary to fund the Required Payments.

(e) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to,
shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to use reasonable best efforts to, and

, _however_ , that in no event shall the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or
any of their respective officers, directors or other representatives, have any
obligation to authorize, adopt or execute any supplemental indenture or other
agreement that would become effective prior to the Closing. Concurrently with

that the Existing Notes Offer Documents shall not contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of

(a) In the event of termination of this Agreement and the abandonment of the

pursuant to which such termination is made and this Agreement shall become
void and of no effect with no liability to any Person on the part of any

_however_ , that notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary,
(i) the provisions set forth in (x) _ Section_ __ _ 6.11(i)_,  _Section_ __
_ 6.15(f)_ and _Section_ __ _ 6.16(b)_ (the provisions set forth in this
clause (x), collectively, the " _Parent Reimbursement Obligations_ "), (y)
this  _Section_ __ _ 8.5_ and (z) _ Article IX_ shall survive the
termination of this Agreement, and (ii) no such termination shall relieve any
Party of any liability or damages to any other Party resulting from any
fraud or any Willful and Material Breach of this Agreement prior to such
termination, in which case the non-breaching party shall be entitled to sue
for damages up to the amount of the Parent Termination Fee;  _provided_ ,
_further_ , that in no event shall a Party be entitled to receive both damages
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 8.5(a)_ and the Company Termination Fee or

condition set forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.1(b)_ shall not have been satisfied
(in the case of this clause (1), only if such condition has not been satisfied
solely as a result of the failure of the waiting period (or any extension
thereof) under the HSR Act to have expired or been terminated) or (2) the
condition set forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.1(c)_ shall not have been satisfied
(in the case of this clause (2) only if such condition has not been satisfied
solely as a result of an Order arising under a U.S. Foreign Investment and
Antitrust Law), (C) the failure of the condition set forth in _Section_ __ _

covenants or agreements under this Agreement and (D) all other conditions set
forth in  _Section_ __ _ 7.1_ and _Section_ __ _ 7.2_ have been satisfied
or waived (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be

such time were capable of being satisfied if the Closing were to occur);

then Parent shall promptly, (x) but in no event later than five (5)
days after the date of such termination, in the case of a termination by the
Company, or (y) prior to or concurrently with such termination, in the case of
a termination by Parent, pay the Company an amount equal to $380,054,760 (the
" _Parent Termination Fee_ "). For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall
Parent be required to pay the Company the Parent Termination Fee on more than
one occasion.

 

(d) In the event this Agreement is terminated by either Parent or the Company
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.2(b)_, then the Company shall be required to
reimburse Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Affiliates for all

in connection with this Agreement, the Merger, the Financing and the other
transactions contemplated herein (including all fees and expenses of financing
sources, counsel, accountants, investment banks, advisors and consultants) in
an amount not to exceed $25,000,000 in the aggregate (the " _Expense
Reimbursement_ "), by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account designated in writing by Parent, which payment shall be made promptly
(but in no event later than five (5) days) following the delivery by Parent
of an invoice, together with reasonable supporting documentation, therefor.
The payment of the Expense Reimbursement shall not relieve the Company of any
subsequent obligation to pay the Company Termination Fee pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 8.5(b)_, but shall reduce on a dollar for dollar basis the
Company Termination Fee if such Company Termination Fee subsequently becomes
due and payable under  _Section_ __ _ 8.5(b)(i)_.

(e) (i) Each of the Parties acknowledges that the agreements contained in
this  _Section_ __ _ 8.5_ are an integral part of the transactions

Company fails to promptly pay the Company Termination Fee or Expense
Reimbursement when due pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.5(b)_ or _Section_ __ _
8.5(d)_, or if Parent fails to promptly pay the Parent Termination Fee or the
Parent Reimbursement Obligations when due pursuant to _Section_ __ _

the amount of the Parent Termination Fee or the Parent Reimbursement
Obligations, or any portion thereof, then the Company shall pay to Parent, or
Parent shall pay to the Company, as the case may be, the reasonable and
documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable and
documented out-of-pocket attorneys fees) of the prevailing Party in
connection with such suit, together with interest on the amount of such
payment from the date such payment was required to be made until the date of
payment at the U.S. prime rate as indicated by J.P. Morgan Chase and Co. on the
date of such payment, in each case in an amount not to exceed $5,000,000 (such
reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs as described in this _Section_

(ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, upon

pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.5(b)_ and, if applicable, the Enforcement Costs

or the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each
of Parent and Merger Sub expressly acknowledges and agrees that: in light of
the difficulty of accurately determining actual damages with respect to the
foregoing, upon any such termination of this Agreement in circumstances in
which Parent has the right to receive the Company Termination Fee pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 8.5(b)_, the payment of the Company Termination Fee pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 8.5(b)_ (and any Enforcement Costs, if applicable), which
constitutes a reasonable estimate of the monetary damages that will be

foregoing, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if
Parent or Merger Sub breaches this Agreement (whether willfully (including a
Willful and Material Breach), intentionally, unintentionally or otherwise) or
fails to perform hereunder (whether willfully (including a Willful and
Material Breach), intentionally, unintentionally or otherwise), then, except
for the right to seek specific performance in accordance with and subject to

remedies of the Company, its Affiliates and their Representatives against any
Parent Related Party for any loss suffered as a result of any breach of any
covenant or agreement in this Agreement or the failure of the Merger or the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated shall be
for either (x) the Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 8.3_ and receive payment of the Parent Termination Fee if and when
payable and, if applicable, the Enforcement Costs described in _Section_ __ _
8.5(e)(i)_, or (y) for the Company to seek to recover monetary damages from
Parent in accordance with the first proviso of _Section_ __ _ 8.5(a)(ii)_, in
an aggregate amount not to exceed the amount of the Parent Termination Fee,
in connection with any termination of this Agreement in a circumstance in
which the Parent Termination Fee is not payable, and upon payment of any such
amount, no Parent Related Party shall have any further liability or
obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the Merger or the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that in no event will the Company be entitled to both the Parent Termination
Fee (or monetary damages) and specific performance of this Agreement to
consummate the Merger. The Company expressly acknowledges and agrees that: (i)
in light of the difficulty of accurately determining actual damages with
respect to the foregoing, upon any such termination of this Agreement, the
payment of the Parent Termination Fee pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.5(c)_ (and
any Enforcement Costs, if applicable), which constitutes a reasonable
estimate of the monetary damages that will be suffered by the Company by
reason of breach or termination of this Agreement shall be in full and
complete satisfaction of any and all monetary damages of the Company arising
out of or related to this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including any breach of this Agreement), the
termination of this Agreement, the failure to consummate the Merger or the

Company, (ii) from Parent or Merger Sub to the extent expressly provided for
in this Agreement and (iii) from the Guarantors under, and solely pursuant to
the terms of, the Limited Guarantees and the Equity Commitment Letters.

or the third party beneficiary rights of the Company to the extent expressly
specified in the Equity Commitment Letters, it is agreed that none of the
Financing Source Related Parties will have any liability to the Company or any
of its Affiliates relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the Financing
or otherwise, whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise, and
neither the Company nor any of its Affiliates will have any rights or claims
against any of the Financing Source Related Parties hereunder or thereunder.
In addition, in no event will any Financing Source Related Party be liable for
consequential, special, exemplary, punitive or indirect damages (including any
loss of profits, business or anticipated savings) or damages of a tortuous
nature.

9.2 _Modification or Amendment_. Subject to the provisions of applicable Law,
at any time prior to the Effective Time, the Parties may modify or amend this
Agreement, solely by a written agreement executed and delivered by duly
authorized officers of the respective Parties; _provided_ , _however_ , that
following receipt of the Requisite Company Vote, there shall be no amendment
to or waiver of the provisions of this Agreement which by Law or in accordance

the holders of Shares without such approval; _provided_ , _further_ , that
any modification, amendment or waiver of _Sections 8.5(e)_ , _8.6_ , _9.2_ ,
_9.5_ , _9.6_ , _9.9_ and _9.12_ , or of any defined term used in any of the

located in the County of New Castle, Delaware, solely in respect of the
interpretation and enforcement of the provisions of (and any claim or cause of
action arising under or relating to) this Agreement and of the documents
referred to in this Agreement, and in respect of the
transactions contemplated hereby, and hereby waive, and agree not to assert,
as a defense in any action, suit or proceeding for the interpretation or
enforcement hereof or of any such document, that it is not subject thereto or

subject matter of such dispute and agree that mailing of process or other
papers in connection with any such action or proceeding in the manner provided

in tort or otherwise, involving the Debt Financing Related Parties or the

the exclusive jurisdiction of any state or federal court sitting in the State
of New York in the Borough of Manhattan and any appellate court thereof, and

proceeding to the exclusive jurisdiction of such court; (ii) not to bring or
permit any of their Affiliates to bring or support anyone else in bringing any
such legal proceeding in any other court; (iii) to waive and hereby waive, to
the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection which any of them may now

inconvenient forum to the maintenance of, any such legal proceeding in any
such court; and (iv) any such legal proceeding will be governed and construed
in accordance with the laws of the State of New York (except as expressly
contemplated by the provisions of the Debt Commitment Letter or Preferred
Commitment Letters). 

(b) EACH PARTY AND ITS AFFILIATES ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY
WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND
DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW ANY RIGHT SUCH
PARTY AND ITS AFFILIATES MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY ACTION

 IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (iii) EACH PARTY AND ITS AFFILIATES MAKES THIS

BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS CONTAINED IN
THIS _SECTION_ __ _ 9.5_.

 

9.6 _Specific Performance_.

 

(a) The Parties agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even
if available, would not be an adequate remedy would occur in the event that
the Parties do not perform the provisions of this Agreement (including any
Party failing to take such actions as are required of it hereunder in order to
consummate this Agreement) in accordance with its specified terms or
otherwise breach such provisions. The Parties acknowledge and agree that (A)
the Parties will be entitled, in addition to any other remedy to which they
are entitled at law or in equity, to an injunction, specific performance and
other equitable relief to prevent breaches (or threatened breaches) of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof; (B) the
provisions of _Section_ __ _ 8.5_ are not intended to and do not adequately
compensate the Company, on the one hand, or Parent and Merger Sub, on the
other hand, for the harm that would result from a breach of this Agreement,
and will not be construed to diminish or otherwise impair in any respect any
Partys right to an injunction, specific performance and other equitable
relief; and (C) the right of specific enforcement is an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and without that right, the
Parties would not have entered into this Agreement. The Parties hereby agree
not to raise any objections to the availability of the equitable remedy of
specific performance to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of
this Agreement by any Party, and to specifically enforce the terms
and provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches
of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and obligations of any Party
under this Agreement. Any Party seeking an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement will not be required to provide any bond or other
security in connection with such injunction or enforcement, and each Party
irrevocably waives any right that it may have to require the obtaining,
furnishing or posting of any such bond or other security. The Parties further
agree that (i) by seeking the remedies provided for in this _Section_ __ _
9.6_, a Party shall not in any respect waive its right to seek any other form
of relief that may be available to a party under this Agreement in the event
that this Agreement has been terminated or in the event that the remedies
provided for in this _Section_ __ _ 9.6_ are not available or otherwise are
not granted, and (ii) nothing set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 9.6_ shall
require any Party to institute any proceeding for (or limit any partys right
to institute any proceeding for) specific performance under this _Section_ __
_ 9.6_ prior or as a condition to exercising any termination right under
_Article VIII_ (and pursuing damages after such termination), nor shall the
commencement of any legal proceeding pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 9.6_ or
anything set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 9.6_ restrict or limit any Partys
right to terminate this Agreement in accordance with the terms of
_Article VIII_ or pursue any other remedies under this Agreement that may be
available then or thereafter.

(b) Notwithstanding  _Section_ __ _ 9.6(a)_, the Parties hereby further
acknowledge and agree that the Company shall be entitled to specific
performance of Parents obligation to cause the Equity Financing to be funded
and to cause Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the Closing in accordance
with _Section_ __ _ 1.2_ if, and only if, (A) all conditions set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 7.1_

 



83

   ##### Table of Contents

   

 

 and _Section_ __ _ 7.2_ (other than those conditions that by their nature
are to be satisfied at or immediately prior to the Closing, but which
conditions at such time are capable of being satisfied if the Closing were to
occur) have been satisfied or have been waived by Parent at the time when the
Closing would be required to occur pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.2_, (B)
Parent and Merger Sub fail to consummate the Closing on the date when the
Closing should have occurred pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.2_, (C) the
Marketing Period has ended and the Debt Financing and Preferred Financing
(and/or, if applicable, the Alternative Financing) has been funded or will be
funded in accordance with the terms thereof at the Closing if the Equity
Financing is funded at the Closing and (D) the Company has irrevocably
confirmed in a written notice to Parent that, if specific performance is
granted and the Equity Financing, Preferred Financing and Debt Financing are
funded, the Company is prepared to consummate the Closing, and Parent and
Merger Sub fail to complete the Closing within three (3) business days after
the delivery of the Companys irrevocable written confirmation. For the
avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, the Company may concurrently pursue both (A) a grant of
specific performance of Parents obligation to cause the Equity Financing to
be funded and to consummate the Closing to the extent permitted by this
_Section_ __ _ 9.6(b)_ and (B) the payment of the Parent Termination Fee,
the Parent Reimbursement Obligations and the Enforcement Costs if any are due
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.5(e)(i)_; _provided_ that under no circumstances
shall the Company be entitled to receive both (A) a grant of
specific performance of Parents obligation to cause the Equity Financing to
be funded and to consummate the Closing and (B) the payment of the Parent
Termination Fee, the Parent Reimbursement Obligations and the Enforcement
Costs if any due pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.5(e)(i)_ or monetary damages.

9.7 _Notices_. All notices, requests, instructions, consents or other
documents to be given hereunder by any Party to the others shall be in writing

prepaid, by facsimile, email or overnight courier:

expressly acknowledged and agreed by Parent and Merger Sub, Parent and the
Company hereby agree that their respective representations, warranties

representations and warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation
among the Parties of risks associated with particular matters regardless of
the knowledge of any of the Parties. Consequently, Persons other than the
Parties may not rely upon the representations and warranties in this Agreement
as characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this
Agreement or as of any other date.

9.11 _Definitions_. Each of the terms set forth in _Annex A_ is defined in
the Section of this Agreement set forth opposite such term.

9.12 _Severability_. The provisions of this Agreement shall be
deemed severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision
shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions
hereof. If any provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof to any
Person or any circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and
equitable provision shall be substituted therefor in order to carry out, so
far as may be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid or
unenforceable provision and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the
application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances shall not be
affected by such invalidity or unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity or
unenforceability affect the validity or enforceability of such provision, or
the application thereof, in any other jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the parties intend that the remedies and limitations thereon
contained in _Section_ __ _ 8.5(e)_ and  _Section_ __ _ 8.6_ be construed
as an integral provision of this Agreement and that such remedies and
limitations shall not be severable in any manner that increases a partys
liability or obligations hereunder or under the Financing or the Limited
Guarantees.

9.13 _Interpretation; Construction_.

 

(a) The table of contents and headings herein are for convenience of reference
only, do not constitute part of this Agreement and shall not be deemed to
limit or otherwise affect any of the provisions hereof. Where a reference in
this Agreement is made to a Section or Exhibit, such reference shall be to a
Section of or Exhibit to this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. Whenever
the words " _include,_ " " _includes_ " or " _including_ " are used in this
Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation."

 

(b) The words " _hereof,_ " " _herein_ " and " _hereunder_ " and words of
similar import, when used in this Agreement, shall refer to this Agreement as
a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement.

(c) The word " _extent_ " and the phrase " _to the extent_ " used in this
Agreement shall mean the degree to which a subject or other thing extends, and
such word or phrase shall not mean simply "if".

 

(d) The Parties have participated jointly in negotiating and drafting this
Agreement. In the event that an ambiguity or a question of intent
or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted
jointly by the Parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise
favoring or disfavoring any Party by virtue of the authorship of any provision
of this Agreement.

 

(e) The rule known as the _ejusdem generis_ rule shall not apply, and,
accordingly, general words introduced by the word "other" shall not be given
a restrictive meaning by reason of the fact that they are preceded by words
indicating a particular class of acts, matters or things.

   ##### Table of Contents

   

 

(f) Each Party has or may have set forth information in its respective
Disclosure Letter in a section thereof that corresponds to the section of
this Agreement to which it relates. The fact that any item of information is
disclosed in a Disclosure Letter to this Agreement shall not be construed to
mean that such information is required to be disclosed by this Agreement.

(g) The definitions contained in this Agreement are applicable to the singular
as well as the plural form of such terms and to the masculine as well as to
the feminine and neuter genders of such terms.

9.14 _Assignment_. This Agreement and the rights, interests and obligations
hereunder shall not be assignable by operation of law or otherwise without the
prior written consent of (x) the Company (in the case of an assignment by
either Parent or Merger Sub) or (y) Parent (in the case of an assignment by
the Company); _provided_ , that (i) ___ Parent and Merger Sub each shall be
permitted to assign all of its rights (but not obligations) under this
Agreement to any of their respective Affiliates without the consent of the
Company unless such assignment would reasonably be expected to prevent,
materially delay or materially impair the consummation of the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby, and (ii) Parent may assign all or
any portion of its rights and obligations pursuant to this Agreement to the
Debt Financing Sources pursuant to the terms of the Debt Commitment Letter for
purposes of creating a security interest herein or otherwise assigning as
collateral in respect of the Debt Financing; _provided_ , _further_ , that
(A) no assignment shall relieve the assigning party of any of its obligations
hereunder and (B) no such assignment shall affect the obligations of any
Person who has committed to provide Equity Financing or Preferred Financing
under the applicable Equity Commitment Letter or Preferred Commitment Letter
or the Guarantors under the Limited Guarantees. Subject to the first sentence
of this  _Section_ __ _ 9.14_, this Agreement shall be binding upon and
shall inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective successors and
permitted assigns. Any purported assignment in violation of this  _Section_
__ _ 9.14_ shall be null and void.
