1.4 _Effective Time_. The purchase and sale of the Assets shall be effective
as of April 1, 2009, at 7:00 a.m. local time at the location of the Assets
(the "Effective Time").

1.5 _1031 Exchange_. Seller reserves the right, at or prior to Closing, to
assign its rights under this Agreement with respect to all or a portion of the
Purchase Price, and that portion of the Assets associated therewith ("1031
Assets"), to a Qualified Intermediary ("QI") (as that term is defined in
Section 1.1031(k)-1(g)(4)(v) of the Treasury Regulations) to accomplish this
Transaction, in whole or in part, in a manner that will comply with the
requirements of a like-kind exchange ("Like-Kind Exchange") pursuant to
Section 1031 of the Code. Buyer reserves the right, at or prior to Closing, to
assign its rights under this Agreement and all or a portion of the 1031
Assets to a QI or an exchange accommodation titleholder (as that term is
defined in the IRS Revenue Procedure 2000-37) ("EAT") to accomplish this
transaction, in whole or in part, in a manner that will comply with
the requirements of a Like-Kind Exchange. If Seller or Buyer so elects,
Seller or Buyer may assign its rights under this Agreement to the applicable
1031 Assets to the QI or to the EAT, as applicable. Each Party hereby (i)
consents to the other Partys assignment of its rights in this Agreement with
respect to the applicable 1031 Assets to a QI or to an EAT, as applicable,
(ii) if such an assignment is made by Seller, Buyer agrees to pay all or a
portion of the Purchase Price into the qualified trust account at Closing as
directed in writing by Seller, (iii) if such an assignment is made by Buyer to
an EAT, Seller agrees to transfer the applicable 1031 Assets to the EAT at
Closing as directed in writing by Buyer and (iv) if such an assignment is
made by Buyer to a QI, Seller agrees to accept payment of all or a portion of
the Purchase Price from the QI. Each Party agrees to take all actions
reasonably required of it, including, but not limited to, executing and
delivering documents, to permit the other Party to effect the exchange
described in this Section. The Parties acknowledge and agree that a whole or
partial assignment of this Agreement to a QI or to an EAT, as
applicable, shall not release either Party from any of its respective
liabilities and obligations to the other Party or expand any liabilities or
obligations of the other Party under this



 

3  Agreement. Neither Party represents to the other that any particular tax
treatment will be given to the other Party as a result of the Like-Kind
Exchange. Neither Party shall be obligated to pay any additional costs or
incur any additional obligations under this Agreement if such costs are the
result of the other Partys Like-Kind Exchange, and each Party shall hold
harmless and indemnify the other Party from and against all Losses, if any,
resulting from such a Like-Kind Exchange.

ARTICLE 2

PURCHASE PRICE

2.1 _Purchase Price_. The purchase price for the Assets shall be $210,000,000
(the "Purchase Price"). At Closing, Buyer shall pay Seller the Purchase Price,
as adjusted pursuant to Section 2.4.

2.2 _Deposit_. Contemporaneously with the execution of this Agreement, the
Parties and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (the "Escrow Agent") have entered into
an escrow agreement (the "Escrow Agreement"), attached hereto as _Exhibit K_ ,
pursuant to which Buyer has deposited in cash $21,000,000 (the "Deposit") in
an escrow account with Escrow Agent (the "Escrow Account"). Under the terms
of the Escrow Agreement, the Escrow Agent shall distribute the Deposit as set
forth in Articles 11 and 12.

2.3 _Allocation of the Purchase Price._ Buyer and Seller have allocated the
Purchase Price among the Assets as set forth on _Exhibit B_. The value so
allocated to a particular Asset may be referred to as the "Allocated Value"
for that Asset. The undeveloped locations specifically described on _Exhibit
B_ shall be included in the term "Assets."

2.4 _Adjustments to Purchase Price_. All adjustments to the Purchase Price
shall be made (i) according to the factors described in this Section, (ii) in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as consistently
applied in the oil and gas industry, and (iii) without duplication.

A. _Settlement Statements_. The Purchase Price shall be adjusted at Closing
pursuant to a "Preliminary Settlement Statement" prepared by Seller, submitted
to Buyer on or before five business days prior to Closing, for Buyers comment
and review. The Preliminary Settlement Statement shall set forth the Closing
Amount and all adjustments to the Purchase Price and associated calculations.
The term "Closing Amount" means the Purchase Price, adjusted as provided in
this Section using reasonable estimates as agreed to by the Parties if actual
numbers are not available. If Buyer has any questions or disagreements
regarding the Preliminary Settlement Statement, Buyer may contact Seller at
least two business days prior to the Closing, and in such case Seller and
Buyer shall in good faith attempt to resolve any disagreements, and Seller
shall afford Buyer the opportunity to examine the Preliminary Settlement
Statement and such supporting schedules, analyses, workpapers, including
the audit workpapers and other underlying records or documentation, on which
the Preliminary Settlement Statement is based or from which the Preliminary
Settlement Statement is derived as are reasonably requested by Buyer. If Buyer
and Seller agree on changes to the Closing Amount based on such discussions,
then the Purchase Price shall be paid at Closing based on such changes. If
Buyer and Seller do not agree on changes to the Closing Amount, then the
Purchase Price shall be paid at Closing based on the amounts set forth in the
Preliminary Settlement Statement. After Closing, the Purchase Price shall be
adjusted pursuant to the Final Settlement Statement delivered pursuant to
Section 13.1.



 

4 B. _Property Expenses_. For the purposes of this Agreement, the term "Property
Expenses" shall mean all capital expenses, joint interest billings, lease
operating expenses, Taxes (as defined and apportioned as of the Effective Time
pursuant to Article 9), drilling expenses, workover expenses, geological,
geophysical and any other exploration or development expenditures chargeable
under applicable operating agreements or other agreements consistent with the
standards established by the Council of Petroleum Accountant Societies of
North America that are attributable to the maintenance and operation of the
Assets during the period in question. If an operating or other agreement is
not in place with respect to any Asset for which Seller or its affiliates is
acting as operator, then to compensate Seller for administrative overhead
expenses associated with conducting operations of any such Asset, an
administrative overhead fee of $450.00 per month per operated well that is
flowing and $500.00 per month per operated well that is pumping, shall be
deemed paid by Seller and shall be charged and allocated to such Asset as
"Property Expenses".

C. _Effective Time; Apportionment of Property Expenses and Revenues_. Buyer
and Seller agree that all revenues, costs and expenses (both operating and
capital), including Property Expenses related to the Assets will be
apportioned between Buyer and Seller as of the Effective Time. Accordingly,
(i) Seller shall be entitled to any production revenues or other amounts
realized from and accruing to the Assets before the Effective Time, and shall
be liable for the payment of all costs and expenses, including
Property Expenses, royalties, overriding royalties, lease rental and
maintenance costs and leasehold payments attributable to the Assets before the
Effective Time; and (ii) Buyer shall be entitled to any production revenues or
other amounts realized from and accruing to the Assets at or after the
Effective Time, and shall be liable for the payment of all costs and expenses,
including Property Expenses, royalties, overriding royalties, lease rental and
maintenance costs and leasehold payments attributable to the Assets at or
after the Effective Time.

D. _Upward Adjustments_. The Purchase Price shall be adjusted upward by the
following:

1\. An amount equal to all proceeds (net of royalty and Taxes not otherwise
accounted for hereunder) received and retained by the Buyer from the sale of
all Hydrocarbons produced from or credited to the Assets prior to the
Effective Time;

2\. An amount equal to all direct and actual expenses attributable to the
Assets, including, without limitation, the Property Expenses, incurred and
paid by Seller at or after the Effective Time;

3\. To the extent not covered in the preceding paragraph, an amount equal to
all prepaid expenses attributable to the Assets at or after the
Effective Time that were paid by or on behalf of Seller, including without
limitation, prepaid drilling and/or completion costs and prepaid utility
charges;



 

5 4\. An amount equal to the value (net of applicable Taxes and royalties) of
Sellers share of all Hydrocarbons in storage tanks above the pipeline
interconnect at the Effective Time, to be calculated as follows: The value
shall be the product of (i) the volume in each storage tank (attributable to
Sellers net revenue interest) as of the Effective Time as shown by the
actual gauging reports, multiplied by (ii) the price actually received for
April 2009 production under the applicable marketing contract if the
Hydrocarbons in question had been sold; provided, however, that the
adjustment contemplated by this subsection shall be made only to the extent
that Seller does not receive and retain the proceeds, or portion thereof,
attributable to the pre-Effective Time merchantable Hydrocarbons in the
storage tanks; 

5\. Any amount equal to the value of Additional Interest pursuant to
subsection 4.2 C.

6\. Any other amount agreed to by Buyer and Seller.

E. _Downward Adjustments_. The Purchase Price shall be adjusted downward by
the following:

1\. Proceeds received and retained by Seller (net of applicable Taxes and
royalties) that are attributable to production from the Assets at or after the
Effective Time;

2\. The amount of all direct and actual expenses attributable to the Assets,
including, without limitation, the Property Expenses, that remain unpaid by
Seller, or that have been paid by Buyer, that are attributable to the period
prior to the Effective Time;

3\. An amount equal to adjustments for Title Defects, Environmental Defects,
Casualty Losses and Exclusion Adjustments, and other adjustments as set forth
in this Agreement;

4\. The amount of the Deposit plus interest earned thereon;

 

5\. The amount of suspended funds Buyer assumes responsibility for pursuant to
Section 14.3; and

6\. Any other amount agreed to by Buyer and Seller.

F. _Gas Imbalances_. In addition to the foregoing, the Purchase Price shall be
adjusted downward or upward, as appropriate, by an amount equal to $2.00 per
Mcf for the well and pipeline gas imbalances existing as of the Effective
Time, as further outlined on _Schedule 6.10_. The Purchase Price shall be
adjusted in the Preliminary Settlement Statement with respect to the imbalance
volumes. If there is a dispute concerning the confirmation and adjustment of
the imbalance volumes, the Parties agree to submit such dispute to binding
arbitration pursuant to the provisions of Section 14.7.



 

6 ARTICLE 3

BUYERS INSPECTION

3.1 _Access to the Records_. Prior to Closing and subject to Section 8.3,
Seller will make the Records available to Buyer for inspection, copying, and
review at Sellers offices during normal business hours to permit Buyer to
perform its due diligence review. Subject to the consent and cooperation of
third parties, Seller will assist Buyer in Buyers efforts to obtain, at
Buyers expense, such additional information from such parties as Buyer may
reasonably desire. Buyer may inspect the Records and such additional
information only to the extent it may do so without violating any obligation
of confidence or contractual commitment of Seller to a third party. Nothing in
this Agreement shall be construed to permit Buyer or its representatives to
have access to any records relating to any bids or offers received by Seller
for the sale of the Assets or access to any records protected by the attorney-
client privilege (other than title opinions) or that would otherwise violate
any legal obligation of Seller and all such bids, offers and legally
privileged information shall be the sole property of Seller.

3.2 _Disclaimer_. Except for the representations contained in this Agreement,
Seller makes no representation of any kind as to the Assets (including,
without limitation, the Records or any information contained therein). Buyer
agrees that any conclusions drawn from the Records shall be the result of its
own independent review and judgment.

3.3 _Physical Access to the Leases, Lands and Wells_. Upon reasonable notice
and during reasonable business hours, Seller agrees to grant Buyer physical
access to the Leases, Lands and Wells to allow Buyer to conduct, at Buyers
sole risk and expense, on-site inspections and environmental assessments of
the Leases, Lands and Wells. In connection with any such on-site inspections
and assessments, Buyer agrees not to interfere with the normal operation of
the Leases and Wells and agrees to comply with all operational and safety
requirements of the operators of the Wells. If Buyer or its agents prepare an
environmental assessment of any Leases, Lands or Wells, Buyer agrees to keep
such assessment confidential and to furnish copies thereof to Seller. Such
information shall be held confidential but may be disclosed to Buyer or
Buyers affiliates, attorneys, officers, employees and consultants used in
Buyers evaluation of Sellers properties. Furthermore, Buyers obligations of
confidentiality shall not apply to information (i) required to be disclosed
by legal process, order, regulation, or rule, or (ii) generally available to
the public through no fault of Buyer, or (iii) acquired from third parties not
known by Buyer to have confidentiality obligations to Seller. In connection
with granting such access, Buyer represents that it is adequately insured and
waives, releases and agrees to indemnify Seller, and its respective directors,
officers, shareholders, employees, agents and representatives against all
claims for injury to, or death of, persons or for damage to property arising
as a result of any act or omission committed by Buyer or its employees,
agents, contractors or representatives in conducting Buyers on-site
inspections and environmental assessments of the Leases, Lands and Wells
regardless of any concurrent negligence or strict liability on the part of
Seller or its affiliates and regardless of the form of claim whether at
common law, strict liability, negligence or under any statute or regulation.
This waiver, release and indemnity by Buyer shall survive termination of this
Agreement.

3.4 _Buyer s Agents_. To the extent that Buyer uses agents to conduct its due
diligence activities, either in Sellers offices or on the Lands, Buyer agrees
to (i) make such agents aware of the terms and conditions set forth in this
Article 3 and the confidentiality provisions of Article 8, and (ii) ensure
that such agents agree to be bound by the terms of this Article 3 and the
confidentiality provisions of Article 8. 



 

7 ARTICLE 4

TITLE MATTERS

4.1 _Definitions_

A. _Defensible Title_. The term "Defensible Title" means such title to the
Assets that, subject to and except for Permitted Encumbrances: (i) entitles
Seller to receive not less than the net revenue interest set forth on _Exhibit
B_ for each Well or undeveloped location listed on _Exhibit B_ ("NRI") and,
if the NRI for any Well or undeveloped location is listed as both "BPO" and
"APO," not less than the BPO NRI prior to the applicable payout event, and not
less than the APO NRI after the applicable payout event; (ii) obligates Seller
to bear costs and expenses relating to the maintenance, development,
operation and the production of Hydrocarbons from each Well or undeveloped
location in an amount not greater than the working interest set forth in
_Exhibit B_ ("WI"); (iii) is not subject to reduction by virtue of the
exercise by any third party or automatic effectuation of a reversionary
interest, back-in or similar right except as scheduled in _Exhibit B_ ; (iv)
is free and clear of mortgages, encumbrances, liens, and delinquent taxes;
and (v) defects or conditions that would create an impairment of use or loss
of interest in the affected Asset. If a formation in a Well or undeveloped
location is not listed on _Exhibit B_, then the Allocated Value for such
formation or undeveloped location is zero.

B. _Permitted Encumbrances_. The term "Permitted Encumbrances" shall mean:

1\. lessors royalties, overriding royalties, net profits interests,
production payments, reversionary interests and similar burdens (payable or
in suspense) if the net cumulative effect of such burdens does not operate to
reduce the represented NRI;

2. liens for Taxes, or assessments not yet due and delinquent or, if
delinquent, that are being contested in good faith;

3\. all rights to consent by, required notices to, filings with, or other
actions by federal, state, or local governmental bodies, in connection with
the conveyance of the applicable Asset if the same are customarily obtained
after such conveyance ("Routine Consents");

4\. rights of reassignment upon the surrender or expiration of any Lease that
expires after Closing;

5\. the terms and conditions of all contracts and agreements relating to the
Assets, including, without limitation, exploration agreements, gas
sales contracts, processing agreements, farm-ins, farm-outs, operating
agreements, area of mutual interest agreements, and right-of-way agreements to
the extent such do not decrease the NRI for the affected Asset or increase the
WI for such Asset without a corresponding proportionate increase in the NRI
for such Asset;



 

8 6\. easements, rights-of-way, servitudes, permits, surface leases and other
rights with respect to surface operations, on, over or in respect of any of
the Assets or any restriction on access thereto so long as the same do not
materially interfere with the operation of the affected Asset as has been
conducted in the past and do not materially affect the value thereof;

7\. undetermined or inchoate liens, materialmens, mechanics, operators,
repairmans, contractors or other similar liens, security interests or
charges for liquidated amounts, arising in the ordinary course of business
incidental to construction, maintenance, development, production or operation
of the Assets that are not delinquent and that will be paid in the ordinary
course of business or, if delinquent, that are being contested in good faith;

8. preferential rights to purchase the Assets ("Preferential Rights");

9\. all agreements and obligations set forth on Schedule 6.10 relating to (1)
imbalances with respect to the production, gathering, transportation or
processing of gas, (2) calls or purchase options on oil, gas or other minerals
exercisable at current fair market prices or the posted prices of such
purchaser, or (3) processing rights or commitments;

10\. any encumbrance, title defect or other matter (whether or
not constituting a Title Defect) waived or deemed waived by Buyer; and

11\. rights reserved to or vested in any governmental authority to control or
regulate any of the Wells or other properties included in the Assets and all
applicable laws, rules, regulations and orders of such authorities so long as
the same do not decrease the NRI for the affected Asset or increase the WI for
such Asset without a corresponding proportionate increase in the NRI for such
Asset.

C. _Title Defect_. The term "Title Defect" means any lien, encumbrance,
claim, defect in or objection to real property title, excluding Permitted
Encumbrances, that alone or in combination with other defects renders the
Sellers title to the Asset less than Defensible Title, including, but not
limited to, Sellers inability to provide, to Buyers reasonable satisfaction,
evidence of current payment of proceeds of production from wells listed on
Exhibit B, based on the interests shown thereon. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the following shall not be considered Title Defects:

1\. defects in the early chain of title that would generally be waived by a
prudent purchaser of oil and gas properties in the area, unless Buyer provides
reasonable written evidence that such failure or omission has resulted in
another party claiming title to the relevant Asset;

2\. defects arising out of a lack of survey;

3\. defects arising out of a lack of corporate or other entity authorization
that would generally be waived by a prudent purchaser of oil and gas
properties in the area unless Buyer provides affirmative written evidence that
the action may not have been authorized and may result in another party
claiming title to the Asset;



 

9 4\. defects that have been cured by possession under applicable statutes of
limitation for adverse possession or for prescription; and

5\. defects based on the failure to record Leases issued by any state or
federal governmental body, or any assignments of such Leases, in the real
property, conveyance or other records of the county or parish in which such
property is located.

D. _Title Defect Value_. "Title Defect Value" means the amount by which the
Allocated Value of an Asset has been reduced by a Title Defect. In determining
the Title Defect Value, the Parties intend to include only that portion of
the Asset affected by the Title Defect. The Title Defect Value may not exceed
the Allocated Value of the Asset and shall be determined by the Parties in
good faith taking into account all relevant factors, including without
limitation, the following:

1\. If the Title Defect is a lien or encumbrance on the Asset created by,
through or under Seller, the Title Defect Value shall be an amount sufficient
to discharge such lien or encumbrance notwithstanding the limitation set forth
above.

2\. If the Title Defect is an actual reduction in NRI, an increase in the WI
without a corresponding increase in the NRI or any other matter that does not
fall within the matters described in Subsection 4.1 D.1., then the Buyer will
rerun its economic valuation calculation that resulted in the Allocated Value
for the affected portion of the Assets using the same economic and engineering
criteria except as changed to accommodate the Title Defect to calculate the
impact on the Allocated Value for the affected Asset. This revised
calculation of the Allocated Value will be presented to Seller and Buyer and
Seller will act in good faith to reach mutual agreement as to the diminution
effect of this Title Defect and thus the Title Defect Value. 

3\. If the Title Defect is not effective or does not affect an Asset
throughout the entire productive life of such Asset, such fact shall be taken
into account in determining the Title Defect Value.

4\. The Title Defect Value with respect to any property shall be
determined without duplication of any costs or losses included in another
Title Defect Value thereunder. For example, but without limitation, if a lien
affects more than one property or the curative work with respect to one Title
Defect results (or is reasonably expected to result) in the curing of any
other Title Defect affecting the same or another property, the amount
necessary to discharge such lien or the cost and expense of such curative work
shall be allocated among the properties so affected (in the ratios of the
respective portions of the Purchase Price allocated to such properties) and
the amount so allocated to a property shall be included only once in the Title
Defect Value therefor.



 

10 5\. If a Title Defect affects only a portion of a property (as contrasted with
an undivided interest in the entirety of such property) and a portion of the
Purchase Price has not been allocated specifically to such portion of a
property in the Allocated Value, then for the purposes of computing the Title
Defect Value, the portion of the Purchase Price allocated to such property
shall be further allocated among the portions of such property in the
proportion that the net acreage (or net acre feet, as appropriate) of such
property affected by such Title Defect bears to the net acreage (or net
acre feet, as appropriate) in the entire property. In the event such property
is subject to a unitization agreement, the foregoing allocation shall be made
in a manner which is consistent with the allocation of production or
productive acreage in such unitization agreement.

4.2 _Purchase Price Adjustments for Title Matters_.

A. _Notices of Title Defects_. Buyer shall give Seller a written "Title
Defects Notice" as soon as possible but no later than 5:00 p.m. Dallas,
Texas, time on July 31, 2009 (the "Title Defect Date"). To be effective, each
Title Defect Notice must be in writing and must satisfy the following
conditions precedent: (i) name the affected Asset; (ii) describe each Title
Defect in reasonable detail; (iii) describe the basis for each Title Defect;
(iv) attach Supporting Documentation; (v) state the Allocated Value of the
affected Asset; (vi) state Buyers good faith estimate of the Title Defect
Value; (vii) set forth the computations, upon which Buyers estimate is based;
and (viii) each Title Defect must be equal to or greater than $50,000.00 in
value net to Sellers interest. Buyer will make reasonable efforts to
communicate to Seller Title Defects promptly after they are discovered, but
Buyer shall not be precluded from claiming any Title Defects as long as Buyer
notifies Seller on or prior to the Title Defect Date. 

B. _Downward Defect Adjustments_.

1\. If an Asset is affected by a Title Defect, the Purchase Price will be
reduced as set forth below and elsewhere in this Agreement, unless: (i) Seller
elects to cure and actually does cure the Title Defect prior to Closing to
Buyers reasonable satisfaction; (ii) Buyer agrees to waive the relevant Title
Defect; (iii) Seller elects on or before Closing to cure such Title Defect no
later than 90 days after Closing; (iv) Seller, with Buyers consent, which
Buyer may withhold in its sole discretion, elects on or before Closing to
indemnify Buyer against any Loss (as defined below) attributable to the
relevant Title Defect; or (v) Seller elects on or before Closing to exclude
the affected portion of the Asset from the Transaction and reduce the Purchase
Price accordingly. In the event Seller elects option (v) above as to any
portion of the Assets, Buyer may waive the relevant Title Defect in lieu
thereof. 

2\. The Purchase Price shall be adjusted downward for Title Defects only if
and to the extent that the sum of (i) the aggregate value of all Title
Defects and (ii) the aggregate value of all Environmental Defects exceeds the
Defect Deductible (any reduction in the Purchase Price pursuant to this
Section shall be in conjunction with the reduction in the Purchase Price
in Section 5.2 C. and Buyer shall not be entitled to duplicative reductions
to the Purchase Price under either Section). If the sum of (i) the aggregate
value of all Title Defects and (ii) the aggregate value of all Environmental
Defects does not exceed the Defect Deductible, there shall be no adjustment
to the Purchase Price, and Buyer will be deemed to have (i) accepted title to
the Assets "AS IS WHERE IS," and (ii) waived its right to assert any objection
to title to the Assets.



 

11 3\. If Seller elects to cure the relevant Title Defect post-Closing, the
Parties shall proceed as provided in this Section. If the Title Defect Value
is equal to the Allocated Value of the affected Asset, Seller shall deposit
the assignment of the Asset affected by the Title Defect (the "Affected
Asset") in the Escrow Account and Buyer shall deposit the Allocated Value of
the Affected Asset in the Escrow Account. If the Title Defect Value is less
than the Allocated Value of the affected Asset, Seller shall assign the Asset
to Buyer on the Closing Date, Buyer shall deposit the Title Defect Value in
the Escrow Account, and the Purchase Price payable by Buyer to Seller on the
Closing Date shall be adjusted downward by the Title Defect Value deposited by
Buyer into the Escrow Account. If Seller cures the relevant Title Defect to
Buyers reasonable satisfaction within 90 days after Closing, the Parties
shall instruct the Escrow Agent (i) to deliver to Seller the Allocated Value
of the Affected Asset, adjusted as set forth in Section 2.4 and, if relevant
at that time, Section 13.1, or the Title Defect Value, as applicable, and (ii)
the assignment of the affected Asset if the assignment has been deposited into
the Escrow Account. If Seller does not cure the relevant Title Defect
to Buyers reasonable satisfaction, the Purchase Price shall be adjusted as
set forth in Section 4.2 B.2., and the Parties shall instruct the Escrow Agent
to deliver the Allocated Value or the Defect Value, as applicable, of the
Affected Asset to Buyer and, if the Title Defect Value is equal to the
Allocated Value of the Affected Asset, to return the assignment of the
affected Asset to Seller. Interest accruing on such amount shall be
distributed to each of the Parties in proportion to the amount of the
Allocated Value distributed to such Party.

C. _Upward Defect Adjustments_. If Buyer or Seller discover additional
interests in the Leases, Wells or undeveloped locations that are listed in
_Exhibit A_ and _Exhibit B_ , including any interest that entitles Seller to
receive more than the NRI set forth in _Exhibit B_ or obligates Seller to
bear costs and expenses in an amount less than the WI set forth in _Exhibit B_
without a corresponding reduction in Sellers NRI, the discovering party shall
promptly notify the other Party of such interest (the "Additional Interest").
The Party who discovers the Additional Interest shall give the other Party
written notice of the Additional Interest as soon as possible, but in no event
later than the Title Defect Date. This notice shall be in writing and
shall include (i) a description of each Additional Interest, (ii) the basis
for each Additional Interest, and supporting documentation with respect
thereto, (iii) the Allocated Value of the Lease, Well or undeveloped location
affected by the Additional Interest, and (iv) the value of the Additional
Interest or the amount by which the notifying Party believes the Allocated
Value of the Lease, Well or undeveloped location has been increased by the
Additional Interest and the computations upon which such Partys belief is
based. The value of the Additional Interest shall be determined by the parties
in good faith taking into account all relevant factors. No adjustment to the
Purchase Price shall be made for Additional Interests except to the extent
they exceed $50,000 individually and an amount equal to the Defect Deductible
in the aggregate.

4.3 _Title Matters Dispute Resolution_. In the event the Parties cannot in
good faith resolve a dispute involving title matters, the Parties shall
resolve such dispute pursuant to the terms of this Section. The Parties agree
to submit all disputes concerning title matters regarding (i) the existence
and scope of a Title Defect, (ii) the Title Defect Value of that portion of
the Asset affected by a Title Defect or (iii) the adequacy of Sellers Title
Defect curative materials, to binding arbitration in Dallas, Texas, such
arbitration to be conducted as follows. The arbitration proceeding shall be
submitted to a neutral arbitrator approved by each of the Parties who is an
attorney licensed in Texas with at least 15 years experience in preparing oil
and gas  



 

12  title opinions involving properties in the regional area where the Assets
are located (the "Title Arbitrator"). The arbitration proceeding shall
be conducted by the American Arbitration Association in accordance with its
commercial rules, with discovery to be conducted in accordance with the
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The arbitration shall be governed by Texas
law and shall be held in Dallas, Texas. The Parties shall submit written
materials to the Title Arbitrator within 10 days of the selection of such
arbitrator explaining their position regarding the title dispute. The Title
Arbitrator shall conduct a hearing, if necessary, no later than 30 days after
the selection of such arbitrator, and the Title Arbitrator shall render a
written decision within 15 days of the hearing or, if no hearing is conducted,
not later than 45 days after such arbitrator is selected. At the hearing, the
Parties shall present such evidence and witnesses as they may choose, with or
without counsel. Adherence to formal rules of evidence shall not be required
but the Title Arbitrator shall consider any evidence and testimony that such
arbitrator determines to be relevant, in accordance with procedures that such
arbitrator determines to be appropriate. The final decision shall be binding
on the Parties, final and non-appealable, and may be filed in a court of
competent jurisdiction and may be enforced by any Party as a final judgment
of such court. Each Party shall bear its own costs and expenses of the
arbitration, provided, however, that the costs of employing the Title
Arbitrator shall be borne 50% by the Seller and 50% by the Buyer.

4.4 _No Title Warranty or Representation_. Except for the special warranty of
title by, through and under Seller that will be contained in the Assignment,
Bill of Sale and Conveyance in the form attached as _Exhibit F_ and without
limiting Buyers right to adjust the Purchase Price as provided in this
Article 4, Seller makes no warranty or representation, express or implied,
statutory or otherwise, with respect to Sellers title to any of the Assets
and Buyer hereby acknowledges and agrees that Buyers sole remedy for any
defect of title, including any Title Defect, with respect to any of the
Assets shall be pursuant to the procedures and as set forth in this Article 4.

4.5 _Casualty Loss_. After the Effective Time and prior to Closing, if a
portion of the Assets is destroyed by fire or other casualty, or is taken or
threatened to be taken in condemnation or under the right of eminent domain,
(with such event being a "Casualty Loss"), Buyer shall purchase such Asset at
Closing for the Allocated Value of the Asset reduced by the estimated cost to
repair or replace such Asset (with equipment of similar utility).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, at its sole option, Seller may elect (i) to
designate such Asset as an Excluded Asset so long as the Purchase Price is
reduced by the Allocated Value of such Asset or (ii) to cure such Casualty
Loss. If Seller elects to cure such Casualty Loss, Seller may replace any
personal property that is the subject of a Casualty Loss with equipment of
similar grade and utility and Seller shall be entitled to keep all associated
insurance proceeds, if any. If Seller cures the Casualty Loss to Buyers
reasonable satisfaction, Buyer shall purchase the affected Asset at Closing
for the Allocated Value thereof without any Purchase Price adjustment for such
Casualty Loss. In no event shall the watering out of a well, casing collapse,
sand infiltration, breakage of equipment or other change in the condition of
an Asset through normal depletion constitute a Casualty Loss.

4.6 _Preferential Rights and Required Consents_. To Sellers knowledge, other
than as set forth on _Schedule 4.6_ , there are no Preferential Rights and no
consents to the assignment thereof that are required to be obtained in
connection with the consummation of the Transaction  



 

13  ("Required Consents"). If there are Preferential Rights or Required
Consents, the provisions of this Section shall apply. If either Party
discovers Assets affected by Preferential Rights or Required Consents, Seller
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to give the notices required in
connection with the Preferential Rights in sufficient time prior to Closing to
permit the lapse of the period of time in which to exercise such Preferential
Rights prior to Closing and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain such Required Consents prior to Closing; provided, however, that Seller
shall not be obligated to pay any consideration to, or incur any cost or
expense for the benefit of, the holder of any Preferential Right or Required
Consent in order to obtain the waiver thereof or compliance therewith.

A. _Required Consents_. If a Required Consent has not been obtained as of the
Closing, then (i) the portion of the Assets for which such Required Consent
has not been obtained shall not be conveyed at the Closing, (ii) the Allocated
Value for that Asset shall not be paid to Seller, and (iii) Seller shall use
its reasonable efforts to obtain such Required Consent as promptly as
possible following Closing. If a Required Consent has been obtained as of the
Final Settlement Date, Seller shall convey the affected Asset to Buyer
effective as of the Effective Time and Buyer shall pay Seller the Allocated
Value of the affected Asset, reduced by the amount of any net proceeds from
the affected Asset attributable to the period of time at or after the
Effective Time with Seller retaining such net proceeds attributable to the
period of time at or after the Effective Time until the affected Asset is
assigned, and with Seller bearing all attendant costs in connection therewith,
including Property Expenses, royalties and overriding royalties, lease rental
and maintenance costs and leasehold payments for the affected Asset accruing
during this period of time. If such Required Consent has not been obtained as
of the Final Settlement Date, the affected Asset shall be deemed to be an
Excluded Asset and Seller shall retain such Asset and the Purchase Price shall
be deemed to be reduced by an amount equal to the Allocated Value of the
particular Asset (with such adjustment being an "Exclusion Adjustment"). Buyer
shall reasonably cooperate with Seller in obtaining any Required Consent
including providing assurances of reasonable financial conditions, but Buyer
shall not be required to expend funds or make any other type of financial
commitments a condition of obtaining such consent.

B. _Preferential Rights_.

1\. If any Preferential Right affecting any portion of the Assets is
exercised and consummated prior to the Closing Date, that portion of the
Assets affected by such Preferential Right shall be deemed to be Excluded
Assets and the Purchase Price shall be adjusted downward by an amount equal
to the Allocated Value of such affected Assets without the requirement for
Buyer or Seller to give notice (with such adjustment being an "Exclusion
Adjustment").

2\. If by Closing, the time frame for the exercise of such Preferential Rights
has not expired and Seller has not received notice of an intent not
to exercise or a waiver of the Preferential Right, that portion of the Assets
affected by such Preferential Right shall be handled in the same manner as in
Section 4.6 A. above.

C. _Exclusive Remedy_. The remedies set forth in this Section 4.6 are the
exclusive remedies under this Agreement for Preferential Rights and Required
Consents.



 

14 ARTICLE 5

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

The provisions of this Article apply only to the environmental
matters associated with the Assets as the result of oil and gas operations on
the Lands.

5.1 _Environmental Review_.

A. _Environmental Access_. Prior to the expiration of the Environmental
Examination Period, subject to the restrictions contained in this
Agreement and any required consent or waiver of any third person, Seller
shall (i) permit Buyer and representatives of Buyer and its lenders to have
reasonable access and at reasonable times in the Sellers offices, and in a
manner so as not to interfere unduly with the business operations of Seller,
to Sellers environmental files and records in Sellers possession relating to
the Assets insofar as Seller may do so without waiving any attorney/client
work product or like privilege, and (ii) permit Buyer and the Environmental
Consultant to have reasonable access to the Assets for the purpose of allowing
Buyer and the Environmental Consultant to inspect and/or audit the Assets for
any Environmental Defects (collectively, "Buyers Environmental Review"), all
at Buyers sole risk, cost and expense.

B. _Conduct of Review_. Prior to conducting Buyers Environmental Review,
Buyer shall furnish Seller with a written proposed scope of Buyers
Environmental Review, including a description of the activities to be
conducted and the locations of such activities. No third person, other than
the Environmental Consultant and Buyers employees, may conduct Buyers
Environmental Review. Buyer shall not commence any activity proposed to be
included in Buyers Environmental Review unless and until such activity
(including the location thereof) has been approved in writing by Seller which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; provided, that if
Seller declines to approve a proposed activity, Buyer may elect to exclude
the affected property from the transaction and the Purchase Price will be
adjusted downward accordingly. Seller shall have the right to be present
during any inspection (including Buyers Environmental Review) of the Assets
and shall have the right, at its option and expense, to split samples with
Buyer.

C. _Buyer s Responsibility for Review_. In connection with Buyers
Environmental Review, Buyer agrees that Buyer, the Environmental Consultant
and Buyers employees, agents and contractors shall comply with all laws and
shall exercise due care with respect to the Assets and their
condition, taking into consideration the characteristics of any wastes or
substances found thereon, and in light of all relevant facts and
circumstances. Specifically, but without limitation, when handling solid waste
or hazardous substances, if any, discovered during the inspection of the
Assets, Buyer, the Environmental Consultant and Buyers employees, agents and
contractors shall handle such waste or substances in accordance with all laws.
Any soil or water samples taken by Buyer from the Assets shall become the
sole property and possession of Buyer and will be managed consistent with the
applicable rules and regulations of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
and other applicable governmental authorities. Promptly after completing
Buyers Environmental Review, Buyer shall, at its sole cost and expense,
restore the Assets substantially to their original condition, in accordance
with good engineering practice, if changed due to Buyers Environmental
Review. Failure by Buyer to  



 

15  comply with the requirements of this subsection within a reasonable time
period will entitle (but shall not obligate) Seller to take any action
deemed necessary or appropriate by Seller to correct such failure, all at
Buyers expense. Prior to Closing, Buyer shall maintain and shall cause its
partners, officers, directors, employees, agents, representatives,
contractors, consultants and advisors to maintain all information obtained
pursuant to Buyers Environmental Review strictly confidential and shall not
disclose the same to any third person without the prior written consent of
Seller, except to the extent required by law. Buyer shall provide Sellers
counsel with copies of any reports prepared and analytical test results
received by Buyer or the Environmental Consultant promptly following Buyers
or the Environmental Consultants preparation or receipt of the same. Buyer
does hereby indemnify and hold harmless, release and agree to defend Seller
and its officers, directors, employees and agents from and against any and all
liabilities arising out of any violation by Buyer, the
Environmental Consultant, or Buyers or the Environmental Consultants
officers, directors, employees, agents, representatives, contractors,
consultants and advisors of any Environmental Law, the provisions of this
Section or, in whole or in part, from Buyers or the Environmental
Consultants inspection or testing of the Assets or handling any substances or
samples in connection therewith, regardless of any concurrent negligence or
strict liability on the part of Seller and its officers, directors, employees
and agents and regardless of the form of claim whether at common law, strict
liability, negligence or under any statute or regulation.

5.2 _Environmental Liabilities and Obligations_.

A. _Retained Environmental Liabilities_. Upon Closing, if and to the extent
the sum of (i) the aggregate value of all Environmental Defects and (ii) the
aggregate value of all Title Defects exceeds the Defect Deductible, and
subject to subsection 5.3 C. below, Seller shall retain and pay, perform,
fulfill and discharge all claims, cost, expenses, liabilities and obligations
accruing or relating to and release Buyer from all Losses attributable to and
relating to Environmental Defects for which Seller receives a
timely Environmental Defect Notice (the "Retained Environmental
Liabilities"). The following are conditions precedent to Sellers obligation
to retain liability for Retained Environmental Liabilities: (i) timely receipt
of an Environmental Defect Notice, (ii) verification of the cost to remediate
by the Environmental Consultant and (iii) the aggregate value of all
Environmental Defects plus the aggregate value of all Title Defects must
exceed the Defect Deductible.

B. _Assumed Environmental Liabilities_. If the sum of (i) the aggregate value
of all Environmental Defects and (ii) the aggregate value of all Title
Defects does not exceed the Defect Deductible, upon Closing Buyer shall assume
and pay, perform, fulfill and discharge and release Seller from all Losses
relating to environmental conditions in, on or under the Assets attributable
to the period of time before and after the Effective Time, including without
limitation any and all liability for (i) ground water contamination, (ii)
NORM, (iii) man-made material fibers, or (iv) the obligation to plug and
abandon all of the wells located on the Lands and reclamation of existing well
sites on the Lands (collectively, the "Assumed Environmental Liabilities"). If
Buyer fails to timely deliver an Environmental Defect Notice with respect to
an Asset, Buyer shall be deemed to (i) accept the environmental condition(s)
in, on and under that Asset or the Assets, (ii) have waived its right to claim
an Environmental Defect with respect to that particular condition in, on or
under the Assets and (iii) include the particular environmental condition(s)
as part of the Assumed Environmental Liabilities.



 

16 C. _Remedies_. If the sum of (i) the aggregate value of all Environmental
Defects and (ii) the aggregate value of all Title Defects exceeds the Defect
Deductible, with respect to Environmental Defects, Seller shall elect one of
the following options: (i) remediate the condition on the affected Assets
comprising the specified Environmental Defect(s) as promptly as practicable
(and retain its obligation to indemnify and defend Buyer from any Losses
relating to such Environmental Defects), such remediation to be consistent
with Environmental Laws and all costs related to such remediation shall first
be borne by Buyer to the extent Seller elects to apply any of the Defect
Deductible to such costs; (ii) exclude the affected Asset from the Transaction
and reduce the Purchase Price by the Allocated Value of such Asset, or (iii)
if agreed to by Buyer, in its sole discretion, leave such affected Assets in
the Transaction and reduce the Purchase Price by the amount that the aggregate
Environmental Defect Value plus the aggregate value of all Title Defects
exceeds the Defect Deductible (any reduction in the Purchase Price pursuant to
this Section shall be in conjunction with the reduction in the Purchase Price
in Section 4.2 B.2. and Buyer shall not be entitled to duplicative
reductions to the Purchase Price under either Section), in which event Buyer
shall release Seller from any further Retained Environmental Liability
relating to the Environmental Defects so satisfied. Seller will be deemed to
have adequately completed the Remediation set forth in option (i) upon
receipt of either (x) a certificate or approval from the applicable
governmental authority that the Remediation has been implemented to the extent
necessary to comply with existing regulatory requirements or (y) a
certification from a licensed professional engineer approved by Buyer that the
Remediation has been completed to the extent necessary to comply with existing
regulatory requirements if the approval or certification specified in clause
(x) cannot be obtained because provision for such approval or certification is
not provided under applicable Environmental Law. In the event Seller elects
option (ii) above as to any portion of the Assets, Buyer may waive the
relevant Environmental Defect in lieu thereof.

5.3 _Contested Environmental Defects_. If Seller contests the existence of an
Environmental Defect or the Environmental Defect Value, Seller shall notify
Buyer in writing on or before seven (7) days after receipt of the
Environmental Defect Notice ("Rejection Notice"). The Rejection Notice shall
state with reasonable specificity the basis of the rejection of the
Environmental Defect or the Environmental Defect Value. Within three business
days of receipt of the Rejection Notice, representatives of Buyer and Seller
knowledgeable in environmental matters shall meet and, either (i) mutually
agree to reject the particular Environmental Defect or (ii) agree on the
validity of such Environmental Defect and the Environmental Defect Value. If
the Parties cannot agree on either options (i) or (ii) in the preceding
sentence, the Environmental Defect and/or the Environmental Defect Value
subject to the Rejection Notice shall be resolved in accordance with the
arbitration procedures set forth in Section 14.7. If Seller fails to timely
deliver a Rejection Notice, Seller shall be deemed to have accepted the
validity of the Environmental Defect and Buyers estimate of the Environmental
Defect Value, and shall be deemed to have waived its own option to contest
the Environmental Defect pursuant to this Section.

5.4 _Limited Environmental Warranty and Representation_. Other than as
set forth in Section 6.22, Seller makes no warranty or representation,
express or implied, statutory or otherwise, with respect to any environmental
matters and Buyers indemnification rights under Article 14 with respect to
any environmental matters are limited to a breach by Seller of its
representation set forth in Section 6.22.



 

17 5.5 _Exclusive Remedies for Environmental Defects_. The rights and remedies
granted each Party in this Article and the rights of each Party to not close
pursuant to Articles 10 and 11 are the exclusive rights and remedies against
the other Party related to any Environmental Defects.

cost $25,000.00 or less, net to Sellers interest, and (ii) no proposals or
authorities for expenditures (AFEs) are currently outstanding (whether made
by Seller or by any other party) to drill additional wells, or to deepen, plug
back, or rework existing wells, or to conduct other operations on the Assets
for which consent is required under the applicable operating or unitization
agreement, or to abandon any Wells, or to conduct any other operation on the
Assets for which, in each such case, the estimated cost exceeds $25,000.00 net
to Sellers interest.

by third parties.

6.18 _Seller s Knowledge_. Seller has no knowledge of any fact which results
in any representation or warranty of Buyer in Article 7 being inaccurate in
any respect. If after the date of this Agreement, Seller obtains knowledge of

inaccurate in any respect, Seller will promptly furnish Buyer written notice
thereof.

A.  _Schedule 6.19_ sets forth a list of the following contracts, agreements
or commitments to which the Assets are subject or by which Seller is bound
with respect to the Assets (collectively, the "Material Contracts"):

1933, as amended, and certain applicable state securities or Blue Sky laws
and that resales thereof may therefore be subject to the registration

tax or other consequences of this Transaction including its own estimate and
appraisal of the extent and value of the petroleum, natural gas and other
reserves of the Assets, the value of the Assets and future operation,
maintenance and development costs associated with the Assets. Buyer is aware
of the geologic factors and risks associated with operating oil and gas wells
in the area of the Assets. Accordingly, Buyer assumes the risk of the downhole
condition of the Wells. Except as expressly provided in this Agreement, Seller
shall not have any liability to Buyer or its affiliates, agents,
representatives or employees resulting from any use, authorized or
unauthorized, of the Records or other information relating to the Assets
provided by or on behalf of Seller.

7.8 _Buyer s Knowledge_. Buyer has no knowledge of any fact which results in
any representation or warranty of Seller in Article 6 being breached. If
after the date of this Agreement, Buyer obtains knowledge of any fact which

will assist Buyer in Buyers efforts to succeed Seller as operator of any
Wells included in the Assets. Buyer shall, promptly following Closing, file
all appropriate forms and declarations or bonds with federal and state
agencies relative to its assumption of operatorship. For all Seller Operated

respect to the Financial Statements, provided that Buyer shall provide
customary indemnity for any officer of Seller executing and delivering such
representation letters to the Audit Firm.

TAX MATTERS

9.1 _Apportionment of Tax Liability_. All Taxes based on or measured by
production of Hydrocarbons shall be deemed attributable to the period during
which such production occurred and not attributable to the year in which such
Taxes are assessed. The apportionment of Taxes between the Parties shall take
place as an adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to Sections 2.4 and
13.1 in the Preliminary Settlement Statement for Taxes for which information
is available at Closing and in the Final Settlement Statement for all
remaining Taxes, using estimates of such Taxes if actual numbers are not
available.

9.2 _Tax Reports and Returns_. Seller agrees to file all tax returns for the
period of time prior to and including the Closing Date, and Buyer agrees to
file all tax returns for the period of time after the Closing Date. The Party
not filing the return agrees to provide the Party filing the return with
appropriate information which is necessary to file any required tax reports
and returns related to the Assets. Buyer agrees to file all tax returns and
reports applicable to the Assets that are required to be filed after the
Closing, and pay all required Taxes payable with respect to the Assets
subject to the provisions of Sections 9.1 and 14.4.

similar taxes that are required to be paid as a result of the transfer of the
Assets to Buyer and Buyer shall promptly (in any event within five business
days) reimburse Seller therefor upon written notice from Seller. Such notice
will include Sellers calculation and supporting detail of the taxes paid and
evidence of payment, such as a copy of a cashed check. If Seller receives
notice that any sales and/or use taxes are due, Seller shall promptly forward
such notice to Buyer for payment of such taxes that may be due.

9.4 _Tax Allocation_. Seller and Buyer agree that the Purchase Price and the
Assumed Liabilities shall be allocated among the various Assets for federal
and state income tax purposes. The initial draft of such allocations shall be
prepared in a manner consistent with the Allocated Values by Seller and shall
be provided to Buyer concurrently with the delivery of the Final Settlement
Statement. Seller and Buyer shall cooperate to update the allocation to
reflect any adjustment to the Purchase Price. The allocation of the Purchase
Price shall be reflected on a completed Form 8594 (Asset Acquisition Statement

Buyer, will prepare and deliver to Buyer, in accordance with customary
industry accounting practices, the Final Settlement Statement (the "Final

Sellers proposed Final Settlement Statement, Buyer shall deliver to Seller a
written report containing any changes that Buyer proposes to make to the Final
Settlement Statement. Buyers failure to deliver to Seller a written report

which such agreement is reached or upon which the Final Purchase Price is
established shall be herein called the "Final Settlement Date." If the Final

Seller shall execute such engagement, indemnity and other agreements as such
accounting firm may require in connection with or as a condition to such
engagement. Buyer and Seller shall cooperate diligently with any reasonable
request of the accounting firm and furnish to the accounting firm such
workpapers and other documents and information relating to such objections as
the accounting firm may request and are available to such Party or its
subsidiaries (or its independent public accountants) and will be afforded the
opportunity to present to the accounting firm any material relating to the
determination of the matters in dispute and to discuss such determination
with the accounting firm prior to any written notice of determination
hereunder being delivered by the accounting firm and to the extent that a
value has been assigned to any objection that remains in dispute, the
accounting firm shall not assign a value to such objection that is greater
than the greatest value for such objection claimed by either Party or less
than the smallest value for such objection claimed by either Party. The fees
and expenses of said accounting firm in making such determination shall be
shared equally by Buyer and Seller. Upon resolution of such unresolved
disagreements of Buyer, the Final Settlement Statement (including any
revisions thereto as are so resolved or agreed), shall be conclusive, final
and binding on Buyer and Seller.

13.2 _Records_. Seller shall make the Records available for pick up by Buyer
at Closing to the extent possible, but in any event, within five business days
after Closing. Seller may retain copies of the Records and Seller shall have
the right to review and copy the Records during standard business hours upon
reasonable notice for so long as Buyer retains the Records. Buyer agrees that
the Records will be maintained in compliance with all applicable laws
governing document retention. Buyer will not destroy or otherwise dispose
of Records for a period of 6 years after Closing, unless Buyer first gives

by the Indemnified Party.

B. _Claim Notice_. The Party seeking indemnification under the terms of this
Agreement ("Indemnified Party") shall submit a written "Claim Notice" to the
other Party ("Indemnifying Party") which shall list the amount claimed by an
Indemnified Party, the basis for such claim, with supporting
documentation, and list each separate item of Loss for which payment is so
claimed. The amount claimed shall be paid by the Indemnifying Party to the
extent required herein within 30 days after receipt of the Claim Notice, or
after the amount of such payment has been finally established, whichever last
occurs.

C. _Information_. If the Indemnified Party receives notice of a claim or
legal action that may result in a Loss for which indemnification may be
sought under this Agreement (a "Claim"), the Indemnified Party shall give
written notice of such Claim to the Indemnifying Party as soon as is
practicable. The Indemnified Party shall furnish the Indemnifying Party with
copies of all pleadings and other information with respect to such Claim. At
the election of the Indemnifying Party made within 60 days after receipt of
such notice, the Indemnified Party shall permit the Indemnifying Party to
assume control of such Claim (to the extent only that such Claim, legal action
or other matter relates to a Loss for which the Indemnifying Party is liable),
including the determination of all appropriate actions, the negotiation of
settlements on behalf of the Indemnified Party, and the conduct of litigation
through attorneys of the Indemnifying Partys choice; provided, however, that
any settlement of the claim by the Indemnifying Party may not result in any
liability or cost to the Indemnified Party without its prior written consent.
If the Indemnifying Party elects to assume control, (i) any expense incurred
by the Indemnified Party thereafter for investigation or defense of the
matter shall be borne by the Indemnified Party, and (ii) the Indemnified
Party shall give all reasonable information and assistance that the
Indemnifying Party shall deem necessary to the proper defense of such Claim.
In the absence of such an election, the Indemnified Party will use its best
efforts to defend, at the Indemnifying Partys expense, any Claim to which
such other Partys indemnification applies until the Indemnifying Party
assumes such defense. If the Indemnifying Party fails to assume such defense
within the time period provided above, the Indemnified Party may settle the
Claim, in its reasonable discretion at the Indemnifying Partys expense. If
such a Claim requires immediate action, both the Indemnified Party and the
Indemnifying Party will cooperate in good faith to take appropriate action so
as not to jeopardize defense of such Claim or either Partys position with
respect to such Claim.

14.7 _Dispute Resolution_. Subject to the provisions of subsection 4.3 above,
the Parties agree to resolve all disputes concerning this Agreement pursuant
to the provisions of this Section, such disputes to include without limitation

Value, (iii) the adequacy of any remediation actions take with  



 

36  respect to an Environmental Defect, or (iv) disputes concerning a Claim or
amount to be paid by an Indemnifying Party (each a "Dispute" and collectively
"Disputes"). The Parties agree to submit all Disputes to binding arbitration
in Dallas, Texas, such arbitration to be conducted as follows: The arbitration
proceeding shall be conducted by the American Arbitration Association in
accordance with its commercial rules, with discovery to be conducted in
accordance with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The arbitration shall be
governed by Texas law and shall be held in Dallas, Texas. The arbitration

least 15 years experience in the oil and gas industry, consisting of one
person picked by each side, and the two arbitrators so selected picking the

the scope of discovery shall be determined by the Arbitrators. The Arbitrators
shall conduct a hearing no later than 60 days after submission of the matter
to arbitration, and the Arbitrators shall render a written decision within 30
days of the hearing. At the hearing, the Parties shall present such evidence
and witnesses as they may choose, with or without counsel. Adherence to formal
rules of evidence shall not be required but the Arbitrators shall consider
any evidence and testimony that they determine to be relevant, in accordance
with procedures that they determine to be appropriate. Any award entered in
the arbitration shall be made by a written opinion stating the reasons and
basis for the award made and any payment due pursuant to the arbitration shall
be made within 15 days of the decision by the Arbitrators. The final decision
shall be binding on the Parties, final and non-appealable, and may be
filed in a court of competent jurisdiction and may be enforced by any Party
as a final judgment of such court. Each Party shall bear its own costs and
expenses of the arbitration, provided, however, that the costs of employing
the Arbitrators shall be borne 50% by the Seller and 50% by the Buyer.
