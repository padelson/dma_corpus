and list each separate item of Loss for which payment is so claimed. The amount claimed shall be paid by the Indemnifying Party to the extent required herein within 30&nbsp;days after receipt of the Claim Notice, or after the amount of such payment
has been finally established, whichever last occurs. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:8%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">C. <U>Information</U>. If the Indemnified Party receives notice of a claim or legal

Party shall furnish the Indemnifying Party with copies of all pleadings and other information with respect to such Claim. At the election of the Indemnifying Party made within 60&nbsp;days after receipt of such notice, the Indemnified Party shall
permit the Indemnifying Party to assume control of such Claim (to the extent only that such Claim, legal action or other matter relates to a Loss for which the Indemnifying Party is liable), including the determination of all appropriate actions,
the negotiation of settlements on behalf of the Indemnified Party, and the conduct of litigation through attorneys of the Indemnifying Party&#146;s choice; provided, however, that any settlement of the claim by the Indemnifying Party may not result
in any liability or cost to the Indemnified Party without its prior written consent. If the Indemnifying Party elects to assume control, (i)&nbsp;any expense incurred by the Indemnified Party thereafter for investigation or defense of the matter
shall be borne by the Indemnified Party, and (ii)&nbsp;the Indemnified Party shall give all reasonable information and assistance that the Indemnifying Party shall deem necessary to the proper defense of such Claim. In the absence of such an
election, the Indemnified Party will use its best efforts to defend, at the Indemnifying Party&#146;s expense, any Claim to which such other Party&#146;s indemnification applies until the Indemnifying Party assumes such defense. If the Indemnifying
Party fails to assume such defense within the time period provided above, the Indemnified Party may settle the Claim, in its reasonable discretion at the Indemnifying Party&#146;s expense. If such a Claim requires immediate action, both the
Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party will cooperate in good faith to take appropriate action so as not to jeopardize defense of such Claim or either Party&#146;s position with respect to such Claim. </FONT></P> <P
