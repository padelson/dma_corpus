notice shall state the nature and the basis of such claim to the extent then known.
The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to defend and settle, at its own expense and by its own
counsel, any such matter as long as the Indemnifying Party pursues the same diligently and in good

by March&nbsp;31, 2007, Regency shall prepare and file a Shelf Registration Statement under the Act with
respect to all of the Registrable Securities. Regency shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to cause the Shelf Registration Statement to become effective no later than 165&nbsp;days after
March&nbsp;31, 2007. A Shelf Registration Statement filed pursuant to this <U>Section&nbsp;2.01</U> shall
be on an appropriate registration form under the Securities Act selected by Regency; <I>provided,
however</I>, that, if a prospectus supplement will be used in connection with the marketing of an
Underwritten Offering from the Shelf Registration Statement and the Managing Underwriter at any
time shall notify Regency in writing that, in the sole judgment of such Managing Underwriter,
inclusion of detailed information to be used in such prospectus supplement is of material
importance to the success of the Underwritten Offering of such Registrable Securities, Regency
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to include such information in the prospectus.
Regency will use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Shelf Registration Statement
filed pursuant to this <U>Section&nbsp;2.01</U> to be continuously effective under the Securities Act
until the earlier of (i)&nbsp;the date as of which all such Registrable Securities have been sold by the
Purchaser or (ii)&nbsp;the second anniversary of the date on which the Shelf Registration Statement is
declared effective by the Commission (the &#147;<U>Effectiveness Period</U>&#148;). The Shelf Registration
Statement when declared effective (including the documents incorporated therein by reference) shall
comply as to form with all applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and
shall not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required
to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading.

2.01</U> is not declared effective within 165&nbsp;days after March&nbsp;31, 2007, then each Purchaser shall
be entitled to a payment (with respect to each of such Purchaser&#146;s Purchased Class&nbsp;C Units), as
liquidated damages and not as a penalty, of 0.25% of the Purchase Price per 30-day period for the
first 60&nbsp;days following the 165th day, increasing by an additional 0.25% of the Purchase Price per
30-day period for each subsequent 60&nbsp;days, up to a maximum of 1.00% of the Purchase Price per
30-day period (the &#147;<U>Liquidated Damages</U>&#148;), which shall accrue on a daily basis and be
payable within 10 Business Days following the end of such 30-day period. In any event, the
aggregate amount of Liquidated Damages paid to the Purchasers pursuant to this Section&nbsp;2.01(a)(ii)
shall not to exceed 10% of the Purchase Price. The Liquidated Damages shall be paid to each
Purchaser in cash; <I>provided, however</I>, if Regency certifies that it is unable to pay the Liquidated
Damages in cash because such payment would result in a breach under any of Regency&#146;s or Regency&#146;s
Subsidiaries&#146; credit facilities filed as exhibits to Regency&#146;s SEC Documents, then Regency may pay
the Liquidated Damages in kind in the form of the issuance of additional Common Units (which shall,
for this purpose, be valued at the closing price of Common Units on The Nasdaq Global Market or
such other national securities exchange on which such Common Units are then listed on the trading
day immediately prior to the issuance thereof). Upon any issuance of Common Units as Liquidated
Damages, Regency shall promptly prepare and file an amendment to the Shelf Registration Statement

transferee&#146;s rights pursuant to Section&nbsp;2.10) under this Section&nbsp;2.01 shall terminate when such
Registrable Securities become eligible for resale under Rule 144(k) (or any similar provision then

the Shelf Registration Statement (in which event the Selling Holder shall discontinue sales of the
Registrable Securities pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement) if (i)&nbsp;Regency is pursuing an
acquisition, merger, reorganization, disposition or other similar transaction and Regency
determines in good faith that Regency&#146;s ability to pursue or consummate such a transaction would be
materially adversely affected by any required disclosure of such transaction in the Shelf
Registration Statement or (ii)&nbsp;Regency has experienced some other material non-public event the
disclosure of which at such time, in the good faith judgment of Regency, would materially adversely
affect Regency; <I>provided, however</I>, in no event shall the Purchasers be suspended for a period
exceeding an aggregate of ninety (90)&nbsp;days (exclusive of days covered by any lock-up agreement
executed by a Purchaser in connection with any Underwritten Offering by Regency or a Purchaser) in
any 365-day period. Upon disclosure of such information or the termination of the condition
described above, Regency shall provide prompt notice to the Selling Holders whose Registrable
Securities are included in the Shelf Registration Statement, and shall promptly terminate any
suspension of sales it has put into effect and shall take such other actions to permit registered
sales of Registrable Securities as contemplated in this Agreement.

held by a court or government agency of competent jurisdiction to be unavailable to any indemnified
party or is insufficient to hold them harmless in respect of any Losses, then each such
indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount
paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such Loss in such proportion as is
appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party on the one hand and of such
indemnified party on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in
such Losses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations; <I>provided, however</I>, that in no
event shall such Selling Holder be required to contribute an aggregate amount in excess of the
dollar amount of proceeds (net of Selling Expenses) received by such Selling Holder from the sale
of Registrable Securities giving rise to such indemnification. The relative fault of the
indemnifying party on the one hand and the indemnified party on the other shall be determined by
reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact
or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact has been made by, or relates to,
information supplied by such party, and the parties&#146; relative intent, knowledge, access to
information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The parties hereto
agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this paragraph were to
be determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take
account of the equitable considerations referred to herein. The amount paid by an indemnified
party as a result of the Losses referred to in the first sentence of this paragraph shall be deemed
to include any legal and other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection
with investigating or defending any Loss that is the subject of this paragraph. No person guilty of
fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be
entitled to contribution from any Person who is not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
