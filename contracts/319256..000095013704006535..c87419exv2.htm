 _PHARMACY ASSETS_     

 _Section 2.1.  Right to Acquire Pharmacy Assets_. From and after
the time of the sale, conveyance and assignment by Seller of a Property to

Purchaser, to the extent permitted under applicable law, all right, title and

"Pharmacy Assets") used in the retail drugstore and pharmaceutical operations
of Seller conducted at such Property (each such operation relating to a
particular Property being a "Pharmacy"):

In order to exercise its Acquisition Right with respect to the Pharmacy
Assets relating to a particular Property, Purchaser must deliver written
notice of exercise to Seller on or after the time of the Closing with respect
to the related Property and prior to the date that is 60 days prior to the
Occupancy Delivery Date for such Property (the "Election Deadline"). If
Purchaser does not so exercise its Acquisition Right with respect to any
particular Pharmacy Assets prior to the applicable Election Deadline,
Purchasers Acquisition Right with respect to such Pharmacy Assets shall
terminate and all of Sellers obligations hereunder with respect to such
Pharmacy Assets and the related Pharmacy (including under _Section 2.4_)
shall cease and be of no further effect (except that Seller shall remain
liable for any breaches of _Section 2.4_,  _Section 2.5(b)_ and the third
sentence of _Section 2.5(d)_ prior to such termination), and Seller shall
have the right to retain such Pharmacy Assets or convey them to a third
party. If Purchaser does so exercise its Acquisition Right with respect to
any particular Pharmacy Assets prior to the applicable Election Deadline,
Seller shall convey and assign such Pharmacy Assets to Purchaser on a
Business Day to be later specified by Purchaser in a written notice of
closing (the "Notice") to Seller, which  ##### 

  

   

date shall be no earlier than 10 Business Days after Purchasers delivery
of its Notice to Seller and no later than 10 Business Days prior to the
Occupancy Delivery Date.   

 _Section 2.2. No Additional Consideration_. The portion of the
Purchase Price allocable to, and payable by Purchaser with respect to, each
Property shall be deemed to include payment for the Pharmacy Assets relating
to such Property and no additional consideration shall be payable by
Purchaser to Seller in connection with the exercise by Purchaser of any
Acquisition Rights or the transfer of any Pharmacy Assets. Furthermore,
Purchaser shall not assume or be obligated to pay, perform or otherwise
assume or discharge any Liabilities of Seller or any of its affiliates
accruing or arising from or out of events occurring during the period of
Sellers ownership of any Pharmacy Assets or operation of the related
Pharmacy prior to Sellers transfer of such Pharmacy Assets to Purchaser, and
all such Liabilities shall be Excluded Liabilities hereunder.   

 _Section 2.3. Pharmacy Transfer Deliveries_.

At the time of transfer of any Pharmacy Assets, Seller shall execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, to Purchaser such customary documents necessary to effect the transfer from Seller to Purchaser of the Pharmacy Assets as may be reasonably requested by Purchaser, including, without limitation, assignment agreements relating to the Pharmacy Assets in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit G_.    

 (b) _Purchaser Deliveries_. At the time of transfer of any Pharmacy Assets, Purchaser shall execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, to Seller such customary documents necessary to effect the transfer from Seller to Purchaser of the Pharmacy Assets as may be reasonably requested by Seller, including, without limitation, assignment agreements relating to the Pharmacy Assets in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit G_.   

 _Section 2.4. Operation of Pharmacies_. From and after the Effective
Date until December 31, 2004, Seller shall operate each Pharmacy in the usual
and ordinary course of business, consistent with past practices with respect
to such Pharmacy; _provided_ , that nothing in this _Section 2.4_ shall
preclude Seller from commencing a store closing sale with respect to Sellers
non-Pharmacy operations prior to December 31, 2004 at any Property in which a
Pharmacy is located.   

 _Section 2.5. Cooperation_.    

 (a) Seller and Purchaser shall reasonably cooperate to effect an orderly transfer of any Pharmacy Assets for which Purchaser exercises its Acquisition Right. In addition, Seller and Purchaser shall cooperate in good faith to develop within 30 days after the Initial Closing hereunder a preliminary schedule for the transfer of Pharmacy Assets relating to each Property and shall thereafter consult with each other and cooperate to update such schedule from time to time in light of continuing developments with respect to the Pharmacies and the transactions contemplated hereunder. Seller shall reasonably cooperate with Purchaser to transfer in an electronic format usable to Purchaser all such Pharmacy Assets that are, or reasonably can be, embodied in an electronic format; _provided_ , that Purchaser shall reimburse Seller for all    ##### 

  

   

documented and reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by Seller
in complying with its obligations under this sentence.    

 (b) From and after the Effective Date, Seller shall (i) subject to the terms of the Confidentiality and Access Agreement (as hereinafter defined) and applicable law, allow Purchaser and its representatives and advisors and any prospective Designee (as hereinafter defined) of Purchaser reasonable access at reasonable times and upon reasonable prior notice to Seller, to the employees, assets and facilities of Seller related to Sellers operation of any Pharmacy, provided that such access shall not unreasonably interfere with Sellers operation of any Pharmacy, and (ii) furnish promptly to Purchaser and its representatives and advisors and any prospective Designee of Purchaser such information concerning the business, records and personnel of each Pharmacy (including, without limitation, financial, operating and other data and information) as may be reasonably requested by Purchaser, to the extent such information is within Sellers possession or control; provided, that as a condition precedent to Sellers obligation to allow such access or furnish such information to any prospective Designee of Purchaser, such prospective Designee shall have executed and delivered to Seller a customary confidentiality agreement reasonably similar to the Confidentiality and Access Agreement.    

 (c) From and after the exercise by Purchaser of its Acquisition Right with respect to any Pharmacy, Seller shall, subject to receipt of any necessary approvals from Landlords or other third parties, permit Purchaser to post reasonably-sized signs around the Pharmacy at each such Property to notify customers that Purchaser intends to open a pharmacy at such location.    

 (d) From and after the exercise by Purchaser of its Acquisition Right with respect to any Pharmacy, Seller shall, subject to receipt of any necessary approvals from Landlords or other third parties, permit Purchaser (at Purchasers sole cost) to construct a reasonably-sized temporary facility to be used for the operation of a pharmacy in a location reasonably acceptable to Purchaser and Seller outside the store at such Property. From and after the transfer from Seller to Purchaser of Pharmacy Assets relating to any Property, Seller shall, subject to the receipt of any necessary approvals from Landlords or other third parties, permit Purchaser (at Purchasers sole cost) to operate a pharmacy from such temporary facility. From and after the Effective Date, Seller shall reasonably cooperate with Purchaser to obtain, at Purchasers sole cost and expense, any requisite Landlord consents and regulatory permits and approvals necessary for the construction and operation of any temporary pharmacy facility. Purchaser agrees to operate any temporary pharmacy facility in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations and (notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Take-Back Lease) agrees to indemnify and hold harmless all Seller Indemnified Parties (as hereinafter defined) against any and all Losses (as hereinafter defined) incurred or suffered by the Seller Indemnified Parties, or any of them, due to any claim or other assertion of liability by a third party to the extent such third party claim or assertion relates to or results from Purchasers construction or operation of any temporary pharmacy facility (which indemnification obligation of Purchaser shall survive the Closing).   

 _Section 2.6. Sellers Representations and Warranties Relating to
Pharmacy Assets_. Seller represents and warrants to Purchaser that the
following shall be true, complete and correct as of the date of transfer of
any Pharmacy Assets:    

 (a) Seller shall have good and valid title to the Pharmacy Assets; and    ##### 

  

   

 (b) The Prescription Files and Pharmacy Records that Seller will transfer shall be, in all material respects, complete and correct copies of all such items in Sellers records as of the time of such transfer.   

 _Section 2.7. Transfer to Designee_. Purchaser may, upon written
notice to Seller given at least 30 days prior to the First Occupancy Delivery
Date, request that Seller convey the Pharmacy Assets to any Purchaser
Subsidiary (as hereinafter defined) or any third party (a "Designee"), and in
such event Seller shall convey the Pharmacy Assets on the applicable transfer
date to such Designee (to the extent permitted under applicable law and
subject to receipt of any requisite Landlord consents under the applicable
Lease), provided that Purchaser (and not such Designee) shall retain any
rights or obligations hereunder with respect to such Pharmacy Assets, and
Seller shall have no liability to such Designee in connection therewith. From
and after the time that Purchaser requests that Seller convey the Pharmacy
Assets to its Designee, Seller shall be obligated to Purchaser to cooperate
with the Designee for all purposes under this Article II in the same manner
as Seller would be obligated to cooperate with Purchaser if Purchaser would
acquire such Pharmacy Assets.   

 _ARTICLE III_     

 _PURCHASE PRICE_     

 _Section 3.1. Purchase Price_.    

 (a) The purchase price for the Transferred Assets (the "Purchase Price") to be paid by Purchaser to Seller under this Agreement, in consideration for the conveyance by Seller to Purchaser of the Properties and the other Transferred Assets, shall be $621,000,000, in cash, subject to adjustment pursuant to Section 3.1(b) hereof and subject to any adjustments and prorations as provided under Section 4.3.

If, as of the Initial Closing Date, the Closing Conditions (as hereinafter defined) have not been satisfied with respect to certain of the Properties (and subject to the provisions of _Article XII_ below) (for example, if the Closing Conditions shall have been satisfied for forty-four (44) Properties and the Closing Conditions shall not yet have been satisfied for the remaining ten (10) Properties) then the parties shall proceed with the Initial Closing with respect only to the Properties for which the Closing Conditions shall have been satisfied (the "Initial Closing Properties"), and the Purchase Price payable by Purchaser to Seller at the Initial Closing shall be reduced by the allocable portion of the Purchase Price (as set forth on _Schedule 3.1(a)_) of those Properties not conveyed by Seller to Purchaser at the Initial Closing (the "Remaining Properties").    ##### 

  

   

 (c) In the event that, in accordance with this Agreement, any of the Remaining Properties are conveyed by Seller to Purchaser in a Subsequent Closing (as hereinafter defined), the Purchase Price payable by Purchaser to Seller in respect of the conveyance of any such Remaining Property shall be the allocable portion of the Purchase Price for such Remaining Property as set forth on _Schedule 3.1(a)_.   

 _Section 3.2. Payment of Purchase Price_.    

 (a) Within two (2) Business Days after the execution hereof, Purchaser shall pay an amount equal to $62,100,000 (the "Deposit"), by wire transfer of federal funds, into escrow with the Title Company, as Escrow Agent (as such terms are hereinafter defined), to be held and disbursed by the Escrow Agent in accordance with _Article XIV hereof_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any interest earned on the Deposit shall be paid to Purchaser.    

 (b) At the Initial Closing, (i) the Deposit (less ten percent (10%) of the Purchase Price allocable to the Remaining Properties pursuant to _Schedule 3.1(a)_ ), shall be paid by the Escrow Agent to Seller, (ii) Purchaser shall pay, or cause to be paid, to Seller an additional 20% of the Purchase Price allocable to the Properties conveyed at the Initial Closing pursuant to  _Schedule 3.1(a)_ by wire transfer of federal funds to an account designated by Seller in writing by notice to Purchaser, and (iii) all adjustments and prorations (relating to the Properties being conveyed at the Initial Closing) as provided in _Section 4.3_ shall be made and credited between Seller and Purchaser.    

 (c) At any Subsequent Closing, (i) the applicable Deposit for any Remaining Property being conveyed shall be paid by the Escrow Agent to Seller, (ii) Purchaser shall pay, or cause to be paid, to Seller an additional 20% of the Purchase Price for such Remaining Property (pursuant to _Schedule 3.1(a)_), by wire transfer of federal funds to an account designated by Seller in writing by notice to Purchaser, and (iii) all adjustments and prorations (relating to such Remaining Property) as provided in _Section 4.3_ shall be made and credited between Seller and Purchaser.    

 (d) The balance of the Purchase Price with respect to each Property conveyed at the Initial Closing or any Subsequent Closing shall be paid by Purchaser to Seller as follows: (i) on the First Occupancy Delivery Date (as hereinafter defined), and provided that (x) Seller shall have delivered occupancy to Purchaser of such First Occupancy Delivery Date Property (as hereinafter defined) in the manner set forth in the Take-Back Lease applicable to such Property, (y) Seller is not otherwise in default in any material respect of any of its covenants or obligations under such applicable Take-Back Lease, under this Agreement, or under any Seller Tenant Estoppel or any Seller Subtenant Estoppel, as applicable, with respect to such Property, and (z) there is no uncured Seller Violation (as defined below) (collectively, the "Possession Payment Conditions"), Purchaser shall pay to Seller the balance of the Purchase Price allocable to such First Occupancy Delivery Date Property pursuant to _Schedule 3.1(a)_, and (ii) on the Second Occupancy Delivery Date (as hereinafter defined), and provided that Seller shall have satisfied the Possession Payment Conditions with respect to any Second Occupancy Delivery Date Property, Purchaser shall pay to Seller the balance of the Purchase Price allocable to such Property pursuant to _Schedule 3.1(a)_.    ##### 

  

   

 (e) In the event the Possession Payment Conditions are not satisfied in all material respects with respect to any Property at the applicable Occupancy Delivery Date (as hereinafter defined), the following shall occur: (i) in the event Seller has not delivered occupancy of such Property to Purchaser, Purchaser shall not be required to pay to Seller any of the balance of the Purchase Price allocable to such Property until occupancy is so delivered to Purchaser, and (ii) in the event Seller has not satisfied the Possession Payment Conditions described in clause (y) or (z) of _Section 3.2(d)(i)_ above, Purchaser shall withhold from the balance of the Purchase Price allocable to such Property (which balance, less such withheld amount, shall be paid by Purchaser to Seller on the Occupancy Delivery Date) an amount equal to one hundred fifty percent (150%) of the reasonably estimated cost to cure or otherwise satisfy such Possession Payment Conditions, which amount shall be deposited by Purchaser with, and held by, the Title Company in escrow until the earliest of (1) its receipt of a joint direction from both Seller and Purchaser, (2) Seller substantially cures the applicable default (in which event Purchaser and Seller will provide a joint direction to the Title Company), or (3) a court of competent jurisdiction issues an order directing the disbursement of such funds, whereupon the Title Company shall pay such withheld funds to Seller or as otherwise directed pursuant to such joint direction or court order. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event Purchaser, pursuant to the terms of a Take-Back Lease, has expended funds to cure a default of Seller under a Take-Back Lease, the reasonable costs incurred by Purchaser in curing such default (including, without limitation, any reasonable attorneys fees incurred in connection therewith) may be deducted from the balance of the Purchase Price for such Property and such costs shall not be deposited with the Title Company in escrow but shall be retained by Purchaser.    

 (f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Closing is part of an Exchange pursuant to _Section 5.3_, the funds paid at such Closing and on the First Occupancy Delivery Date or the Second Occupancy Delivery Date (as applicable) shall be wire transferred to an account designated by the Qualified Intermediary (as hereinafter defined).    

 (g) The provisions of this _Section 3.2_ shall survive the Closings.

in the form and manner that complies with _Section 1445_ of the Internal

Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder;

  
      
    | (xv)  |   |

Properties being conveyed at such Closing to Purchaser.

  
---|---|---|--- 
     

 (b) _Purchaser s Closing Deliveries_. Purchaser shall deliver or cause
to be delivered to Seller (or to the Title Company in escrow, if applicable)
at Closing: (i) the portion of the Purchase Price due at such Closing
pursuant to  _Article III_ hereof, plus or minus prorations and adjustments
as set forth herein; (ii) a duly executed counterpart of the Assignment of

contemplated by this Agreement, including, without limitation, those
customarily provided by purchasers in the applicable state and local
jurisdictions in order to perfect the conveyance, transfer and assignment of
the Properties being conveyed at such Closing to Purchaser.   

 _Section 4.3. Closing Prorations and Adjustments_. A statement
of prorations and other adjustments shall be prepared by Seller (for each
Property being conveyed at a Closing) in conformity with the provisions of
this Agreement and submitted to Purchaser for review and approval not less
than five (5) Business Days prior to the Initial Closing Date and three (3)
Business Days prior to any Subsequent Closing Date (the "Closing Statement").
For purposes of prorations, Purchaser shall be deemed the owner of the
respective Property on the Closing Date. In addition to other adjustments
that may be provided for in this Agreement, the following items with respect
to each Property are to be prorated or adjusted, as the case may require, for
each Property as of the Closing Date for such Property:    

 (a) real estate taxes and assessments (initially prorated on the basis of 100% of the most recent ascertainable bill, but subject to reproration upon issuance of the actual bills therefor to effectuate the actual proration); to the extent that Seller has escrowed any real estate taxes with the Landlord under a Lease, Seller shall assign all rights under such escrow to Purchaser and, provided the amount so escrowed is confirmed by such Landlord in writing or is confirmed by other reasonably satisfactory substantiation, Seller shall be credited accordingly in connection with the proration of taxes or assessments. Real estate taxes shall be apportioned on the basis of the fiscal period for which assessed. If as of the applicable Closing Date any of the Properties or any portion thereof shall be affected by any special or general assessments which are or    ##### 

  

   

may become payable in installments of which the first installment is then a
lien and has become payable, Seller shall be responsible to pay the unpaid
installments of such assessments which are due prior to the applicable
Closing Date and Purchaser shall be responsible to pay the installments which
are due on or after the applicable Closing Date and Purchaser or Seller shall
make a payment to the other to the extent necessary so that the total amount
of such special or general assessment is apportioned as provided
above;    

 (b) the rent and other sums, including, without limitation, monthly installments payable by Seller on account of operating costs and taxes, payable by Seller under the Leases. Any percentage rent owed under any Lease with respect to any time period prior to the applicable Closing shall be paid by Seller. To the extent that Seller has paid to or escrowed with the Landlord under any Lease any monthly estimate of taxes or other operating expenses, and the Landlord refunds or credits to Purchaser or its designee (after the applicable Closing) a portion of such estimated or escrowed payments resulting from a reconciliation of the actual expenses or taxes for the period prior to such Closing, Purchaser shall deliver to Seller its pro-rata share of such refund within twenty (20) days of receipt of said refund. In the event that a Landlord is owed any additional funds as a result of any deficiency shown in such reconciliation for the period of time prior to the applicable Closing, Seller shall deliver to Purchaser the deficient funds within twenty (20) days of receipt of notice from Purchaser, subject to any rights of the tenant under the Lease to contest such determination by the Landlord (which rights shall be retained and shall be exercisable by Seller) with respect to any reconciliation for the period of time prior to the applicable Closing. Seller shall retain, subsequent to any Closing with respect to a Leased Property, any other rights, claims and remedies against the Landlord with respect to any refunds, rebates or credits due from the Landlord to Seller (as a tenant under the Lease) with respect to any periods prior to the Closing Date (including, without limitation, audit rights and rights to claim adjustments from the Landlord for overcharged amounts of additional rent under the Lease), and Purchaser shall promptly pay to Seller any such amounts received by (or credited for the benefit of) Purchaser after the Closing Date and attributable to periods prior to the Closing Date;    

 (c) security deposits paid under the Leases, and not theretofore applied, shall be credited by Purchaser to Seller on the applicable Closing Date;    

 (d) water, electric, telephone and all other utility and fuel charges shall be prorated ratably on the basis of the last ascertainable bills (and reprorated upon receipt of the actual bills or invoices) unless final meter readings and final invoices can be obtained. To the extent practicable, Seller shall cause meters for utilities to be read not more than ten (10) Business Days prior to the applicable Closing Date;    

 (e) assignable license and permit fees;    

 (f) deposits made by Seller with utility companies, Governmental Entities or any other person, which deposits shall be assigned to Purchaser at Closing and shall be credited to Seller, provided, however, that Seller shall have received written notice from the party holding such deposits confirming the amount of such deposits and stating that no default has occurred by Seller and no other condition has occurred which would    ##### 

  

   

prohibit all or any portion of such deposit from being refunded (or such
other substantiation of the foregoing facts reasonably satisfactory to
Purchaser). If Seller is unable to obtain such a notice or provide such other
substantiation, amounts on deposit with utility companies shall not be
prorated; provided, however, that prior to Closing, Purchaser shall
substitute its own deposit for any amounts on deposit with utility companies
and Seller shall be entitled to arrange for a refund of Sellers deposit from
such utility companies;    

 (g) the rent and other sums, including, without limitation, monthly installments payable by subtenants on account of operating costs and taxes payable under the Approved Subleases, subject to _Section 4.5_ below;    

 (h) security deposits paid under the Approved Subleases, and not theretofore applied, shall be credited by Seller to Purchaser on the applicable Closing Date; and    

 (i) other operating expenses and any other customarily apportioned items.   

Except with respect to general real estate taxes (which shall be reprorated
upon the issuance of the actual bills, if necessary), any proration which
must be estimated at a Closing shall be reprorated and finally adjusted as
soon as practicable after the applicable Closing, with any refunds payable to
Seller or Purchaser to be made as soon as practicable; otherwise
all prorations shall be final. The provisions of this _Section 4.3_ shall
survive the Closings.   

 _Section 4.4. Closing Costs_. Purchaser shall pay the cost of the
Owners Policies and Leasehold Policies, with extended coverage (all other
endorsements requested by Purchaser shall be paid for by Purchaser), and (ii)
the Surveys (as hereinafter defined); and at Closing, Seller shall pay 75% of
the cost of transfer taxes, documentary stamps, intangible taxes and similar
taxes or charges, and Purchaser shall pay 25% of such costs. Purchaser shall
pay the costs of recording the deeds and all costs of Purchasers due
diligence activities, including, without limitation, engineering and
environmental inspections and reports, and Seller and Purchaser shall each
pay one-half of any escrow charges (including any charges for a "New York
Style" closing). Seller and Purchaser shall each be responsible for the fees
and costs of their respective attorneys, accountants, financial advisors,
brokers and other agents and advisors and any expenses and costs incurred by
such party except as otherwise specifically set forth herein.   

 _Section 4.5. Certain Retained Claims_.    

 (a) Seller shall have the right to collect and retain all charges due and payable by the subtenants ("Subtenants") under any subleases, licenses or concession agreements relating to any Property and attributable to the period prior to the Closing Date, including without limitation, rent, payments of common area maintenance charges and payments in the nature of the Subtenants share of real estate taxes (collectively, "Sublease Rents"). If, at the Closing Date, any of the Subtenants are in arrears in the payment of any Sublease Rents (such arrearages being herein referred to as "Delinquent Amounts"), Seller shall have the right to collect the same after the Closing Date. Sublease Rents received after the Closing Date by Purchaser from any of the Subtenants shall first be applied to the amount due to Purchaser from such Subtenant for the time period after Closing and shall then be applied to Delinquent Amounts and be    ##### 

  

  

promptly paid over by Purchaser to Seller. Seller shall have and reserves the
right to pursue any right or remedy against the Subtenants for
Delinquent Amounts; provided, however, that with respect to any of the
Approved Subleases to be assigned to Purchaser as set forth herein, Seller
shall have no right to file an eviction action against such Subtenants after
the Closing.    

(b) Seller shall retain all rights, claims and remedies, from and after the
Closing Date (and, with respect to any Leased Property, to the extent of the
tenants rights under the applicable Lease), with regard to any refunds
of real estate taxes, with respect to any period prior to the Closing Date.
The amount of any tax refund (net of reasonable attorneys fees and
other reasonable costs of obtaining such tax refunds) with respect to the tax
year for any Property in which the Closing Date occurs (a "Current Tax Year")
shall be apportioned between Seller and Purchaser as of the Closing Date. If,
in lieu of a tax refund, a tax credit is received by Seller or Purchaser
with respect to any Property for the Current Tax Year, then (x) within thirty
(30) days after receipt by Seller or Purchaser, as the case may be, of
evidence of the actual amount of such tax credit (net of reasonable
attorneys fees and other reasonable costs of obtaining such tax credit), the
tax credit apportionment shall be readjusted between Seller and Purchaser,
and (y) upon realization by Purchaser or Seller of a tax savings on account
of such credit, Purchaser or Seller, as the case may be, shall pay to Seller
or Purchaser an amount equal to the savings realized (as apportioned). All
refunds, credits or other benefits applicable to any tax year for any
Property prior to the Current Tax Year shall belong solely to Seller (and
Purchaser shall have no interest therein) and, if the same shall be paid or
credited to Purchaser or anyone acting on behalf of Purchaser, same shall be
paid to Seller within twenty (20) days following receipt thereof or following
the realization of such credit by Purchaser. All refunds, credits or other
benefits applicable to any tax year for any Property after the Current Tax
Year shall belong solely to Purchaser (and Seller shall have no interest
therein) and, if the same shall be paid to Seller or anyone acting on behalf
of Seller, same shall be paid by Seller to Purchaser within twenty (20) days
following receipt thereof.    

(c) The provisions of this _Section 4.5_ shall survive the Closing.   

 _Section 4.6. Take-Back Leases_. At each Closing, Seller, as tenant,
and Purchaser, as landlord, shall enter into a lease or sublease for each
Property conveyed by Seller to Purchaser at such Closing, in the form
attached hereto as  _Exhibit C_ (the "Take-Back Lease"). The term of the
Take-Back Leases shall expire (a) on March 15, 2005 (the "First Occupancy
Delivery Date") with respect to the Properties described on _Schedule
4.6(a)_ (the "First Occupancy Delivery Date Properties"), and (b) on April
15, 2005 (the "Second Occupancy Delivery Date", and each of the First
Occupancy Delivery Date and the Second Occupancy Delivery Date, an "Occupancy
Delivery Date"), with respect to the Properties described on _Schedule
4.6(b)_ (the "Second Occupancy Delivery Date Properties"). In the event that
Purchaser acquires less than 54 Properties as a result of a failure of
certain Closing Conditions or for any other reason as set forth in this
Agreement, Seller and Purchaser may mutually agree in good faith to
revise the allocation of Occupancy Delivery Dates as shown on _Schedules
4.6(a) and 4.6(b)_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in the
event a Take-Back Lease is terminated as a result of a default by Seller
under such Take-Back Lease, Purchaser may elect to accelerate the Occupancy
Delivery Date for such Property to a date prior to the First Occupancy
Delivery Date or the Second Occupancy Delivery Date.    ##### 

  

    

 _Section 4.7.  Cooperation Between the Parties_. Seller and
Purchaser shall cooperate with one another in order to minimize the transfer
taxes payable in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and to minimize any increase in real estate taxes, property
valuations or assessments (special or ordinary) including, without
limitation, effecting the acquisition by Purchaser of any Transferred Assets
through the merger, consolidation or stock acquisition of or with a newly
formed limited liability company ("LLC") that is wholly owned by Seller which
has no assets other than the Transferred Assets and no liabilities other than
the Assumed Liabilities; provided that such alternative structure has no
adverse tax consequences or other adverse consequences to either party, is
otherwise reasonably acceptable to both parties and does not adversely impact
the ability of either party to structure such transfer as a like-kind
exchange under _Section 1031_ of the Code. In the event that the acquisition
by Purchaser of any Transferred Assets occurs through the merger,
consolidation or stock acquisition of or with a wholly owned LLC, Seller
shall provide reasonable representations and warranties with respect to such
wholly owned LLC covering the matters contained in _Section 2.5_ and
_Section 8.1_, and such LLC shall be bound by the covenants contained
herein that bind the Seller, as applicable.   

 _Section 4.8. Separate Transactions_. Seller and Purchaser intend
and agree that for federal and state income tax purposes the sale or Exchange
of an individual Transferred Asset does not take place until the Closing for
such Transferred Asset, and agree to report the transactions
accordingly.   

 _Section 4.9. Pre-Closing Allocation of Purchase Price_. Not less
than ten (10) days prior to each Closing, Purchaser and Seller will jointly
prepare and approve a statement (the "Pre-Closing Allocation Statement")
setting forth the portion of the Purchase Price that is being paid for
Transferred Assets that are subject to a transfer tax.   

 _ARTICLE V_     

 _PRE-CLOSING COVENANTS_     

 _Section 5.1. Operation of Transferred Assets_. With respect to
each Property, from the Effective Date through and including the first to
occur of (i) the termination of this Agreement or (ii) the Closing relating
to such Property (provided, however, where covenants specifically noted in
this _Section 5.1_ run through the Occupancy Delivery Date for such Property,
such covenants shall not expire on the Closing for such Property, but shall
survive the Closing and expire on the Occupancy Delivery Date for such
Property):    

 (a) Seller shall keep each Property in substantially the same condition and repair as on the date hereof, ordinary wear and tear and damage due to a casualty or a taking by condemnation excepted (the "Permitted Property Condition"), provided that Seller shall not be required subsequent to the Effective Date to make any improvements (including capital improvements) to any Property that would upgrade the condition and repair of any Property beyond the Permitted Property Condition (other than Sellers obligation to cure Seller Violations (as defined below) under _Section 5.1(d))_;       ##### 

  

   

 (b) without the prior written consent of Purchaser, Seller shall not sell, mortgage, pledge, lease, hypothecate or otherwise transfer or dispose of all or any part of any Property or any interest therein or enter into any agreement or arrangement to do so, other than non material subleases, licenses or concession agreements or other similar agreements entered into in the ordinary course of business, each of which will be terminated on or before the applicable Occupancy Delivery Date;    

 (c) Seller shall not initiate, consent to, approve or otherwise take any material action with respect to zoning or any other governmental laws, rules or regulations presently applicable to any Property, other than such action as is necessary to maintain a Property in compliance with such laws, rules and regulations applicable to such Property, in each case without the prior written consent of Purchaser, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed;    

 (d) Seller shall cure, or cause to be cured, prior to Closing any violations ("Violations", which shall include, with respect to a Leased Property, only those violations that are the responsibility of the tenant under the Lease) of laws, ordinances, requirements, rules, regulations, notices and orders (collectively, "Applicable Laws") of any federal, state or local governmental agency, quasi-governmental agency or regulatory authority (a "Governmental Entity"), applicable to the Transferred Assets and issued in writing by the applicable Governmental Entity to Seller (i) on or prior to the date of this Agreement, or (ii) subsequent to the date of this Agreement and prior to Occupancy Delivery Date, if arising from Sellers actions or the conduct of Sellers business at the Property subsequent to the date hereof (each, a "Seller Violation"); provided that if any Seller Violation is not capable of being cured by Seller prior to the Closing, then the parties shall nevertheless proceed to Closing with respect to the applicable Property in accordance with this Agreement, and Seller shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Purchaser Indemnified Parties from and against any Losses with respect to such uncured Seller Violations, subject to the limitations set forth in this _Section 5.1(d)_ (and such indemnification obligation of Seller shall survive the Closing), but without limiting Purchasers rights under _Section 3.2(e)_ above. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the estimated cost of curing all Seller Violations with respect to a Property (as determined by an independent architect or engineer selected by Seller and approved by Purchaser) exceeds five percent (5%) of the allocated Purchase Price with respect to any Property (the "Maximum Violation Cure Amount"), then Seller, upon written notice to Purchaser given within five (5) Business Days after Sellers receipt of such determination, shall have the right to terminate this Agreement with respect to the applicable Property, in which event (i) the portion of the Deposit allocated to such Property shall be returned to Purchaser, (ii) the Purchase Price shall be deemed to be reduced by the allocated Purchase Price applicable to such Property, (iii) the term "Property" as used herein shall be deemed to be amended to omit any references to the applicable Property, (iv) the parties shall proceed to Closing with respect to the other Properties pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, and (v) neither party hereto shall have any further obligation to the other with respect to the applicable Property, with the exception of those obligations which expressly survive the termination of this Agreement (clauses (i) through (v) collectively, the "Property Termination Procedure"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, within ten (10) Business Days after Purchasers receipt of    ##### 

  

   

such a termination notice from Seller, Purchaser may notify Seller that it
elects to void Sellers termination notice and to proceed to Closing subject
to such Seller Violation, in which event the Purchase Price allocable to such
Property shall be reduced by five percent (5%). Any Violation with respect to
a Transferred Asset that is not a Seller Violation shall be
hereinafter referred to as a "Non-Seller Violation".    

 (e) Seller shall terminate any leases (for the Owned Properties), subleases and/or license agreements (except for the Approved Subleases set forth on _Schedule 8.1(j)_ attached hereto) relating to each Property prior to the applicable Occupancy Delivery Date relating to such Property, such that Purchaser shall have sole and exclusive possession of each Property at the applicable Occupancy Delivery Date, except for any Approved Subleases;    

 (f) Seller shall comply in all material respects with all terms and conditions of the Leases and Approved Subleases and Seller shall not terminate, extend or modify any of the Leases or Approved Subleases without the prior written consent of Purchaser, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Seller shall provide written notice ("Renewal Notice") to Purchaser of any pending renewal options with respect to any Lease at least thirty (30) days prior to the last date on which any such renewal option may be exercised, and unless Seller is notified in writing by Purchaser not to exercise any such renewal option within fifteen (15) days after Purchasers receipt of the Renewal Notice, Seller shall exercise such renewal option. Seller shall also promptly forward to Purchaser copies of any material notices received by Seller from any Landlord subsequent to the Effective Date;    

 (g) all Service Contracts and other contracts (other than the Leases, the Approved Subleases and the Permitted Exceptions) which affect or pertain to any Property shall be terminated, or caused to be terminated, by Seller prior to and be of no further force or effect as of the applicable Occupancy Delivery Date relating to such Property;    

 (h) any mortgage financing relating to any Owned Property, and any financing secured by Sellers leasehold interest with respect to any Leased Property, shall be paid off and all related security documents encumbering the Owned Properties or Leased Properties, as applicable, shall be released at the Closing relating to such Property;    

 (i) prior to the applicable Occupancy Delivery Date for each Property, Seller shall vacate the Property and remove all personal property and inventory therefrom, except for Merchandise Trade Fixtures, which may be left by Seller in their existing location as of the completion of Sellers store closing sale, or in any other reasonable location within the Property as reasonably determined by Seller. At the applicable Occupancy Delivery Date for each Property, Seller shall deliver the applicable Property to Purchaser in broom-clean condition;    

 (j) Seller shall be responsible for and shall pay all amounts due through the applicable Occupancy Delivery Date relating to such Property for each Employees salaries, wages, fees, vacation pay, severance pay, withholding and payroll taxes and   ##### 

  

   

other benefits, and shall otherwise comply with any and all applicable
requirements of the WARN Act (including all notice requirements), any
similar Applicable Law and the medical and dental continuation requirements
of COBRA;    

 (k) subject to _Section 5.7_ hereof, Seller shall (i) terminate the employment of, or transfer to another Seller store, all of the individuals rendering services to Seller as employees or independent contractors in connection with any Property before the applicable Occupancy Delivery Date related to such Property, and (ii) provide Purchaser with written notice of the number of employees terminated by Seller during the ninety (90) days preceding and including any applicable Occupancy Delivery Date;    

 (l) Seller shall promptly give written notice to Purchaser of the occurrence of any event known to Seller which affects in any material respect the truth or accuracy of any of the representations or warranties made or to be made by Seller under this Agreement; and    

 (m) Notwithstanding any provisions of the Take-Back Leases, Purchaser and its representatives and contractors shall have reasonable access to each Property during the time period after the Closing for such Property through the Occupancy Delivery Date for such Property for purposes of inspection of the Property in connection with Purchasers intended renovations and operations at the Property, upon reasonable prior notice to Seller and during business hours (or, at Sellers election and to the extent reasonable, after business hours), provided that such access by Purchaser shall not interfere in any material respect with Sellers business operations at the Property. Seller shall (at no cost to Seller) reasonably cooperate with Purchaser prior to the Occupancy Delivery Date for each Property in connection with Purchaser obtaining any permits from Governmental Entities to perform renovations on the Property, which renovations shall be performed by Purchaser after the Occupancy Delivery Date for such Property. Purchasers entry on the Properties shall be subject to the terms and conditions of the Confidentiality and Access Agreement.    

 (n) Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain a no further action letter or no further remediation letter, from the appropriate Governmental Entity providing that the former underground storage tanks identified in _Schedule 5.1(n)_ were closed in accordance with all applicable Environmental Laws.   

 _Section 5.2. Reasonable Best Efforts to Consummate the
Transactions_.    

 (a) Subject to the terms and conditions provided herein and to Applicable Laws, each of the parties shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do, or cause to be done, and assist and cooperate with the other party in doing, in the most expeditious manner practicable, all things necessary, proper or advisable to ensure that the conditions set forth in _Article X_ hereof are satisfied and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.    

 (b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject to the terms and conditions in this Agreement, each of Purchaser and Seller shall:    #####

and thereafter respond as promptly as practicable to any inquiries or
requests received from any Governmental Authority for additional information
or documentation;

  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (ii)  |   |

with any Governmental Authority not to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, except with the prior consent of the other
party hereto (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed);

  
      
    | (iii)  |   |

use their reasonable best efforts to cooperate with one another in (A)
determining which filings and notifications are required to be made
under Applicable Laws with, and which consents, licenses, approvals,
permits, waivers, orders or authorizations are required to be obtained under
Applicable Laws from, Governmental Entities in connection with the
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (B) timely making all such
filings and notifications and timely seeking all such consents, licenses,
approvals, permits, waivers, orders or authorizations and (C) as promptly as
practicable, responding to any request for information from such Governmental
Entities;

  
      
    | (iv)  |   |

subject to any restrictions under Applicable Laws, to the extent practicable,

Agreement and permit the other party to review in advance any proposed

Entity, gives the other party the opportunity to attend and
participate thereat, in each case to the extent practicable;

  
      
    | (vi)  |   |

subject to any restrictions under Applicable Laws, furnish the other party
with copies of all correspondence, filings and communications (and memoranda
setting forth the substance thereof) between it and its affiliates and their
respective 

  
    ##### 

  

   

       |   |   |

representatives on the one hand, and any Governmental Entity or members of
its staff on the other hand, with respect to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (excluding documents and communications that are subject to
preexisting confidentiality agreements and to the attorney-client privilege
or work product doctrine);

  
---|---|---|--- 
     

       | (vii)  |   |

furnish the other party with such necessary information and reasonable
assistance as such other party and its affiliates may reasonably request
in connection with their preparation of necessary filings, registration, or

use its reasonable best efforts to take any steps necessary to avoid or
eliminate any impediment under any Applicable Law that may be asserted by
any Governmental Entity or private party with respect to the transactions
contemplated by the Agreement so as to enable the Closings to occur as soon
as reasonably practicable after the date hereof.

  
      

 (c) Seller and Purchaser agree that they will seek with respect to each Lease set forth on _Schedule 5.2(c)_ attached hereto a written consent and/or waiver from either the Landlord under such Lease, any ground lessor and/or from other property owners pursuant to a recorded declaration, pursuant to which such Landlord, ground lessors or property owners, as applicable, consents to (as applicable, based upon the terms of such Lease, ground lease or declaration): (i) the assignment of such Lease from Seller to Purchaser and Landlord waives any termination or recapture rights in favor of such Landlord under the Lease, (ii) the closing of business at the Leased Property by Purchaser (after such assignment and transfer of the Lease) for up to ninety (90) days (subject to extension for up to forty-five (45) days due to unusually severe weather conditions, labor strikes, latent defects or conditions in or on the Property discovered by Purchaser during construction, and other materially adverse events not within Purchasers reasonable control, provided that if any such latent defects or conditions require that Purchaser obtain a building permit from a Governmental Entity in order to remedy such defect or condition, then the extension period shall end on the date forty five (45) days after the issuance by the Governmental Entity to Purchaser of such building permit) for purposes of renovating the    ##### 

  

   

Property for Purchasers intended use, (iii) Purchaser making exterior and/or
structural alterations to the Improvements on the Property for purposes of
(x) compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act, (y) constructing
an awning or rain shelter at the front entrance of the Property, and/or
(z) constructing a customer pick up dock, and consents to a change in the
signage on the Property, and/or (iv) the recording of a memorandum of lease
or similar instrument sufficient to enable the Title Company to issue a
Leasehold Policy (and execution of such document by the Landlord) with
respect to those Leased Properties located in Puerto Rico for which no
memorandum of lease or similar instrument is currently recorded (such
consents being hereinafter referred to collectively as the "Required
Consents"). The form of Required Consents to be sent to Landlords, ground
lessors or property owners, as applicable, shall be approved by Seller and
Purchaser, and, once approved, Seller shall send the Required Consent forms
to the Landlords, ground lessors and property owners. Seller and Purchaser
shall each use their reasonable best efforts to obtain the Required Consents
as soon as practicable after the Effective Date, provided, however, that
neither Seller nor Purchaser shall have any obligation to pay any sum of
money or commence any action or proceeding in order to obtain the same. In
connection with seeking each Required Consent, Purchaser shall cooperate with
the reasonable requests of the Landlords, ground lessors or property owners
(including, without limitation, reasonable modifications to the Lease
or other applicable documents), provided that in no event shall Purchaser
be required, in connection with obtaining a Required Consent, to (i) pay any
sum of money to any Landlord, ground lessor or property owner (including
through any increase in rent or additional charges), or (ii) make any
agreements that could increase Purchasers liability under a Lease or other
applicable documents or materially interfere with or otherwise adversely
affect in any material respect Purchasers ability to conduct its intended
business on the Property. Seller and Purchaser (x) shall jointly meet and/or
communicate with each Landlord, ground lessor or property owner with respect
to any initial request for a Required Consent, and (y) following such initial
meeting or communication, shall establish and adhere to mutually acceptable
procedures for communicating with Landlords, ground lessors or property
owners and their representatives and attorneys with respect to such Required
Consents and keeping the other party (to the extent that such other party is
not involved in such subsequent meetings or communications) advised with
respect thereto.    

 (d) Seller and Purchaser shall promptly request, and use reasonable and good faith efforts to obtain prior to Closing with respect to any Leased Property, (i) an estoppel letter from each Landlord of the Leased Properties, in substantially the form specified in the particular Lease (provided such form of estoppel is customary for retail leases of such age and location) or, if no form of estoppel is prescribed in a Lease, in substantially the form attached hereto as _Exhibit E_, and dated within thirty (30) days of such Closing; (ii) with respect to any Properties as requested by Purchaser, including without limitation the Properties set forth on _Schedule 5.2(d)_ attached hereto, a subordination, non-disturbance and attornment agreement (an "SNDA") from the Landlords lender and/or, in the event the Lease is actually a sublease subject to a Ground Lease (as hereinafter defined), from Landlords ground lessor, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Purchaser; (iii) a release from the Landlord in favor of Seller with respect to the Lease, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Seller, and (iv) an estoppel letter from each subtenant of the Approved Subleases, in form and substance similar to the form attached to the applicable Approved Sublease, or if no form of estoppel letter is attached to such Approved Sublease, an estoppel letter in substantially the form attached hereto as _Exhibit F_, in each case dated within thirty (30) days of Closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (x) the receipt by    ##### 

  

   

Purchaser of executed estoppels with respect to any Lease or
Approved Sublease shall not be a condition to Purchasers obligation to close
with respect to the transfer and assignment of the applicable Lease provided
that Seller delivers a Seller Tenant Estoppel or Seller Subtenant Estoppel
at Closing for any Leases or Approved Subleases for which such estoppels are
not obtained, (y) the receipt by Seller of an executed release with respect
to any Lease shall not be a condition of Sellers obligation to close with
respect to the transfer and assignment of such Lease, and (z) the receipt by
Purchaser of any SNDAs shall not be a condition to Purchasers obligation to
close with respect to the transfer and assignment of the applicable Lease
except with respect to those Leased Properties described in _Section
10.1(a)(iii)(y)_.    

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement shall
require Purchaser to agree to the sale, transfer, divestiture or other
disposition of any assets (including any lines of business and any
Transferred Assets or Pharmacy Assets to be acquired hereunder) of Purchaser.
Furthermore, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
Seller shall not, without Purchasers prior written consent, take any action
or commit to take any action that would limit the Purchasers freedom of
action with respect to, or its ability to retain, any of the Transferred
Assets or Pharmacy Assets.   

 _Section 5.3. Tax-Deferred Exchange_. Upon the written request of
Seller or Purchaser, the other party agrees to cooperate with the requesting
party to effectuate a tax deferred like kind exchange (an "Exchange") as
contemplated by  _Section 1031_ of the Code, or other tax efficient
transaction, including, in the case of an Exchange, by use of a qualified
intermediary (a "Qualified Intermediary"), with respect to (a) the sale of
any Property by Seller and/or (b) the acquisition of any Property by
Purchaser or a permitted assignee of Purchaser; provided, however, that (i)
neither party shall have any liability to the other if such other party is
unable to effectuate an Exchange (or other tax efficient transaction) for any
reason, other than by reason of a default under this Agreement by the other
party, including, without limitation, that neither party shall have liability
under any circumstances for any part of any tax savings or tax benefit that
the other party might have enjoyed by reason of an Exchange; (ii) either
partys ability to effectuate an Exchange (or other tax efficient
transaction) shall not be a condition to its obligation to consummate any
transaction contemplated by this Agreement, and (iii) neither party shall be
obligated to incur any costs, expenses or liabilities of the other party with
respect to the Exchange. Either partys election to exchange, rather than
sell or buy any Property for other real estate of a like kind shall be at no
cost or liability to the other, and the Exchanger (as defined below) shall
pay all additional costs associated with the use of the
Qualified Intermediary. Should a Property become part of an Exchange, each
party electing to exchange the Property (the "Exchanger") hereby agrees that
the other party may enforce and all representations, warranties, covenants
and other obligations of the Exchanger under this Agreement directly against
the Exchanger, and the other party agrees that the Exchanger may enforce any
and all representations, warranties, covenants and other obligations of the
other party under this Agreement directly against the other party. If both
parties request an Exchange with respect to the same Property, the parties
agree to cooperate to effectuate such Exchange in accordance with the
preceding principles.   

 _Section 5.4. Disclosure_. Purchaser and Seller will each use
their reasonable best efforts to coordinate and simultaneously release their
first public announcement or press release relating to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. In addition, prior to the Initial   ##### 

  

   

Closing Date, Purchaser and Seller shall consult with each other
before issuing, and provide each other a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment upon, any press release or other similar written public statements
with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby (including, without
limitation, the first public announcement or press release) and shall not
issue any such press release or written public statement prior to such
consultation, except as may be required by Applicable Law, by court process
or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national
securities exchange.   

 _Section 5.5. Additional Approved Sublease Documents_. With respect to
any documents (or portions thereof) set forth on _Schedule 5.5_ or noted on
_Schedule 8.1(j)_ as having not been made available by Seller to Purchaser
prior to the Effective Date (collectively, "Additional Approved Sublease
Documents"), Seller shall use good faith efforts to provide to Purchaser, at
least ten (10) Business Days prior to the applicable Closing, true and
complete copies of such Additional Approved Sublease Documents.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller shall deliver to Purchaser, at least
ten (10) Business Days prior to the then applicable Closing, true and
complete copies of the Additional Approved Sublease Documents set forth on
_Schedule 5.5_ attached hereto.   

 _Section 5.6.  Purchase of Fee Interest in Leased Properties_.
Prior to the Closing Date with respect to a Leased Property, Purchaser shall
not acquire or attempt to acquire the underlying fee simple interest with
respect to such Leased Property, or make any offer or purchase inquiry with
respect thereto. Seller (or its affiliates) shall be entitled to acquire or
enter into a contract to acquire the underlying fee simple interest with
respect to any Leased Property prior to the Closing Date with respect to such
Leased Property, provided, that, in the event of such acquisition, Seller
shall, as the fee owner of such Leased Property, consent to (without
requiring Purchaser to agree to amend or otherwise modify the Lease) (i) the
assignment of the leasehold interest in the Lease to Purchaser, (ii) the
closing of business at the Leased Property by Purchaser in connection with
any renovation of the Leased Property for Purchasers intended use as
contemplated hereunder, and (iii) structural or exterior alterations or
changes in signage in accordance with the standard plans and specifications
for Purchasers use as a [Sears] brand store to the extent such Lease
requires the consent of the Landlord to any of the foregoing. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, neither Seller nor any affiliate of any of Seller shall
purchase or enter into a contract to purchase the fee simple interest with
respect to more than twenty five (25) of the Leased Properties prior to the
final Closing Date, without the prior written approval of Purchaser.   

 _Section 5.7. Employee Matters_.    

(a) From and after the applicable Closing Date until the
Occupancy Delivery Date with respect to a Property, Seller shall cooperate
with Purchaser to attempt to make available to Purchaser (or any of its
officers, employees or agents or its Designee) each Employee (including all
pharmacy personnel) employed by Seller at such Property (a "Store Employee")
for the purpose of interviewing such individuals for possible employment with
Purchaser or its Designee, to the extent that such individuals desire to
interview for possible employment with Purchaser or its Designee. Prior to
the Occupancy Delivery Date with respect to a Property, Purchaser shall
arrange an interview with each interested Store Employee employed at such
Property for possible employment with Purchaser or its Designee. However,
notwithstanding the    ##### 

  

   

foregoing, nothing in this Agreement shall obligate or constitute
the agreement of Purchaser or any of its affiliates or its Designee to
recruit or hire any Store Employee or any other employee or former employee
of Seller. Furthermore, in the event that Purchaser or any of its affiliates
or its Designee determines to hire any Store Employee or any other employee
or former employee of Seller, any such hiring and employment shall be at the
sole discretion of Purchaser or its Designee and any terms or conditions of
such employment shall be determined by Purchaser or its Designee, in its
respective sole discretion.    

 (b) From and after the Effective Date until thirty (30) days (or sixty (60) with respect to Pharmacy Employee) after the applicable Closing with respect to a Property, Seller shall not transfer or reassign any pharmacy personnel employed by Seller in connection with Sellers operation of its pharmacy business from any Property (a "Pharmacy Employee") or any store manager or assistant store manager (either, a "Store Manager") employed by Seller at such Property to any other stores of Seller or any of its subsidiaries, unless such a Pharmacy Employee or Store Manager requests a transfer or reassignment for health or family reasons or for similar reasons, in which case Seller may transfer or reassign such employee and Seller shall promptly notify Purchaser of any such transfer or reassignment. From and after the Effective Date until the applicable Closing Date with respect to a Property, Seller may communicate with, but shall not make an offer to, any Pharmacy Employee or Store Manager employed by Seller at such Property to continue to work for Seller after the applicable Occupancy Delivery Date; provided, however, in the event Seller notifies Purchaser that it desires to make an offer to a Store Manager prior to the applicable Closing Date and provides Purchaser with no less than ten (10) days after Purchasers receipt of such notice to interview such Store Manager for possible employment with Purchaser, Seller may make an offer to such Store Manager at any time after such ten (10) day period. Except as set forth in the preceding sentence, Purchaser shall not recruit, solicit, interview, make an offer to or otherwise communicate with Sellers Employees prior to the Closing Date for the applicable Property. After the Closing Date for the applicable Property, both Seller and Purchaser shall have the right to recruit, solicit, interview, make an offer to and communicate with Sellers Employees with respect to prospective employment, except that (notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Section 5.7(b)) with respect to Pharmacy Employees Seller may not make an offer of employment to such Pharmacy Employee (or engage such Pharmacy Employee as an independent contractor or leased employee) for any other store of Seller or any of its subsidiaries during the period beginning on the Effective Date and ending on the sixtieth (60th) day after the applicable Closing Date, subject to the limitations on Sellers right to transfer or reassign Pharmacy Employees or Store Managers, for health or family or similar reasons, pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 5.7(b).    

 (c) Seller shall be liable for all claims relating to COBRA continuation coverage (within the meaning of Treas. Reg.  _Section 59.4980B-9_) attributable to "qualifying events" with respect to any Employee and his or her beneficiaries and dependents that occur on or before the Occupancy Delivery Date with respect to the Property at which the Employee rendered service; provided that Purchaser shall not take, or encourage any other person to take, any measures that discourage or are intended to discourage any Employee hired by Purchaser from enrolling in Purchasers health and medical plans, programs, policies or arrangements, nor shall Purchaser take, or encourage or facilitate any other person to take, any measures that encourage or are intended to encourage any Employee to apply for COBRA continuation coverage.    ##### 

  

  

 _Section 5.8. Environmental Due Diligence for Approved Sublease Space_.
Purchaser shall have the right subject to the Confidentiality and
Access Agreement to perform Phase I and Phase II environmental investigations
with respect to the portions of the Properties subleased pursuant to the
Approved Subleases (each a "Subleased Premises") identified on _Schedule
5.8_. In the event any such report discloses an environmental condition in,
on, under or relating to any such Subleased Premises which is in violation of
any Environmental Law and the estimated cost to remediate such
environmental condition is reasonably estimated by Purchasers consultant to
exceed five percent (5%) of the Purchase Price allocable to such Property,
Purchaser shall notify Seller in writing of the same, and Purchaser shall
have the right, within thirty (30) days after the Effective Date, to
terminate this Agreement with respect to such Property, in which event the
Property Termination Procedure shall apply.   

 _ARTICLE VI_     

 _STATUS OF TITLE TO THE PROPERTIES_     

 _Section 6.1. Preliminary Evidence of Title_. Within thirty (30)
days following the Effective Date, Purchaser shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain each of the following documents (and shall
provide to Seller a copy of such documents promptly after Purchasers receipt
thereof):    

 (a) with respect to the Owned Properties, title insurance commitments (the "Owners Title Commitments") for ALTA Form B (1992) Owners Title Insurance Policies proposing to insure Purchaser and committing to insure each Owned Property, issued by First American Title Insurance Company (referred to herein as the "Title Company" or "Escrowee").    

 (b) with respect to the Leased Properties, leasehold title insurance commitments (the "Leasehold Commitments," and, together with the Owners Title Commitments, the "Title Commitments") for ALTA Leasehold Owners Title Insurance Policies proposing to insure Purchaser and committing to insure the leasehold interest in each Leased Property, issued by the Title Company.    

 (c) current survey plats (collectively, the "Surveys") of each of the Properties certified to Purchaser and the Title Company (and such other persons or entities as Purchaser may designate) by a surveyor registered in the state in which such Property is located, prepared in accordance with the Minimum Standard Detail Requirements for ALTA/ACSM Land Title Surveys.   

 _Section 6.2. Title Defects_. If any Title Commitment or Survey
discloses any (i) mortgages, deeds of trust, financing statements, judgments,
mechanics liens, materialmens liens, tax liens, or similar monetary liens,
(ii) material encroachments, or (iii) other title exceptions or defects that
materially and adversely affect the future use or operation of a Property as
a Sears brand retail store, including, without limitation, the sale of
consumables and transactional merchandise (a "Material Title Defect"),
Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts to notify Seller in
writing of such Material Title Defect within ten (10) days after Purchasers
receipt of a Title Commitment and Survey for a Property, but in no event
later    ##### 

  

 

than forty five (45) days after the Effective Date (the "Title
Review Period"), and Seller shall have ten (10) days from the receipt of
Purchasers notice ("Sellers Title Cure Election Period") to elect whether
to have the Material Title Defect removed or cured (or to commit to do the
same), to the reasonable satisfaction of Purchaser. In the event Seller
elects, within Sellers Title Cure Election Period, not to remove or cure
such Material Title Defect, Purchaser shall have the option, within ten (10)
days after the expiration of Sellers Title Cure Election Period, to either
(i) waive such Material Title Defect and proceed to Closing for such Property
in accordance with this Agreement, or (ii) elect not to acquire such Property
and related Transferred Assets, in which event the Property Termination
Procedure shall apply. In the event Seller elects, within Sellers Title Cure
Election Period, to remove or cure such Material Title Defect, Seller shall
be entitled to a period ending on the later of (1) 30 days after the
expiration of Sellers Title Cure Election Period, or (2) the Closing Date
with respect to such Property, to remove or cure such Material Title Defect,
upon which removal or cure the parties shall proceed to Closing for such
Property in accordance with this Agreement. Any liens, encumbrances, title
defects or other title exceptions disclosed in any Title Commitment or Survey
and which do not constitute Material Title Defects (and any Material Title
Defects which Purchaser elects to waive pursuant to this _Section 6.2_),
shall be referred to herein as the "Permitted Exceptions". Notwithstanding
the foregoing, Seller shall cause to be removed and discharged of record
prior to Closing (i) any lien encumbering the Property and securing money
borrowed by Seller, and (ii) any mechanics lien, judgment lien or other lien
securing a liquidated sum relating to work performed by or on behalf of
Seller or otherwise required to be removed by Seller pursuant to the
applicable Lease for such Property, provided that Seller shall not be
required to remove or discharge at Closing any bona fide mechanics liens,
judgment liens or other liens (excluding judgment liens relating to non-
appealable judgments) encumbering the Property and described in this clause
(ii) if the aggregate amount of such liens exceeds five percent (5%) of the
Purchase Price allocated to such Property, and if Seller so elects not to
remove and discharge such liens at Closing pursuant to this proviso, then
Purchaser shall have the same rights (as set forth in the second sentence of
this _Section 6.2_) as if Seller shall have elected not to cure a Material
Title Defect, except that if Purchaser elects to waive such Material Title
Defect and to proceed to Closing, the Purchase Price allocated to such
Property shall be reduced by five percent (5%).   

 _Section 6.3. Permitted Exceptions_. As used in this Agreement, the
term "Permitted Exceptions" shall mean the following:    

 (a) the matters deemed to be Permitted Exceptions pursuant to  _Section 6.2_;    

 (b) any title exceptions or defects (A) over which the Title Company is willing to insure (without additional cost to Purchaser or where Seller pays such cost for Purchasers account), (B) against which the Title Company is willing to provide affirmative insurance (without additional cost to Purchaser or where Seller pays such cost for Purchasers account) (provided that any insurance by the Title Company pursuant to clauses (A) and (B) shall be in a form acceptable to Purchaser in its reasonable discretion), (C) which will be extinguished upon the Closing of the Property, or (D) which are the responsibility of a Landlord under a Lease to cure, correct or remove and which will not result in a forfeiture of the tenants interest under the Lease or in the Property;    ##### 

  

   

 (c) Real property taxes which are a lien but not yet due and payable, subject to proration in accordance with _Section 4_;    

 (d) any Applicable Laws, rules, regulations, statutes, ordinances, orders or other legal requirements affecting the Property, including, without limitation, those relating to zoning and land use;    

 (e) any installment not due and payable as of the Closing Date of assessments imposed after the date hereof and affecting the Property or any portion thereof; and    

 (f) any utility company rights, easements and franchises for electricity, water, steam, gas, telephone or other service or the right to use and maintain poles, lines, wires, cables, pipes, boxes and other fixtures and facilities in, over, under and upon the Property, provided the same do not materially and adversely affect the present use of the Property and will not materially and adversely affect Purchasers intended use of the Property.   

 _Section 6.4. Cooperation By Seller_. If necessary in order for the
Title Company to issue a Title Commitment or to deliver to Purchaser copies
of the underlying title documents, Seller shall, promptly after request from
Purchaser or Purchasers attorneys, (and, if necessary, shall request that
the applicable Landlord) deliver to the Title Company or any applicable
Governmental Entity any authorizations reasonably required by the Title
Company or the applicable Governmental Entity, in order to release such
documents to Purchaser.   

 _ARTICLE VII_     

 _CASUALTY LOSS AND CONDEMNATION_     

 _Section 7.1. Condemnation or Material Casualty_. If, prior to any
Closing, any Property or any part thereof shall be condemned, or destroyed or
materially damaged by fire or other casualty (that is, damage or destruction
which Purchaser and Seller reasonably estimate would cost in excess of
$750,000 to repair or restore or which materially impedes access to the
respective Property or any material part thereof) (a "Material Casualty"),
Purchaser shall have the option, which may be exercised not later than the
later of (x) ten (10) days prior to the applicable Closing, or (y) ten (10)
days following the date Purchaser receives written notice of the condemnation
or material damage, to:    

(a) proceed to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement with respect to the Property, notwithstanding such casualty
or condemnation, and receive a credit at Closing in the amount of the
costs to repair any damage (in an amount reasonably acceptable to Seller
and Purchaser); or    

(b) elect not to acquire the Property and other Transferred
Assets related to such Property, in which event the Property
Termination Procedure shall apply.    

(c) In the event that Seller and Purchaser cannot agree as to the amount
of credit set forth in _Section 7.1(a)_ above, Seller and Purchaser agree to
promptly submit the matter to an independent, licensed third party contractor
that has performed similar work    ##### 

  

  

 in the area where the Property is located (a "Qualified Contractor") and
that is mutually acceptable to Seller and Purchaser, to determine the amount
of such credit. If the parties are unable to agree upon such contractor, each
party shall select a Qualified Contractor, and the two (2) contractors shall
mutually agree on a third Qualified Contractor, which third contractor shall
determine the amount of such credit. Each party shall pay the cost of its
respective contractor and the parties shall each pay for one-half of the cost
of the mutually acceptable contractor or the third contractor, as
applicable.    

 _Section 7.2. Non-Material Casualty_. If there is any other damage or destruction (that is, damage or destruction which Purchaser and Seller reasonably estimate would cost $750,000 or less to repair or restore, or which does not materially impede access to the Property or any material part thereof), Seller shall either, at Sellers option, (i) completely repair such damage prior to Closing in a manner reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser, or (ii) allow Purchaser a credit against the Purchase Price in an amount equal to the estimated cost of repair (determined as set forth in _Section 7.1_ above), as of the Closing Date.   

 _ARTICLE VIII_     

 _REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES_     

 _Section 8.1. Sellers Representations and Warranties_. Seller
represents and warrants to Purchaser that the following are true, complete
and correct as of the Effective Date and shall be true, complete and correct
as of each Closing Date (with respect to the Properties being transferred and
conveyed as of such Closing Date):    

 (a) Seller is duly organized, validly existing, and in good standing under the laws of the State in which Seller was incorporated. Seller has all requisite corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Seller and the consummation by Seller of the transactions contemplated hereby has been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action and no other corporate proceedings on the part of Seller are necessary to authorize this Agreement or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Seller and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement by Purchaser, constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of Seller, enforceable against Seller in accordance with its terms, except as may be limited by (i) any bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws now or hereafter in effect relating to creditors rights, and (ii) the law of fraudulent transfer and conveyance.    

 (b) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor its performance by Seller will conflict with or result in the breach of any contract, agreement, or Applicable Laws to which Seller is a party, other than Leases, ground leases or Permitted Exception documents for which Required Consents are necessary as set forth in _Section 5.2(c)_.    ##### 

  

   

 (c) No approvals, consents, authorizations, declarations, registrations or notices of or to any Governmental Entity that have not been received or made is required by or with respect to Seller in connection with the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by Seller or the consummation by Seller of the transactions contemplated hereby except for (i) the filing of any premerger notification and report forms and the expiration or termination of any waiting periods required by the HSR Act, (ii) any applicable approvals, consents, authorizations, declarations, registrations or notices under any pharmacy regulations or to any Governmental Entities or third party administrators in connection with the transactions contemplated under _Article II_ ("Pharmacy Approvals"), and (iii) any other approvals, consents, authorizations, declarations, registrations or notices that, if not made or obtained, would not materially and adversely affect the ability of Seller to perform its obligations under this Agreement or under any instrument, document or agreement required to be executed and delivered pursuant hereto (collectively, the "Related Agreements") or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.    

 (d) Seller is the owner of the Personal Property, free and clear of all liens and encumbrances.    

 (e) Seller has not entered into any currently effective agreement to lease (other than the Leases), sell, mortgage or otherwise encumber or dispose of its interest in any of the Transferred Assets or any part thereof (other than currently effective Subleases, or otherwise in the ordinary course of business), except for this Agreement, any Permitted Exceptions and mortgages, deeds of trust or other encumbrances that will be satisfied and released from the Properties at or before the Closing.    

 (f) Except as set forth on _Schedule 8.1(f)_ attached hereto, to the knowledge of Seller, Seller has not received any written notice that the Transferred Assets or any part thereof are presently in violation in any material respect of any Applicable Laws, or any covenants or restrictions of record applicable to the particular Transferred Assets, provided that notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the provisions of this  _Section 8.1(f)_ relating to Violations shall be applicable only as of the Effective Date, and any Violations issued with respect to the Properties subsequent to the Effective Date shall be governed by _Section 5.1(d)_ hereof.    

 (g) Except as set forth on _Schedule 8.1(g)_, to the knowledge of Seller, there is no action, proceeding or investigation pending or threatened against or involving the Transferred Assets or against Seller with respect to the Transferred Assets before any court or governmental department, commission, board, agency or instrumentality.    

 (h) Except as set forth on _Schedule 8.1(h)_ attached hereto, Seller has not received written notice of any proposed material reassessment of any Property for purposes of real estate taxes. Except as set forth on  _Schedule 8.1(h-1)_, Seller has not received written notice of any special or general assessments affecting any Property.    

 (i) _Schedule 1.1(b)-1_ describes all of the Leases, including all amendments, modifications and revisions thereof (all of which are deemed included within the term    ##### 

  

   

"Leases" defined herein), and Seller has made available to Purchaser true and
complete copies of all Leases, except as set forth on _Schedule 1.1(b)-1_.
Each of the Leases is in full force and effect. To Sellers knowledge, no
commissions to any broker or leasing agent and payable by Seller are due or
will become due pursuant to an agreement made by Seller on account of any of
the Leases or upon extension or renewal of the original term thereof, whether
or not pursuant to an option or other rights contained in the Lease. Except
as set forth on _Schedule 8.1(i)-1_ attached hereto, Seller has not received
or given any written notice from or to a Landlord that any default exists on
the part of the Seller or the respective Landlord under any of the Leases,
which default has not been cured. _Schedule 8.1(i)-2_ discloses all
unapplied security and other deposits held by Landlords under the Leases.
Seller has not made any advance payment of rent (other than for the current
month) on account of any of the Leases. All written or oral leases,
subleases, license agreements, concession agreements or tenancies or rights
of possession affecting the Leased Properties entered into by Seller other
than the Leases (collectively, the "Subleases") shall be terminated effective
at or prior to each Occupancy Delivery Date (except for those Subleases
and consent agreements listed on _Schedule 8.1(j)_, which shall not
be terminated (the "Approved Subleases")). All of the Leases are
assignable by Seller at Closing as contemplated by this Agreement without

 _Section 11.2. Proceedings Involving Third Parties_. The rights
and obligations of Purchaser and Seller in connection with their
respective indemnities pursuant to _Section 11.1_    ##### 

  

 

hereunder resulting from any claim or other assertion of liability by a third
party (a "Third Party Proceeding") shall be subject to the following terms
and conditions:    

 (a) The Indemnified Person shall give prompt written notice of such Third Party Proceeding to the party from whom indemnification is sought (the "Indemnifying Person"), but the failure to give such notice or a delay in giving such notice shall not affect the Indemnified Persons right to indemnification or the Indemnifying Persons obligation to indemnify as set forth in this Agreement, except to the extent the Indemnifying Persons ability to remedy, contest, defend or settle with respect to such Third Party Proceeding is actually prejudiced thereby. Such written notice shall describe in reasonable detail the facts constituting the basis for such Third Party Proceeding and the amount of the potential Loss, in each case to the extent known. Within twenty (20) days after delivery of such notification, the Indemnifying Person may, upon written notice thereof to the Indemnified Person, elect to assume control of the Third Party Proceeding with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnified Person shall retain control of such Third Party Proceeding if (i) the Indemnifying Person elects not to assume control, (ii) the Indemnifying Person shall fail to undertake to defend such Third Party Proceeding, or diligently pursue or maintain such defense, within a reasonable time after receipt of notice thereof, (iii) the Indemnified Person reasonably concludes that the Indemnifying Person and Indemnified Person have conflicting interests with respect to such Third Party Proceeding which may materially and adversely affect the Indemnified Person, or (iv) the Third Party Proceeding involves a claim for injunctive, equitable or other non-monetary relief.

The Indemnifying Person shall not agree to any settlement of, or the entry of any judgment arising from, any such Third Party Proceeding without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Person, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; provided that the consent of the Indemnified Person shall not be required if (i) the Indemnifying Person agrees in writing to pay all amounts payable pursuant to such settlement or judgment, and (ii) the proposed settlement of such Third Party Proceeding (x) includes as an unconditional term thereof a complete and irrevocable release of the Indemnified Person from all liability with respect to such Third Party Proceeding, (y) provides for no injunctive, equitable or other non-monetary relief against the Indemnified Person, and (z) has no other adverse effect on the Indemnified Person. The Indemnified Person shall not agree to any settlement of, or the entry of any judgment arising from (and the    ##### 

  

   

Indemnifying Person shall have no indemnification obligations with respect
to), any such Third Party Proceeding without the prior written consent of the
Indemnifying Person, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed.   

 _Section 11.3. Objections to Claims for Indemnification; Resolution by
the Parties_. An Indemnifying Person may make a written objection

in reasonable detail the basis therefor. The Objection shall be delivered to
the Indemnified Person within thirty (30) days after receipt by the
Indemnifying Person of notice of a claim for indemnification from an
Indemnified Person. The Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person shall
attempt in good faith to resolve any claim for indemnification to which an
Objection is made. If the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person are
unable to resolve a claim for indemnification to which an Objection has been
made within thirty (30) days of receiving such Objection (as such period may
be extended by mutual agreement between Purchaser and Seller), either the
Indemnifying Person or the Indemnified Person shall serve the other with a
written demand for arbitration within forty-five (45) days of the expiration
of such thirty (30) day period. Any such arbitration shall be held in New
York City and shall be conducted before a single arbitrator mutually
agreeable to Purchaser and Seller and in accordance with the Commercial
Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association. In the event that
within thirty (30) days after submission of any dispute to arbitration
Purchaser and Seller cannot mutually agree on one arbitrator, Purchaser and
Seller shall each select one arbitrator, and the two arbitrators so selected
shall select a third arbitrator. The decision of the arbitrator or, if
applicable, the majority of the three arbitrators regarding any claim for
indemnification to which an Objection has been made shall be binding and
conclusive. Such decision shall be written and shall be supported by written
findings of fact and conclusions, which shall set forth the award, judgment,
decree or order awarded by the arbitrator. The parties agree to complete such
arbitration as expeditiously as reasonably practicable.

indemnification payments made under this Agreement shall be treated by the
parties as an adjustment to the Purchase Price.   

 _Section 11.5. Exclusive Remedy_. The parties hereby acknowledge and
agree that, from and after the Closing Date with respect to an applicable
Property, the exclusive remedy of the parties hereto with respect to any
Losses described in _Sections 11.1(a)_ and _11.1(b)_ relating to such
Property shall be pursuant to indemnification under this _Article XI_;
provided, however, that the foregoing shall not limit the remedies of the
parties in the event of any breach or default under any Take-Back
Lease.

forth in  _Article II_ and _Article VIII_ of this Agreement, and the
indemnification obligations set forth in _Sections 11.1(a)(i)_, and

The indemnification obligations set forth in _Sections 11.1(a)(ii), (iv) and
(v)_ and _11.1(b)(ii)_ shall survive the Closing Date without limitation
except as provided under Applicable Law. The indemnification obligations set
forth in _Section 11.1(a)(iii)_ with respect to any Pharmacy Assets shall
survive the Closing Date for the related Property and shall expire and
terminate at the later to occur of (1) the Occupancy Delivery Date for the
related Property and (2) the date that is 30 days after the transfer of such
Pharmacy Assets. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, each    ##### 

  

 

representation or warranty that is the subject of one or more claims asserted
in writing prior to the expiration of the twelve (12) month period set forth
above shall survive with respect to the related claim or claims until
the final resolution thereof.

anything to the contrary set forth in _Section 11.1(a)_ of this Agreement or
elsewhere in this Agreement, (a) Purchaser hereby expressly waives,
relinquishes and releases any right or remedy available to it at law, in
equity or under this Agreement, in the event the Closing occurs, to make a
claim against Seller for Losses that Purchaser may incur, or to rescind this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, as the result of any of
Sellers representations or warranties in _Articles II_ or _VIII_ hereof or
in any Seller Subtenant Estoppel or Seller Tenant Estoppel being untrue,
inaccurate or incorrect in any material respect if Purchaser has actual
knowledge that such representation or warranty was untrue, inaccurate or
incorrect at the time of the Closing and Purchaser nevertheless proceeds with
the Closing hereunder, (b) Sellers liability for the breach of any
representations or warranties of Seller contained in _Articles II_ or _VIII_

Seller may incur, or to rescind this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, as the result of any of Purchasers representations or
warranties in _Section 11.1(b)(i)_ being untrue, inaccurate or incorrect if
Seller has actual knowledge (as defined in _Section 8.3_ hereof) that such
representation or warranty was untrue, inaccurate or incorrect at the time of
the Closing and Seller nevertheless proceeds with the Closing hereunder, and
(b) Purchasers liability for breach of any representations or warranties of
Purchaser contained in  _Article VIII_ hereof or pursuant to _Section

representations or warranties shall not exceed $62,100,000, except that there

 _ARTICLE XIV_     

 _ESCROW AGENT_     

 _Section 14.1. Duties and Obligations of Escrow Agent_.    ##### 

  

   

 (a) Upon receipt by Escrow Agent of the Deposit (which term, as used herein, shall refer either to the entire Deposit or, following the Initial Closing, the remaining portion of the Deposit then held by the Escrow Agent), Escrow Agent shall cause the same to be deposited into an interest bearing account selected by Escrow Agent, it being agreed that Escrow Agent shall not be liable for (y) any loss of such investment (unless due to Escrow Agents gross negligence or willful misconduct) or (z) any failure to attain a favorable rate of return on such investment. Escrow Agent shall deliver the Deposit (or applicable portion thereof) to Seller or to Purchaser, as the case may be, under the following conditions:   

       | (i)  |   |

The portion of the Deposit applicable to the Properties being conveyed at
such Closing shall be delivered to Seller at the Closing upon receipt by
Escrow Agent of a statement duly executed by Seller and Purchaser
authorizing such portion of the Deposit to be released.

  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (ii)  |   |

The Deposit (or applicable portion thereof) shall be delivered to Seller
within ten (10) Business Days following receipt by Escrow Agent of written
demand therefor from Seller (a copy of which shall be simultaneously sent by
Seller to Purchaser) stating that Purchaser has defaulted in the performance
of its material obligations under this Agreement, and specifying the Section
of this Agreement that entitles Seller to be paid the Deposit (or portion
thereof), if Purchaser shall not have given notice of objection
in accordance with the provisions set forth below; or

  
      
    | (iii)  |   |

The Deposit (or applicable portion thereof) shall be delivered to Purchaser
within ten (10) Business Days following receipt by Escrow Agent of written
demand therefor from Purchaser (a copy of which shall be simultaneously
sent by Purchaser to Seller) stating that Seller has defaulted in the
performance of its material obligations under this Agreement or that this
Agreement was terminated under circumstances entitling Purchaser to the
return of the Deposit (or portion thereof), and specifying the Section of
this Agreement that entitles Purchaser to the return of the Deposit (or
portion thereof), if Seller shall not have given written notice of objection
in accordance with the provisions set forth below; or

  
      
    | (iv)  |   |

The Deposit shall be delivered to Purchaser or Seller as directed by joint
written instructions of Seller and Purchaser.

  
      

 (b) Upon the delivery of a written demand for the Deposit (or applicable portion thereof) by Seller or Purchaser, pursuant to subsection (ii) or (iii) above, the other party shall have the right to object to the delivery of the Deposit (or applicable portion thereof), by giving notice of such objection to Escrow Agent (with a copy to the party demanding the Deposit (or applicable portion thereof)) at any time within seven (7) days after such partys receipt of notice of the demand for the Deposit (or applicable portion thereof), but not thereafter. Such notice shall set forth the basis for objecting to the delivery of the Deposit. If Escrow Agent shall have timely received such notice of objection, Escrow Agent shall continue to hold the Deposit until    ##### 

  

   

(x) Escrow Agent receives a notice jointly signed by Seller and
Purchaser directing the disbursement of the Deposit (or applicable portion
thereof), in which case Escrow Agent shall then disburse the Deposit (or
applicable portion thereof) in accordance with said direction, or (y)
litigation is commenced between Seller and Purchaser, in which case Escrow
Agent shall deposit the Deposit (or applicable portion thereof) with the
clerk of the court in which said litigation is pending, or (z) Escrow Agent
takes such affirmative steps as Escrow Agent may elect, at Escrow Agents
sole option, in order to terminate Escrow Agents duties hereunder, including
but not limited to depositing the Deposit (or applicable portion thereof) in
court and commencing an action for interpleader, the costs thereof to be
borne by whichever of Seller or Purchaser is the losing party in such
interpleader action.    

 (c) Escrow Agent may rely and act upon any instrument or other writing reasonably believed by Escrow Agent to be genuine and purporting to be signed and presented by any person or persons purporting to have authority to act on behalf of Seller or Purchaser, as the case may be, and shall not be liable in connection with the performance of any duties imposed upon Escrow Agent by the provisions of this Agreement, except for Escrow Agents own gross negligence or willful misconduct. Escrow Agent shall have no duties or responsibilities except those set forth herein. Escrow Agent shall not be bound by any modification, cancellation or rescission of this Agreement unless the same is in writing and signed by Purchaser and Seller, and, if Escrow Agents duties hereunder are affected, unless Escrow Agent shall have given prior written consent thereto. Escrow Agent shall be reimbursed by Seller and Purchaser for any expenses (including reasonable legal fees and disbursements of outside counsel), including all of Escrow Agents fees and expenses with respect to any interpleader action incurred in connection with this Agreement, and such liability shall be joint and several; _provided_ , _however_ , that, as between Purchaser and Seller, the prevailing party in any dispute over the Deposit shall be entitled to reimbursement by the losing party of any such expenses paid to Escrow Agent. In the event that Escrow Agent shall be uncertain as to Escrow Agents duties or rights hereunder, or shall receive instructions from Purchaser or Seller that, in Escrow Agents opinion, are in conflict with any of the provisions hereof, Escrow Agent shall be entitled to hold and apply the Deposit, and may decline to take any other action. After delivery of the Deposit (or applicable portion thereof) in accordance herewith, Escrow Agent shall have no further liability or obligation of any kind whatsoever.    

 (d) Escrow Agent shall have the right at any time to resign as Escrow Agent upon ten (10) Business Days prior notice to Seller and Purchaser. Seller and Purchaser shall jointly select a successor Escrow Agent and shall notify Escrow Agent of the name and address of such successor Escrow Agent within ten (10) Business Days after receipt of notice of Escrow Agent of its intent to resign. If Escrow Agent has not received notice of the name and address of such successor Escrow Agent within such period, Escrow Agent shall have the right to select on behalf of Seller and Purchaser a bank or trust company to act as successor Escrow Agent hereunder. At any time after the expiration of such ten (10) Business Day period, Escrow Agent shall have the right to deliver the Deposit to any successor Escrow Agent selected hereunder, provided such successor Escrow Agent shall execute and deliver to Seller and Purchaser an assumption agreement whereby it assumes all of Escrow Agents obligations hereunder. Upon the delivery of all such amounts and such assumption agreement, the successor Escrow Agent shall become the Escrow Agent for all purposes hereunder and shall have all of the rights and    ##### 

   

   

obligations of the Escrow Agent hereunder, and the resigning Escrow Agent
shall have no further responsibilities or obligations hereunder.    

 (e) Seller and Purchaser shall jointly and severally indemnify and hold harmless Escrow Agent from and against any and all costs, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses, including reasonable costs of investigation, court costs, attorneys fees and disbursements, which may be imposed upon or incurred by Escrow Agent in connection with its acceptance of, or appointment as, Escrow Agent hereunder, or in connection with the performance of its duties hereunder (other than due to the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Escrow Agent), including, without limitation, any litigation arising out of this Agreement or involving the subject matter hereof.    

 (f) The interest earned on the Deposit shall be paid to Purchaser and Purchaser shall pay any income taxes thereon.
