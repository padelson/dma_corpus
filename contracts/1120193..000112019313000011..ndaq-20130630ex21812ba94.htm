Parties acknowledge that, in order to facilitate the proper transfer of the
Acquired Assets to Purchaser, Sellers and their Affiliates may, after
consulting with Purchaser in good faith and reasonably considering
Purchaser\'s views, transfer some or all of the Acquired Assets and Assumed
Liabilities to one or more of the Acquired Subsidiaries. In such case, each
Acquired Asset or Assumed Liability so transferred to an Acquired Subsidiary
shall not be transferred to Purchaser pursuant to Section 2.1(a) or Section
2.2(a), respectively, but instead shall be transferred to Purchaser by virtue
of the transfer of the Acquired Subsidiary Equity. In such circumstances,
upon the terms and subject to the provisions and conditions of this Agreement,
at the Closing, the applicable Seller shall sell, assign, transfer and convey
to Purchaser, and Purchaser shall purchase, acquire and accept from the
applicable Seller, all of the Acquired Subsidiary Equity, free and clear of
all Liens (other than restrictions on transfers of securities imposed by
applicable federal or state securities Laws), which Acquired Subsidiary Equity
shall constitute, and will constitute as of the Closing, all of the equity
interests of each of the Acquired Subsidiaries. \t\t

following the Closing, Purchaser shall prepare a draft allocation of the
consideration, as determined for U.S. federal income Tax purposes, among the
Acquired Assets in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury
Regulations (the "Initial Allocation"). If Parent does not object to the
Initial Allocation within thirty (30) days of receipt, the Initial Allocation
shall be deemed to have been accepted and agreed upon. If Parent objects to
the Initial Allocation, it shall notify Purchaser of such disputed item (or
items) and the basis for its objection, and Purchaser and  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t24  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

Parent shall endeavor to resolve any such dispute. If Parent and Purchaser
are unable to resolve such dispute, the disputed item(s) shall be submitted to
the Accountant for resolution in a manner in accordance with Section 3.7(b).
The Initial Allocation, as may be adjusted pursuant to this Section 2.4, shall
be the "Final Allocation." Each of Parent and Purchaser and their respective
Affiliates shall report and file Tax Returns and shall act, in all respects
and for all Tax purposes in a manner consistent with the Final Allocation, and
neither Parent nor Purchaser shall take any position (whether in audits, Tax
Returns, or otherwise) which is inconsistent with the Final Allocation, except
as required by a "determination" within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the
Code (or any analogous provision of state, local or foreign Law). \t\t

satisfied at the Closing) or waived (if permissible) or (b) at such other
place, time or date as the Parties shall agree upon in writing; provided,
however, that (A) if prior to the three-(3)-month anniversary of the date of

Purchaser does not yet own a broker-dealer contemplated by Section 6.21, then
Purchaser shall have a right to delay the Closing until the earlier of (i)
five (5) Business Days after the date on which Purchaser owns such a broker-
dealer and (ii) the three-(3)-month anniversary of the date of this Agreement;
provided that from and after the date on which Purchaser has exercised its
right to delay the Closing, the condition set forth in Section 7.2(a) and,

of this Agreement and Purchaser shall thereafter cease to have a right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(e) for any breach of any
representation or warranty; and (B) if applicable Law shall prohibit, until
the condition set forth in Section 7.1(a) shall have been satisfied, Sellers
from providing to Purchaser pursuant to Section 6.2(a) information relating to
the Business necessary or appropriate for Purchaser to operate the Business as

 \t\t\tSection 3.7 Post-Closing Adjustment. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) Not later than ninety (90) days after the Closing
Date or such other time as is mutually agreed by the Parties, Purchaser shall
prepare or cause to be prepared, and deliver to Parent a revised Closing Date
Statement and a revised statement of the Adjustment Amount as of the Closing
Date (the "Revised Adjustment Amount"), together with such reasonably detailed
data appropriate to support such revised Closing Date Statement and Revised
Adjustment Amount. The Revised Adjustment Amount shall be prepared in
accordance with GAAP, consistent with the Accounting Principles. In
connection with the preparation of such revised Closing Date Statement and the
calculation of the Revised Adjustment Amount, Sellers shall:  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t27  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

(A) provide Purchaser and its Affiliates (including the Acquired Subsidiaries)
and their authorized representatives with reasonable access, during normal
business hours, upon reasonable notice and without unreasonably interfering
with Sellers\' operations of their businesses, to the relevant books, records
and facilities of the Business and the relevant employees, consultants and
representatives of Parent or its Affiliates who were involved in the
preparation of the Closing Date Statement and Revised Adjustment Amount; and
(B) cooperate in good faith with Purchaser and its Affiliates (including the
Acquired Subsidiaries) and their authorized representatives, in each case, as
reasonably requested by Sellers to evaluate, assess and prepare the Closing
Date Statement and Revised Adjustment Amount. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) For thirty (30) days following the delivery of
the Revised Adjustment Amount, Purchaser shall provide Sellers and their
Affiliates and their authorized representatives with reasonable access to the
relevant books, records, facilities, employees and representatives of
Purchaser reasonably requested by Sellers to evaluate and assess the
preparation of the revised Closing Date Statement and the calculation of the
Revised Adjustment Amount. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) Within thirty (30) days following receipt of the
Revised Adjustment Amount, Parent shall deliver to Purchaser in writing either
its (i) agreement as to the calculation of the Revised Adjustment Amount or
(ii) dispute thereof, specifying in reasonable detail the nature of its
dispute. To be effective, any such notice of dispute shall include a copy of
the Revised Adjustment Amount, marked to indicate those specific line items
that are in dispute (the "Disputed Line Items") and shall be accompanied by
Parent\'s calculation of the Revised Adjustment Amount. In the event that
Parent does not provide a notice of dispute within such thirty (30) day
period, Parent, on behalf of Sellers, shall be deemed to have accepted in full
the Revised Adjustment Amount as prepared by Purchaser, which shall be final
and binding for the purposes hereunder. During the thirty (30) days after the
delivery of such dispute notice to Purchaser, Purchaser and Parent shall
attempt in good faith to resolve any such dispute and finally determine the
final Adjustment Amount. If, at the end of such thirty (30)-day period,
Purchaser and Parent have failed to reach agreement with respect to the final
Adjustment Amount, the matter shall be submitted to KPMG LLP, which shall act
as arbitrator. If KPMG LLP is unable to serve, Purchaser and Parent shall
jointly select another nationally recognized accounting firm that is not the
independent auditor for either Parent or Purchaser and is otherwise neutral
and impartial; provided, however, that if Parent and Purchaser are unable to
select such other accounting firm within thirty (30) days after delivery of
written notice of a disagreement, each of Purchaser and Parent shall cause its
respective selected nationally recognized accounting firm to select another
firm meeting the requirements set forth above or a neutral and impartial
certified public accountant with significant relevant experience. The
accounting firm or accountant so selected shall be referred to herein as the
"Accountant." The Accountant shall determine the final Adjustment Amount in
accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. In making such
determination, the Accountant may only consider Disputed Line Items and must
resolve the matter in accordance with the terms and provisions of this
Agreement; provided that the determination of the Accountant will neither be
more favorable to Purchaser than reflected in the Closing Date Statement or
the Revised Adjustment Amount nor more favorable to Parent than reflected in
Parent\'s dispute notice. The Accountant shall deliver to Parent and
Purchaser, as promptly as practicable and in any event within thirty (30) days
after its appointment, a written report setting forth the resolution of the
final  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t28  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

Adjustment Amount. Such report shall be final and binding upon the Parties to
the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law and may be enforced in any
court having jurisdiction. Each of Purchaser and Parent shall bear all the
fees and costs incurred by it in connection with this arbitration, except that
all fees and expenses relating to the foregoing work by the Accountant shall
be borne by Purchaser, on the one hand, and Parent, on the other hand, in
inverse proportion as they may prevail on the matters resolved by the
Accountant, which proportionate allocation will also be determined by the
Accountant and be included in the Accountant\'s written report. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d) On the second (2nd) Business Day after Purchaser
and Parent agree to the final Adjustment Amount (or after Purchaser and Parent
receive notice of any final determination of the final Adjustment Amount
pursuant to the procedures set forth in Section 3.7(c)), then (i) if the final
Adjustment Amount shall exceed the Estimated Adjustment Amount, then Purchaser
shall pay to Sellers an amount of cash equal to such excess and (ii) if the
Estimated Adjustment Amount shall exceed the final Adjustment Amount, then
Sellers shall pay to Purchaser an amount of cash equal to such excess, in each
of cases (i) and (ii), plus interest on such amount from the Closing Date up
to but excluding the date on which such payment is made at a rate per annum
equal to the Federal Funds Rate as of the Closing Date, calculated on the
basis of a year of three hundred sixty (360) days and the actual number of
days elapsed. Any such payment shall be made by federal funds wire transfer
of immediately available funds to the account(s) of the Party entitled to
receive such payment, which account(s) shall be identified by Purchaser to
Parent or by Parent, on behalf of Sellers, to Purchaser, as the case may be,
not less than two (2) Business Days prior to the date such payment would be
due. \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 3.8 Earn-Out. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) Earn-Out. As additional consideration for the
Acquired Assets, following the Closing, in accordance with Section 3.8(b) and
subject to Sections 3.8(c) and 3.8(d), Purchaser shall issue to BGC US a
number of Purchaser Shares equal to the Earn-Out Number (each, an "Earn-Out
Issuance") for each Measurement Period in which an Earn-Out Date occurs. Each
Earn-Out Issuance shall consist of Purchaser Shares that have been duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable, and shall be free
and clear of all Liens (other than those Liens imposed by applicable federal
or state securities Laws, those set forth in Purchaser\'s Restated Certificate
of Incorporation, in effect as of the date hereof, and those pursuant to
Section 3.8(g) of this Agreement).  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) Earn-Out Statements. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(i) With respect to each Measurement Period in which
an Earn-Out Date occurs, Purchaser shall make an Earn-Out Issuance within five
(5) days of the earlier of (A) the date on which Purchaser shall be required
to file, and (B) the date on which Purchaser shall have filed, its Form 10-Q
quarterly report or Form 10-K annual report, as applicable, in respect of the
fiscal quarter in which the Earn-Out Date occurred. With respect to each
Measurement Period, in the event that Purchaser determines that no Earn-Out
Date occurred, within five (5) days of the earlier of (A) the date on which
Purchaser shall be required to file, and (B) the date on which Purchaser shall
have filed, its Form 10-Q quarterly report or Form 10-K annual report, as
applicable, in respect of  \t\t

the fiscal quarter corresponding to such Measurement Period, Purchaser shall
deliver to Parent a statement that sets forth in reasonable detail its
calculation of the Business Revenue for such Measurement Period (such
statement, the "Earn-Out Statement"); it being understood and agreed that
Purchaser shall have no obligation to deliver any Earn-Out Statement for any
fiscal quarter in a Measurement Period in which an Earn-Out Issuance has been
made. With respect to each Measurement Period, if Purchaser fails to deliver
the Earn-Out Statement on the date on which it is due pursuant to the prior
sentence (the "Earn-Out Statement Deadline"), then an Earn-Out Date shall be
deemed to have occurred with respect to such Measurement Period, and Purchaser
shall make an Earn-Out Issuance with respect to such Measurement Period within
five (5) days following the Earn-Out Statement Deadline. Each Earn-Out
Statement shall provide all reasonable backup calculations necessary to arrive
at Purchaser\'s calculation of the Business Revenue set forth on such Earn-Out
Statement for such Measurement Period and such backup calculations shall be
certified by the corporate controller of Purchaser as having been calculated
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(ii) With respect to any Measurement Period in which
the Purchaser determines that no Earn-Out Date occurred, Purchaser shall, and
shall cause its Affiliates to, keep complete and accurate records in
reasonably sufficient detail to enable Purchaser, Parent and Sellers to
calculate the Business Revenue for such Measurement Period. With respect to
each Measurement Period in which the Purchaser determines that no Earn-Out
Date occurred, Purchaser shall provide Parent, Sellers and their respective
Affiliates and their authorized representatives with access, during normal
business hours, upon reasonable notice and without unreasonably interfering
with Purchaser\'s operation of its businesses (including the Business), to all
books, records, facilities, employees and representatives of Purchaser
reasonably requested by Parent, Sellers and their respective Affiliates to
evaluate and assess the calculation of Business Revenue, including using
commercially reasonable efforts to cause Purchaser\'s accountants to cooperate
and assist Parent, Sellers and their respective Affiliates and their
respective representatives in evaluating the calculation of Business
Revenue. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(iii) Within thirty (30) days of the receipt of the Earn-
Out Statement for the applicable Measurement Period, Parent may deliver to
Purchaser in writing its dispute of such Earn-Out Statement, specifying in
reasonable detail the nature of its dispute. During the thirty (30) days
after the delivery of such dispute notice to Purchaser, Purchaser and Parent
shall attempt in good faith to resolve any such dispute and finally determine
the Business Revenue for such Measurement Period. If, at the end of such
thirty (30) day period, Purchaser and Parent have failed to reach agreement
with respect to the Business Revenue for such Measurement Period, then the
matter shall be submitted to the Accountant, which shall act as arbitrator.
The Accountant shall determine the Business Revenue for such Measurement
Period in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. The
Accountant shall deliver to Parent and Purchaser, as promptly as practicable
and in any event within thirty (30) days after its appointment, a written
report setting forth the resolution of the Business Revenue for such
Measurement Period. Such report shall be final and binding upon the Parties
to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law and may be enforced in any
court having jurisdiction. Each  \t\t

  \t\t\t30  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

of Purchaser and Parent shall bear all the fees and costs incurred by it in
connection with this arbitration, except that all fees and expenses relating
to the foregoing work by the Accountant shall be borne by the Party that does
not prevail on the matters resolved by the Accountant. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(iv) On the second (2nd) Business Day after Purchaser
and Parent agree on the Business Revenue for any Measurement Period (or after
Purchaser and Parent receive notice of any final determination of the Business
Revenue for such Measurement Period pursuant to the procedures set forth in
Section 3.8(b)(iii)), then if the Business Revenue for such Measurement Period
equals or exceeds the Target Revenue, then Purchaser shall make the Earn-Out
Issuance to BGC US for such Measurement Period. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) Acceleration Events. If any Acceleration Event
has occurred, Purchaser shall issue to BGC US, no later than the date on which
such Acceleration Event has occurred, a number of Purchaser Shares equal to
the Acceleration Issuance Number (an "Acceleration Issuance"). An
Acceleration Issuance shall consist of Purchaser Shares that have been duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable, and shall be free
and clear of all Liens (other than those Liens imposed by applicable federal
or state securities Laws, those set forth in Purchaser\'s Restated
Certificate of Incorporation and those pursuant to Section 3.8(g) of this
Agreement). If an Acceleration Issuance shall have occurred, then Purchaser
shall have no further obligations pursuant to Section 3.8(a) and (b), other
than any obligation of Purchaser to make an Earn-Out Issuance for a
Measurement Period that has occurred prior to the date of the Acceleration
Event. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t\t(d) Adjustment of Earn-Out Number for Anti-Dilution.
 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(i) Earn-Out Number. The "Earn-Out Number" shall
mean the Initial Earn-Out Number, as it may be adjusted (if at all) pursuant
to the remaining provisions of this Section 3.8(d); provided that, if more
than one subsection of this Section 3.8(d) is applicable to a single event,
the subsection shall be applied that produces the largest adjustment and no
single event shall cause an adjustment under more than one subsection of this
Section 3.8(d) so as to result in duplication. Any adjustments pursuant to
this Section 3.8(d) shall be made successively whenever an event referred to
herein shall occur.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(ii) Adjustments for Stock Dividends and Distributions.
If Purchaser pays dividends or makes other distributions on Purchaser Shares
in the form of Purchaser Shares, then the Earn-Out Number in effect
immediately prior to the Ex-Date for such dividend or distribution will be
multiplied by the following fraction: \t\t

 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t 
 \t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t\t\tOS0 = the number of Purchaser Shares outstanding immediately
prior to Ex-Date for such dividend or distribution.

 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t 
 \t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t\t\tOS1 = the sum of the number of Purchaser Shares outstanding
immediately prior to the Ex-Date for such dividend or distribution plus the
total number of Purchaser Shares constituting such dividend or distribution.

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tIf any dividend or distribution of the type described in this Section
3.8(d)(ii) is declared but not so paid or made, the Earn-Out Number shall be
immediately readjusted, effective as of the date the Board of Directors of
Purchaser determines not to pay such dividend or distribution, to the Earn-Out
Number that would then be calculated if such dividend or distribution had not
been declared. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(iii) Subdivisions, Splits and Combinations of the
Purchaser Shares. If Purchaser subdivides, splits or combines the Purchaser
Shares, then the Earn-Out Number in effect immediately prior to the effective
date of such share subdivision, split or combination will be multiplied by the
following fraction: \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(iv) Issuance of Stock Purchase Rights. If Purchaser
issues to all or substantially all holders of the Purchaser Shares rights or
warrants (other than rights or warrants issued pursuant to a dividend
reinvestment plan or share purchase plan or other similar plans) entitling
them to subscribe for or purchase the Purchaser Shares at less than the
Current Market Price on the date fixed for the determination of stockholders
entitled to receive such rights or warrants, then the Earn-Out Number in
effect immediately prior to the Ex-Date for such distribution will be
multiplied by the following fraction: \t\t

 \t\t\t\t\t\tOS0 = the number of Purchaser Shares outstanding immediately
prior to the Ex-Date for such distribution.

 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t 
 \t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t\t\tX = the total number of Purchaser Shares issuable pursuant to
such rights or warrants.

 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t 
 \t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t

payable to exercise such rights or warrants divided by the Current Market
Price.

 \t\t

In determining the aggregate offering price payable to exercise such rights or
warrants for such Purchaser Shares, there shall be taken into account any
consideration received for such rights or warrants and the value of such
consideration (if other than cash, to be determined in good faith by the
Purchaser board of directors or committee thereof). If an adjustment to the
Earn-Out Number is required under this clause (iv), delivery of any additional
Purchaser Shares that may be deliverable upon conversion as a result of an
adjustment required under this clause (iv) shall be delayed to the extent
necessary in order to complete the calculations provided in this clause (iv).
To the extent that Purchaser Shares are not delivered after the expiration of
such rights or warrants, the Earn-Out Number shall be readjusted to the Earn-
Out Number that would then be in effect had the adjustments made upon the
issuance of such rights or warrants been made on the basis of delivery of only
the number of Purchaser Shares actually delivered. If such rights or warrants
are not so issued, the Earn-Out Number shall again be adjusted to be the Earn-
Out Number that would then be in effect if such Ex-Date for such distribution
had not been fixed. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(v) Dilutive Issuance. If Purchaser issues Purchaser
Shares in a Dilutive Issuance, then the Earn-Out Number in effect immediately
prior to the Ex-Date for such issuance will be multiplied by the following
fraction: \t\t

prior to the Ex-Date for such Dilutive Issuance.

 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t 
 \t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t\t\tX = the total number of Purchaser Shares issued in the Dilutive
Issuance.

 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t 
 \t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t\t\tY = the number of Purchaser Shares equal to the aggregate price
payable for the Purchaser Shares issued divided by the Current Market Price.

 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t 
 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tIn determining the aggregate offering price payable for such Purchaser
Shares, there shall be taken into account any consideration received by
Purchaser for such Purchaser Shares and the value of such consideration (if
other than cash, to be determined in good faith by the Purchaser board of
directors). If an adjustment to the Earn-Out Number is required under this
clause (v), delivery of any additional Purchaser Shares that may be
deliverable upon conversion as a result of an adjustment required under this
clause (v) shall be delayed to the extent necessary in order to complete the
calculations provided in this clause (v). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(vi) Distributions. If Purchaser distributes to all or
substantially all holders of Purchaser Shares evidences of indebtedness,
shares of capital stock, securities, cash or other assets (excluding any
dividend or distribution referred to in clause (ii) of this Section 3.8(d),
any rights or warrants referred to in clause (iv) of this Section 3.8(d), and
any Non-Dilutive Cash Distribution), then the Earn-Out Number in effect on the
first Business Day of the immediately succeeding fiscal quarter will be
multiplied by the following fraction: \t\t

 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t 
 \t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t\t\tSP0 = the Current Market Price per Purchaser Share on the Ex-
Date for such distribution.

 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t 
 \t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t\t\tFMV = the fair market value of the portion of the distribution
applicable to one Purchaser Share on such date, with such fair market value
equal to (A) in the case of any cash, the amount of such cash, (B) in the
case of any securities that trade on a securities exchange, the opening price
of such security on such securities exchange immediately after the
distribution and (C) in the case of any other asset, as reasonably determined
by the Purchaser board of directors (or committee thereof).

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tWith respect to making an adjustment to the Earn-Out Number with
respect to a cash distribution, Purchaser may at its election (in lieu of
making any adjustments pursuant to this clause (vi) for such cash
distribution) deliver to BGC US an amount in cash payable on all Purchaser
Shares that may be issuable in all Earn-Out Issuances subsequent to the record
date of such cash distribution as if BGC US was the holder of such Purchaser
Shares as of such record date. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(vii) Self-Tender Offers. If Purchaser or any of its
Subsidiaries completes a tender offer, made to all or substantially all
holders of Purchaser Shares, for the Purchaser Shares where the cash and the
value of any other consideration included in the payment per share of the
Purchaser Shares exceeds the arithmetic average of (x) the closing price per
Purchaser Share on the trading day immediately prior to the announcement of
the price of the tender offer and (y) the closing price per Purchaser Share on
the closing date of the tender offer, then the Earn-Out Number in effect at
the open of business on the day following the expiration of the tender offer
will be multiplied by the following fraction: \t\t

 \t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t\t\tSP0 = the arithmetic average of (x) the closing price per
Purchaser Share on the trading day immediately prior to the announcement of
the price of the tender offer and (y) the closing price per Purchaser Share on
the closing date of the tender offer.

 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t 
 \t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t\t\tOS0 = the number of Purchaser Shares outstanding immediately
prior to the expiration of the tender offer, including any shares validly
tendered and not withdrawn.

 \t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t

 \t\t\t\t\t\tAC = the aggregate cash and fair market value of the other
consideration payable in the tender or exchange offer, with such fair market
value equal to (A) in the case of any securities that trade on a securities
exchange, the opening price of such security on such securities exchange
immediately after the completion of the tender offer and (B) in the case of
any other asset, as reasonably determined by the Purchaser board of directors
(or committee thereof).

 \t\t

 \t\t\tIf the application of this clause (vii) to any tender offer would
result in a decrease in the Earn-Out Number, no adjustment shall be made for
such tender offer or exchange offer under this clause (vii). If an adjustment
to the Earn-Out Number is required under this clause (vii), delivery of any
additional Purchaser Shares that may be deliverable as a result of an
adjustment required under this clause (vii) shall be delayed to the extent
necessary in order to complete the calculations provided for in this clause
(vii). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(viii) Rounding of Calculations; Minimum Adjustments. All
calculations under this Section 3.8(d) shall be made to the nearest one-
hundredth (1/100th) of a share. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(ix) Proceedings Relating to any Adjustment. In
connection with any action that would require an adjustment to the Earn-Out
Number pursuant to this Section 3.8(d), Purchaser shall take any action that
may be necessary, including obtaining regulatory, stock exchange or
stockholder approvals or exemptions, in order that Purchaser may thereafter
validly and legally issue as fully paid and nonassessable all shares of
Purchaser Shares that Parent is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section
3.8.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(x) Consequences of Certain Transactions. In the
event of any reclassification of the Purchaser Shares or a consolidation,
merger, combination or binding share exchange involving Purchaser, in each
case in which holders of Purchaser Shares are entitled to receive cash,
securities or other property for Purchaser Shares ("Reference Property"), the
right to receive Purchaser Shares shall be substituted with the right to
receive an amount of Reference Property that would have been deliverable in
such transaction with respect to each such Purchaser Share; provided that
nothing in this clause (x) is intended to limit any such transaction from
triggering an Acceleration Event. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(xi) Notice. In the event that Purchaser shall have
taken any action of the type described in this Section 3.8(d), Purchaser shall
give notice to Parent, in the manner set forth in Section 11.1, which notice
shall specify the record date, if any, with respect to any such action and the
date on which such action has taken place. Such notice shall also set forth
the facts with respect thereto as shall be reasonably necessary to indicate
the effect on the Earn-Out Number. Such notice shall be given no later than
10 days following the taking of such action. Failure to give such notice, or
any defect therein, shall not affect the legality or validity of any such
action. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

Acquired Subsidiary shall, directly or indirectly, (i) offer, pledge, sell,
contract to sell, sell any option or contract to purchase, purchase any option
or contract to sell, grant any option, right or warrant for the sale of, or
otherwise dispose of or transfer any Purchaser Shares or any securities
convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for Purchaser Shares, whether
now owned or hereafter acquired by Parent or with respect to which Parent has
or hereafter acquires the power of disposition, or file, or cause to be filed,
any registration statement under the Securities Act, with respect to any of
the foregoing (collectively, the "Lock-Up Securities") or (ii) enter into any
swap, derivative or any other agreement or any transaction that transfers, in
whole or in part, directly or indirectly, the economic consequence of
ownership of the Lock-Up Securities or the potential economic consequences of
this Earn-Out provision, whether any such swap, derivative or other
transaction is to be settled by delivery of Purchaser Shares or other
securities, in cash or otherwise (each, a "Disposition Transaction"); provided
that any member of the Parent Group or the Cantor Group or any Acquired
Subsidiary may, at any time, as part of their ordinary course of business,
make any Disposition Transaction (1) for the accounts of their unaffiliated
customers or (2) in connection with customer trading, including as principal,
in any currently existing, quoted stock index or publicly traded exchange-
traded fund on a national stock exchange where the number of Purchaser Shares
involved in the Disposition Transaction is consistent with the representation
of Purchaser Shares in such stock index or exchange-traded fund During the
twenty (20) trading days immediately preceding the Closing Date, Purchaser
shall not, directly or indirectly, (i) offer, purchase, contract to purchase,
sell any option or contract to sell, purchase any option or contract to
purchase, acquire any option, right or warrant for the purchase of, or
otherwise purchase or acquire any Purchaser Shares or any securities

such swap, derivative or other transaction is to be settled by delivery of
Purchaser Shares or other securities, in cash or otherwise (each, an
"Acquisition Transaction"); provided that Purchaser may, at any time, as part
of its ordinary course of business, make any (A) Acquisition Transaction for
the accounts of its unaffiliated customers, (B) purchases pursuant to any
employee stock purchase plans that require such purchases and (C) purchases
pursuant to any share repurchase program consistent in amount and timing with
past practice; provided that prior to effecting any such repurchase, Purchaser
shall, through a third-party broker engaged in such repurchase, offer BGC US
to sell to Purchaser such Purchaser Shares at the price at which Purchaser
intends to effect such repurchase. Each Party shall bear and be responsible
for the commissions of its broker in such transaction, and no Party shall bear
or be responsible for the commission of the other Party in such transaction or
any other commission. To the extent that BGC US does not agree to sell such
Purchaser Shares at such price, neither Purchaser nor Purchaser's third-party
broker shall offer to repurchase Purchaser Shares during the twenty (20)
trading days immediately preceding the Closing Date at price that is higher
than that offered to BGC US (which price may be based on volume weighted
average pricing methodology). If BGC US agrees to sell such Purchaser Shares
to Purchaser, then such purchase will be settled at such time that BGC US
would otherwise be entitled to receive an equal or greater number of Purchaser
Shares pursuant to an Earn-Out Issuance (it being agreed that, if the Closing
does not occur for any reason, then all purchases of Purchaser Shares by
Purchaser from BGC US pursuant to this Section 3.8(e) shall be null and void
with no interest, penalty or other payment to either Party in respect of such
purchase). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(f) Ownership Limitation. In the event that any
member of the Parent Group or Cantor Group would be prohibited under
applicable Law from being the beneficial owner (as defined in Section 13(d)-3
of the Exchange Act) of voting securities representing more than 9.9% of
Purchaser\'s outstanding voting securities (the "Ownership Limitation"), then
Purchaser shall be entitled to defer any Earn-Out issuance (or portion
thereof) otherwise required to be issued hereunder if such Earn-Out Issuance
(or portion thereof) would cause the Ownership Limitation to be exceeded,
until such time as such ownership of Purchaser\'s outstanding voting
securities in excess of the Ownership Limitation would not be prohibited by
such applicable Law; provided that, until such Purchaser Shares shall have
been issued, Purchaser shall make payments to BGC US equal to the dividends
that would have been payable on such Purchaser Shares. The Purchaser agrees
to take all reasonable actions as may be requested by any member of the Parent
Group or the Cantor Group to obtain all necessary or required approvals under
applicable Law so such member of the Parent Group or the Cantor Group, as
applicable, may hold outstanding voting securities in excess of the Ownership
Limitation. In the event that the sum of all of the Earn-Out Issuances would
cause Purchaser to issue a number of Purchaser Shares in excess of 19.99% of
the number of Purchaser Shares outstanding as of the date of this Agreement
(the "Share Issuance Limitation") and such issuances would not be permitted by
the listing rules of NASDAQ as of the date hereof without receipt of approval
of the Purchaser's shareholders, then Purchaser shall substitute cash for
Purchaser Shares in any Earn-Out Issuance solely to the extent required so
that the sum of all of the Earn-Out Issuances would cause Purchaser to issue a
number of Purchaser Shares equal to the Share Issuance Limitation, with such
cash equal to (i) the number of Purchaser Shares that Purchaser otherwise
would be obligated to issue to BGC US pursuant to such Earn-Out Issuance,
multiplied by (ii) the Current Market Price as of the date on which Purchaser
otherwise would be obligated to issue such  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t37  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

Purchaser Shares to BGC US pursuant to such Earn-Out Issuance, and such
substitution shall be made with respect to the earliest Earn-Out Issuances
following the Closing.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(g) Disposition Limitations. No member of the Parent
Group or Cantor Group shall directly or indirectly (i) offer, pledge, sell,
contract to sell, sell any option or contract to purchase, purchase any option
or contract to sell, grant any option, right or warrant for the sale of, or
otherwise dispose of or transfer any shares of Purchaser Shares or any
securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for Purchaser
Shares, or (ii) enter into any swap or any other agreement or any transaction
that transfers, in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, the economic
consequence of ownership of the such securities, whether any such swap or
transaction is to be settled by delivery of Purchaser Shares or other
securities, in cash or otherwise (any such transaction, "Potentially
Disruptive Sale Transaction"), in an aggregate amount that, together with any
other Potentially Disruptive Sale Transaction entered into in the immediately
preceding four calendar weeks is an aggregate amount greater than 4.90% of the
number of outstanding Purchaser Shares on such date; provided that none of the
following shall, individually or in the aggregate, constitute a Potentially
Disruptive Sale Transaction: (A) any transaction effected through an
Underwritten Offering (as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement)
pursuant to Section 2.2 of the Registration Rights Agreement, (B) any
transaction involving Purchaser Shares in an amount on any date that is less
than the greater of (1) the DTV for such date or (2) the immediately preceding
Four Week ADTV or (C) any private sale to a purchaser of such Purchaser Shares
that is purchasing for investment without an intention at such time of
distributing or selling such Purchaser Shares; provided, further, that, if
such purchaser acquires pursuant to such private sale a number of Purchaser
Shares greater than an amount equal to (x) the Percentage Amount multiplied by
(y) the number of outstanding Purchaser Shares as of the date of such
transfer, then such purchaser shall agree in writing with Purchaser to be
bound by disposition limitations substantially equivalent to those set forth
in this Section 3.8(g). "Percentage Amount" means 4.90%, which shall be
proportionately increased in the event that the percentage of the outstanding
Purchaser Shares held by any member of the Parent Group or Cantor Group shall
be increased as a result of an action taken by Purchaser, including a share
repurchase, spin-off, split-off or other transaction. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(h) Exemptions. Purchaser shall take all necessary
actions to ensure that the acquisition and ownership of the Purchaser Shares
contemplated to be issued to BGC US pursuant to this Section 3.8 (or any
permitted assignee pursuant to Section 11.8) shall not trigger any rights plan
or other similar plan that Purchaser may adopt in the future (it being
understood that such exemption shall not apply to any other Purchaser Shares
that any member of the Parent Group or Cantor Group may acquire). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) From the date hereof until the earlier of the
Closing and termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms,
subject to applicable Law, each (i) of Sellers, on the one hand, and
Purchaser, on the other, will permit the other and their respective
representatives to have reasonable access, during regular business hours and
upon reasonable advance notice for purposes reasonably consistent with this
Agreement, to their respective properties, premises, facilities, employees and
representatives and books and records to the extent related to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or by the Related Agreements, (ii)
Parent or Purchaser, as applicable, shall direct its respective employees,
agents and representatives and shall cause the employees, agents and
representatives of its respective Affiliates, to cooperate fully with
Purchaser or Sellers, as the case may be, and its respective representatives
to the extent related to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or by
the Related Agreements and (iii) Sellers shall, and shall cause their
Affiliates to, furnish promptly to Purchaser a copy of (x) each regulatory
report, schedule, form, registrations and other documents (and any amendment
with respect thereto) filed with any Governmental Authority to the extent
related to the Business, (y) the internal or external reports related to the
Business and (z) all other information concerning the Business as Purchaser
may reasonably request; provided, however, that nothing  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t61  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

herein shall obligate any Seller or any Acquired Subsidiary or any of their
respective Affiliates to take any actions that would (i) unreasonably
interrupt or interfere with the normal course of their businesses or (ii)
result in any waiver of attorney-client privilege or violate any Laws or the
terms of any Contract to which Seller, any Acquired Subsidiaries or any of
their Affiliates is a party or to which any of their respective assets are
subject; provided, further, that prior to the expiration of any waiting
period under the HSR Act and other similar Law applicable to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, Purchaser and its representatives shall only
be permitted such reasonable access which, in Seller\'s discretion, after
consultation with counsel, is appropriate during such review process.
Purchaser shall comply, and shall cause its representatives to comply, with
all safety, health and security rules applicable to the premises being
visited. In each case, Purchaser and each Seller, as applicable, and its
respective representatives shall comply with the confidentiality obligations
contained herein. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) In addition to the confidentiality arrangements
contained herein, all information provided or obtained in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including pursuant to subsection
(a) above) will be held by Purchaser in accordance with the Non-Disclosure
Agreement, dated October 13, 2011, as amended, between Purchaser and Parent
(the "Non-Disclosure Agreement"). In the event of a conflict or inconsistency
between the terms of this Agreement and the Non-Disclosure Agreement, the
terms of this Agreement will govern.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) Each party hereto shall preserve and keep all
books and records and all information relating to the accounting, business and
financial affairs that are retained by Parent or any of its Affiliates or
obtained by Purchaser hereunder, as the case may be, which information relates
to the Business, the Acquired Assets or the Acquired Subsidiaries prior to the
Closing, for five (5) years after the Closing Date, or for any longer period
as may be (i) required by any Governmental Authority or (ii) reasonably
necessary with respect to the prosecution or defense of any legal action that
is then pending or threatened or audit and with respect to which the
requesting Party has notified the other Party as to the need to retain such
books, records or information. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of
this Section 6.2(c), the provisions of Article VIII shall govern the
preservation, retention and sharing of Tax Returns and Tax work papers. After
the Closing Date, each Party shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to,
permit the other Party and their respective representatives to have reasonable
access to, and to inspect and copy, all materials referred to in this Section
6.2(c) and to meet with officers and employees of the other Party and its
Subsidiaries on a mutually convenient basis in order to obtain explanations
with respect to such materials, to obtain additional information, to call such
officers and employees as witnesses and for any other reasonable business
purpose. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 6.3 Notice. Until the Closing, each of Parent and Purchaser
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to promptly notify the other in
writing of any fact, change, condition, circumstance or occurrence of any
event of which it is aware that will or is reasonably likely to result in the
conditions set forth in Section 7.2(a) or (b) becoming incapable of being
satisfied. Until the Closing, Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to notify Purchaser in writing promptly following any Person set forth on
Section 6.3 of the Seller Disclosure Letter learning that Parent or any of its
Affiliates shall have received from a Material Customer proper written notice
(in accordance with the notice provisions of the applicable Contract) of
 \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t62  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

termination or non-renewal of such Material Customer's contract that
constitutes an Acquired Contract. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 6.4 Efforts; Filings. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, each of Parent and Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts
to take, agree to take, or cause to be taken, any and all actions and to do,
or cause to be done, any and all things necessary, proper or advisable under
applicable Law or otherwise, so as to, as promptly as practicable, consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Related Agreements,
and each shall, and shall cause its respective Affiliates (and in the case of
Parent, the Cantor Group) to, cooperate fully to that end. Subject to Section
6.2 and the Non-Disclosure Agreement, each Party shall (i) permit the other
Parties to review and discuss in advance, and consider in good faith the views
of the other Parties in connection with, any proposed written (or any material
proposed oral) communication with any Governmental Authority regarding the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Related Agreements; and
(ii) promptly inform the other Parties (and if in writing, provide the other
Parties or their counsel with copies of) all correspondence, filings and
communications between the Party and any Governmental Authority regarding the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Related Agreements. The
Parties may, as each deems advisable or necessary, reasonably designate any
competitively sensitive material provided to the other Parties under this
Section 6.4 as "outside counsel only." Such materials and the information
contained therein shall be given only to the outside legal counsel of the
recipient and will not be disclosed by such outside counsel to employees,
officers or directors of the recipient unless express permission is obtained
in advance from the source of the materials (Purchaser or Sellers, as the case
may be) or its legal counsel; provided, however, that materials provided
pursuant to this Section 6.4 may be redacted (x) to remove references
concerning the valuation of the Business, (y) as necessary to comply with
contractual arrangements, or (z) as necessary to address reasonable legal
privilege concerns. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) Without limiting the provisions of Section 6.4(a)
and notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Purchaser shall
take any and all steps necessary to avoid or eliminate each and every
impediment under any antitrust, competition or trade regulation law (including
the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and the
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the "HSR Act")) that may be
asserted with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
the Related Agreements so as to enable the Closing to occur expeditiously;
provided, however, that Purchaser shall not be obligated to divest: (i) the
Business, or (ii) assets unrelated to a marketplace of transactions in U.S.
Treasury Securities, except to the extent that such assets are immaterial or
(iii) any technology that Purchaser is required pursuant to the next sentence
to be willing to agree to license. In addition, if required to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Related Agreements,
Purchaser will, with respect to any third-party competitor of the Business,
both (A) license (non-exclusively with respect to Purchaser) Purchaser\'s
Competitive Technology for use by such competitor in operating a marketplace
of transactions in U.S. Treasury Securities and (B) permit access to, and the
right to modify, the source code underlying such Competitive Technology. For
purposes of the foregoing sentence, the Parties intend that such grant of a
license and access shall, if required to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t63  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

Agreement and the Related Agreements, be for no payment or royalty made to
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates, and that such license shall, if required
to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Related
Agreements, be perpetual. "Competitive Technology" shall mean all technology
of Purchaser and its Subsidiaries that is used by a third-party competitor of
the Business related to a marketplace of transactions in U.S. Treasury
Securities, including, if required to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby, any updates and upgrades of such technology and access to maintenance
of such technology. In addition, Purchaser and Parent shall defend through
litigation on the merits in a U.S. District Court (or any state trial court)
any claim asserted in court by any party in order to avoid entry of, or to
have vacated or terminated, any decree, order or judgment (whether temporary,
preliminary or permanent) that would restrain, prevent or delay the Closing.
For the avoidance of doubt, if Purchaser has complied with its obligations set
forth above, and nonetheless a Governmental Authority has brought an action
under any antitrust, competition or trade regulation Law that has resulted in
a final, permanent Governmental Order preventing the Closing, then either
Party will be entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(b)
without incurring any obligations to each other in connection with such
termination. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, Purchaser shall have the principal responsibility for devising and
implementing the strategy for obtaining any necessary antitrust or competition
clearances and shall take the lead in all meetings and communications with any
Governmental Authority in connection with obtaining any necessary antitrust or
competition clearances. No Party shall participate in any meeting with any
Governmental Authority in connection with this Agreement (or make oral
submissions at meetings or in telephone or other conversations) unless it
consults with the other Parties in advance and, to the extent not prohibited
by such Governmental Authority, gives the other Parties the opportunity to
attend and participate thereat. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) As promptly as practicable but in no event later
than thirty (30) days after the date of this Agreement, Parent and Purchaser
shall prepare and file complete notifications with the Federal Trade
Commission and the United States Department of Justice as are required to
comply with the HSR Act. In the event that the Parties receive a formal
request for additional information or documentary materials after an initial
notification pursuant to the HSR Act, the Parties will use their respective
reasonable best efforts to respond to such request as promptly as possible and
counsel for the Parties will reasonably cooperate during the entirety of any
such process. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d) Each of Parent and Purchaser agrees to use its
reasonable best efforts to prepare all documentation, to effect all filings
and to obtain all permits, consents, clearances, approvals and authorizations
of all Governmental Authorities and other Persons necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Related Agreements as
promptly as practicable.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(e) Purchaser and Sellers shall not, and shall not
permit any of their Subsidiaries to, acquire or agree to acquire by merging or
consolidating with, or by purchasing a substantial portion of the assets of or
equity in, or by any other manner, any business or any corporation,
partnership, association or other business organization or division thereof,
or otherwise acquire or agree to acquire any assets or take any other action
if the entering into of a definitive agreement relating to or the consummation
of such acquisition, merger, consolidation or other action could reasonably be
expected to (i) impose any delay in the obtaining of, or  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t64  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

significantly increase the risk of not obtaining, any authorizations,
consents, orders, declarations or approvals of any Governmental Authority
necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the
expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period, (ii) significantly
increase the risk of any Governmental Authority entering an order prohibiting
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Related Agreements, (iii) significantly increase the risk of not being able to
remove any such order on appeal or otherwise, or (iv) delay or prevent the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Related Agreements. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 6.5 Non-Solicitation of Alternative Transaction. From and
after the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the Closing or the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, Sellers shall not,
nor shall they permit any of their respective Subsidiaries to, nor authorize
or permit any director, officer or employee of Sellers or any of their
respective Affiliates to, and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause any
investment banker, attorney, accountant or other advisor or representative of
Sellers or any of their respective Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly,
(a) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage, or take any other action
knowingly to facilitate, any Alternative Proposal or (b) enter into, continue
or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or
furnish to any person any information with respect to, or otherwise cooperate
in any way with, any Alternative Proposal. The term "Alternative Proposal"
means any inquiry, proposal or offer from any Person relating to any direct or
indirect acquisition, in one transaction or a series of related transactions
(including any merger, consolidation, exchange offer, binding share exchange,
business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution, joint
venture or similar transaction) of any equity or voting interests of an
Acquired Subsidiary or twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the Acquired
Assets; provided that an Alternative Proposal shall not include any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Related Agreements or any
inquiry, offer or proposal to acquire all or a majority of the outstanding
common stock or equity interest of Parent or BGC Holdings. \t\t

the second anniversary of the Closing Date (or, in the event that this
Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, the second anniversary
of the date of this Agreement): \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(i) without the prior written consent of Purchaser,
Parent agrees that no member of the Parent Group and Cantor agrees that no
member of the Cantor Group will, directly or indirectly, (A) hire, employ, or
engage as a consultant, any employee or consultant of any member of the
Purchaser Group (but only if such member is a member of the Purchaser Group as
of the date hereof) or, following the Closing, any Business Employee to whom
Purchaser has made an offer pursuant to Section 6.10(a) or any Business
Consultant to whom Purchaser has made an offer of consulting engagement
pursuant to Section 6.10(k) or (B) solicit, induce, attempt to induce or
otherwise encourage any employee or consultant of any member of the Purchaser
Group (but only if such member is a member of the Purchaser Group as of the
date hereof) or, following the Closing, any Business Employee to whom
Purchaser has made an offer pursuant to Section 6.10(a) or any Business
Consultant to whom Purchaser has made an offer of  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t65  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

consulting engagement pursuant to Section 6.10(k) to terminate employment or
engagement with any member of the Purchaser Group; provided, however, the
foregoing shall not preclude any member of the Parent Group or Cantor Group
from (x) hiring or engaging any such employees whose employment was terminated
by Purchaser or any member of the Purchaser Group (other than for cause) at
least three (3) months prior to the date when he/she was first solicited for
employment by such Person, or (y) making general or public solicitations not
targeted at any such employee; and \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(ii) without the prior written consent of Parent,
Purchaser agrees that no member of the Purchaser Group will, directly or
indirectly, (A) hire, employ, or engage as a consultant, any employee or
consultant (other than any Business Employee or Business Consultant pursuant
to the terms of this Agreement) of any member of the Parent Group or Cantor
Group (but only if such member is a member of the Parent Group or Cantor
Group, as applicable, as of the date hereof) or (B) solicit, induce, attempt
to induce or otherwise encourage any employee or consultant (other than any
Business Employee or Business Consultant pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement) of any member of the Parent Group or Cantor Group (but only if such
member is a member of the Parent Group or Cantor Group, as applicable, as of
the date hereof) to terminate employment or engagement with any member of the
Parent Group or Cantor Group; provided, however, the foregoing shall not
preclude any member of the Purchaser Group from (x) hiring or engaging any
such employees whose employment was terminated by any member of the Parent
Group or Cantor Group (other than for cause) at least three (3) months prior
to the date when he/she was first solicited for employment by a member of the
Purchaser Group or (y) making general or public solicitations not targeted at
any such employee. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tIn the event that any party breaches or violates its obligations under
this Section 6.6(a) prior to the Closing, the non-breaching party shall
provide written notice of such breach or violation to the breaching party and
provide the breaching party with an opportunity to cure such breach, and the
breaching party shall not be deemed to be in breach or violation of this
Section 6.6(a) for purposes of Section 7.2(b), Section 7.3(b), Section 9.1(d)
or Section 9.1(e), as applicable, so long as it shall have taken actions to
cure such breach reasonably promptly following receipt of such notice. In
addition to the foregoing, in the event that any party breaches or violates
its obligations under this Section 6.6(a) prior to or after the Closing
because it did not have knowledge that a Person was or was formerly an
employee or consultant of the other party at the time of the solicitation,
hiring or engagement, as the case may be, of such Person, then the breaching
party shall not be deemed to be in breach or violation of this Section 6.6(a)
so long as it shall have taken actions to cure such breach reasonably promptly
following receipt of notice from the non-breaching party that such Person was
or was formerly an employee or consultant of the non-breaching party \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) From the Closing Date until the third anniversary
thereof, without the prior written consent of Purchaser, and subject to
Section 6.6(c), Parent agrees that no member of the Parent Group and Cantor
agrees that no member of the Cantor Group will, directly or indirectly,
including as principal, sole proprietor, partner, member, stockholder or
investor or in  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t66  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

any other capacity, own, control, manage or operate any business or entity
that, anywhere in the world, in whole or in part, engages in the Competing
Business. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) Nothing in Section 6.6(b) shall preclude any
member of the Parent Group or any member of the Cantor Group from: \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(i) collectively owning ten percent (10%) or less of
the outstanding securities of any Person that are listed on any national
securities exchange or otherwise publicly traded so long as such member is not
otherwise directly or indirectly advising, directing or otherwise engaged in
the Competing Business of such Person, including as an officer, director,
consultant or employee of such Person; \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(ii) acquiring and, after such acquisition, owning an
interest in any Person (or its successor) that is engaged, directly or
indirectly, in a Competing Business if (A) such Competing Business generated
less than ten percent (10%) of such Person\'s consolidated annual revenues in
the last completed fiscal year of such Person and (B) Parent enters into a
definitive agreement to cause the divestiture of the Competing Business within
nine (9) months after the consummation of such acquisition is consummated and
has completed such disposition within six (6) months of the date of such
definitive agreement (the "Divestiture Period"); provided that if such
divestiture has not been consummated due to (x) any applicable waiting period
(including extension thereof) applicable to such divestiture under the HSR
Act, or under any other applicable Law not having expired or been terminated,
or (y) the failure to procure or obtain any required governmental or
regulatory consents, approvals, permits or authorizations applicable to such
divestiture, then the Divestiture Period will automatically be extended so
that it expires one week following the later of the expiration or termination
of such waiting period and the procurement or obtainment of such consents,
approvals, permits and authorizations; provided, further, that in no event
shall the Divestiture Period extend beyond eighteen (18) months following the
acquisition of the Competing Business; \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(iii) exercising its rights under the License Agreement;
 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(iv) engaging in the ordinary or customary activities
of primary dealers designated by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York,
including operating a single dealer electronic platform or a request for quote
platform; provided that such activities shall not include operating a
transparent central limit order book in Recently Announced or Issued or Re-
Opened or First Off-The-Run U.S. Treasury Securities; and \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(v) engaging in any activity that constitutes a de
minimis inadvertent breach or violation of its obligations pursuant to Section
6.6(b); provided that upon receiving notice of such activity Parent and/or its
Affiliate promptly ceases the activity causing such breach. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d) Without limiting any other rights of Purchaser,
Parent (on behalf of itself and the members of the Parent Group) and Cantor
(on behalf of itself and the members of the Cantor Group) acknowledge and
agree that the remedy at law for any breach, or threatened  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t67  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

breach, of any of the provisions of Section 6.6(b) will be inadequate, and,
accordingly, Parent and Cantor hereby acknowledge and agree that Purchaser
shall, in addition to any other rights and remedies which Purchaser may have
at law or otherwise, be entitled to equitable relief, including injunctive
relief, and to the remedy of specific performance with respect to any breach
or threatened breach of Section 6.6(b). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(e) Parent (on behalf of itself and the members of
the Parent Group), Cantor (on behalf of itself and the members of the Cantor
Group) and Purchaser agree that the terms of the covenants in Section 6.6(b),
as modified by Section 6.6(c), are fair and reasonable with respect to their
duration, geographical area and scope, including in light of Purchaser\'s
plans for the Business, are necessary to protect the value of the Acquired
Assets and the Acquired Subsidiary Equity (including the goodwill related
thereto) and were a material and necessary inducement for Purchaser, Parent
(on behalf of itself and the members of the Parent Group) and Cantor (on
behalf of itself and the members of the Cantor Group) to agree to the
transactions contemplated hereby and by the Related Agreements. Parent has
independently consulted with its counsel and after such consultation, hereby
agrees that the covenants set forth in Section 6.6(b), as modified by 6.6(c),
are reasonable and proper. In the event that any provision contained in
Section 6.6(b), as modified Section 6.6(c), shall be determined by any court
of competent jurisdiction or any Governmental Authority to be unenforceable
for any reason whatsoever (including in relation to duration or the scope of
the activities covered thereby), then the Parties agree that the maximum
subject matter, duration, scope, geographic area or other restrictions deemed
reasonable under such circumstances by such court shall be substituted for the
stated subject matter, duration, scope, geographic area or other restrictions,
with it being specifically acknowledged and agreed by Purchaser, Parent and
Cantor that it is their continuing desire that each covenant in Section
6.6(b), as modified by Section 6.6(c), be enforced to the full extent of its
terms and conditions. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 6.7 Further Assurances. After the Closing Date, each of
Parent and Purchaser shall use its commercially reasonable efforts from time
to time to execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, at the
reasonable request of the other Party such additional documents and
instruments (including any assignments, bills of sale, assumption agreements,
consents and other similar instruments in addition to those required by this
Agreement) as may be reasonably required to give effect to this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby, and to provide whatever documents or
other evidence of ownership as may be reasonably requested by Purchaser to
confirm Purchaser\'s ownership of the Acquired Assets and Acquired Subsidiary
Equity. To the extent that any member of the Cantor Group owns or has any
right, title or interest in an Acquired Asset, including those assets set
forth on Section 6.7 of the Seller Disclosure Letter, Cantor shall and shall
cause such member of the Cantor Group to execute and deliver, or cause to be
executed and delivered such documents and instruments (including any
assignments, bills of sale, assumption agreements, consents and other similar
instruments) as may be reasonably required to transfer such ownership or
right, title or interest to Purchaser, and shall also cause such member to
comply with the provisions set forth in Sections 6.1 and 6.8 insofar as they
apply to Affiliates of Sellers that own or have a right, title or interest in
an Acquired Asset. \t\t

resulting therefrom if an attempted assignment thereof, without the consent of
a third party thereto, would constitute a breach or other contravention
thereof or be ineffective with respect to any party thereto or would violate
any applicable Law. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) With respect to any such Contract or Lease and
any claim, right or benefit arising thereunder or resulting therefrom, Sellers
shall, and shall cause their Affiliates to, use commercially reasonable
efforts, and Purchaser shall reasonably cooperate with Sellers and their
Affiliates, to obtain, or cause to be obtained, prior to Closing, any consent,
substitution, approval or amendment (which requests for consents,
substitution, approval or amendment shall be in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Purchaser) required to novate or assign such Contract or
Lease; provided, however, in no event shall any Seller, Purchaser or their
Affiliates be obligated to pay any money (other than a de minimis amount) to
any Person or to otherwise offer or grant other financial or other
accommodations to any Person in connection with obtaining any such consent,
substitution, approval or amendment with respect to any Contract or
Lease. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) If any consent, substitution, approval or
amendment required to novate or assign any Contract or Lease is not obtained
prior to Closing, until the earlier of such time as such consent is obtained
or one (1) year following the Closing Date, Sellers and Purchaser will each
use reasonable best efforts to establish an agency type or other similar
arrangement reasonably satisfactory to Sellers and Purchaser under which
Purchaser would obtain, to the fullest extent practicable, the claims, rights
and benefits and assume the corresponding liabilities and obligations
thereunder from and after the Closing in accordance with this Agreement
(including by means of any subcontracting, sublicensing or subleasing
arrangement) and under which the applicable Seller or its Affiliates would
enforce at the direction of and for the benefit of Purchaser, any and all
claims, rights and benefits of such Seller or Affiliate against a third party
thereto. During such period and without further consideration, (i) Sellers or
its applicable Affiliates will promptly pay, assign and remit to Purchaser
when received all monies and other consideration relating to the period after
the Closing Date received by it under any Contract or any claim, right or
benefit arising thereunder not transferred pursuant to this Section 6.8 and
(ii) Purchaser will promptly pay, perform or discharge when due any Liability
(including any liability for Taxes) arising thereunder after the Closing
Date. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d) Without limiting the generality of the
obligations set forth in Section 2.1(a), any Contract to be assigned,
transferred and conveyed in accordance with Section 2.1(a)(ii) that does not
exclusively relate to the Business (each, a "Shared Contract," including
certain electronic trading agreements, development agreements, pricing
agreements market data vendor agreements and market data direct fee
agreements, shall be assigned, only with respect to (and preserving the
meaning of) those parts that relate to the Business, to either an Acquired
Subsidiary or Purchaser, if so assignable, or appropriately amended prior to,
on or after the Closing (the form and substance of any such amendment to be
reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser), so that Purchaser shall be entitled to
the rights and benefit of those parts of the Shared Contract that relate to
the Business and shall assume the related portion of any Liabilities  \t\t

 \t\t

contemplated by this Agreement; provided, however, that (x) in no event shall
any Person be required to assign (or amend), either in its entirety or in
part, any Shared Contract that is not assignable (or cannot be amended) by its
terms without the consent or approval of a third party thereto and (y) if any
Shared Contract cannot be so partially assigned by its terms or otherwise, or
cannot be amended, without the consent or approval of a third party thereto,
until the earlier of such time as such consent or approval is obtained or one
(1) year following the Closing Date, Sellers and Purchaser will each use
reasonable best efforts to establish an agency type or other similar
arrangement reasonably satisfactory to Sellers and Purchaser under which
Purchaser would obtain, to the fullest extent practicable under such Shared
Contract, the claims, rights and benefits of those parts that relate to the
Business and assume the related portion of the liabilities and obligations
thereunder from and after the Closing in accordance with this Agreement
(including by means of any subcontracting, sublicensing or subleasing
arrangement) and under which Sellers or its applicable Affiliates would
enforce, at the direction of and for the benefit of Purchaser, any and all
claims, rights and benefits of such Seller or Affiliate against a third party
thereto to the extent relating to the Business. During such period and
without further consideration, (i) Sellers and their applicable Affiliates
will promptly pay, assign and remit to Purchaser when received all monies and
other consideration relating to the period after the Closing Date received by
them thereunder or any claim, right or benefit arising thereunder not
transferred pursuant to this Section 6.8 and (ii) Purchaser will promptly pay,
perform or discharge when due any Liability (including any liability for
Taxes) arising thereunder after the Closing Date. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(e) If any consent, substitution, approval or
amendment under any Contract or Lease is required for Sellers or Purchaser to
perform their or its obligations pursuant to the Services Agreement, Parent or
the applicable Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain or
cause to be obtained such consent, substitution, approval or amendment;
provided, however, in no event shall any Seller be obligated to pay any money
(other than a de minimis amount) to any Person or to otherwise offer or grant
other financial or other accommodations to any Person in connection with
obtaining any such consent, substitution, approval or amendment with respect
to any Contract or Lease. \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 6.10 Employee Matters. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) Offers of Employment. No later than five (5)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Purchaser shall make or cause to be
made offers of employment to each of the Business Employees, with such offers
to be effective as of the Closing Date, except as otherwise set forth in
Section 6.10(b). Each such offer of employment shall be on terms and
conditions substantially comparable (but not necessarily identical) to those
terms and conditions of employment applicable to the applicable Business
Employee immediately prior to the Closing. Except as otherwise set forth in
Section 6.10(b), all Business Employees who accept such offers of employment
shall become "Continuing Business Employees" as of the Closing Date.
Effective as of the Closing Date (or, if later, the date such individual
becomes a Business Employee pursuant to Section 6.10(b)), Sellers or their
Affiliates shall cause (i) each Continuing Business Employee to be fully
vested in such employee\'s benefits under any Parent Benefit Plan that is a
qualified or non-qualified pension or retirement plan and (ii) the employment
of each of the Continuing Business Employees with Sellers or their Affiliates
(other than those employed by an Acquired Subsidiary or described in Section
6.10(b)) to be terminated. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) Inactive Employees. Notwithstanding the
provisions of Section 6.10(a), Purchaser\'s offer of employment to any
Business Employee who is inactive as of the Closing Date due to short-term
disability or other leave of absence shall not be effective until such
employee is ready and able to return to work; provided that such employee is
able to return to work within the one (1)-year period commencing on the
Closing Date. Any such employee shall not become a Continuing Business
Employee for purposes hereof until such employee returns to work within such
period. Employees who do not return to work within such period shall not
become Continuing Business Employees unless otherwise agreed to by
Purchaser. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) Employee Benefits Generally. From the Closing
Date until the first anniversary thereof, Purchaser shall provide or cause to
be provided the Continuing Business Employees with compensation and welfare
benefits (excluding any severance or retiree medical benefits) that are not
materially less favorable in the aggregate than those generally provided to
similarly situated employees of Parent or its Affiliates immediately prior to
the Closing. Except as may be specifically required by this Agreement or by
applicable Law, Purchaser or its Affiliates shall not be obligated to provide
any particular employee benefits to any Continuing Business Employee for any
specific period of time. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to limit
the right of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates to terminate the employment of
any Business Employee. \t\t

 \t\t

(d) Severance. With respect to each Continuing Business
Employee whose employment is terminated without cause (as defined in or within
the meaning of the applicable severance plan, policy or statement or other
similar Contract of Seller or any of its Affiliates in existence as of
immediately prior to the Closing) during the one (1)-year period immediately
following the Closing Date, Purchaser shall, except as may otherwise be
required by an Assumed Employment Agreement, provide or cause to be provided
severance benefits and payments equal in value to those which such Continuing
Business Employee would have received under such plan, policy or statement or
other similar Contract had the employment of such Continuing Business Employee
been terminated by Seller or its applicable Affiliate immediately prior to the
Closing, and the amount of such severance benefits and payments shall be
calculated in accordance with the terms of such applicable plan, policy or
statement, Employment Agreement or other similar Contract in effect
immediately prior to the Closing, taking into account the Continuing Business
Employee\'s period of employment prior through the Closing and with Purchaser
or its Affiliates after the Closing. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(e) Preexisting Conditions; Deductibles; Credited
Service. As of the date on which the Continuing Business Employees become
eligible to participate in the applicable Purchaser benefit plans, Purchaser
shall cause to be (i) waived all limitations as to preexisting conditions,
exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage
requirements applicable to Continuing Business Employees under any welfare
plan of Purchaser or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates in which such Continuing
Business Employees may be eligible to participate after the Closing, to the
extent that such conditions, exclusions and waiting periods would have been
waived or satisfied under the corresponding welfare plan in which any such
Continuing Business Employee participated immediately prior to the Closing,
(ii) provided to each Continuing Business Employee credit for any co-payments
and deductibles paid prior to the Closing, in respect of the calendar year in
which the Closing Date occurs, in satisfying any applicable deductible or out-
of-pocket requirements under any welfare plans of Purchaser or its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates in which such Continuing Business Employees may be
eligible to participate after the Closing in the calendar year in which the
Closing Date occurs and (iii) provided to each Continuing Business Employee
credit for purposes of eligibility, vesting and benefit accrual (other than
with respect to any defined benefit pension plan) under each employee benefit
plan, program or arrangement of Purchaser or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates in
which such Continuing Business Employees are eligible to participate after the
Closing for all service recognized by Seller under the corresponding Parent
Benefit Plan; provided, however, that in no event shall the Continuing
Business Employees be entitled to any credit to the extent that it would
result in a duplication of benefits with respect to the same period of
service. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(f) 401(k) Plan. Effective as of the Closing,
Purchaser shall establish or cause to be established, and Seller shall
reasonably cooperate with Purchaser to establish, participation by the
Continuing Business Employees in Purchaser\'s tax-qualified defined
contribution plan or plans with a cash or deferred feature (the "Purchaser
401(k) Plan") for the benefit of each Continuing Business Employee who, as of
immediately prior to the Closing, was eligible to participate in a tax-
qualified defined contribution plan maintained by Seller or its Affiliates
(the "Seller 401(k) Plan"). Purchaser shall continue to make available and
maintain the Purchaser 401(k) Plan for a period ending no earlier than the
first anniversary of the Closing Date. As soon as practicable after the
Closing Date, the Seller 401(k) Plan shall, to the extent  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t72  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

permitted by Section 401(k)(10) of the Code, make distributions available to
Continuing Business Employees, and the Purchaser 401(k) Plan shall accept any
such distribution (including loans) as a rollover distribution if so directed
by the Continuing Business Employee. The Parties agree to cooperate so as not
to place any loan with respect to a Continuing Business Employee\'s rollover
account into default during the period from the Closing Date until the
rollover is completed; provided that such employee continues making loan
repayments on a timely basis during such period in accordance with the
established procedures of Seller and its Affiliates, as applicable. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(g) COBRA. Parent shall retain responsibility for
continuation coverage under Sections 601 et seq. of ERISA and any state
continuation coverage requirements ("COBRA Obligations") to all Business
Employees (and their qualified beneficiaries), for whom a "qualifying event"
under COBRA occurs prior to the Closing. Purchaser shall be responsible for
COBRA Obligations with respect to the Continuing Business Employees and their
beneficiaries for whom a "qualifying event" under COBRA occurs at or after the
Closing.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(h) WARN Act. Sellers shall not, by reason of its
actions alone, at any time within the ninety (90)-day period immediately
before the Closing Date, cause a Business Employee to incur an "employment
loss" (as such term is defined in the WARN Act) without the consent of
Purchaser (which will not be unreasonably withheld). Purchaser shall be solely
responsible for and agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Seller and its
Affiliates from and against any Liability under the WARN Act or any similar
state Law to any Business Employee who is found to have suffered an
"employment loss" under the WARN Act on or after the Closing Date as a result
of the actions of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates, and any and all other
Liabilities related to Purchaser\'s or any of its Affiliates\' failure to
comply with the WARN Act or any similar state Law, including attorneys\' fees,
arising out of or resulting from the actions Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates with respect to Business Employees and the WARN Act or any similar
state Law, or their failure to serve sufficient notice pursuant to the WARN
Act or any similar state Law. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(i) Flexible Spending Accounts. With respect to each
Continuing Business Employee, effective as of the Closing, Purchaser shall
establish, and, through December 31, 2013, Purchaser shall maintain or cause
to be maintained flexible spending accounts for medical and dependent care
expenses. Purchaser shall credit each such account at Closing with the amount
credited as of the Closing Date under the comparable account maintained under
the applicable Parent Benefit Plan from the beginning of the plan year in
which the Closing occurs through the Closing Date. As soon as practicable
after the Closing Date, (i) Seller shall pay, or cause to be paid, to
Purchaser in cash the amount, if any, by which aggregate contributions made by
Continuing Business Employees to Parent\'s or its Affiliates\' flexible
spending accounts exceeded the aggregate benefits provided to Continuing
Business Employees as of the Closing, or (ii) Purchaser shall pay to Parent or
its applicable Affiliate, as determined by Parent, in cash the amount, if any,
by which aggregate benefits provided to Continuing Business Employees under
Parent\'s or its Affiliates\' flexible spending accounts exceeded the
aggregate contributions made by Continuing Business Employees as of the
Closing. \t\t

(j) To the extent permitted by the Parent Benefit Plans and
the applicable equity and equity-based compensation awards of Parent, prior to
the Closing, Parent shall take action to cause the equity and equity-based
compensation awards of Parent held by Continuing Business Employees that are
unvested as of the Closing to be amended to provide that such awards will vest
(and if applicable, become exercisable and/or exchangeable) in full in the
event that a Continuing Business Employee remains employed with Purchaser or
an Affiliate for a period of 120 days following the Closing; provided,
however, that Parent shall have the right to maintain its customary
provisions with regard to forfeiture of such awards, including forfeiture for
violation of non-competition obligations; provided further, however, that the
performance of services by Continuing Business Employees for Purchaser or an
Affiliate with respect to the Business will in no event be treated as a
violation of such non-competition obligations. Each Seller hereby agrees,
on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, that any Business Employee who becomes
a Continuing Business Employee pursuant to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and remains employed by Purchaser or an Affiliate of Purchaser
shall not be deemed to violate any non-competition, duty of loyalty,
confidentiality or other restrictive covenant set forth in the Amended and
Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of BGC Holdings, dated as of March
31, 2008, as amended, solely as a result of such Business Employee becoming a
Continuing Business Employee pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and remaining employed by Purchaser or an Affiliate of Purchaser,
and each Seller hereby, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, irrevocably
waives any right to enforce any such covenant against a Business Employee
following the Closing if such covenant would be violated solely as a result of
such Business Employee becoming a Continuing Business Employee pursuant to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and remaining employed by
Purchaser or an Affiliate of Purchaser. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(k) Purchaser shall make or cause to be made offers

terms and conditions of consulting applicable to the applicable Business
Consultant immediately prior to the Closing. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(l) Except as set forth on Section 6.10(l) of the
Seller Disclosure Letter, each Seller shall cause each loan from such Seller
or an Affiliate of such Seller to a Business Employee to be forgiven on the
date that is 120 days following the Closing Date, subject to such individual
becoming a Continuing Business Employee hereunder and remaining employed by
Purchaser or an Affiliate of Purchaser during such 120-day period; provided,
however, any such loan may be forgiven prior to such 120th day if the terms of
any such loan require such earlier forgiveness. \t\t

 \t\t\t(f) Assistance with Claims. Following the Closing
and during such time as Parent or its Affiliates are using the Business Marks
pursuant to this Section 6.12, Parent shall, promptly upon learning thereof,
furnish Purchaser in writing with the name, address, and such other pertinent
information as may be available, with respect to any third party that Parent
reasonably believes may be infringing or otherwise violating any Purchaser
rights in the Business Marks or with respect to any third party that Parent
reasonably believes may make a claim that the use of the Business Marks
infringes upon or otherwise violates any rights of any nature of such third
party. Parent shall cooperate in all respects, as required by Purchaser, with
regard to any action which Purchaser reasonably deems advisable either to
protect the right of Purchaser in the Business Marks or to contest a claim by
a third party that the use of the Business Marks infringes upon or otherwise
violates any rights of any nature of such third party. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(g) Acknowledgements. Parent hereby acknowledges
that (i) any and all goodwill and proprietary rights in the Business Marks
(including any derivatives thereof) remain entirely vested in Purchaser from
and after the Closing and (ii) Parent derives from this Agreement no rights in
or to use any Business Mark from and after the Closing other than under and in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 6.13 Access to the Business. Purchaser shall, and shall
cause its Affiliates and any successor in interest to the Business (such
Affiliates, together with any successor in interest to the Business, the
"Acquiring Affiliates") to, permit each member of the Parent Group and each
member of the Cantor Group to be customers of the fully electronic brokerage
of the Business and to pay the lowest commission paid by any other customer of
the Business, whether by volume, dollar amount or other applicable
measurements (including on a price per volume basis for the most recently
completed calendar quarter), regardless of whether such customer is paying a
fixed commission or has agreed to trade a minimum amount of securities. For
example, if a customer of the Business is paying a fixed commission of $x to
Purchaser or any of the Acquiring Affiliates to trade U.S. Treasury Securities
for the first calendar quarter of a year, and such customer trades y million
of U.S. Treasury Securities during such calendar quarter, then each member of
the Parent Group and each member of the Cantor Group shall be entitled to be
customers of the fully electronic brokerage of the Business and to pay a
commission equal to $x divided by y per million of U.S. Treasury Securities
traded by such member during the second calendar quarter of such year, without
an obligation by such member to pay the full fixed commission paid by such
customer and without any minimum trading volume or other requirements. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tIn addition, Purchaser shall, and shall cause its Affiliates and the
Acquiring Affiliates to, permit each member of the Parent Group and each
member of the Cantor Group to receive any co-location and related
installation, maintenance, support, remote access, and management of
communication services, in each case to the extent that Purchaser or any
 \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t77  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

Acquiring Affiliate offers or provides such services to any other customers of
the Business following the Closing Date, at a cost to such member equal to any
incremental out-of-pocket costs incurred by Purchaser or the Acquiring
Affiliates in providing such member with such services (it being agreed that
such costs shall not include any rent costs but may include the cost of
utilities), provided that neither Purchaser nor the Acquiring Affiliates shall
have any obligation to continue offering or providing any such services to
customers of the Business following the Closing Date. Such co-location and
related services shall be provided to each member of the Parent Group and each
member of the Cantor Group (and each permitted successor thereto) on such
terms and conditions as are generally applicable to receipt of such services
by customers of the Business as of the Closing Date. The foregoing right to
receive co-location and related services may not be sublicensed to, sublet to
or otherwise enjoyed by any customer of any member of the Parent Group or the
Cantor Group. Each member of the Parent Group and each member of the Cantor
Group may assign the foregoing right to receive co-location and related
services in whole, without the prior written consent of Purchaser, only to a
third party that acquires all or a majority of (1) in the case of assignment
by a member of the Parent Group, the business of BGC Financial, L.P. (or any
Affiliate of Parent that is a successor to such business) and (2) in the case
of assignment by a member of the Cantor Group, the business of Cantor
Fitzgerald and Co. (or any Affiliate of Cantor that is a successor to such
business). The Parties agree that (y) except for the assignment rights
expressly granted in the foregoing sentence, no member of the Parent Group and
no member of the Cantor Group shall have any right to assign such right to
receive co-location and related services, in whole or in part; and (z) in the
event that such right is assigned by any member of the Parent Group or any
member of the Cantor Group, all members of the Parent Group, or all members of
the Cantor Group, as applicable, shall be deemed to have assigned such right
in its entirety insofar as it relates to the rights granted to the Parent
Group or the Cantor Group, as applicable, and no member of the Parent Group or
the Cantor Group, as applicable, shall retain any right to receive such
services. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 6.14 Clearing. From and after the Closing, Purchaser shall
not, and shall cause the Acquiring Affiliates not to, with respect to the
Business, (a) prevent customers of the Business from clearing their
transactions with any member of the Cantor Group (including the Clearing
Affiliate) or any member of the Parent Group, including by refusing to provide
a service to such customer at the price or on terms offered by the Acquiring
Affiliates to other similarly situated customers or (b) treat the Clearing
Affiliate in an unreasonable, discriminatory or anti-competitive manner
(including with respect to pricing and terms and including by refusing to deal
with and boycotting the Clearing Affiliate) as compared to any other Person
that provides the same or similar services as the Clearing Affiliate. In
furtherance of the foregoing, with respect to the Business, if any Person
provides clearing services to Purchaser or its Affiliates, Purchaser and such
Affiliate shall execute an agreement with such Person providing that such
Person and its Affiliates shall not (a) prevent customers of the Business from
clearing their transactions with any member of the Cantor Group (including the
Clearing Affiliate) or any member of the Parent Group, including by refusing
to provide a service to such customer at the price or on terms offered by the
Acquiring Affiliates to other similarly situated customers or (b) treat the
Clearing Affiliate in an unreasonable, discriminatory or anti-competitive
manner (including with respect to pricing and terms and including by refusing
to deal with or boycotting the Clearing Affiliate) as compared to any other
Person that provides the same or similar services  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t78  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

as the Clearing Affiliate, and such agreement shall provide that the Clearing
Affiliate shall be a third-party beneficiary of such provisions in the
agreement. The Parties agree that this Section 6.14 is not intended to
prohibit the Acquiring Affiliates from competing with any member of the Cantor
Group or any member of the Parent Group in any business in the ordinary course
of business. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 6.15 License Agreement Fees. If, due to a change in
applicable Law, the royalty-free nature of the License Agreement would
prohibit Purchaser or its Affiliates from charging fees or royalties to other
market data customers, Purchaser shall endeavor to take such steps as are
necessary to not prejudice Parent and its Affiliates\' rights under the
License Agreement; provided that this Section 6.15 shall not require Purchaser
to take any steps that would result in Purchaser or its Affiliates failing to
comply with or violating any Law. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) Without limiting Section 6.16(a), Parent and its
Affiliates shall have the full and unconditional right to alter, modify,
prepare derivative works of, duplicate, reproduce and distribute the Licensed
Software, including to alter or modify the source code thereof and to
distribute such Licensed Software among any member of the Parent Group or the
Cantor Group. Parent and its Affiliates may permit their respective
suppliers, contractors, service providers and consultants to exercise any or
all of the rights and licenses granted to Parent and its Affiliates solely at
the direction of, and on behalf of, Parent or its Affiliates, as applicable.
 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) The Software License shall be binding on
assignees and transferees of any of the Software included within the Acquired
Intellectual Property. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d) Purchaser makes no warranty with respect to the

or one of its Affiliates shall not have substituted itself for Seller and any
of its Affiliates under, and caused Seller and its Affiliates to be released
from, any Substituted Guarantee, (i) Purchaser shall continue to use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause itself or one of its Affiliates
(including any Acquired Subsidiary) to be substituted for Seller and any of
its Affiliates, and for Seller and any of its Affiliates to be released, in
respect of all obligations of Seller and any of its respective Affiliates
under any Substituted Guarantee; and (ii) Purchaser shall indemnify and hold

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 6.18 Section 16 Matters. Subject to applicable Law,
Purchaser agrees that, upon the reasonable request of Parent from time to time
and for the benefit of Parent and its Affiliates, Purchaser\'s board of

issuances from the application of the "short-swing" trading rules under
Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act pursuant to Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange
Act; provided that Purchaser shall not be deemed to have represented or
warranted that such exemption will apply. \t\t

issue to Sellers the total number of Purchaser Shares that could be issued
pursuant to all of the Earn-Out Issuances, disregarding any adjustments that
may be made to the Initial Earn-Out Number pursuant to Section 3.8(d). To the
extent that any adjustments may be made to the Initial Earn-Out Number

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t80  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

its Affiliate, as applicable, may at any time upon twenty-four (24) months\'

Assets and the Continuing Business Employees to the same extent that the
Business enjoyed such benefits as of immediately prior to the Closing;

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) Subject to Section 10.5(d) and Section 10.5(e),
Parent shall be responsible for and shall indemnify Purchaser and its
Affiliates (including the Acquired Subsidiaries) (the "Purchaser Tax
Indemnitees") from and against all Damages arising from or attributable to (i)
Excluded Taxes ("Specified Taxes"), (ii) any breach of or inaccuracy in any
representation or warranty contained in Section 4.22 (such Damages or breach
and/or inaccuracy determined without respect to any materiality, Business
Material Adverse Effect or similar term or qualifications) and (iii) any
breach of any covenant contained in Section 6.1(b)(xiv) or this Article VIII.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
following the Closing, neither Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates, including
the Acquired Subsidiaries, shall have any obligation to assert any claim or
exercise any other right of recovery against any customer of Purchaser or any
of its Affiliates (including the Acquired Subsidiaries) in respect of any

 \t\t\tSection 8.2 Filing Responsibility. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) Parent shall prepare and file, or cause to be
prepared and filed, when due all Tax Returns required to be filed by any
Acquired Subsidiary prior to the Closing. All such Tax Returns shall be
prepared and filed in a manner that is consistent with prior practice, if any,
except as required by applicable law. Parent shall pay or cause to be paid
all Taxes due and payable in respect of all such Tax Returns. In the case of
any Tax Return required to be prepared and filed by Parent pursuant to this
subsection for which the position taken with respect to any Tax Item is
reasonably likely to increase the Taxes of any Purchaser Tax Indemnitee with
respect to any taxable period or portion thereof beginning after the Closing
Date, Parent shall deliver a  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t83  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

draft of such Tax Return to Purchaser for its review at least twenty (20)
Business Days prior to the Due Date, and Parent shall consider in good faith
any comments received from Purchaser. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) Purchaser shall, except to the extent that the
filing of such Tax Returns is the responsibility of Parent under Section
8.2(a), prepare and file, or cause to be prepared and filed, all Tax Returns
required to be filed by any Acquired Subsidiaries. In the case of any Tax
Return required to be prepared and filed by Purchaser pursuant to this
subsection for which any Taxes are the responsibility of Parent under Section
8.1(a), Purchaser shall deliver a draft of such Tax Return to Parent for its
review at least twenty (20) Business Days prior to the Due Date and shall
provide Parent with Purchaser\'s calculation, in reasonable detail, of
Parent\'s share of the Taxes with respect to such Tax Return (determined in
the case of a Straddle Period in accordance with Section 8.2(c)); provided,
however, that such drafts of any such Tax Return and such calculations of
Parent\'s share of the Taxes with respect to such Tax Return shall be subject
to Parent\'s review and approval, which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed. If Parent disputes any Tax Item on such Tax
Return or Purchaser\'s calculation of Parent\'s share of the Taxes with
respect to such Tax Return, Parent shall notify Purchaser (by written notice
within five (5) days of receipt of Purchaser\'s calculation) of such disputed
item (or items) and the basis for its objection. If Parent does not object by
written notice within such period, Purchaser\'s calculation of Parent\'s share
of the Taxes with respect to such Tax Return shall be deemed to have been
accepted and agreed upon, and final and conclusive, for all purposes hereof.
Parent and Purchaser shall act in good faith to resolve any such dispute prior
to the Due Date. If Parent and Purchaser cannot resolve any disputed item,
the item in question shall be resolved by the Accountant in a manner
consistent with the standards set forth in Section 3.7(c) as promptly as
practicable. No later than five (5) days prior to the filing of such Tax
Return, Parent shall pay Purchaser in immediately available funds the amount
of Parent\'s share of the Taxes with respect to such Tax Return determined
pursuant to this Section 8.2(b). Subject to the preceding sentence, Purchaser
shall pay or cause to be paid all Taxes due and payable in respect of all Tax
Returns required to be prepared by Purchaser pursuant to this subsection. If
the Accountant has not finalized its conclusion in respect of any disputed
item prior to the Due Date, Purchaser shall (i) file such Tax Return in the
form initially provided to Parent, (ii) amend such Tax Return if the dispute
is subsequently resolved in favor of Parent, and (iii) pay Parent in
immediately available funds the amount of any excess of (x) the amount paid by
Parent to Purchaser pursuant to this Section 8.2(b) and (y) the amount of
Parent\'s share of the Taxes with respect to such Tax Return as finally
determined by the Accountant. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) In order to apportion appropriately any Taxes
relating to a Straddle Period between the portion of such Straddle Period
ending on and including the Closing Date and the portion of such Straddle
Period beginning after the Closing Date, the Parties shall, to the extent
permitted under applicable law, elect with the relevant Tax authority to treat
for all Tax purposes the Closing Date as the last day of a taxable period. In
the case of any other Taxes for a Straddle Period for which such election to
close the taxable period is not permitted, the portion of such Taxes that are
allocable to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on and including the
Closing Date shall be: (i) in the case of ad valorem or similar Taxes that are
imposed on a periodic basis, deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for the
entire period (or, in the case of such Taxes determined on an arrears basis
(such as real property Taxes), the amount of such Taxes for the immediately
preceding period) multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the
number of  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t84  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

days in the Straddle Period ending on and including the Closing Date and the
denominator of which is the number of days in the entire relevant Straddle
Period; and (ii) in the case of Taxes not described in (i) (such as Taxes that
are either (x) based upon or related to income, receipts or premiums, or (y)
imposed in connection with any sale or other transfer or assignment of
property (real or personal, tangible or intangible)), deemed equal to the
amount that would be payable if the taxable period ended on and included the
Closing Date. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 8.3 Cooperation and Exchange of Information. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) The Parties and Cantor shall cooperate with each
other and furnish or cause to be furnished to each other, upon request, as
promptly as practicable, such information (including access to books and
records) and assistance relating to the Business or the Acquired Subsidiaries
as is reasonably requested for the filing of any Tax Returns, and the
preparation and conduct of any Tax Proceeding. Anything to the contrary in
this Agreement notwithstanding, Parent shall not be required to provide any
person with any Tax Return (or copy thereof) of Parent or any consolidated,
combined or unitary group that includes Parent or any member of the Parent
Group. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) Cantor, Parent and Purchaser shall, and shall
cause their respective Subsidiaries to, cooperate in the preparation of all
Tax Returns that are required to be filed after the Closing Date relating to
Pre-Closing Tax Periods or to Straddle Periods. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) Purchaser shall promptly notify Parent upon
receipt by Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries of notice of any claim,
assessment or dispute relating to any Tax Proceeding for which Parent has
liability pursuant to Section 8.1(a) and shall promptly forward to Parent any
written communications received from any Governmental Authority in connection
with any such Tax Proceeding; provided, however, that a failure by Purchaser
to give such notice will not affect the Purchaser Tax Indemnitees\' rights to
indemnification pursuant to Section 8.1(a) unless and solely to the extent
Parent is materially prejudiced as a consequence of such failure. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d) Parent may elect to control, contest, resolve and
defend, at Parent\'s sole expense and with the participation of Purchaser, any
Tax Proceeding relating to Taxes of any Acquired Subsidiary for a Pre-Closing
Tax Period. If Parent desires to elect to control any such Tax Proceeding,
Parent shall, within ten (10) days of receipt of the notice of the Tax
Proceeding from Purchaser, notify Purchaser in writing of its intent to do so.
If Parent timely elects to control any such Tax Proceeding, then Parent shall
have the right to determine whether, when and on what terms to settle or
dispose of such Tax Proceeding; provided, however, that Parent shall not
settle or dispose of such Tax Proceeding if such settlement or disposition
could affect the Liability for Taxes of any Purchaser Tax Indemnitee without
the consent of Purchaser, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. If Parent does not elect to control a Tax Proceeding
which it is entitled to control pursuant to this subsection (or, after
assuming control, Parent fails to reasonably pursue such Tax Proceeding), any
of the Purchaser Tax Indemnitees may, without affecting its or any of the
other Purchaser Tax Indemnitees\' rights to indemnification under Section
8.1(a), assume and control such Tax Proceeding; provided, however, that if
the settlement or disposition of such Tax Proceeding would affect the
Liability for Taxes of any Seller Tax Indemnitee, such Purchaser Tax
Indemnitee may not settle such Tax  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t85  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

Proceeding without the consent of Parent, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Purchaser shall control,
contest, resolve and defend, at Purchaser\'s sole expense and with the
participation of Parent at its sole expense, any Tax Proceeding relating to
Taxes of any Acquired Subsidiary for a Straddle Period. Purchaser shall have
the right to determine whether, when and on what terms to settle or dispose of
any such Tax Proceeding; provided, however, that Purchaser shall not settle
or dispose of any such Tax Proceeding if such settlement or disposition could
affect the Liability for Taxes of any Seller Tax Indemnitee, without the
consent of Parent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 8.4 Tax Sharing Agreements. Notwithstanding anything herein
or in any other agreement to the contrary, all Liabilities between Parent or
any of its Affiliates (other than the Acquired Subsidiaries), on the one hand,
and the Acquired Subsidiaries, on the other hand, under any Tax allocation or
Tax sharing agreement to which an Acquired Subsidiary is a party in effect
prior to the Closing Date (other than this Agreement) shall cease and
terminate as of the Closing Date. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 8.5 Transfer Taxes. Parent will be responsible for
preparing and timely filing (and Purchaser will cooperate with Parent in
preparing and filing) any Tax Returns required with respect to any Transfer
Taxes. Parent will provide to Purchaser a true copy of each such Tax Return
as filed and evidence of the timely filing thereof. Parent and Purchaser
shall share equally the Liability for any Transfer Taxes and the costs for
preparing any Tax Returns for Transfer Taxes. Each of Parent and Purchaser
shall (a) use commercially reasonable efforts to minimize the amount of
Transfer Taxes and (b) jointly control any Tax Proceeding relating to Transfer
Taxes. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 8.6 Survival. All rights and obligations under this Article
VIII shall survive the Closing Date and continue until after the expiration of
all applicable statutes of limitation (including extensions thereof);
provided, however, that in the event written notice of any bona fide claim
for indemnification under this Article VIII shall have been given in
accordance herewith within the applicable survival period, the rights and
obligations that are the subject of such claim for indemnification shall
survive with respect to such claim until such time as such claim is fully and
finally resolved. The representations and warranties contained in Section
4.22 shall survive until after the expiration of all applicable statutes of
limitations, which shall include the statute of limitations with respect to
taxable years beginning after the Closing Date through and including the
taxable year in which the fifteenth (15th) anniversary of the Closing Date
occurs (including extensions thereof). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 8.7 Tax Treatment of Payments. Each member of the Parent
Group, Sellers, the Acquired Subsidiaries, Purchaser, and their respective
Affiliates shall treat any and all payments under this Article VIII, Section
3.8 or Article X as an adjustment to purchase price for all Tax
purposes. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 8.8 Treatment as Asset Sale. The Parties acknowledge that
for federal income Tax purposes, the sale of the equity of each Acquired
Subsidiary pursuant to this  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t86  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

Agreement is intended to be treated as a sale of the assets of such Acquired
Subsidiary (and an assumption by Purchaser of the liabilities of such Acquired
Subsidiary). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 9.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated and the
transactions contemplated hereby may be abandoned at any time prior to the
Closing: \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) by the mutual written consent of Purchaser and
Parent; \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) by either Purchaser or Parent, upon written
notification of the non-terminating Party by the terminating Party, if any
permanent Governmental Order prohibiting consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall have been issued and shall have become
final and non-appealable (except that a final, permanent Governmental Order
preventing the Closing as a result of an action brought by a Governmental
Authority under any antitrust, competition or trade regulation Law need not be
non-appealable so long as Purchaser has complied with its obligations set
forth in Section 6.4); provided, however, that a Party shall not have the
right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.1(b) if the
failure by such Party or of any of its Affiliates to perform any of its
material covenants or obligations under this Agreement has been the cause of,
or has resulted in, such Governmental Order;  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) by either Purchaser or Parent, if the Closing has
not occurred by the date that is twelve (12) months after the date hereof (the
"Outside Date"); provided, however, that if, as of twelve (12) month
anniversary of the date hereof, either the condition set forth in Section
7.1(a) or Section 7.1(b) (solely with respect to any Governmental Order under
any antitrust or competition Law) has not been satisfied or waived, but all
other conditions to the Closing set forth in Article VII have been satisfied
or mutually waived (other than those conditions which by their nature can only
be satisfied at or immediately prior to the Closing, which conditions would be
satisfied if the Closing Date were such twelve (12) month anniversary of the
date hereof), then the Outside Date shall be extended until both the
conditions set forth in Section 7.1(a) and Section 7.1(b) (solely with respect
to any Governmental Order under any antitrust or competition Law) have been
satisfied; provided, further, that neither Purchaser nor Parent shall have the
right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.1(c) if (i) its
failure to perform any of its material covenants or obligations under this
Agreement has been the cause of, or has resulted in, the failure of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement to occur on or before such date or
(ii) a Governmental Authority has brought an action under any antitrust,
competition or trade regulation Law, and that action has not yet resulted in a
final Governmental Order preventing the Closing; \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d) by Parent, if Purchaser shall have breached any
of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement that would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in
Section 7.3(a) or Section 7.3(b), which breach has not been cured within sixty
(60) days after the giving of written notice by Parent to Purchaser specifying
 \t\t

  \t\t\t87  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

such breach, or cannot be cured by the earlier of (x) sixty (60) days after
the giving of written notice by Parent to Purchaser specifying such breach or
(y) the Outside Date; or \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(e) by Purchaser, if any Seller or Cantor shall have
breached any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements
contained in this Agreement that would give rise to the failure of a condition
set forth in Section 7.2(a) or Section 7.2(b), which breach has not been cured
within sixty (60) days after the giving of written notice by Purchaser to
Parent specifying such breach, or cannot be cured by the earlier of (x) sixty
(60) days after the giving of written notice by Purchaser to Parent specifying
such breach or (y) the Outside Date. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 9.2 Effect of Termination. If this Agreement is terminated,
no party hereto (or any of its Affiliates, directors, officers,
representatives or agents) will have any Liability to any other party to this
Agreement, except for any Liability arising out of any knowing or willful
breach of this Agreement prior to such termination and except for the
obligations set forth in Sections 6.2(b) and 6.6(a) and Article XI, which
shall survive termination. \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) Except as otherwise provided in Section 8.6, the
right to commence any claim with respect to the representations and warranties
set forth herein shall survive until the date that is twelve (12) months after
the Closing Date; provided that the right to commence any claim with respect
to the representations and warranties contained in (i) Section 4.11 (Employee
Benefit Plans) will survive until the expiration of the applicable statute of
limitations and (ii) Section 4.1(a) (Organization and Good Standing), Sections

actions to be taken or not taken or obligations in effect after the Closing
shall survive in accordance with their terms. This Section 10.1 shall not
limit any covenant or agreement of the parties contained in this Agreement
which by its terms contemplates performance after the Closing, and shall not
extend the applicability of any covenant or agreement of the parties contained
in this Agreement which by its terms relates only to a period between the date
hereof and the Closing, except that the right to commence any claim with
respect to any such covenant or agreement which by its terms relates only to a
period between the date hereof and the Closing shall survive until the date
that is twelve (12) months after the Closing Date. \t\t

for such claim, the indemnification claim shall survive until such time as
such claim is fully and finally resolved. Neither Purchaser nor Sellers shall
have any liability pursuant to this Agreement with respect to any claim first
asserted in connection with any indemnification claim for a breach of
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement asserted after the survival
period specified for such representation, warranty, covenant or agreement in
Section 8.6, Section 10.1(a) or Section 10.1(b), as applicable. \t\t

(including the Acquired Subsidiaries), each of their respective officers,
directors, employees, agents and representatives, and each of the heirs,
executors, successors and assigns of the foregoing (collectively, the
"Purchaser Indemnified Parties"), from and against (whether in connection with
a Third Party Claim or a direct claim) any and all Damages to the extent
resulting from, arising out of or relating to: \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) any breach by any Seller or Cantor of any
representation or warranty under this Agreement or in any certificate or

set forth in Section 4.22 (Taxes)), such breach and Damages determined without
regard to any Business Material Adverse Effect or materiality qualification
(except for (i) the lists of information required to be set for the pursuant
to the representations and warranties in Section 4.11 (Employee Benefit

 \t\t\t(a) Third Party Claims. Upon receipt by an
Indemnified Party of notice of any action, suit, proceedings, audit, claim,
demand, investigation or assessment made or brought by an unaffiliated third
party (a "Third Party Claim") with respect to a matter for which such
Indemnified Party is indemnified under this Article X which has or is expected
to give rise to a claim for Damages, the Indemnified Party shall promptly (but
in any event within ten (10) Business Days of receipt of such Third Party
Claim), in the case of a Purchaser Indemnified Party, notify Parent, and in
the case of a Seller Indemnified Party, notify Purchaser (Parent or Purchaser,
as the case may be, the "Indemnifying Party"), in writing, indicating the
nature of such Third Party Claim and the basis therefor; provided, however,
that any delay or failure by the Indemnified Party to give notice to the
Indemnifying Party shall relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations
hereunder only to the extent, if at all, that it is materially prejudiced by
reason of such delay or failure. Such written notice (a "Claim Notice") shall
include (i) the facts and circumstances giving rise to such claim for
indemnification, to the extent then known by the Indemnified Party and copies
of all material written evidence thereof to the extent available, (ii) the
nature of the Damages suffered or incurred or expected to be suffered or
incurred, to the extent then known by the Indemnified Party, (iii) a reference
to the provisions of this Agreement in respect of which such Damages have been
suffered or incurred or are expected to be suffered or incurred and (iv) the
amount of Damages actually suffered or incurred, to the extent then known by
the Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party shall have thirty (30) days
after receipt of the Claim Notice to elect, at its option, to assume and
control the defense of, at its own expense and by its own counsel, any such
Third Party Claim and shall be entitled to assert any and all defenses
available to the Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law; provided that, prior to the Indemnifying Party assuming and
controlling such defense, it shall first confirm to the Indemnified Party in
writing that, assuming the facts then presented to the Indemnifying Party by
the Indemnified Party being true, the Indemnifying Party shall indemnify the
Indemnified Party for any such Damages to the extent resulting from, or
arising out of, such Third Party Claim; provided, further, that, if the
Indemnifying Party assumes such defense and, in the course of defending such
Third Party Claim, (x) the Indemnifying Party discovers that the facts
presented at the time the Indemnifying Party acknowledged its indemnification
obligation in respect of such Third Party Claim were not true and (y) such
untruth provides a reasonable basis for asserting that the Indemnifying Party
does not have an indemnification obligation in respect of such Third Party
Claim, then (A) the Indemnifying Party shall not be bound by such
acknowledgment, (B) the Indemnifying Party shall promptly thereafter provide
the Indemnified Party written notice of its assertion that it does not have an
indemnification obligation in respect of such Third Party Claim and (C) the
Indemnified Party shall have the right to assume the defense of such Third
Party Claim (it being agreed that all costs and expenses in conducting such
defense prior to the date that the Indemnified Party shall have the ability to
assume the defense, including costs and expenses of counsel, shall be the
 \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t90  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

responsibility of the Indemnifying Party and not the Indemnified Party). If
the Indemnifying Party shall undertake to compromise or defend any such Third
Party Claim, it shall promptly notify the Indemnified Party of its intention
to do so, and the Indemnified Party agrees to, and to cause its Affiliates to,
cooperate with the Indemnifying Party and its counsel in the compromise of, or
defense against, any such Third Party Claim, including by furnishing non-
privileged books and records, personnel and witnesses, as appropriate for any
defense of such Third Party Claim; provided, however, that the Indemnifying
Party shall not settle, compromise or discharge, or admit any liability with
respect to, any such Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of
the Indemnified Party (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed) unless the relief consists solely of money damages and includes a
provision whereby the plaintiff or claimant in the matter releases the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties or Seller Indemnified Parties, as applicable,
from all liability with respect thereto. Notwithstanding an election to
assume the defense of such action or proceeding, the Indemnified Party shall
have the right to employ separate counsel and to participate in the defense of
such action or proceeding, and the Indemnifying Party shall bear the
reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel if (i) the
Indemnified Party shall have determined in good faith after consultation with
counsel that an actual or potential conflict of interest makes representation
by the same counsel or the counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party
inappropriate or (ii) the Indemnifying Party shall have authorized in writing
the Indemnified Party to employ separate counsel at the Indemnifying Party\'s
expense. In any event, the Indemnified Party and Indemnifying Party and their
counsel shall cooperate in the defense of any Third Party Claim subject to
this Article X and keep such Persons informed of all developments relating to
any such Third Party Claims, and provide copies of all relevant correspondence
and documentation relating thereto. All costs and expenses incurred in
connection with the Indemnified Party\'s cooperation shall be borne by the
Indemnifying Party. In any event, the Indemnified Party shall have the right
at its own expense to participate in the defense of such asserted liability.
If the Indemnifying Party receiving such notice of Third Party Claim does not
elect to defend, or does not defend, such Third Party Claim, the Indemnified
Party shall have the right, in addition to any other right or remedy it may
have hereunder, at the Indemnifying Party\'s expense, to defend such Third
Party Claim; provided, however, that (i) the Indemnified Party\'s defense of
or participation in the defense of any such Third Party Claim shall not in any
way diminish or lessen the obligations of the Indemnifying Party under this
Article X; and (ii) the Indemnified Party shall not settle, compromise or
discharge, or admit any liability with respect to, any such Third Party Claim
without the written consent of the Indemnifying Party (which consent will not
be unreasonably withheld or delayed). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) Direct Claims. As promptly as is reasonably
practicable (but in any event, within ten (10) Business Days) after becoming
aware of a claim for indemnification under this Agreement not involving a
Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall provide a Claim Notice to the
Indemnifying Party of such claim. Each Party hereto also agrees that any
direct claim which such Party may bring against any other Party hereto under
the provisions of this Agreement shall be governed exclusively by the
provisions of this Article X, other than Section 10.4(a). \t\t

Sellers or Purchaser be required to provide indemnification to any Purchaser
Indemnified Party or Seller Indemnified Party, respectively, pursuant to
Section 10.2 or 10.3 for any amount that is included in the final Adjustment
Amount. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

provide indemnification to any Purchaser Indemnified Party for any single
claim or aggregated claims arising out of substantially the same events or
circumstances under Section 8.1(a) or 10.2 or (ii) Purchaser be required to
provide indemnification to any Seller Indemnified Party for any single claim
or aggregated claims arising out of substantially the same events or
circumstances under Section 8.1(b) or 10.3, in each of cases (i) and (ii),
unless the amount of such claim or aggregated claims arising out of
substantially the same events or circumstances is in excess of fifty thousand
dollars ($50,000) ("De Minimis Claims"), in which event, subject to the
Threshold, the applicable Indemnifying Party shall be required to pay for all
Damages back to the first dollar of any such claims; provided, however, that
the limitation set forth in this Section 10.5(b) shall not apply to any breach
of the covenants or obligations set forth in Section 3.3 (Closing Purchase
Price), Section 3.7 (Post-Closing Adjustment) or Section 3.8 (Earn-Out). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) Sellers shall not be liable for any amounts for
which Purchaser Indemnified Parties are otherwise entitled to indemnification
pursuant to Section 10.2(a) until the aggregate amount of all Damages exceeds,
on a cumulative basis, seven million five hundred thousand dollars
($7,500,000) (the "Threshold"), and then the Purchaser Indemnified Parties
shall be entitled to indemnification pursuant to Section 10.2(a) for all of
their Damages (excluding any Damages with respect to De Minimis Claims) in
excess of such Threshold; provided, however, that the limitation set forth
in this Section 10.5(c) shall not apply to any breach of the representations
and warranties set forth in Section 4.1(a) (Organization and Good Standing),
Section 4.2(a) and (b) (Acquired Subsidiaries), Section 4.3 (Authorization;
Binding Obligations), Section 4.5 (Approvals), Section 4.7(b) (Compliance with
Law), Section 4.8 (Transactions with Affiliates), Section 4.10(a) and (b)
(Title), Section 4.13 (No Brokers or Finders) or Section 4.24 (Sufficiency of
Assets) and Damages related thereto shall not be included in the calculation
of the Threshold. Purchaser shall not be liable for any amounts for which
Seller Indemnified Parties are otherwise entitled to indemnification pursuant
to Section 10.3(a) until the aggregate amount of all Damages exceeds, on a
cumulative basis, the Threshold, and then the Seller Indemnified Parties shall
be entitled to indemnification pursuant to Section 10.3(a) for all of their
Damages (excluding any Damages with respect to De Minimis Claims) in excess of
the Threshold; provided, however, that the limitation set forth in this
Section 10.5(c) shall not apply to any breach of the representations and
warranties set forth in Section 5.1 (Organization and Good Standing), Section
5.3 (Authorization; Binding Obligations), Section 5.5 (Approvals) or Section
5.10 (No Brokers or Finders) and Damages related thereto shall not be included
in the calculation of the Threshold. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d) In no event shall Sellers\' aggregate liability
pursuant to Section 8.1(a) and Section 10.2 (other than any liability
thereunder for the Seller Excluded Items (and Damages related thereto shall
not be included in the calculation of the Cap)) exceed an amount equal to one
hundred million dollars ($100,000,000) (the "Cap"). "Seller Excluded Items"
shall mean (i) any breach of the representations and warranties set forth in
Section 4.1(b) (Organization and  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t92  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

Good Standing), Section 4.2(a) and (b) (Acquired Subsidiaries), Section 4.3
(Authorization; Binding Obligations), Section 4.8 (Transactions with
Affiliates), Section 4.10(a) and (b) (Title) or Section 4.13 (No Brokers or
Finders), (ii) indemnification pursuant to Section 10.2(c), (iii) any breach
of any covenant or agreement to be performed at or following the Closing and
(iv) any fraud. In no event shall Purchaser\'s aggregate liability pursuant
to Section 8.1(b) and Section 10.3 (other than any liability thereunder for
the Purchaser Excluded Items (and Damages related thereto shall not be
included in the calculation of the Cap)) exceed an amount equal to the Cap.
"Purchaser Excluded Items" shall mean (i) any breach of the representations
and warranties set forth in Section 5.1 (Organization and Good Standing),
Section 5.3 (Authorization; Binding Obligations) or Section 5.10 (No Brokers
or Finders), (ii) indemnification pursuant to Section 10.3(c), (iii) any
breach of any covenant or agreement to be performed at or following the
Closing and (iv) any fraud.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(e) In no event shall Sellers\' aggregate liability
pursuant to Section 8.1(a) and Section 10.2 (including any liability
thereunder for the Seller Excluded Items) exceed an amount equal to five
hundred million dollars ($500,000,000) (the "Aggregate Liability Cap");
provided, however, that the limitation set forth in this sentence shall not
apply to any breach of the covenants or obligations set forth in Section 3.7
(Post-Closing Adjustment). In no event shall Purchaser\'s aggregate liability
pursuant to Section 8.1(b) and Section 10.3 (including any liability
thereunder for the Purchaser Excluded Items) exceed an amount equal to the
Aggregate Liability Cap; provided, however, that the limitation set forth in
this sentence shall not apply to any breach of the covenants or obligations
set forth in Section 3.3 (Closing Purchase Price), Section 3.7 (Post-Closing
Adjustment) or Section 3.8 (Earn-Out). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(f) The Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall have a
right to set off any payment in respect of an indemnification claim of any
Purchaser Indemnified Party under Article VIII and this Article X against any
unissued Earn-Out Issuance (with such Purchaser Shares being valued at the
Current Market Price as of the applicable date that Purchaser is required to
make the Earn-Out Issuance subsequent to such time as a Purchaser Indemnified
Party is entitled to payment pursuant to Article VIII or this Article X); it
being agreed that the Purchaser Indemnified Party and the applicable Seller
may agree to settle such set off in cash instead of Purchaser Shares. Such
right of set-off shall be the sole and exclusive source of funds to satisfy
any such indemnification claim other than in respect of any breach of the
covenants or obligations set forth in Section 3.3 (Closing Purchase Price) and
Section 3.7 (Post-Closing Adjustment); except in the event that such right of
set-off is insufficient to fully indemnify the Purchaser Indemnified Parties
with respect to claims for indemnification with respect to the Seller Excluded
Items. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(g) Purchaser and Seller acknowledge and agree that,
following the Closing, other than with respect to fraud, the indemnification
provisions of Section 8.1, Section 10.2 and Section 10.3 shall be the sole and
exclusive monetary remedies of Seller and Purchaser, respectively, for any
Damages (including any Damages from claims for breach of contract, warranty,
tortious conduct (including negligence) or otherwise and whether predicated on
common law, statute, strict liability, or otherwise) that each party may at
any time suffer or incur, or become subject to, as a result of or in
connection with this Agreement, or the transaction contemplated by this
Agreement, including any breach of any representation or warranty in this
 \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t93  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

Agreement by any party, or any failure by any party to perform or comply with
any covenant or agreement that, by its terms, was to have been performed, or
complied with, under this Agreement. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(h) Except for amounts where the sole and exclusive
source of funds shall be the right of set-off as set forth in Section 10.5(f),
amounts payable by the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party in respect
of any Damages for which such party is entitled to indemnification hereunder
("Indemnity Payments") shall be paid in immediately available funds within
twenty (20) Business Days after the later of the (i) the receipt of a written
request from the party entitled to such Indemnity Payment and (ii) date of
payment of the amount that is the subject of the Indemnity Payment by the
party entitled to receive the Indemnity Payment, except to the extent
contested by the Indemnifying Party. All such Indemnity Payments shall be
made to the designated account of, and in the manner specified in writing by,
the party entitled to such Indemnity Payments. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 10.6 Insurance. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, Damages shall be net of any insurance or other recoveries actually
received by the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates in connection with the
facts giving rise to the right of indemnification. The Indemnified Party shall
use, and cause its Affiliates to use, commercially reasonable efforts to seek
full recovery under all insurance and indemnity provisions covering such
Damages to the same extent as it would if such Damages were not subject to
indemnification hereunder. If an Indemnified Party shall have used its
reasonable efforts to recover any amounts recoverable under insurance policies
and shall not have recovered the applicable Damages in full within one hundred
twenty (120) days, the Indemnifying Party shall promptly pay upon written
request the amount with interest accrued thereon, by which such Damages
exceeds the amounts actually recovered. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 10.7 Additional Limitations on Damages. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) In no event shall any Indemnified Party have any
Liability for (i) Damages computed on a multiple of earnings, book value or
similar basis, (ii) special, speculative, indirect or consequential Damages or
lost profits to the extent not the direct and reasonably foreseeable
consequence of the relevant breach or (iii) punitive damages, except in the
case of clauses (i) and (ii), to the extent awarded against an Indemnified
Party in connection with a Third Party Claim. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) In no event shall any Party be indemnified
against any Damage arising out of a breach of any representation and warranty
or covenant or agreement of the other Party, if the first Party had Knowledge
at or before the (i) date hereof, of such breach or the facts underlying such
breach, (ii) Closing, of such breach or the facts underlying such breach and
such Party could have terminated this Agreement as a result of such breach in
accordance with Section 9.1(d) or Section 9.1(e), as applicable, or (iii)
Closing, of such breach or the facts underlying such breach and such party did
not notify the other Party of such breach. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 10.8 Tax Indemnification. Other than Section 10.5 and 10.7,
the provisions of this Article X shall not apply to indemnification with
respect to matters relating to Taxes, which shall be governed exclusively by
Article VIII. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

Section 10.9 Mitigation. Each of the Parties agrees to use its commercially
reasonable efforts to mitigate its respective Damages upon and after becoming
aware of any event or condition that would reasonably be expected to give rise
to any Damages that are indemnifiable hereunder. Upon making any payment to
the Indemnified Party for any indemnification claim pursuant to this Article
X, the Indemnifying Party shall be subrogated, to the extent of such payment,
to any rights which the Indemnified Party may have against any third parties
(but specifically excluding any right of recovery against any customer other
than any Retained Claim) with respect to the subject matter underlying such
indemnification claim, and the Indemnified Party shall assign any such rights
to the Indemnifying Party. \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 11.2 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by
and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware applicable
to agreements made and to be performed entirely within such State, without
regard to the conflict of laws principles of such State. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 11.3 Jurisdiction; Venue; Consent to Service of
Process. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) Each party hereto hereby consents to submit to
the exclusive jurisdiction of the Chancery Court in the State of Delaware in
connection with any action or proceeding instituted relating to this
Agreement. Each of the parties consents to the jurisdiction of such court (and
of the appropriate appellate courts) in any such action or proceeding and
hereby waives (x) any objection to venue laid therein and (y) any right to
remove such action or proceeding to a federal court. In addition, each of the
parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally waives and agrees not to assert
by way of motion, as a defense or otherwise (i) any claim that it is not
subject to the jurisdiction of the above court, (ii) that its property is
exempt or immune from attachment or execution in any such action or proceeding
in the above-named courts, (iii) that such action or proceeding is brought in
an inconvenient or improper forum, (iv) that such action or proceeding should
be transferred or removed to any court other than the above-named court, or
should be stayed by reason of the pendency of some other proceeding in any
other court other than the above-named court, or that this Agreement or the
subject matter hereof may not be enforced in or by such court. Each of the
parties hereto hereby agrees not to commence any such action or  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t96  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

proceeding other than before the above-named court. Each of the parties
hereto also hereby agrees that any final and unappealable judgment against a
party in connection with any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and
binding on such party and that such judgment may be enforced in any court of
competent jurisdiction, either within or outside of the United States. A
certified or exemplified copy of such award or judgment shall be conclusive
evidence of the fact and amount of such award or judgment. The foregoing
consent to jurisdiction shall not (a) constitute submission to jurisdiction in
the State of Delaware for any purpose except with respect to any action or
proceeding resulting from, relating to or arising out of this Agreement or (b)
be deemed to confer rights on any Person other than the respective parties to
this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, each party agrees that
service of process on such party as provided in Section 11.1 shall be deemed
effective service of process on such party. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) To the extent that any party has or hereafter may
acquire any immunity from jurisdiction of any court or from any legal process
(whether through service or notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment
in aid of execution, execution or otherwise) with respect to itself or its
property, each of such Seller or Purchaser hereby irrevocably waives such
immunity in respect of its obligations with respect to this Agreement.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) Each party irrevocably consents to service of
process in the manner provided for the giving of notices pursuant to Section
11.1 of this Agreement. Nothing in this Section 11.3 shall affect the right
of any party to serve process in any other manner permitted by Law. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 11.4 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in two or
more counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same effect as
if the signatures were upon the same instrument, and shall become effective
when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and
delivered (by telecopy, electronic delivery or otherwise) to the other
parties. Signatures to this Agreement transmitted by facsimile transmission,
by electronic mail in "portable document format" (".pdf") form, or by any
other electronic means intended to preserve the original graphic and pictorial
appearance of a document, will have the same effect as physical delivery of
the paper document bearing the original signatures. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 11.5 Entire Agreement. This Agreement, together with the
Related Agreements, the Disclosure Letters, the Non-Disclosure Agreement and
the letter agreements set forth in Section 11.5 of the Seller Disclosure
Letter and all annexes and exhibits hereto and thereto, embody the entire
agreement of the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and
supersede all prior agreements with respect thereto. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 11.6 Amendment, Modification and Waiver. No amendment to
this Agreement shall be effective unless it shall be in writing and signed by
each Party hereto. Any failure of a party to comply with any obligation,
covenant, agreement or condition contained in this Agreement may be waived by
the party entitled to the benefits thereof only by a written instrument duly
executed and delivered by the party granting such waiver, but such waiver or
failure to insist upon strict compliance with such obligation, covenant,
agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with
respect to, any subsequent or other failure of compliance. \t\t

  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 11.7 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement or
the application of any such provision is invalid, illegal or unenforceable in
any jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not
affect any other provision of this Agreement or invalidate or render
unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction. To the extent
permitted by applicable Law, the parties waive any provision of law that
renders any provision of this Agreement invalid, illegal or unenforceable in
any respect. The parties shall, to the extent lawful and practicable, use
their reasonable efforts to enter into arrangements to reinstate the intended
benefits, net of the intended burdens, of any such provision held invalid,
illegal or unenforceable.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 11.8 Successors and Assigns; No Third-Party Beneficiaries.
This Agreement and all its provisions shall be binding upon and inure to the
benefit of the parties and their respective permitted successors and assigns.
Nothing in this Agreement, whether expressed or implied, will confer on any
Person, other than the parties hereto or their respective permitted successors
and assigns, any rights, remedies or Liabilities; provided that the
provisions of Article X will inure to the benefit of the Indemnified Parties.
No party may assign its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the
prior written consent of the other parties hereto and any purported assignment
without such consent shall be void; provided, that Purchaser may, without the
consent of Sellers, assign any or all of its rights or obligations hereunder
to any of its Subsidiary that is wholly owned (although no such assignment
shall relieve Purchaser of its obligations to Sellers or any Purchaser
Indemnified Party hereunder) and Parent and Sellers may, without the consent
of Purchaser, assign their right to receive the Closing Purchase Price and the
Earn-Out Issuances to any their respective Affiliates. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 11.9 Publicity. With respect to any information in respect
of the transactions contemplated hereby which shall not have been previously
issued or disclosed, except as required by Law (including the rules and
regulations of any applicable stock exchange), each of Parent and Purchaser
agrees that neither it nor any of its Affiliates will issue a press release or
make any other public statement or release any public communication with
respect thereto without the prior consultation with the other Party.
Purchaser and Parent agree, to the extent possible and legally permissible, to
notify, cooperate and consult with, the other party prior to issuing or making
any such public statement (and be provided a reasonable opportunity to comment
on such public statement). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 11.10 WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED
BY LAW, EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY
JURY IN ANY ACTION, SUIT, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF, IN WHOLE
OR IN PART, OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT OR THE RELATED AGREEMENTS. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 11.11 Expenses. Except as otherwise expressly stated in
this Agreement, Sellers shall bear the costs of Seller Transaction Expenses,
Purchaser shall bear the costs of Purchaser Transaction Expenses, and any
other costs, expenses, or charges incurred by any of the parties hereto shall
be borne by the party incurring such cost, expense or charge, in each case,

whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby shall be consummated;
provided, however, that Purchaser and Parent shall share in equal proportions
any HSR Act filing fees. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 11.12 Specific Performance and Other Equitable Relief. The
parties hereby expressly recognize and acknowledge that immediate, extensive
and irreparable damage would result, no adequate remedy at law would exist and
damages would be difficult to determine in the event that any provision of
this Agreement is not performed in accordance with its specific terms or is
otherwise breached. Each party further acknowledges that a breach or
violation of this Agreement cannot be sufficiently remedied by money damages
alone and, accordingly, each party shall be entitled, without the need to post
a bond or other security, in addition to damages and any other remedies
provided at law or in equity, to specific performance, injunctive and other
equitable relief in order to enforce or prevent any violation. Each party
agrees not to oppose the granting of such equitable relief, and to waive, and
to cause its representatives to waive, any requirement for the securing or
posting of any bond in connection with such remedy. \t\t
