Parties in its role as operator of certain of the Properties pursuant to any
applicable joint operating agreement or similar agreement associated with
periods prior to the Closing. If Buyer collects any such receivable, refund or
other amounts associated with such periods and such amount has not been
reflected as an adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to Sections 3(a) or
3(b), then Buyer shall promptly remit to Seller any such amounts. Similarly
Buyer shall have the right to collect any receivable, refund or other amounts
associated with periods at or after the Effective Time (except for overhead
properly chargeable by Seller to Third Parties in its role as operator of
certain of the Properties pursuant to any applicable joint operating agreement
or similar agreement associated with periods prior to the Closing). If Seller
collects any such receivable, refund or other amounts associated with such
periods and such amount has not been reflected as an adjustment to the
Purchase Price pursuant to Sections 3(a) or 3(b), then Seller shall promptly
remit to Buyer any such amounts.

 



 

(d) **_Allocation_**. The Purchase Price shall be allocated to the Properties
as set forth in Schedule 3(d) hereto. Seller and Buyer acknowledge and agree
that the values allocated among various Properties, as set forth on Schedule
3(d) hereto (with respect to each item, individually, the "Allocated Value,"
and collectively, the "Allocated Values") shall be binding on Seller and
Buyer.

 



 

(e) **_Tax Allocation_**. For the purpose of making requisite filings under
Section 1060 of Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and
the regulations thereunder, Seller and Buyer agree to allocate in a manner
consistent with the allocation set forth on Schedule 3(d), the Purchase Price
(as adjusted by Section 3) and all obligations assumed by Buyer among the
Wells and Leases (the "Tax Allocation"). The Tax Allocation shall be delivered
by Buyer to Seller within 30 days after the Closing Date for Sellers
approval, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed. If the Purchase Price is adjusted, the Tax Allocation shall be
adjusted as mutually agreed by Buyer and Seller. Buyer and Seller shall file
all Tax Returns (including, but not limited to, Internal Revenue Service Form
8594) consistent with the Tax Allocation. Neither Buyer nor Seller shall take
any Tax position inconsistent with such Tax Allocation and neither Buyer nor
Seller shall agree to any proposed adjustment to the Tax Allocation by any
Governmental Authority without first giving the other party prior written
notice; provided, however, that nothing contained herein shall prevent Buyer
or Seller from settling any proposed deficiency or adjustment by any
Governmental Authority

 



      
 

 



 

based upon or arising out of the Tax Allocation, and neither Buyer nor Seller
shall be required to litigate before any court any proposed deficiency or
adjustment by any taxing authority challenging such Tax Allocation.

 



 

(f) **_Production Taxes_**. On or before the Closing, Seller shall deliver to
Buyer copies of the relevant documents concerning assessment and collection of
the Production Taxes. Seller shall retain responsibility for all Production
Taxes assessed with respect to the ownership and operation of the Properties
for (i) any period ending prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) the portion of
any Straddle Period ending immediately prior to the Effective Time. All
Production Taxes with respect to the ownership or operation of the Assets
arising on or after the Effective Time (including all Production Taxes for any
Straddle Period not apportioned to Seller) shall be allocated to and borne by
the Buyer. For purposes of determining whether and to what extent a liability
for Production Taxes for a Straddle Period is allocable to a taxable period
(or portion thereof) ending on or before the Effective Time or after the
Effective Time: (a) Production Taxes imposed in connection with any sale or
other transfer or assignment of property (real or personal, tangible or
intangible) shall be allocated to the taxable period or portion thereof based
on an interim closing of the books, (b) Production Taxes that are attributable
to the severance or production of hydrocarbons shall be allocated to the
period in which the severance or production giving rise to such Taxes
occurred, and (c) Production Taxes imposed on a periodic basis shall be
allocated based on the number of days in the relevant taxable period that
occur on or before the Effective Time, on the one hand, and the number of days
in such taxable period that occur after the Effective Time, on the other hand.
Seller shall timely file any Tax Return with respect to Production Taxes due
on or before the Closing Date or that otherwise relates solely to periods
before the Closing Date and shall pay any Production Taxes shown due and owing
on such Tax Return. From and after the Closing Date, Buyer shall timely file
any Tax Returns with respect to Production Taxes required to be filed after
the Closing Date, including such Tax Returns for any Straddle Period that are
due after the Closing Date, and shall pay any Production Taxes shown due and
owing on such Tax Return. To the extent the actual amount of a Production Tax
is not known at the time an adjustment is to be made with respect to such
Production Tax pursuant to Section 3(a), Section 3(b) or Section 12(a) or
Section 13, as applicable, the Parties shall utilize the most recent
information available in estimating the amount of such Production Tax for
purposes of such adjustment. To the extent the actual amount of a Production
Tax (or the amount thereof paid or economically borne by a Party) is
ultimately determined to be different than the amount (if any) that was taken
into account in the Final Settlement Statement as finally determined pursuant
to Section 13, timely payments will be made from one Party to the other to the
extent necessary to cause each Party to bear the amount of such Production Tax
that is allocable to such Party under this Section 3(f).

 



 

(g) **_Audit Adjustments_**. Seller retains all rights to adjustments
resulting from any operating agreement and other audit claims on transactions
occurring prior to the Effective Time. Any credit received by Buyer pertaining
to such an audit claim on transactions occurring prior to the Effective Time
shall be paid to Seller within thirty (30) days after receipt. In like manner,
Seller shall remain solely liable for, and Buyer does not assume, any
obligations due to third parties resulting from any operating agreement and
other audit claims on transactions occurring prior to the Effective Time, and
if Buyer is required to pay any such audit claim, Seller will reimburse Buyer
within thirty (30) days after billing for same.

safety policies of the operator that have been communicated to Buyer in
writing and shall not interfere with the operation of the Properties. Seller
shall have the right to witness all of Buyers due diligence and environmental

process of any court or governmental authority. If reasonably possible and to
the extent allowed by Applicable Law, Buyer shall notify Seller in advance of
any such disclosure prior to the Closing Date, and shall furnish Seller copies
of all materials to be disclosed prior to any disclosure thereof to third
parties. As soon as reasonably possible after Buyers receipt thereof, Buyer
shall deliver to Seller a copy of any final report concerning or derived from
Buyers environmental assessment. Buyers failure to deliver a copy of all or
any of such final reports shall in no way constitute a waiver of any
Environmental Defect asserted on or before Buyers Notice Date pursuant to
Section 7(c).

 



 

(b) **_Indemnity and Disclaimer_**. **WITHOUT LIMITING ANY REMEDIES OF BUYER
FOR EITHER TITLE DEFECTS OR ENVIRONMENTAL DEFECTS OR ANY REMEDIES IN THIS
AGREEMENT OF BUYER FOR THE BREACH OF ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY IN SECTION

FORTH IN THE ASSIGNMENT OR ANY COVENANT OF SELLER, (I) ** **BUYER SHALL
INDEMNIFY, DEFEND, RELEASE AND HOLD HARMLESS SELLER INDEMNITEES FROM AND
AGAINST ANY AND ALL CLAIMS AND DAMAGES**

 



      
 

 



 

 **ARISING FROM OR IN CONNECTION WITH BUYER S, AND BUYERS AGENTS AND
REPRESENTATIVES, DUE DILIGENCE INVESTIGATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT OF
THE PROPERTIES, INCLUDING CLAIMS FOR PROPERTY DAMAGE, PERSONAL INJURY AND
DEATH, EVEN THOUGH CAUSED IN WHOLE OR IN PART BY THE NEGLIGENCE (WHETHER
ACTIVE, PASSIVE, SOLE, JOINT OR CONCURRENT) OR OTHER LEGAL FAULT OF THE SELLER
INDEMNITEES, BUT EXCLUDING THE GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OF ANY
OF SELLER INDEMNITEES OR MATTERS DISCOVERED BY BUYER IN CONNECTION WITH

RELEASE ANY AND ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY, AT
COMMON LAW OR OTHERWISE, WITH RESPECT TO THE ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF ANY
INFORMATION PROVIDED BY SELLER TO BUYER. BUYER AGREES THAT ANY CONCLUSIONS

Defects (the "Defect Notice"), including Buyers Knowledge of any Title
Benefit not later than 4:00 p.m., Mountain Time on May 25, 2017 (the "Buyers
Notice Date"); provided, however, Buyer agrees to use Buyers commercially
reasonable efforts in good faith to provide Seller with an informal weekly
update with respect to Buyers discovery of any Title Defect, Title Benefit or
Environmental Defect during the prior week. Buyers failure to provide any
such weekly informal update shall in no way constitute a waiver of any Title
Defects or Environmental Defects asserted on or before Buyers Notice Date
pursuant to this Section 7(c). The Defect Notice shall set forth in reasonable
detail: (i) the Properties affected by Title Defects and/or Environmental
Defects; (ii) the nature and basis of such Title Defects and/or Environmental
Defects, including any reasonable supporting documentation in Buyers
possession reasonably necessary for Seller to verify the existence of such
Title Defect or Environmental Defect; (iii) the action Buyer recommends to
cure such Title Defect or remediate such Environmental Defect; and (iv)
Buyers good faith determination of the Title Defect Value or Remediation
Value. Except with respect to any Title Defects that would constitute a breach
of Sellers special warranty of title contained in the Assignment, failure to
assert a Title Defect or Environmental Defect by a Defect Notice delivered on
or before Buyers Notice Date shall conclusively be deemed a waiver of the
alleged Title Defect or Environmental Defect.

 



 

(d) **_Seller s Right to Cure_**. Seller shall have the right, but not the
obligation, to (i) remediate any Environmental Defects asserted in the Defect
Notice and/or any preliminary notice, at Sellers sole cost and expense, at
any time prior to the Closing Date and (ii) cure any Title Defects asserted in
the Defect Notice and/or any preliminary notice, at Sellers sole cost and
expense, at any time during the Title Cure Period. On or before 4:00 p.m.,
Mountain Time on June 6, 2017 ("Sellers Response Date"), Seller shall deliver
to Buyer written notice of Sellers response to Buyers Defect Notice setting
forth in reasonable detail, with respect to each of Buyers asserted Title
Defect and Environmental Defects, (A) whether Seller elects to attempt to cure
such Title Defect or Environmental Defect, as applicable, (B) whether Seller
objects to

 



      
 

 



 

the existence of such Title Defect or Environmental Defect, as applicable, and
(C) whether Seller objects to the asserted Title Defect Value or Remediation
Value, as applicable, and, in the case of (B) and (C), reasonable supporting
documentation. The Parties shall enter into good faith negotiations and shall
attempt to agree on the existence and amounts of the Title Defects and
Environmental Defects and the appropriate remedies with respect thereto as set
forth in Section 7(e) prior to Closing.

 



 

(e) **_Remedies for Title Defects_**. Subject to Sellers rights pursuant to
Section 7(d), in the event that any Title Defect timely asserted by Buyer in

Deductible, upon the mutual election of the Parties:

 



 

(i) Seller will convey the entirety of the Property that is subject to such
Title Defect, together with all associated Properties, at Closing, to Buyer
and make an accompanying reduction to the Purchase Price by the Title Defect
Value determined pursuant to Section 7(f) or Section 7(j) (after giving effect
to any partial cure, if applicable); or

 



 

(ii) Seller shall retain the entirety of the Property that is subject to such
Title Defect, together with all associated Properties (in which case, such
Properties shall become Excluded Properties hereunder), in which event the
Purchase Price shall be reduced by an amount equal to the Allocated Value of
such Property that is subject to such Title Defect and such associated
Properties;

 



 

provided, that if the Parties cannot reach a mutually acceptable agreement on
or before the Closing, with respect to the appropriate remedy for such Title
Defect, then the option set forth in Section 7(e)(i) shall apply; provided
further that, if the option set forth in Section 7(e)(i) is elected or
otherwise deemed elected, then the provisions of Section 7(i) shall apply.

 



 

(f) **_Title Defect Value_**. The amount by which the Allocated Value of the
affected Property is reduced as a result of the existence of a Title Defect
shall be the "Title Defect Value" and shall be determined in accordance with
the following terms and conditions:

 



 

(i) If a Title Defect is undisputed and liquidated in amount, then the Title
Defect Value shall equal the amount necessary to be paid to remove the Title
Defect from the affected Properties;

 



 

(ii) if a Title Defect represents a discrepancy between the actual Net Revenue
Interest for any Properties and the Net Revenue Interest set forth in Exhibit
A or Exhibit B for such Properties, and there is a Working Interest change
proportionate to the change in the Net Revenue Interest resulting from the
Title Defect, then the Title Defect Value for each Property shall be the
product of (A) the Allocated Value for such Property set forth on Schedule
3(d) multiplied by (B) one (1) minus a fraction, the numerator of which shall
equal the actual Net Revenue Interest in such Property, and the denominator of
which shall equal the Net Revenue Interest for such Property set forth in
Exhibit A or Exhibit B;

 



      
 

 



 

(iii) if a Title Defect represents a discrepancy in the amount of Net Mineral
Acres for any Properties and the Net Mineral Acres set forth in Exhibit A for
such Properties, then the Title Defect Value for each Property shall be the
product of (A) the Allocated Value for the applicable Property as set forth on
Schedule 3(d) multiplied by (B) one (1) minus a fraction, the numerator of
which shall equal the actual Net Mineral Acres for such Property, and the
denominator of which shall equal the Net Mineral Acres for such Property set
forth in Exhibit A; and

 



 

(iv) if the Parties do not agree on the amount of a Title Defect Value,
Section 7(j) shall apply with respect thereto;

 



 

provided, that notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 7, the
aggregate Title Defect Values attributable to the effects of all Title Defects
upon any single Property shall not exceed the Allocated Value of such Title
Defect Property.

 



 

(g) **_Remedies for Environmental Defects_**. Subject to Sellers rights
pursuant to Section 7(d), in the event that any Environmental Defect timely
asserted by Buyer in accordance with Section 7(c) is not waived in writing by
Buyer or cured on or before Closing, then, subject to the Environmental Defect
Threshold and the Environmental Deductible, upon the mutual election of the
Parties:

 



 

(i) Seller will convey the entirety of the Property that is subject to such
Environmental Defect, together with all associated Properties, at Closing, to
Buyer and make an accompanying reduction to the Purchase Price by the
Remediation Value for such Environmental Defect agreed to by the Parties or
otherwise determined pursuant to Section 7(k); or

 



 

(ii) Seller will retain the entirety of the Property that is subject to such
Environmental Defect, together with all associated Properties (in which case,
such Properties shall become Excluded Properties hereunder), and reduce the
Purchase Price by an amount equal to the Allocated Value of such Property and
such associated Properties;

 



 

provided, that if the Parties cannot reach a mutually acceptable agreement on
or before the Closing with respect to the appropriate remedy for such
Environmental Defect, then the option set forth in Section 7(g)(ii) above
shall apply.

 



 

(h) **_Title Benefits_**. Seller shall have the right, but not the obligation,
to deliver to Buyer on or before Buyers Notice Date, with respect to each
Title Benefit discovered by Seller, written notice setting forth the nature
and basis of such Title Benefits and the Title Benefit Amounts attributable
thereto. On or before Sellers Response Date, Buyer shall have the right, but
not the obligation, to deliver to Seller written notice of Buyers response to
Sellers asserted Title Benefits. The Parties shall enter into good faith
negotiations between Sellers Response Date and the Closing with respect to
Title Benefits and shall attempt to agree on the existence and the appropriate
resolution thereof. If the Parties cannot reach agreement regarding an
increase to the Purchase Price for Title Benefits on or before the Closing,
the Parties shall resolve such dispute in accordance with Section 7(j).

 



      
 

 



 

(i) **_Post-Closing Title Matters_**. With respect to any Property subject to
a Title Defect that is conveyed to Buyer at Closing pursuant to Section
7(e)(i):

 



 

(i) If at the end of the Title Cure Period, (A) the Title Defect is not cured
and Seller and Buyer agree that such Title Defect has not been cured or (B) if
Seller and Buyer cannot agree, and it is determined by the Title Consultant
that such Title Defect is not cured at the end of the Title Cure Period, then
(in either case) Buyer shall retain the Property affected by such Title Defect
and Seller shall not be entitled to any increase to the Purchase Price; or

 



 

(ii) If at the end of the Title Cure Period, (A) the Title Defect is cured and
Seller and Buyer agree that such Title Defect has been cured or (B) if Seller
and Buyer cannot agree, and it is determined by the Title Consultant that such
Title Defect is cured as of the end of the Title Cure Period, then (in either
case) Buyer shall retain the Property affected by such Title Defect and Seller
shall be entitled to an increase in the Purchase Price in an amount equal to
the reduction in the Purchase Price attributable to such Title Defect at
Closing, which increase shall be reflected in the Final Settlement Statement
and paid to Seller in accordance with Section 13.

 



 

(j) **_Title Disputes_**. During the ten (10) Business Day period following
the Closing Date (or at the end of the Title Cure Period, if Seller elects to

Title Defect Values and Title Benefit Amounts shall be submitted to a title
attorney with at least ten (10) years experience in oil and gas titles as
selected by: (x) mutual agreement of Buyer and Seller; or (y) absent such
agreement during the ten (10) Business Day period, by the Denver, Colorado
office of the American Arbitration Association (the "Title Consultant"). The
Title Consultant shall not have been employed by any Party or its affiliates
within the five (5) year period preceding the arbitration. The Title

shall be conducted in writing, with copies sent simultaneously to the other
party in the same manner, or at a meeting or conference call to which the
representatives of both Seller and Buyer have been invited and of which such
parties have been provided at least five (5) days notice. Within ten (10)
days of appointment of the Title Consultant, each of Seller and Buyer shall
present the Title Consultant with its Defect Notice or its response, as
applicable, and all other supporting information that it desires, with a copy
to the other Party. The Title Consultant shall also be provided with a copy of
this Agreement. Within forty-five (45) days after receipt of such materials
and after receipt of any additional information required by the Title
Consultant, the Title Consultant shall make its determination, which shall be
final and binding upon all parties, without right of appeal, absent manifest
error. In making his determination, the Title Consultant shall be bound by the
rules set forth in this Section 7. In no event shall any Title Defect Value
exceed the estimate given by Buyer in its claim notice delivered in accordance
with Section 7(c), and in no event shall any Title Benefit Amount exceed any
estimate given by Seller in a claim notice delivered in accordance with
Section 7(h). The Title Consultant shall act as an expert for the limited
purpose of determining: (A) the existence of any timely and properly asserted
Title Defect or Title Benefit in dispute; (B) whether or to the extent to
which any disputed curative action has succeeded in curing a Title Defect in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement; and (C) specific disputed Title
Defect Values or Title Benefit

 



      
 

 



 

Amounts submitted by either party. The Title Consultant may not award damages,
interest or penalties to either party with respect to any matter. Seller and
Buyer shall each bear its own legal fees and other costs of presenting its
case. Seller shall bear one-half (1/2) and Buyer shall bear one-half (1/2) of

(10) day period, by the Denver, Colorado office of the American Arbitration
Association (the "Environmental Consultant"). The Environmental Consultant
shall not have been employed by any party or its Affiliates within the five
(5) year period preceding the arbitration. The Environmental Consultant, once
appointed, shall have no ex parte communications with any of the parties
concerning the determination required hereunder. All communications between
any party or its affiliates and the Environmental Consultant shall be
conducted in writing, with copies sent simultaneously to the other party in
the same manner, or at a meeting or conference call to which the
representatives of both Seller and Buyer have been invited and of which such
parties have been provided at least five (5) days notice. Within ten (10)
days of appointment of the Environmental Consultant, each of Seller and Buyer
shall present the Environmental Consultant with a written statement of its
position on the disputed matter, including a written statement of its position
with respect to any disputes regarding: (x) the existence of any Environmental
Defect and (y) the estimated Remediation Value, in each case, as applicable,
together with all other supporting information that it deems relevant, with a
copy to the other party. The Environmental Consultant shall also be provided
with a copy of this Agreement. Within forty-five (45) days after receipt of
such materials and after receipt of any additional information required by the
Environmental Consultant, the Environmental Consultant shall make its
determination, which shall be final and binding upon all parties, without
right of appeal, absent manifest error. In making its determination, the
Environmental Consultant shall be bound by the rules set forth in this Section
7. In no event shall the Environmental Consultant select a Remediation Value
lower than the Remediation Value proposed by Seller nor higher than the
Remediation Value proposed by Buyer, as applicable. The Environmental
Consultant shall act as an expert for the limited purpose of determining: (A)
the existence of any timely and properly asserted Environmental Defect in
dispute and (B) the specific disputed Remediation Value. The Environmental
Consultant may not award damages, interest or penalties to any party with
respect to any matter nor may it cause Buyer to take assignment of any
Property. Seller and Buyer shall each bear its own legal fees and other costs
of presenting its case. Seller shall bear one-half (1/2) and Buyer shall bear

(l) **_Exclusive Remedy_**. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein,
except for any Title Defects that constitute a breach of Sellers special
warranty of title contained in the Assignment, this Section 7, Section 9, any
remedies of Buyer in this Agreement for the breach by Seller of its
representation or warranties in Section 4 or in Sellers Certificate and the
termination right contained in Section 18 shall be Buyers sole and exclusive
remedies against Seller for Title Defects and Environmental Defects, and Buyer
irrevocably waives, releases and disclaims all other Claims and remedies
against Seller arising in connection with or related to Title Defects and
Environmental Defects.

 



       
 

 



 

8. **_Environmental Acknowledgments_**. **WITHOUT LIMITING BUYER S REMEDIES WITH RESPECT TO AN ENVIRONMENTAL DEFECT PURSUANT TO SECTION 7 OR A BREACH BY SELLER OF ITS REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES IN SECTION 4 OR IN SELLERS CERTIFICATE, OR ANY REMEDIES OF BUYER UNDER SECTION 9 OR SECTION 16, BUYER HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES AS FOLLOWS: (I) BUYER HAS ENTERED INTO THIS AGREEMENT ON THE BASIS OF BUYERS OWN INVESTIGATION OF THE CONDITION OF THE PROPERTIES, INCLUDING SURFACE AND SUBSURFACE CONDITIONS; (II) BUYER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THE LAND HAS BEEN USED TO EXPLORE FOR, DEVELOP AND PRODUCE OIL AND GAS, AND FOR THE DISPOSAL OF PRODUCED WATER, AND THAT SPILLS OF CRUDE OIL, PRODUCED WATER, WASTES, HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES, AND OTHER MATERIALS MAY HAVE OCCURRED THEREON, AND PHYSICAL CHANGES TO THE PROPERTIES MAY HAVE OCCURRED AS A RESULT OF SUCH USE; (III) (A) LOW LEVELS OF NORM MAY BE PRESENT AT SOME LOCATIONS, (B) NORM IS A NATURAL PHENOMENON ASSOCIATED WITH MANY OIL FIELDS IN THE U.S. AND THROUGHOUT THE WORLD, AND (C) BUYER WILL MAKE ITS OWN DETERMINATION ON THIS MATTER; AND (IV) EXCEPT AS SPECIFICALLY PROVIDED ELSEWHERE IN THIS AGREEMENT, UPON CLOSING, BUYER SHALL, AND DOES HEREBY, ASSUME THE RISK THAT THE PROPERTIES MAY CONTAIN WASTES OR CONTAMINANTS AND THAT ADVERSE PHYSICAL CONDITIONS, INCLUDING THE PRESENCE OF WASTES OR CONTAMINANTS, MAY NOT HAVE BEEN REVEALED BY BUYERS INVESTIGATION.**

 



 

9. **_Casualty_**.

 



 

(a) **_Casualty Loss_**. Prior to the Closing, if a portion of the Properties
are damaged or destroyed by an act of God, fire, explosion, earthquake,
windstorm, flood, or other casualty (excluding normal wear and tear, and
changes in production characteristics (except for any such changes caused by
or resulting from a Casualty Event)), or if a portion of the Properties is
taken or threatened to be taken in condemnation or under the right of eminent
domain (collectively, a "Casualty Event"), Seller shall promptly deliver to
Buyer written notice of such Casualty Event with reasonable detail of the
nature of such Casualty Event, and Sellers good faith proposal for the
appropriate corrective action with respect thereto, including any
environmental remediation required pursuant to applicable Environmental Law.
For purposes of this Section, the amount of any "Casualty Loss" shall be equal
to either the lesser of (i) the cost of such appropriate corrective action to
restore the Properties affected by such Casualty Event to substantially their
same condition as prior to such Casualty Event or (ii) the Allocated Value of
the Properties affected by such Casualty Event; provided, that with respect to
any condemnation or action for eminent domain the option set forth in clause
(ii) shall apply. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, any
individual Casualty Loss which is less than the Casualty Threshold shall not
be deemed to be a Casualty Event hereunder.

 



 

(b) **_Casualty Remedies_**. Seller shall have the right, but not the
obligation, to remedy any Casualty Loss prior to the Closing. If Seller
remedies such Casualty Loss prior to the Closing to the reasonable
satisfaction of Buyer, there shall be no adjustment to the Purchase Price.
Seller shall not voluntarily compromise, settle or adjust any amounts payable
by reason of

 



      
 

 



 

any Casualty Event without the prior written consent of Buyer. If the Closing
occurs with respect to any of the Properties affected by a Casualty Event, and
Buyer is not reasonably satisfied that Seller has remedied such Casualty Loss
prior to the Closing, the Parties will mutually agree to (x) adjust the
Purchase Price downward by the amount of the Casualty Loss less the Casualty
Threshold, (y) have Seller assign to Buyer the proceeds of any insurance
coverage or condemnation award attributable to such affected Properties, or
(z) exclude the affected Property from the transaction contemplated hereby;
provided that if the Parties are unable to agree, Buyer shall be entitled to
the remedy under Section 9(b)(x). If the Parties agree on the remedy under
Section 9(b)(y) Seller shall except and reserve such affected Properties from
the Assignment and such Properties will be Withdrawn Properties, and the
Purchase Price for the remaining Properties shall be reduced by the Allocated
Value of the Properties affected by the Casualty Event and Seller shall be
entitled to and shall retain all insurance proceeds and condemnation awards
allocable to such affected Properties. Each Party hereby waives, disclaims and
releases any and all Claims against the other Party arising in connection with
or related to such Withdrawn Properties.

 



 

(c) **_Risk of Loss_**. Without limiting Buyers remedies pursuant to the
special warranty of title contained in the Assignment, Section 16 or with
respect to any breach of Sellers representations and warranties set forth in
Section 4 or in Sellers Certificate, from and after the Closing Date, Buyer
shall assume all risk of loss for the Properties with respect to: (i) changes
in commodities prices, credit markets, and other market factors or conditions;
(ii) changes in the Land; (iii) changes in production characteristics,
including production declines, depletion, watering out, collapsed casing, sand
infiltration or other adverse changes; and (iv) normal wear and tear.

 



 

10. **_Preferential Purchase Rights and Consents_**.

 



 

(a) Seller shall deliver all required notices with respect to Preferential
Purchase Rights and Consents, with respect to each, in accordance with the
terms set forth in the agreement providing for such notice, as soon as
reasonably possible after this Agreement is executed and delivered by the
Parties, but in any event within five (5) Business Days after the Execution
Date. Seller shall use its commercially reasonable efforts in good faith to
obtain waivers of Preferential Purchase Rights and Consents (without any
obligation of Seller to incur any liabilities or pay any money or tender any
other consideration). Seller will provide Buyer with a copy of the form of
waiver or consent request (as applicable) it intends to use to obtain any such
waivers or Preferential Purchase Rights and Consents prior to sending such
waiver or consent request. Buyer shall use its commercially reasonable efforts
(without any obligation to incur any liabilities or pay any money or other
consideration) to assist and cooperate with Seller in furtherance of this
Section 10(a).

 



 

(b) If (i) the time period for the exercise of any Preferential Purchase Right
or Consent expires prior to Closing, (ii) a Preferential Purchase Right is
waived in writing by the holder thereof, or (iii) a Consent is obtained from
or waived by the applicable Third Party, then Seller shall convey the
Properties affected thereby to Buyer at the Closing.

 



 

(c) In the event that any Preferential Purchase Right is timely exercised
prior to the Closing (or, subject to the following sentence, after Closing),
the applicable Properties

 



      
 

 



 

shall cease to be a part of this transaction and will be Withdrawn Properties,
and the Purchase Price for the Properties shall be reduced by the Allocated
Value of the applicable Properties. If the time period for any such
Preferential Purchase Right has not expired at or prior to the Closing, then
the Properties affected thereby shall constitute Withdrawn Properties until
such time as the time period for the exercise of such Preferential Purchase
Right expires or such Preferential Purchase Right is waived, upon which Seller
shall promptly assign such Properties to Buyer, and Buyer shall pay Seller the
Allocated Value of the applicable Properties, as adjusted pursuant to Section
3.

 



 

(d) In the event that, prior to Closing, Seller is unable to obtain any
Consents, the Properties affected by such un-obtained Consent(s) shall
constitute Withdrawn Properties and the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the
Allocated Value of such Withdrawn Properties. Notwithstanding the foregoing
sentence, Buyer shall have the right, but not the obligation, to waive any
Consent by delivering written notice to Seller. If such a waiver is delivered
to Seller, the Properties subject to such waived Consents shall not be
considered Withdrawn Properties and shall be included in the Properties.

 



 

(e) After Closing, Seller shall use reasonable efforts to obtain the Consents
within a reasonable time. If Seller obtains any Consents on or before the
Post-Closing Date, Seller shall promptly assign to Buyer the Properties
subject to such Consents, and Buyer shall pay Seller the Allocated Value of
such Properties, as adjusted pursuant to Section 3\. If any Consents have not
been obtained on or before the Post-Closing Date, the Properties affected
thereby shall cease to be a part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and shall continue to be Withdrawn Properties.

Settlement Statement and any other documentation such Party may desire to
submit. Within twenty (20) Business Days after receiving the Parties
respective submissions, the Accounting Arbitrator shall render a decision
choosing either Sellers position or Buyers position with respect to each
matter addressed in any Dispute Notice, based on the materials described
above. Any decision rendered by the Accounting Arbitrator pursuant hereto
shall be final, conclusive and binding on Seller and Buyer and will be
enforceable against any of the Parties in any court of competent jurisdiction.
The costs of such Accounting Arbitrator shall be borne by the party which the
Accounting Arbitrator has not selected their position as the appropriate
position. In the event that Hein and Associates LLP declines to serve as the
Accounting Arbitrator, then the Accounting Arbitrator shall be selected from

15. **_Operations_**. Buyer acknowledges that it desires to succeed Seller as operator of those Properties or portions thereof that Seller may, as of the Closing, operate. Buyer further acknowledges and agrees that Seller cannot and does not covenant or warrant that Buyer or any Affiliate of Buyer shall become successor operator of such Properties or portions thereof. Seller agrees however that, as to the Properties it operates, prior to Closing it shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to (i) designate or recommend, to the extent legally possible and permitted under any applicable agreements, Buyer or its Affiliate as successor operator of such Properties or portions thereof, and (ii) support Buyers efforts to become successor operator of such Properties, to the extent legally possible and permitted under any applicable agreements, in each case, effective as of Closing or within a reasonable time thereafter.

 



 

16. **_Indemnities_**.

 



 

(a) **_Seller s Indemnification_**. Seller hereby agrees to indemnify,
defend, release and hold harmless Buyer, and Buyers Affiliates, investment
bankers, brokers, accountants, attorneys, successors and assigns, and their
respective officers, directors, shareholders, managers, members, partners,
employees, agents and representatives (collectively "Buyer Indemnitees"), from
and against any and all Claims and Damages arising in connection with or
related to: (i) a breach of any of Sellers (A) representations and warranties
or (B) covenants or agreements hereunder; (ii) Sellers material violation of
or noncompliance with any Applicable Law with respect to its ownership and
operation of the Properties; (iii) the Retained Liabilities; and (iv) Seller
Taxes.

 



 

(b) **_Buyer s Indemnification_**. Buyer hereby agrees to indemnify, defend,
release and hold harmless Seller, Sellers Affiliates, investment bankers,
brokers, accountants

 



      
 

 



 

and attorneys, successors and assigns, and their respective officers,
directors, shareholders, managers, members, partners, employees, agents and
representatives (collectively, "Seller Indemnitees"), from and against any and
all Claims and Damages arising in connection with or related to: (i) the
Assumed Liabilities; and (ii) a breach of any of Buyers (A) representations
and warranties or (B) covenants or agreements hereunder.

 



 

(c) **_Monetary Damages_**. Seller and Buyer acknowledge and agree that the
payment of money, as limited by the terms of this Agreement, shall be adequate
compensation for any and all Claims of breach of any representation, warranty
or covenant contained herein or for any other Claims arising in connection
with or with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. As
the payment of money shall be adequate compensation, Buyer and Seller hereby
waive, disclaim and release any and all rights to rescind this Agreement or
any of the transactions contemplated hereby after the Closing.

 



 

(d) **_Monetary_** ** _Limitation_**. Seller shall not be obligated to
indemnify Buyer for any Damages pursuant to Section 16(a)(i)(A) or Section
16(a)(ii) except to the extent that the aggregate of all such Damages exceeds
the Indemnity Deductible, provided, however, that neither breach by Seller of
any of the Fundamental Representations nor a Tax Claim shall be subject to the
Indemnity Deductible. The Parties acknowledge and agree that it is the intent
of the Parties that Sellers obligations set forth in Section 16(a)(i)(A) and
Section 16(a)(ii) shall cover and include that portion of the Damages in
excess of the Indemnity Deductible only. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary, Buyers right to indemnification from Seller pursuant to Section
16(a)(i)(A) and Section 16(a)(ii) shall be limited to and shall not exceed
fifteen percent (15%) of the Adjusted Purchase Price, provided, however, that
neither a breach by Seller of Sellers Fundamental Representations or a Tax
Claim shall be subject to the monetary limitation contained in this Section
16(d). The monetary limitations in this Section 16(d) shall not apply to any
Claims by Buyer arising from Sellers intentional fraud with respect to any
matter. Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, in no event shall any
Party be entitled to duplicate compensation with respect to any Claim, Title
Defect, Environmental Defect, Damages or breach of representation, warranty or
covenant asserted under any provision of this Agreement, even though such
Claim, Title Defect, Environmental Defect, Damages or breach may be addressed
by more than one provision of this Agreement. Further, Buyer shall not have
any right of indemnification by Seller under this Section 16, and Seller shall
not have any obligation of indemnification of Buyer under this Section 16 for
the Permitted Encumbrances, Title Defects or Environmental Defects.

 



 

(e) **_Time_** ** _Limitation_**. Except for a claim by Buyer arising out of a
breach by Seller of Sellers Fundamental Representations (which Claims shall
expire only as provided in the applicable statute of limitations) or a Tax
Claim (which shall expire upon the expiration of the applicable statute of
limitations to which such Tax relates, plus thirty (30) days), the following
shall terminate and be of no further force or effect after the six (6) month
anniversary of the Closing: (i) Sellers representations and warranties
contained herein and (ii) Sellers obligation to indemnify Buyer pursuant to
Section 16(a)(ii). Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Claims asserted in good
faith by Buyer for indemnification by Seller for which Buyer has delivered
written notice to Seller on or before the termination dates noted, the
indemnification obligations under this Section 16 shall remain in full force
and effect until the final resolution of such Claims. The covenants,
obligations and agreements of Seller and Buyer in this Agreement

 



      
 

 



 

that are required to be performed on or prior to Closing shall, in each case,
survive the Closing until the 6 month anniversary of the Closing and covenants
to be performed after Closing shall survive until fully performed in
accordance with their terms. The intended effect of termination of Sellers
representations, warranties, covenants, agreements and indemnities is to
irrevocably bar, from and after the date of the applicable termination, any
Claim arising out of or related to the alleged inaccuracy of the
representation or the alleged breach of the warranty, covenant or agreement,
or any obligation with respect to the applicable indemnity.

 



 

(f) **_Indemnification Actions_**. To make a claim for indemnification under
this Section 16, an Indemnified Party shall notify the Indemnifying Party of
its claim under this Section 16, including the specific details of and
specific basis under this Agreement for its claim (the "Claim Notice"). In the
event that the claim for indemnification is based upon a Third Party Claim,
the Indemnified Party shall provide its Claim Notice promptly after the
Indemnified Party has actual knowledge of the Third Party Claim and shall
enclose a copy of all papers (if any) served with respect to the Third Party
Claim.

 



 

(g) **_Materiality_**. Notwithstanding anything herein or in any transaction
document to the contrary, the obligations and rights of the Parties hereunder,
and the liabilities for which any Indemnifying Party is obligated to indemnify
or any Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnity under this Section 16 shall
be determined and calculated by excluding and without giving effect to any
qualifiers as to materiality, Material Adverse Effect or material adverse
effect set forth in any representation or warranty.

 



 

(h) **_Express Negligence_**. THE DEFENSE, INDEMNIFICATION, HOLD HARMLESS AND
RELEASE PROVISIONS, THE RETENTION OF THE RETAINED LIABILITIES AND THE
ASSUMPTION OF THE ASSUMED LIABILITIES PROVISIONS (IN EACH CASE) PROVIDED FOR
IN THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE APPLICABLE WHETHER OR NOT THE LIABILITIES, LOSSES,
COSTS, EXPENSES AND DAMAGES IN QUESTION AROSE OR RESULTED SOLELY OR IN PART
FROM THE GROSS, SOLE, ACTIVE, PASSIVE, CONCURRENT OR COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE,
STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER FAULT OR VIOLATION OF LAW OF OR BY ANY INDEMNIFIED
PARTY. BUYER AND SELLER ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS STATEMENT COMPLIES WITH THE
EXPRESS NEGLIGENCE RULE AND IS CONSPICUOUS.

 



 

(i) **_Exclusive_** ** _Remedy_**. If the Closing occurs, the sole and
exclusive remedy of Buyer and Seller with respect to this Agreement, and the
transactions contemplated hereby, shall be pursuant to the indemnification
provisions of this Section 16 and the special warranty of title in the
Assignment only. Any and all Claims for the breach of any representation,
warranty, agreement or covenant contained herein, or for any other Claims
arising in connection with or with respect to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, shall be subject to the provisions set forth in this Section
16 and the special warranty of title in the Assignment. Except for the rights
and remedies expressly stated in this Agreement (including the indemnification
provisions of this Section 16) and the special warranty of title in the
Assignment, if the Closing occurs, each Party shall be deemed to have
irrevocably disclaimed, waived and released any and all rights and remedies,
at law or in equity, against the other Party for any Claims arising in
connection with or related to this Agreement, and the transactions
contemplated hereby,

 



      
 

 



 

including any right of contribution under any and all Applicable Law.

 



 

(j) **_Indemnity Payments_**. Any payments made to any Party pursuant to
Section 16 shall constitute an adjustment of the Purchase Price for Tax
purposes and shall be treated as such by Buyer and Seller on their Tax Returns
to the extent permitted by law.

18. **_Termination and Notices_**.

 



 

(a) **_Termination_**. This Agreement, and the transactions contemplated
hereby, may be terminated at any time prior to the Closing: (i) by mutual
written agreement of Seller and Buyer; (ii) by Seller, at Sellers option, if
the conditions set forth in Section 11(a), Section 11(e) or 11(g) have not
been satisfied by Buyer or waived in writing by Seller by the Outside
Termination Date; (iii) by Buyer, at Buyers option, if the conditions set
forth in Section 11(b), Section 11(f) or Section 11(h) have not been satisfied
by Seller or waived in writing by Buyer by the Outside Termination Date; (iv)
by either Buyer or Seller, at such Partys option, if the conditions set forth
in Sections 11(c) or 11(d) have not been satisfied or waived in writing by the
Parties by the Outside Termination Date; or (v) by either Seller or Buyer, at
such Partys option, if the Closing shall not have occurred on or before June
30, 2017 (the "Outside Termination Date"). A Party shall not have any right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 18(a) if such Party is at
such time in material breach of any provision of this Agreement. If this
Agreement is terminated by either Party pursuant to Section 18(a)(i), (iv) or
(v), the Escrow Agent shall promptly return the Deposit (and all interest
thereon, if any) to Buyer as Buyers sole and exclusive remedy, and each Party
hereby disclaims, waives and releases any and all Claims against the other
Party arising in connection with or related to such termination. If this
Agreement is terminated pursuant to any provision of this Section 18(a), then,
except as provided

 



      
 

 



 

in Section 18(b) and Section 18(c) and except for the provisions of Schedule 1
and Article 20 (other than Section 20(q)), this Agreement shall forthwith
become void and of no further force or effect.

 



 

(b) **_Buyer s Remedy_**. If this Agreement is terminated by Buyer pursuant
to Section 18(a)(iii), then, Buyer shall be entitled to, and at its option,
either (i) obtain specific performance of this Agreement in lieu of
termination and recover all actual, direct damages incurred by Buyer in
connection with enforcing such specific performance or (ii) have the Buyer and
Seller direct the Escrow Agent to promptly return all funds then in the Escrow
Account to Buyer and receive as liquidated damages and not as a penalty an
amount equal to Seven Million Dollars ($7,000,000) (which, for the avoidance
of doubt, shall be in addition to Buyers right to a return of the all funds
then in the Escrow Account as provided for above). In connection with any
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 18(a) and except as provided
in this Section 18(b) and Section 18(c), each Party hereby disclaims, waives
and releases any and all Claims against the other Parties arising in
connection with or related to such termination. The Parties acknowledge and
agree that, as of the time this Agreement was entered into: (i) the
anticipated damages in case of such termination were difficult to ascertain;
(ii) the Parties mutually intended to liquidate the damages in advance; (iii)
the amount of such liquidated damages are a reasonable estimate of the
potential actual damages the breach would cause; and (iv) such liquidated
damages are not so disproportionate to any possible loss as to constitute a
penalty. Buyer hereby covenants and agrees that Buyer shall not file, and
hereby disclaims, waives and releases any right to record in the real property
records a copy of this Agreement.

 



 

(c) **_Seller s Remedy_**. If this Agreement is terminated by Seller pursuant
to Section 18(a)(ii), then, as Sellers sole and exclusive remedy and as
liquidated damages and not a penalty, the Escrow Agent shall promptly be
directed by Buyer and Seller to deliver to Seller an amount equal to all funds
then in the Escrow Account. Each Party hereby disclaims, waives and releases
any and all Claims against the other Party arising in connection with or
related to such termination. The Parties acknowledge and agree that, as of the
time this Agreement was entered into: (i) the anticipated damages in case of
such termination were difficult to ascertain; (ii) the Parties mutually
intended to liquidate the damages in advance; (iii) the amount of such
liquidated damages are a reasonable estimate of the potential actual damages
the breach would cause; and (iv) such liquidated damages are not so
disproportionate to any possible loss as to constitute a penalty.

 



 

19. **_Notices_**. All notices and communications required or permitted under this Agreement shall be in writing addressed as set forth below, and any notice or communication hereunder shall be deemed to have been duly delivered upon the earliest of: (a) actual receipt by the Party to be notified; (b) if sent by the United States Postal Service, certified mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested, then the date shown as received on the return notice; (c) if by electronic transmission, upon acknowledgment of receipt; or (d) by Federal Express overnight delivery (or other reputable overnight delivery service if the transmitting Party obtains proof of delivery), the date shown on the notice of delivery. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if such date of delivery is not a Business Day (or if such date is a Business Day but the time of such delivery is after normal business hours), then the date of delivery shall be deemed to be on the next date that is a Business Day. If the date specified in this Agreement for taking any action is not a Business Day (or if the period during which any notice is required to be given or any action

 



      
 

 



 

taken expires on a date which is not a Business Day), then the date for giving

matter shall be deemed to be disclosed in such other section of this
Agreement, whether or not an explicit cross reference appears.

 



 

(b) **_Integration_**. This Agreement, and the exhibits and schedules hereto,
including Schedule 1  Definitions and the transaction documents contemplated

(c) **_Amendments_**. This Agreement may not be altered or amended, nor any
rights hereunder waived, except by a written document signed by the Party to

(d) **_No Assignment_**. A Party shall not assign, or contract to assign, any
of its rights, interests, obligations or duties under this Agreement before

performance or injunctive relief hereunder.

would cause the application of Law from another jurisdiction. **SUBJECT TO THE
ARBITRATION PROVISION SET FORTH IN SECTION 20(i), IN THE EVENT A PROCEEDING
IN COURT IS NECESSARY TO ENFORCE ANY ARBITRATION AWARD OR OTHER RELIEF
HEREUNDER, THE PARTIES AGREE THAT ANY SUCH PROCEEDING ARISING UNDER THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREIN SHALL BE BROUGHT ****ONLY IN
DENVER, COLORADO. EACH PARTY WAIVES, DISCLAIMS AND RELEASES, TO THE MAXIMUM

PERSONALLY TO THE JURISDICTION OF THE STATE OR FEDERAL COURTS LOCATED IN
DENVER, COLORADO; (II) SUCH PROCEEDING HAS BEEN BROUGHT IN AN INCONVENIENT
FORUM; AND/OR (III) VENUE OF SUCH PROCEEDING IS IMPROPER.**

terms and provisions hereof, including the Purchase Price, shall be maintained
confidential by Buyer and Seller; provided, however, that this Agreement and
the terms and provisions thereof may be disclosed (a) to Buyers lenders, if
any, and its and their advisors and consultants, who shall agree to keep such
information confidential and (b) as required by Applicable Law or rules and
regulation of any Governmental Authority or stock exchange. If this Agreement

and its Affiliates) agrees that, following the Closing, Lewis, Bess, Williams
and Weese P.C. ("Lewis Bess") may serve as counsel to Seller in connection with
any matters related to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby, including any litigation, claim or obligation arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
notwithstanding any representation of Seller by Lewis, Bess prior to the
Closing. Buyer hereby: (i) waives any claim it may have that Lewis, Bess,
Williams and Weese P.C. has a conflict of interest or is otherwise prohibited
from engaging in such representation; and (ii) agrees that, in the event that
a dispute arises after the Closing between Buyer and Seller, Lewis, Bess may
represent Seller in such dispute even though Lewis, Bess may have represented
Seller in a matter substantially related to such dispute. Buyer represents
that Buyers own attorney has explained and assisted Buyer in evaluating the
implications and risks of waiving the right to assert a future conflict
against Lewis, Bess, and Buyers consent with respect to this waiver is fully
informed. Buyer and Seller further agree that, as to all communications among
Lewis, Bess and Seller and/or each of its Affiliates and representatives, that
relate in any way to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the
attorney-client privilege and the expectation of client confidence belongs to
Seller and may be controlled by Seller and will not pass to or be claimed by
Buyer. In addition, all of the client files and records in the possession of
Lewis, Bess related to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
will continue to be property of, and be controlled by, Seller, and Buyer will
not have any access to them.

 



 

(n) **_Interpretation_**. For purposes of interpreting the provisions of this
Agreement, the Parties acknowledge and agree that: (i) this Agreement is the
result of negotiations between Buyer and Seller, and their respective counsel;
(ii) Buyer and Seller are deemed to have equal bargaining power and position;
(iii) the Parties are deemed to have drafted this Agreement jointly; and (iv)
the rule of construction that ambiguities are to be resolved against the
drafting party shall not be employed in the interpretation or construction of
this Agreement.
