ARTICLE I

 

THE OFFER AND THE MERGER

 

Section 1.01 _The Offer_.

 

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable (and, in any event, within ten (10)
Business Days after the date of this Agreement), Sub shall, and Parent shall
cause Sub to, commence, within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 promulgated under the
Exchange Act, the Offer. The obligations of Sub to, and of Parent to cause Sub
to, accept for payment, and pay for, any shares of Company Common
Stock tendered pursuant to the Offer are subject to the conditions set forth
in _Annex II_ (the " _Offer Conditions_ "). The Offer shall initially expire
at 11:59 p.m. (New York City time) on the date that is twenty (20)
Business Days following the commencement of the Offer (determined using Rule
14d-1(g)(3) promulgated under the Exchange Act). Sub expressly reserves the
right to waive, in whole or in part, any Offer Condition or modify the terms
of the Offer;  _provided_ , _however_ , that, without the prior written
consent of the Company, Sub shall not, and Parent shall not permit Sub to, (i)
reduce the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Offer, (ii)
reduce the Offer Price, (iii) amend, modify or waive the Minimum Tender
Condition, (iv) add to the Offer Conditions or amend, modify or supplement any

extend or otherwise amend or modify the expiration date of the Offer,

 



2 ##### Table of Contents

  

 (vi) change the form of consideration payable in the Offer, (vii) otherwise
amend, modify or supplement any of the terms of the Offer in any manner
adverse to any holder of Company Common Stock or (viii) provide any
"subsequent offering period" within the meaning of Rule 14d-11 promulgated
under the Exchange Act. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement
to the contrary, Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Sub to, (i) extend the
Offer on one or more occasions, in consecutive increments of up to five (5)
Business Days (or such longer period as the parties hereto may agree) each,
if, at any then-scheduled expiration of the Offer, any Offer Condition (other
than the Minimum Tender Condition) shall not have been satisfied or waived,
until such time as each such condition shall have been satisfied or waived and
(ii) extend the Offer for the minimum period required by any
rule, regulation, interpretation or position of the SEC or the staff thereof
applicable to the Offer; provided, however, that Sub shall not be required to
extend the Offer beyond the Termination Date. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if, at any then-scheduled
expiration of the Offer, each Offer Condition (other than the Minimum Tender
Condition) shall have been satisfied or waived and the Minimum Tender
Condition shall not have been satisfied, then Sub may and, if requested by
the Company, Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Sub to, extend the Offer by
increments of five (5) Business Days; _provided_ , that the maximum number of
days that the Offer may be extended pursuant to this sentence shall be twenty
(20) Business Days unless requested or approved by the Company; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that Sub shall not be required to extend the Offer beyond the
Termination Date. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the
Offer and this Agreement, Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Sub to, (x)
immediately following any then-scheduled expiration of the Offer (if each
Offer Condition shall have been satisfied or, if permitted by this Agreement,
waived at such time) accept for payment all shares of Company Common Stock
that Sub becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer and (y) following
such acceptance, and as soon as practicable on the Business Day that
immediately follows the date on which the Offer expired, pay for all such
shares. The time at which such acceptance occurs is referred to in this
Agreement as the " _Acceptance Time_." The time at which sufficient funds for
the payment of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to and subject to the
conditions of the Offer and this Agreement are deposited with the Paying Agent
is referred to in this Agreement as the " _Offer Closing_ " and the date on
which the Offer Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the "
_Offer Closing Date_." The Offer may not be terminated prior to its expiration
date (as such expiration date may be extended and re-extended in accordance
with this _Section 1.01(a)),_ unless this Agreement is validly terminated in
accordance with _Section 7.01_. If (i) at any then-scheduled expiration of
the Offer, (x) each Offer Condition (other than the Minimum Tender Condition)
shall have been satisfied or waived, (y) the Minimum Tender Condition shall
not have been satisfied and (z) no further extensions or re-extensions of the
Offer are permitted or required pursuant to this _Section 1.01(a)_ or (ii)
this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 7.01_, then, in each case,
Sub shall promptly (and, in any event, within twenty-four (24) hours of such
termination), irrevocably and unconditionally terminate the Offer. The
termination of the Offer pursuant to clause (i) of the immediately preceding
sentence is referred to in this Agreement as the " _Offer Termination_ ," and
the date on which the Offer Termination occurs is referred to in this
Agreement as the " _Offer Termination Date_." If the Offer is terminated or
withdrawn by Sub, or this Agreement is terminated in accordance with _Section
7.01_, Sub shall promptly return, and shall cause any

the SEC, in accordance with Rule 14d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act, a
Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with respect to the Offer (together with
all amendments and supplements thereto, the " _Schedule TO_ "), which shall
include, as exhibits, an offer to purchase and a related letter of
transmittal, a summary advertisement and other ancillary Offer documents
pursuant to which the Offer will be made (such Schedule TO and the documents
attached as exhibits thereto, together with any amendments or supplements
thereto, the " _Offer Documents_ "). The Company shall promptly furnish to
Parent and Sub all information concerning the Company that is required by the
Exchange Act to be set forth in the Offer Documents. Each of Parent, Sub and
the Company shall promptly correct any information provided by it for use in
the Offer Documents if and to the extent that such information shall have
become false or misleading in any material respect, and each of Parent and Sub
shall take all steps necessary to amend or supplement the Offer Documents and
to cause the Offer Documents, as so amended or supplemented, to be filed with
the SEC and disseminated to the Companys stockholders, in each case as and to
the extent required by applicable federal securities Laws. Parent and Sub
shall promptly notify the Company upon the receipt of any comments from the
SEC (or the staff of the SEC) or any request from the SEC (or the staff of the
SEC) for amendments or supplements to the Offer Documents, and shall provide
the Company with copies of all correspondence between Parent, Sub and their
respective representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC (or the staff of the
SEC), on the other hand. Parent and Sub shall use their respective
reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as reasonably practicable to
any comments of the SEC (or the staff of the SEC) with respect to the Offer
Documents. Prior to the filing of the Offer Documents (or any amendment or
supplement thereto) or the dissemination thereof to the stockholders of the
Company, or responding to any comments of the SEC (or the staff of the SEC)
with respect thereto, Parent and Sub shall provide the Company a reasonable
opportunity to review and to propose comments on such document or response.

(c) Parent shall provide, or cause to be provided to Sub, on a timely basis,
all of the funds necessary to purchase any shares of Company Common Stock
that Sub becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer; _provided_ that
in no way shall this _Section 1.01(c)_ in any way reduce, offset or limit the
obligations of the Company pursuant to _Section 2.02(a)_.

Section 1.02 _Company Actions_.

 

(a) On the date the initial Offer Documents are filed with the SEC or as soon
as practicable thereafter, the Company shall, in a manner that complies with
Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act, file with the SEC a Tender
Offer Solicitation/ Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 with respect to
the Offer (together with all amendments, supplements and exhibits thereto,
the " _Schedule 14D-9_ "), which shall, subject to the provisions of _Section
5.03_, reflect the terms and conditions of this Agreement, describe and make
the Company Recommendation with respect to the Offer, include a copy of
the fairness opinion referred to in _Section 3.20_ and include the notice of

 Common Stock required by Section 262 of the DGCL, and shall take all steps
reasonably necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9 to be disseminated to the
holders of Company Common Stock. The Company and Parent shall cooperate to

of Company Common Stock together with the Offer Documents disseminated to the
holders of Company Common Stock. Parent and Sub shall promptly furnish to the
Company all information concerning Parent and Sub that is required by the
Exchange Act to be set forth in the Schedule 14D-9. Each of the Company,
Parent and Sub shall promptly correct any information provided by it for
use in the Schedule 14D-9, if and to the extent that such information shall
have become false or misleading in any material respect, and the Company shall
take all steps necessary to amend or supplement the Schedule 14D-9 and to
cause the Schedule 14D-9, as so amended or supplemented, to be filed with the
SEC and disseminated to the holders of Company Common Stock, in each case as
and to the extent required by applicable federal securities Laws. The Company
shall promptly notify Parent upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC
(or the staff of the SEC) or any request from the SEC (or the staff of the
SEC) for amendments or supplements to the Schedule 14D-9, and shall provide
Parent with copies of all correspondence between the Company and the Company
Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC (or the staff of the SEC), on
the other hand. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to respond
as promptly as reasonably practicable to any comments of the SEC (or
the staff of the SEC) with respect to the Schedule 14D-9. Prior to the filing
of the Schedule 14D-9 (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or the
dissemination thereof to the stockholders of the Company, or responding to any
comments of the SEC (or the staff of the SEC) with respect thereto, the
Company shall provide Parent a reasonable opportunity to review and to propose
comments on such document or response. The Company hereby consents to the
inclusion in the Offer Documents of the recommendation of the board of
directors of the Company contained in the Schedule 14D-9.

(b) In connection with the Offer and the Merger, the Company shall cause its
transfer agent to furnish Sub promptly (and in any event within five (5)
Business Days after the date of execution of this Agreement by all parties
hereto) with mailing labels containing the names and addresses of the record
holders of Company Common Stock as of the most recent practicable date,
together, to the extent available, with copies of lists of stockholders,
security position listings and computer files in the Companys possession or
control regarding the beneficial owners of Company Common Stock, and shall
furnish to Sub such information (including updated lists of record holders and
stockholders, security position listings and computer files) as Parent may
reasonably request in communicating the Offer to the Companys stockholders.
Subject to the requirements of applicable Law, and except for such steps as
are necessary to disseminate the Offer Documents and any other documents
necessary to consummate the Transactions, Parent and Sub shall keep
confidential and not disclose such information, including the information
contained in any such labels, lists, listings and files, in each case as
required by the Confidentiality Agreement, shall use such information only in
connection with the Offer and the Merger and, if this Agreement shall be
terminated, shall, upon request, deliver to the Company or destroy all copies
of such information then in their possession or control in accordance with
the Confidentiality Agreement. In addition, in connection with the Offer, the
Company shall cooperate with Parent and Sub to disseminate the Offer Documents

ARTICLE II

EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK

Section 2.01 _Conversion of Securities_.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of Parent, Sub, the Company or the holders of any capital stock of
the Company or Sub:

(i) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Each share of Company Common Stock,
including Restricted Stock (each, a " _Share_ " and collectively, the "
_Shares_ "), issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time,
other than Shares to be cancelled in accordance with _Section 2.01(a)(ii)_
and other than Dissenting Shares, shall automatically be converted into the
right to receive the Offer Price in cash, without interest (the " _Merger
Consideration_ "), and all of such Shares shall cease to be outstanding, shall
be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each certificate representing a
Share (a " _Certificate_ ") or non-certificated Share represented by book-
entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") that formerly represented any of the Shares
(other than Shares to be cancelled in accordance with _Section 2.01(a)(ii)_
and other than Dissenting Shares) shall thereafter cease to have any rights
with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration
without interest thereon, subject to _Section 2.05_.

(ii) _Cancellation of Company-Owned Shares and Parent-Owned Shares_. All
Shares that are held in the treasury of the Company or owned of record by any
wholly owned Company Subsidiary and all Shares owned of record by Parent or
any of its wholly owned Subsidiaries shall be cancelled and shall cease to
exist, with no payment being made with respect thereto.

 



7 ##### Table of Contents

  

(iii) _Capital Stock of Sub_. Each issued and outstanding share of capital
stock of Sub shall be automatically converted into and become one validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01
per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

 

(b) _Merger Consideration Adjustment_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, if, from the date of this Agreement until the
Effective Time, the number of outstanding shares of Company Common Stock shall
have been changed into a different number of shares or a different class by
reason of any reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock
split), recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares,
readjustment or other similar transaction, or a stock dividend or stock
distribution thereon shall be declared with a record date within said period,
the Offer Price and Merger Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted to
provide the holders of Shares the same economic effect as contemplated by this
Agreement prior to such event.

 

Section 2.02 _Exchange of Certificates; Payment for Shares_.

 

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Acceptance Time, Parent shall designate
Computershare Investor Services or another U.S.-based nationally recognized
financial institution reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as agent
(the " _Paying Agent_ ") for the holders of Shares to receive the funds to
which such holders shall become entitled pursuant to this Agreement. Without
limiting the generality of _Section 1.01(c)_ or _Section 5.02(b)_, as soon
as practicable on the Business Day that immediately follows the date on which
the Offer expires and following the Acceptance Time, (i) first Parent shall
deposit with the Paying Agent, in immediately available funds, the Parent
Payment and (ii) immediately following the deposit of the Parent Payment, the
Company shall deposit with the Paying Agent, in immediately available
funds, the Company Contribution (it being agreed that the Company shall have
no obligation to deposit the Company Contribution earlier than immediately
prior to the Effective Time). All funds deposited with the Paying Agent by
Parent and the Company (the " _Exchange Fund_ ") shall be for the benefit of
the holders of Shares that Sub becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to the
Offer and for the benefit of the holders of Shares that are entitled to
receive the Merger Consideration. For purposes of determining the aggregate
amount to be so deposited, Parent shall assume that no stockholder of the
Company shall perfect any right to appraisal of his, her or its Shares. In the
event the Exchange Fund shall be insufficient to make the payments
contemplated by _Section 1.01(a)_ and this _Article II_ , Parent shall
promptly deposit, or cause to be deposited, additional funds with the Paying
Agent in an amount sufficient to make such payments. Funds made available
to the Paying Agent shall be invested by the Paying Agent, as directed by
Parent, in short-term obligations of, or short-term obligations fully
guaranteed as to principal and interest by, the United States of America with
maturities of no more than thirty (30) days or in commercial paper
obligations rated A-1 or P1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or
Standard and Poors Corporation, pending payment thereof by the Paying Agent to
the holders of Shares pursuant to _Section 1.01(a)_ or this _Article II_ ;
_provided_ , that no investment of such deposited funds shall relieve Parent,
the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent from promptly making the
payments required by  _Section 1.01(a)_ or this _Article II_ , and following
any losses from any such investment, Parent shall promptly provide additional
funds to the Paying Agent, for the benefit of the holders 

 



8 ##### Table of Contents

  

 of Shares, in the amount of such losses, which additional funds will be held
and disbursed in the same manner as funds initially deposited with the Paying
Agent to make the payments contemplated by _Section 1.01(a)_ and this
_Article II_. Any interest or income produced by such investments will be
payable to Sub or Parent, as Parent directs. Parent shall direct the Paying
Agent to hold the Exchange Fund for the benefit of the former holders of
Shares and to make payments from the Exchange Fund in accordance with _Section
1.01(a)_ and _Section 2.02(b)_. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any
purpose other than to fund payments pursuant to  _Section 1.01(a)_ or
_Section 2.02(b)_, except as expressly provided for in this Agreement.

(b) _Procedures for Surrender_. As promptly as practicable after the
Effective Time and in any event not later than the second Business Day
thereafter, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of
record of a Certificate or Book-Entry Shares, in each case whose Shares were
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration at the Effective
Time pursuant to this Agreement: (i) a letter of transmittal, which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits
of loss in lieu thereof in accordance with _Section 2.02(e)_) to the Paying
Agent, and shall otherwise be in such form and have such other provisions as
Parent may reasonably specify after consultation with the Company; and (ii)
instructions for effecting the surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares in exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender
of Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof in accordance with
_Section 2.02(e)_) for cancellation to the Paying Agent, and upon delivery of
a letter of transmittal, duly executed and in proper form, with respect to
such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, the holder of such Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the
portion of the Aggregate Common Stock Consideration into which the Shares
formerly represented by such Certificates or such Book-Entry Shares were
converted pursuant to _Section 2.01(a)(i)_ (less any required Tax
withholdings as provided in _Section 2.05_), and the Certificates so
surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of Company Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer
records of the Company, payment may be made and Merger Consideration may be
issued to a person other than the person in whose name the Certificate
so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed
or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer, and the person requesting
such payment shall pay to the Paying Agent any transfer and other similar
Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a
person other than the registered holder of the Certificate so surrendered or
shall establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the Paying Agent that such
Taxes either have been paid or are not required to be paid. Payment of the
Merger Consideration with respect to Book-Entry Shares shall only be made to
the person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares are registered. No interest
shall be paid or accrue on any portion of the Merger Consideration payable
upon surrender of any Certificate or Book-Entry Share (or affidavits of loss
in lieu thereof in accordance with _Section 2.02(e)_).

 

(c) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Shares_. As of the
Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and
thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares on
the records of the Company. The Merger Consideration paid in accordance with
the terms of this _Article II_ upon surrender of any Shares shall be deemed
to 

 



9 ##### Table of Contents

  

 have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Shares.
From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Shares outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with
respect to such Shares except as otherwise provided for herein or by
applicable Law. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to
the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be cancelled
and exchanged as provided in this Agreement.

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund; Abandoned Property; No Liability_. At any
time following the first anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any
portion of the Exchange Fund (including any interest received with respect
thereto) not disbursed to holders of Shares, and thereafter such holders
shall be entitled to look only to the Surviving Corporation (subject to
abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) as general creditors
thereof with respect to the Merger Consideration payable upon due surrender
of their Shares and compliance with the procedures set forth in _Section
2.02(b)_, without interest. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder of
a Share for Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to
any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

(e)  _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit (in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to the Paying Agent) of that fact by the
person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying
Agent or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, shall issue in exchange for
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates the portion of the Aggregate
Common Stock Consideration into which the Shares formerly represented by such
Certificate were converted pursuant to _Section 2.01(a)(i)_; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Paying Agent may, in its reasonable discretion and as a
condition precedent to the payment of such Merger Consideration, require the
owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate to provide a bond in a
customary amount.

 

Section 2.03 _Treatment of Company Options and SARs, Restricted Stock, RSUs,
Performance Awards and Equity Plans_.

 

(a) _Treatment of Company Options and SARs_. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Companys board of directors (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof)
shall adopt appropriate resolutions to provide that, immediately prior to the
Effective Time, each outstanding option to purchase Shares granted under a
Company Stock Plan (the " _Company Options_ ") and each stock appreciation
right granted under a Company Stock Plan (the " _SARs_ ") shall be fully
vested and cancelled and, in exchange therefor, each holder of any such
cancelled Company Option or SAR shall be entitled to receive, in
consideration of the cancellation of such Company Option or SAR and in
settlement therefor, a payment in cash of an amount equal to the product of
(i) the total number of Shares subject to such cancelled Company Option or SAR
and (ii) the excess, if any, of (A) the Merger Consideration over (B) the
exercise price per Share subject to such cancelled Company Option or SAR,
without interest (such amounts payable hereunder, the " _Option/SAR Payments_
"); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that (i) any such Company Option or SAR with
respect to which the exercise price per Share subject thereto is equal to or
greater than the Merger Consideration shall be cancelled in exchange for no
consideration and (ii) such Option/SAR Payments may be

 



10 ##### Table of Contents

  

 reduced by the amount of any required Tax withholdings as provided in
_Section 2.05_. From and after the Effective Time, no Company Option or SAR
shall be exercisable, and each Company Option and SAR shall only entitle the
holder thereof to the payment provided for in this _Section 2.03(a)_.

(b) _Treatment of Restricted Stock_. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Companys board of directors (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof) shall
adopt appropriate resolutions to provide that, immediately prior to the

restrictions or other restrictions (" _Restricted Stock_ ") granted pursuant
to a Company Stock Plan shall vest in full and all restrictions (including
forfeiture restrictions) otherwise applicable to such vested Shares shall
lapse.

(c) _Treatment of Restricted Stock Units_. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Companys board of directors (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof)
shall adopt appropriate resolutions to provide that, immediately prior to the
Effective Time, each outstanding award of restricted stock units (" _RSUs_ ")
with respect to Shares (each, an " _RSU Award_ ") granted pursuant to a
Company Stock Plan shall be fully vested and cancelled and, in exchange
therefor, each holder of any such cancelled RSU Award shall be entitled to
receive, in consideration of the cancellation of such RSU Award and in
settlement therefor, a payment in cash of an amount equal to the product of
(i) the Merger Consideration multiplied by (ii) the number of restricted stock
units subject to such RSU Award, without interest (such amounts payable
hereunder, the " _RSU Payments_ ") (less any required Tax withholdings as
provided in _Section 2.05_).

 

(d) _Treatment of Performance Units and Performance Shares_. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Companys board of directors (or, if appropriate, any
committee thereof) shall adopt appropriate resolutions to provide that
immediately prior to the Effective Time, each outstanding award of performance
units and performance shares with respect to Shares (each, a "
_Performance Award_ ") granted pursuant to a Company Stock Plan shall be
fully vested and paid out. For purposes of determining the number of Shares
earned pursuant to any pending performance period under such Performance
Award, the applicable performance goals shall be deemed to have been
satisfied at the greatest of (i) 100% of the target level of performance, (ii)
the actual measured level of performance determined as of the Effective Time
and (iii) the level of performance that is deemed to have been satisfied
under the terms of the applicable Performance Award agreement. Each
Performance Award shall be cancelled as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time and, in exchange therefor, the holder of such cancelled
Performance Award shall be entitled to receive, in consideration of the
cancellation of such Performance Award and in settlement therefor, an amount
in cash equal to the product of (a) the Merger Consideration and (b) the
number of Shares earned or deemed to have been earned in accordance with this
_Section 2.03(d)_, without interest (such amounts payable hereunder, the "
_Performance Award Payments_ ") (less any required Tax withholdings as
provided in  _Section 2.05_).

(e) _Termination of Company Stock Plans_. As of the Effective Time, all
Company Stock Plans shall terminate, and, as of the date hereof, no further
Company Options, SARs, Restricted Stock, RSUs, Performance Awards or other
rights with respect to Shares shall be granted thereunder except for those
Company Options, SARs, Restricted Stock, RSUs, 

 



11 ##### Table of Contents

"), through the Payroll Agent to the holders of Company Options, SARs, RSUs
and Performance Awards, in each case, subject to _Section 2.05_.

Section 2.04 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, any issued and outstanding Shares held by a person (a "
_Dissenting Stockholder_ ") who is entitled to appraisal rights under Section
262 of the DGCL and has complied with all the provisions of the
DGCL concerning the right of holders of Shares to require appraisal of such
Shares (" _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration as described in _Section 2.01(a)(i)_, but
shall become the right to receive the fair value of such Shares pursuant to
the procedures set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL. If such Dissenting
Stockholder withdraws its demand for appraisal or fails to perfect or
otherwise loses its right of appraisal with respect to such Shares, in any
case pursuant to the DGCL, such Shares shall be deemed to be converted as of
the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration for each
such Share, without interest and subject to  _Section 2.05_. The Company
shall give Parent prompt notice of any demands for appraisal of Shares
received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments
served on the Company pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL. The Company shall

and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger
Consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement in respect of the
Shares, Company Options, SARs, RSU Awards and Performance Awards vested or
cancelled in the Merger, such amounts as it is required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment, or the vesting, waiver of
restrictions or other actions provided for in this Agreement, under the Code
or any other applicable state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld by the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying
Agent, as the case may be, such withheld amounts (a) shall be remitted by the
Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent, as applicable, to the
applicable Governmental Entity, and (b) shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Shares, Company Options,
SARs, Restricted Stock, RSU Awards or Performance Awards in respect of which
such deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation, Parent
or the Paying Agent, as the case may be.

result in any portion of the Financing contemplated thereby to be unavailable
at the Closing or the Offer Closing. Assuming the accuracy of the
representations and warranties set forth in _Section 3.02(a)_ and _Section
3.02(b)_, the performance in all material respects by the Company of its
obligations under this Agreement and satisfaction of the conditions set forth
in _Article VI_ and _Annex II_ , neither Parent nor Sub has reason to believe
that it, either of the Guarantors or any Debt Financing Source would be unable
to satisfy on a timely basis any term or condition of the
Financing Commitments required to be satisfied by such person. Parent or Sub
have fully paid any and all commitment fees or other fees required by the
Financing Commitments to be paid on or before the date of this Agreement.
There are no conditions precedent or other contingencies related to the
funding of the full amount of the Financing, other than as expressly set forth
in the Financing Commitments.

 

(d) Neither Parent nor Sub has, directly or indirectly, entered into an
exclusivity, lock-up or other similar agreement, arrangement or
binding understanding with any bank or investment bank or other potential

obligation of each Guarantor, enforceable against each Guarantor in accordance
with its terms, subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception. No event has
occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, could
constitute a default or breach on the part of either Guarantor under such
Guaranty.

Company to such person without first entering into an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement with such person; (y) will promptly advise Parent of
the receipt of any Competing Proposal that constitutes or could reasonably be

Subsidiaries to enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding,

fail to consummate the Transactions.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
at any time prior to the Acceptance Time, the Companys board of directors
may make a Change of Company Recommendation if:

(i) (A) a Competing Proposal (that did not result from a material breach of
_Section 5.03_) is made to the Company by a third person and such Competing
Proposal is not withdrawn and (B) the Companys board of directors determines
in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside
legal counsel, that such Competing Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal;

 

(ii) the Company provides Parent prior written notice of the Companys
intention to make a Change of Company Recommendation (a " _Notice of Change
of Recommendation_ "), which notice shall identify the person making such
Superior Proposal and

 



44 ##### Table of Contents

  

 include the Competing Proposal Information with respect to such Superior
Proposal (it being agreed that neither the delivery of the Notice of Change of
Recommendation by the Company nor the public announcement that the Companys
board of directors is considering making a Change of Company Recommendation
under applicable Law shall constitute a Change of Company Recommendation);

 

(iii) the Company has negotiated, and has caused any applicable Company
Representatives to negotiate, in good faith with Parent with respect to any
changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent for at least three
(3) days following receipt by Parent of such Notice of Change of
Recommendation to assist Parent in proposing in writing a binding offer to
effect revisions to the terms of this Agreement, the Sponsor Commitment
Agreement and the Guaranty such that it would cause any such Superior Proposal
to no longer constitute a Superior Proposal; and

 

(iv) taking into account any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed
by Parent to the Company pursuant to _clause (iii)_ above, the Companys
board of directors has determined in good faith, after consultation with its
outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such Competing
Proposal would continue to constitute a Superior Proposal if such changes
offered in writing by Parent were to be given effect; _provided_ , that any
material amendment to the terms of such Superior Proposal (whether or not in
response to any changes proposed by Parent pursuant to _clause (iii)_ above)
shall require a new Notice of Change of Recommendation and an additional two
(2)-day period from the date of such notice during which the terms of _clause
(iii)_ above and this _clause (iv)_ shall apply  _mutatis mutandis_.

(e) Other than in connection with a Superior Proposal (which shall be subject
to _Section 5.03(d)_ and shall not be subject to this _Section 5.03(e)_),
nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit or restrict the Companys board of
directors from withholding, modifying or amending, in a manner adverse to
Parent, the Company Recommendation if the Companys board of directors
determines in good faith, after consultation with the Companys outside legal
counsel, that the failure of the Companys board of directors to effect a
Change of Company Recommendation would reasonably be likely to be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ ,
that, to the extent practicable:

 

(i) the Company shall give Parent advance notice of its intention to take such
action (it being agreed that neither the delivery of such notice by the
Company nor any public announcement that the Companys board of directors is
considering making a Change of Company Recommendation under applicable Law
shall constitute a Change of Company Recommendation); and

 

(ii) the Company shall give Parent at least three (3) days following receipt
by Parent of such notice to propose revisions to the terms of this Agreement
(or make another proposal) and shall negotiate in good faith with Parent with
respect to such proposed revisions or other proposal, if any, during such
three (3)-day period.

board of directors from (i) disclosing to the stockholders of the Company a
position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of
Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) making any
disclosure to the stockholders of the Company if the Companys board of
directors determines in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel,
that the failure to make such disclosure would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company (for the avoidance of
doubt, it being agreed that the issuance by the Company or the Companys board
of directors of a "stop, look and listen" statement pending disclosure of its
position, as contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the
Exchange Act, shall not constitute a Change of Company Recommendation).

Section 5.04  _Access to Information_. From the date of this Agreement to the
Effective Time, the Company shall, and shall cause each Company Subsidiary to:
(a) provide to Parent and Sub and their respective representatives reasonable
access during normal business hours, upon prior written notice to the
Company, to the officers, employees, properties, offices and other facilities
of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and to the books and records
thereof; (b) furnish promptly such information concerning the business,
properties, Contracts, assets and liabilities of the Company and Company
Subsidiaries as Parent or its representatives may reasonably request and (c)
within a reasonable time following the request thereof by Parent, use
reasonable best efforts to arrange such meetings and telephone conferences
with such customers and suppliers of the Company and any Company Subsidiary as
may be reasonably requested by Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the Company shall not be required to (or to cause any Company Subsidiary to)
afford such access or furnish such information or provide such assistance to
the extent that the Company believes in good faith that doing so would: (i)
result in the loss of attorney-client privilege ( _provided_ that the Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts to allow for such access or disclosure
in a manner that does not result in a loss of attorney-client privilege) or
(ii) breach, contravene or violate any applicable Law (including the HSR Act
or any other Antitrust Law) and _provided_ , _further_ , that at the Companys
sole discretion, the Company shall have the right to participate in any
meeting or teleconference with any customer or supplier arranged pursuant to
this _Section 5.04_. During any visit to the business or property sites of
the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, each of Parent and Sub shall,
and shall cause their respective representatives accessing such properties
to, comply with all applicable Laws and all of the Companys and the Company
Subsidiaries safety and security procedures. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this  _Section 5.04_, from the date of this Agreement
to the Effective Time, Parent, Sub or any of their respective affiliates shall
have the right to conduct a Phase I environmental site assessment at any Owned
Real Property or, subject to the receipt of any required consent of the
landlord or other relevant party, any Leased Real Property, but in no event
may any environmental investigation include any sampling or other intrusive
investigation of air, surface water, groundwater, soil or anything else at or
in connection with any of such real property without the prior written consent
of the Company. Prior to the termination of this Agreement, the terms of this
_Section 5.04_ shall be deemed to constitute express permission of the

or Sub to speak with customers or suppliers of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary about their relationship with the Surviving Corporation following
the Effective Time consistent with this _Section 5.04_. Parent

Section 5.09 _Directors and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_.

 

(a) _Indemnification_. From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law, indemnify, defend and hold harmless each current or former
director, officer or employee of the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries, each fiduciary under benefit plans of the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries and each such person who performed services at the
request of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries (each an "
_Indemnified Party_ " and collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ")
against (i) all losses, expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and
expenses), judgments, fines, claims, damages or liabilities or, subject to the
proviso of the next succeeding sentence, amounts paid in settlement, arising
out of actions or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (and
whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time) to the
extent that they are based on or arise out of the fact that such person is or
was a director, officer, employee or fiduciary under benefit plans or
performed services at the request of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(the " _Indemnified Liabilities_ "), and (ii) all Indemnified Liabilities to
the extent they are based on or arise out of or pertain to the Transactions,
whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, and
including any expenses incurred in enforcing such persons rights under this
_Section 5.09_. In the event of any such loss, expense, claim, damage or
liability (whether or not asserted before the Effective Time), the Surviving
Corporation shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel selected by
the Indemnified Parties promptly after statements therefor are received and
otherwise advance to such Indemnified Party upon request, reimbursement of
documented expenses reasonably incurred ( _provided_ that the person to whom
expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advance if it is
determined by a final and non-appealable judgment of a court of competent
jurisdiction that such person is not legally entitled to indemnification under
Law).

 

(b) _Insurance_. The Company shall be permitted to, prior to the Effective
Time, and if the Company fails to do so, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, obtain and fully pay the premium for an insurance and
indemnification policy that provides coverage for a period of six (6) years
from and after the Effective Time for events occurring prior to the Effective
Time (the " _D andO Insurance_") that is substantially equivalent to and in any
event not less favorable in the aggregate to the intended beneficiaries
thereof than the Companys existing directors and officers
liability insurance policy. If the Company and the Surviving Corporation for
any reason fail to obtain such "tail" insurance policy as of the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, continue to maintain in effect for a period of at least six
(6) years from and after the Effective Time (and for so long thereafter as any
claims brought before the end of such six-year period thereunder are being
adjudicated) the DandO Insurance in place as of the date hereof with terms,
conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are at least as favorable
as provided in the Companys existing policies as of the date hereof, or the
Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to, purchase comparable DandO Insurance for such six-year period (and for so
long thereafter as any claims brought before the end of such six-year period
thereunder are being adjudicated) with terms, conditions, retentions and
limits of liability that are at least as favorable as provided in the
Companys existing policies as of the date hereof.

(c) _Successors_. In the event the Surviving Corporation, Parent or any of
their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into
any other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any person, then and in either such case,
proper provisions shall be made so that the successors, assigns or transferees
of the Surviving Corporation or Parent shall assume the obligations set forth
in this _Section 5.09_.

 

(d) _Continuation_. For not less than six (6) years from and after the
Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving
Corporation and the certificate of incorporation and by-laws (or other similar
documents) of each Company Subsidiary shall contain provisions no less
favorable with respect to exculpation, indemnification and advancement of
expenses for periods at or prior to the Effective Time than are currently set
forth in the Company Charter, the Company By-Laws or the equivalent
organizational documents of any Company Subsidiary. The contractual
indemnification rights, if any, in existence on the date of this Agreement
with any of the directors, officers or employees of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary shall be assumed by the Surviving Corporation, without any further
action, and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their
terms following the Effective Time.

(e) _Benefit_. The provisions of this _Section 5.09_ are intended to be for
the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, his or
her heirs, executors or administrators and his or her representatives, shall
be binding on all successors and assigns of Parent, the Company and the
Surviving Corporation and shall not be amended in a manner that is adverse to
any Indemnified Parties (including their successors, assigns and heirs)
without the consent of the Indemnified Party (including the successors,
assigns and heirs) affected thereby. 

(f) _Non-Exclusivity_. The provisions of this _Section 5.09_ are in addition
to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or
contribution that any such person may have by contract or otherwise. Nothing
in this Agreement, including this _Section 5.09_, is intended to, shall be
construed to or shall release, waive or impair any rights to directors and
officers insurance claims under any policy that is or has been in existence
with respect to the Company, any of the Company Subsidiaries or the
Indemnified Parties, it being understood and agreed that the
indemnification provided for in this _Section 5.09_ is not prior to, or in
substitution for, any such claims under any such policies.

 

Section 5.10 _Takeover Statutes_. The parties shall use all reasonable efforts
(a) to take all action necessary so that no Takeover Statute is or becomes
applicable to restrict or prohibit any of the Transactions, and (b) if any
Takeover Statute is or becomes applicable to restrict or prohibit any of the
Transactions, to take all action necessary so that such Transaction may be
consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this
Agreement and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize (to the greatest extent
practicable) the effects of such Takeover Statute on such Transaction.

arrangement maintained by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, including

severance plans, each Company Employees service with or otherwise credited by
the Company or any Company Subsidiary shall be treated as service with Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation to the same
extent credited under comparable Company Benefit Plans; _provided_ , _however_
, that such service need not be recognized to the extent that such recognition
would result in any duplication of benefits or would not have been recognized
under the comparable Company Benefit Plan immediately prior to the Effective
Time.

 

(d) Parent shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries, including the Surviving
Corporation, to waive, or cause to be waived, any pre-existing condition
limitations, exclusions, actively at work requirements and waiting periods

 eligible dependents) will be eligible to participate from and after the
Effective Time, except to the extent that such pre-existing condition
limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and waiting periods
would not have been satisfied or waived under the comparable Company Benefit
Plan immediately prior to the Effective Time. Parent shall, or shall cause its
Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation, to recognize, or cause to
be recognized, the dollar amount of all co-payments, deductibles and similar
expenses incurred by each Company Employee (and his or her eligible
dependents) during the calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs
for purposes of satisfying such years deductible and co-payment limitations
under the relevant welfare benefit plans in which such Company Employee (and
dependents) will be eligible to participate from and after the Effective Time.

 

(e) The Company shall take all necessary actions such that no Shares may be
purchased under the Company Stock Purchase Plan on or after the date of this

treated as an amendment of any Company Benefit Plan, (ii) give any employee
or former employee or any other individual associated therewith or any
employee benefit plan or trustee thereof or any other third person any right

Company shall consult with Parent and keep Parent reasonably informed with
respect to any material developments regarding, the defense of any Proceeding
brought by stockholders of the Company against the Company or its directors or

, that the Company shall not settle any such Proceeding (a) without the prior
written consent of Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed) or

obligations that relate to the operation of the business of the Company or
the Company Subsidiaries following the Closing.

Section 5.15 _Cash Statement_. No later than three (3) Business Days prior to

court or from any legal process commenced in such courts (whether through
service of notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of
execution of judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise) and (iii) that (A)
the Proceeding in any such court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (B) the

the event that this Agreement has been terminated or in the event that the
remedies provided for in this _Section 8.10_ are not available or otherwise

(a) Each person who has been or is made a party or is threatened to be made a
party to or is involved in any action, suit or proceeding, ##### Table of Contents

  

 whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (hereinafter a "
_proceeding_ "), by reason of the fact that he or she, or a person of whom he
or she is the legal representative, is or was a director or officer of the
Corporation or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a
director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation or of a
partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including, without
limitation, service with respect to employee benefit plans (hereinafter an "
_Indemnitee_ "), whether the basis of such proceeding is an alleged action in
an official capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent or in any
other capacity while serving as a director, officer, employee or agent, shall
be indemnified and held harmless by the Corporation to the fullest extent
authorized by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, or any
other applicable law, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended (but, in
the case of any such amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits
the Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than said law
permitted the Corporation to provide prior to such amendment), against all
expenses, liability and loss (including, without limitation, attorneys fees,
judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes or penalties and amounts paid or to be
paid in settlement) reasonably incurred or suffered by such Indemnitee in
connection therewith and such indemnification shall continue as to an
Indemnitee who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and
shall inure to the benefit of his or her heirs, executors and administrators;
_provided_ , _however_ , that except as provided in paragraph (b) of this
Article FIFTH, Section 2 with respect to proceedings seeking to enforce rights
to indemnification, the Corporation shall indemnify any such Indemnitee
seeking indemnification in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof)
initiated by such person only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was
authorized by the Board of Directors of the Corporation. The right to
indemnification conferred in this Article FIFTH, Section 2 shall be a
contract right. In addition to the right of indemnification, an Indemnitee
shall have the right to be paid by the Corporation the expenses incurred in
defending any such proceeding in advance of its final disposition; _provided_
, _however_ , that if the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, or
any other applicable law, requires, the payment of such expenses incurred by
an Indemnitee in his or her capacity as a director or officer (and not in any
other capacity in which service was or is rendered by such person while a
director or officer, including, without limitation, service to an employee
benefit plan) in advance of the final disposition of a proceeding shall be
made only upon delivery to the Corporation of an undertaking by or on behalf
of such Indemnitee to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be
determined that such director or officer is not entitled to be
indemnified under this Article FIFTH, Section 2 or otherwise.

(b) If a claim under paragraph (a) of this Article FIFTH, Section 2 is not
paid in full by the Corporation within thirty (30) days after a written claim
has been received by the Corporation, the claimant may at any time thereafter
bring suit against the Corporation to recover the unpaid amount  ##### Table of Contents

  

 of the claim and, if successful in whole or in part, the claimant shall be
entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting such claim. It shall be a
defense to any such action (other than an action brought to enforce a claim
for expenses incurred in defending any proceeding in advance of its final
disposition where the required undertaking, if any is required, has been
tendered to the Corporation) that the claimant has not met the standard of
conduct which makes it permissible under the General Corporation Law of the
State of Delaware, or any other applicable law, for the Corporation to
indemnify the claimant for the amount claimed, but the burden of proving such
defense shall be on the Corporation. Neither the failure of the Corporation
(including, without limitation, its Board of Directors, stockholders or
independent legal counsel) to have made a determination prior to the
commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant is proper in
the circumstances because he or she has met the applicable standard of conduct
set forth in the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, or any
other applicable law, nor an actual determination by the Corporation
(including, without limitation, its Board of Directors, stockholders or
independent legal counsel) that the claimant has not met such applicable
standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption
that the claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct.

(c) The right to indemnification and the payment of expenses incurred in
defending a proceeding in advance of its final disposition conferred in
paragraph (b) of this Article FIFTH, Section 2 shall not be exclusive of any
other right which any person may have or hereafter acquire under any
statute, provision of this Certificate of Incorporation, ByLaws, agreement,
vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise.

 

(d) The Corporation may maintain insurance, at its expense, to protect itself
and any director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation or another
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any
expense, liability or loss, whether or not the Corporation would have the
power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability or loss under
the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, or any other applicable
law.

(e) The Corporation may, to the extent authorized from time to time by the
Board of Directors, grant rights to indemnification, and rights to be paid by
the Corporation the expenses incurred in defending any proceeding in advance
of its final disposition, to any employee or agent of the Corporation to the
fullest extent of the provisions of this Article FIFTH, Section 2 with respect
to the indemnification and advancement of expenses of directors and officers
of the Corporation.

 

(f) Any repeal or modification of this Article FIFTH, Section 2 shall not
adversely affect any right or protection of a director, officer, ##### Table of Contents

  

 employee or agent of the Corporation existing at the time of such repeal or
modification.
