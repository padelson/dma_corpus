The Closing shall take place at the offices of Latham and Watkins, 650 Town Center Drive, 20th Floor, Costa Mesa, California 92626. At the Closing, the documents, certificates, opinions and instruments referred to in _Article VII_ shall be executed and delivered to the applicable party.

 **Section 2.3  Effective Time.** Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, as soon as reasonably practicable on or after the Closing Date, the Parties shall file with the State Department of Assessments and Taxation of Maryland (the " _Maryland Department_ ") the articles of merger or other appropriate documents (the " _Articles of Merger_ ") in such form as is required by, and executed in accordance with, the relevant provisions of the MGCL and make all other filings, recordings or publications required under the MGCL in connection with the Merger. The Merger shall become effective at 2:00 p.m., Los Angeles time, on the date of the filing of the Articles of Merger with, and acceptance for record of such Articles of Merger by, the Maryland Department in accordance with the MGCL, or at such other time as the Parties shall agree as specified in such filings in accordance with applicable law (the " _Effective Time_ ").

 **Section 2.4  Effects of the Merger.** The Merger shall have the effects set forth in Section 3-114 of the MGCL and this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time of the Merger, all of the property, rights, privileges and powers of the Company and Merger Sub will vest in the Surviving Company, and all of the debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub will become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Company.

**Execution Copy**

12 effect on the date hereof, a copy of which has been provided to the Company,
except that at the Effective Time, Article I thereof shall be amended to read
as follows: "The name of the Corporation is Pan Pacific (CTA), Inc." and (ii)
the bylaws of the Surviving Company shall be amended in their entirety to read
as the bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect on the date hereof, a copy of which

The officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be elected as the initial officers of the Surviving Company, each to hold office in accordance with the charter and bylaws of the Surviving Company.

 **Section 2.7  Conversion of Securities.** At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Merger Sub, the Company or the holder of any of the following securities:

 (a) Subject to _Section 2.9_ , each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (including, without limitation, outstanding restricted Company Common Stock granted under the Company Stock Plan, but excluding any shares to be canceled in accordance with _Section 2.7(b)_ hereof), shall be converted into and represent the right to receive 0.218 fully paid and nonassessable shares (rounded to the nearest hundredth of a share) (as adjusted as set forth in subsection (d), the " _Exchange Ratio_ ") of Parent Common Stock (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). The Merger Consideration shall be payable upon the surrender of the Certificate formerly representing such Company Common Stock, subject to _Section 2.11_. As of the Effective Time, all Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a Certificate representing any Company Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive (i) the Merger Consideration, (ii) any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor upon surrender of such Certificate in accordance with _Section 2.9_ , (iii) any dividends or distributions in accordance with _Section 2.10(e)_ and (iv) any unpaid dividend declared by the Company in respect of Company Common Stock in accordance with  _Section 5.3_ , in each case without interest.

 (b) Each share of Company Common Stock that is (i) owned by any Subsidiary of the Company or (ii) owned by Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent, in each case immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be canceled and retired without any conversion thereof and no payment or distribution of any consideration shall be made with respect thereto.

**Execution Copy**

13 and validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the
Surviving Company.

 (d) The Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted to reflect fully the effect of any stock split, reverse split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock, as applicable), reorganization, recapitalization, consolidation, exchange or other like change with respect to Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock occurring after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time.

 **Section 2.8  Treatment of Company Options and Restricted Stock.**

 (a) Except for the Company Options listed on Section 2.8 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, immediately prior to the Effective Time and subject to the consummation of the Merger, subject to the receipt of any necessary consents, the Company and the Company Board (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof) shall cause the vesting of each then outstanding Company Option to be fully accelerated and shall cause each then outstanding Company Option to not be exercisable following the Effective Time and to be canceled and terminated, and the holder to become entitled to receive an amount of cash, if any, from the Company equal to the product of (x) the amount, if any, by which (1) the product of (a) the average closing price per share of Parent Common Stock on the NYSE for the period of ten trading days immediately preceding the Effective Time, and (b) the Exchange Ratio, exceeds (2) the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option, and (y) the number of shares of Company Common Stock issuable pursuant to the unexercised portion of such Company Option (such amount being hereinafter referred to as the " _Option Consideration_ "). The Option Consideration shall be paid by the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time. The Company shall withhold from the Option Consideration any taxes required to be withheld.

 (b) With respect to Company Options listed on Section 2.8 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, at the Effective Time and subject to the consummation of the Merger, such Company Options shall be assumed by Parent and converted into options to acquire Parent Company Stock (the " _Assumed Options_ ") on the same terms and conditions as were applicable under such Company Options immediately prior to the Effective Time except that (i) the per share exercise price of each Assumed Option shall be equal to the per share exercise price of the Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by the Exchange Ratio (rounded up the nearest two-place decimal), and (ii) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such Assumed Option shall be equal to the number of shares of Company Common Stock issuable pursuant to the unexercised portion of the Company Option multiplied by the Exchange Ratio (rounded down to the nearest whole share).

 (c) Parent shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance a sufficient number of shares of Parent Common Stock for delivery under Company Stock Plans assumed in accordance with this Section 2.8. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time,

**Execution Copy**

14 Parent shall file a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor or
other appropriate forms), with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock
subject to the Assumed Options and shall use its best efforts to maintain the
effectiveness of such registration statement or registration statements (and
maintain the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses
contained therein) for so long as the Assumed Options remain outstanding.

 (d) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, and subject to the consummation of the merger, the Company and Company Board (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof) shall cause the vesting of each share of outstanding restricted Company Common Stock granted under the Company Stock Plan to be fully accelerated and the contractual restrictions thereon to terminate.

 (e) Each of the Parties shall take such steps as may be required to provide that, with respect to each Section 16 Affiliate (as defined below), (i) the transactions contemplated by this section, and (ii) any other dispositions of Company equity securities (including derivative securities) or other acquisitions of Parent equity securities (including derivative securities) in connection with this Agreement, shall be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in that certain No-Action Letter, dated January 12, 1999 (CCH Fed. Sec. L. Rep. ¶ 77.515). For purposes of this Agreement, " _Section 16 Affiliate_ " shall mean each individual who (x) immediately prior to the Effective Time is a director or officer of the Company or (y) at the Effective Time will become a director or officer of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company.

 **Section 2.9  Fractional Interests.** No certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued in connection with the Merger, and such fractional interests will not entitle the owner thereof to any rights of a stockholder of Parent. In lieu of any such fractional interests, each Company Stockholder exchanging Certificates pursuant to _Section 2.7(a)_ who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after taking into account all shares of Company Common Stock then held of record by such stockholder) shall receive cash (without interest) in an amount equal to such fractional amount multiplied by the average of the last reported sales prices of Parent Common Stock, as reported on the NYSE, on each of the ten trading days immediately preceding the date of the Effective Time. 

 **Section 2.10  Surrender of Company Common Stock; Stock Transfer Books.**

 (a) Prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall designate a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as agent for Company Stockholders in connection with the Merger (the " _Exchange Agent_ "). The Exchange Agent shall receive the Merger Consideration to which Company Stockholders shall become entitled pursuant to _Section 2.7(a)_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent will make available to the Exchange Agent sufficient shares of Parent Common Stock and an estimated amount of cash in lieu of fractional shares to make all exchanges pursuant to _Section 2.10(b)_. The Exchange Agent shall cause the shares of Parent 

**Execution Copy**

15 Common Stock, dividends or distributions with respect thereto and cash in lieu
of fractional shares deposited by Parent to be (i) held for the benefit of
Company Stockholders and (ii) promptly applied to making the exchanges and
payments provided for in _Section 2.10(b)_. Such shares of Parent Common
Stock, dividends or distributions with respect thereto and cash in lieu of
fractional shares shall not be used for any purpose that is not provided for
herein.

 (b) Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Exchange Agent to, mail to each Company Stockholder whose shares were converted pursuant to _Section 2.7(a)_ into the right to receive Parent Common Stock (i) a form of letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration and the cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to _Section 2.9_. Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be reasonably required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, (i) a certificate representing that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock which such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of _Section 2.7(a)_ , with respect to each Certificate formerly representing shares of Company Common Stock, (ii) cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section 2.9_, after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings, and (iii) any dividends or distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to  _Section 2.10(e)_, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. Until so surrendered and exchanged, each Certificate shall represent solely the right to receive the Merger Consideration into which the shares of Company Common Stock it theretofore represented shall have been converted pursuant to _Section 2.7(a)_, cash in lieu of any fractional shares pursuant to _Section 2.9_ and any dividends or distributions pursuant to _Section 2.10(e)_. If the exchange of certificates representing shares of Parent Common Stock is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition of exchange that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such exchange shall have paid any transfer and other taxes required by reason of the exchange of certificates representing shares of Parent Common Stock to a Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or shall have established to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent that such Tax either has been paid or is not applicable.

 (c) At any time after the one-year anniversary of the Effective Time, Parent shall be entitled to require the Exchange Agent to deliver to Parent cash and any other instruments (including certificates for shares of Parent Common Stock) in its possession relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement which had been made available to the Exchange Agent and which have not been distributed to holders of Certificates. Thereafter, each holder of a Certificate, representing shares converted pursuant to _Section 2.7(a)_ , may surrender such Certificate to Parent and (subject to applicable abandoned property, escheat or other similar laws) receive in exchange therefor the consideration payable in respect thereto pursuant to 

**Execution Copy**

16 _Section 2.7(a)_, _Section 2.9_ and _Section 2.10(e)_ , without interest, but
shall have no greater rights against Parent than may be accorded to general
creditors of Parent under applicable law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none
of Parent, the Surviving Company or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any
stockholder of the Company (or Company Stockholder) for shares of Parent
Common Stock (and any cash payable in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock) whose Certificates have been delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

 (d) At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock on the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates evidencing ownership of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares of Company Common Stock, except as otherwise provided for herein or by applicable law.  

 (e) No dividends or other distributions declared or made after the Effective Time with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock the holder is entitled to receive and no Merger Consideration, or any cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to _Section 2.9_ , shall be paid to such holder until the holder of such Certificate surrenders such Certificate in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement. Upon such surrender, Parent shall cause to be paid to the Person in whose name the certificates representing the Parent Common Stock shall be issued in respect of such surrendered Certificate, any dividends or distributions with respect to such shares of Parent Common Stock which have a record date after the Effective Time and shall have become payable between the Effective Time and the time of such surrender. In no event shall the Person entitled to receive such dividends or distributions be entitled to receive interest thereon.

 **Section 2.11  Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates.** In the event any Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, such shares of Parent Common Stock (and cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock), and dividends or distributions, if any, as may be required to be issued or paid pursuant to _Section 2.7(a)_ , _Section 2.9_ and _Section 2.10(e)_ ; _provided, however_ , that Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in such sum as it may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent or the Exchange Agent with respect to the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

 

 **Section 2.12  Withholding Rights.** Parent or the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration, or cash in lieu of fractional shares, if any, or dividends or distributions, if any, otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any stockholder of the Company such amounts as Parent or the Exchange Agent is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any 

**Execution Copy**

17 provision of state, local, or foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are
so withheld by Parent or the Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Company
Stockholder, in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by

agrees that the recommendations of the Company Board described in _Section
3.19_ (subject to the right of the Company Board to withdraw, amend or modify
such recommendation in accordance with _Section 6.3_ ) shall be included in
the Registration Statement and the Proxy Statement/Prospectus. Parent shall
use commercially reasonable best efforts to take all actions required under
any applicable federal or state securities or Blue Sky Laws in connection with

pay all filing fees incident thereto. As promptly as practicable after the
Registration Statement becomes effective, the Company shall cause the

comply with its obligations under Section 3(a)(i) of the Lazard Rights
Agreement.

 (b) The Company and Parent each agrees that none of the information supplied by it or its Subsidiaries to be included or incorporated by reference in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, will, on the date of the mailing of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, and at the time of the Company Stockholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. The Company and Parent each agrees that none of the information supplied by it or its Subsidiaries to be included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement will, at the time the Registration Statement becomes effective under the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading.

 (c) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, prior to the Effective Time (i) the Company and Parent shall notify each other as promptly as practicable upon becoming aware of any event or circumstance which should be described in an amendment of, or supplement to, the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Registration Statement, and (ii) the Company and Parent shall each notify the other as promptly as practicable after the receipt by it of any written or oral comments of the SEC on, or of any written or oral request by the SEC for amendments or supplements to, the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Registration Statement, and shall promptly supply the other with copies of all correspondence between it or any of its Representatives and the SEC with respect to any of the foregoing filings.

 

 (d) The Company shall take all action necessary to duly call the Company Stockholders Meeting, to be held as promptly as practicable for the purpose of voting upon the approval of the Company Voting Proposal. Subject to the right of the Company Board to withdraw, amend or modify such recommendation in accordance with _Section 6.3_ , the Company shall, through its board of directors, recommend to its stockholders adoption of this Agreement and approval of the Merger and related matters, and the Company shall use its best efforts to 

 

 **Execution Copy**

52 solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor of the Company Voting Proposal.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company agrees that its
obligations pursuant to this _Section 6.1(d)_ to call and conduct the Company
Stockholders Meeting shall not be affected by the commencement, public
proposal or communication to the Company of any Acquisition Proposal.

 **Section 6.2**   **Cooperation; Notice; Cure.** Subject to compliance with applicable law, from the date hereof until the Effective Time, each of Parent and the Company shall confer on a regular and frequent basis with one or more Representatives of the other Party to report on the general status of ongoing operations. Each of Parent and the Company shall promptly notify the other in writing of, and will use all commercially reasonable efforts to cure before the Closing Date, any event, transaction or circumstance, as soon as reasonably practicable after it becomes known to such Party, that causes or will cause any covenant or agreement of Parent or the Company, as the case may be, under this Agreement to be breached in any material respect or that renders or will render untrue in any material respect any representation or warranty of Parent or the Company contained in this Agreement. No notice given pursuant to this paragraph shall have any effect on the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement for purposes of determining satisfaction of any condition contained herein.

 **Section 6.3**   **No Solicitation.**

 (a) Subject to _Section 6.3(b)_ , unless and until this Agreement shall have been terminated by either party pursuant to Article VIII hereof, the Company shall not take or cause, directly or indirectly (through representatives, agents or otherwise), any of the following actions with any party other than Parent or its designees: (i) solicit, encourage, initiate or participate in any negotiations, inquiries or discussions with respect to any offer or proposal to acquire all or any part of its business, assets or capital stock whether by merger, consolidation, other business combination, purchase of assets, tender or exchange offer or otherwise, other than an offer or proposal with respect to a sale transaction permitted under _Section 5.1_ hereof (each of the foregoing, an " _Acquisition Proposal_ "); (ii) disclose, in connection with an Acquisition Proposal, any information or provide access to its properties, books or records, except as required by law or pursuant to a governmental request for information; (iii) enter into or execute any agreement relating to an Acquisition Proposal; or (iv) make or authorize any public statement, recommendation or solicitation in support of any Acquisition Proposal other than with respect to the Merger, or as otherwise required by applicable law. This _Section 6.3(a)_ shall not limit the ability of the Company and its Subsidiaries to sell Assets in accordance with _Section 5.1(f)_ hereof.

 (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in response to a bona fide, unsolicited, written Acquisition Proposal from a Third Party (that does not result from a breach of this _Section 6.3_), the Company Board may, and may authorize and permit the Companys officers, directors, employees, financial advisors, representatives, or agents to, (i) provide such Third Party with nonpublic information, (ii) otherwise facilitate any effort or attempt by such Third Party to make such Acquisition Proposal, (iii) agree to or recommend or endorse any such 

**Execution Copy**

53 Acquisition Proposal with or by any Third Party, (iv) withdraw or modify, or
propose publicly to withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent, its
approval and recommendation of the Merger and this Agreement, and (v)
participate in discussions and negotiations with such Third Party relating to
such Acquisition Proposal, if and only to the extent that (x) the
Company Board believes in good faith (after consultation with its financial
advisor and legal counsel) that such Acquisition Proposal is more favorable or
is likely to result in an Acquisition Proposal that is more favorable to
Company Stockholders than the Merger and is made by a Person believed by the
Company Board to be reasonably capable of completing such Acquisition Proposal
(a " _Superior Proposal_ "), (y) in the case of clauses (iii) and (iv) only,
the Company Board, after having consulted with and considered the advice of
outside counsel, has reasonably determined in good faith that the failure of
the Company Board to take the actions specified in clauses (iii) or (iv) would
result in a breach of its legal duties to the Company or the Company
Stockholders under applicable law and (z) the Third Party has entered into a
confidentiality agreement pertaining to nonpublic information regarding the
Company containing terms in the aggregate no more favorable to the Third
Party than those in the Confidentiality Agreement. In the event the Company
Board withdraws or modifies its approval of the Merger and this Agreement as
herein provided, the Merger and this Agreement shall nevertheless be
submitted to the Company Stockholders for their consideration and approval in
accordance with Section 3-105(d) of the MGCL. For a period of not less than
five Business Days after Parents receipt of notice of a Superior Proposal,
the Company shall, if requested by Parent, negotiate in good faith with
Parent to revise this Agreement so that the Acquisition Proposal that
constituted a Superior Proposal no longer constitutes a Superior Proposal. The
Company shall not enter into any agreement implementing an Acquisition
Proposal prior to the termination of this Agreement in accordance with
_Section 8.1_.

 (c) The Company shall notify Parent reasonably promptly after receipt by the Company (or any of its advisors) of any Acquisition Proposal or any request for nonpublic information in connection with an Acquisition Proposal or for access to the Companys properties, books or records by any person or entity that informs the Company that it is considering making, or has made, an Acquisition Proposal. Such notice shall be made orally and in writing and shall indicate in reasonable detail the identity of the offeror and the terms and conditions of such proposal, inquiry or contact. If the Acquisition Proposal is believed by the Company Board to be a Superior Proposal, the Company shall promptly (but in any event within one calendar day) furnish to Parent all of the terms of such proposal and copies of any proposed agreement relating thereto. The Company shall promptly (but in any event within one calendar day) advise Parent in writing of any material changes to the terms and conditions of any Acquisition Proposal.

 (d) Nothing contained in this _Section 6.3_ shall prohibit the Company from taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making any disclosure to its stockholders if the Company Board determines in good faith after consultation with its outside counsel that failure to do so would reasonably be expected to result in a breach of its statutory duties to the Company or its stockholders under any applicable law, _provided, however,_ that neither the Company nor the

**Execution Copy**

54 Company Board nor any committee thereof may, except as expressly permitted by
this _Section 6.3_ or required by Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange
Act, withdraw or modify, or propose publicly to withdraw or modify, its
position with respect to this Agreement or the Merger or approve or recommend,
or propose publicly to approve or recommend, an Acquisition Proposal.

 **Section 6.4**   **Access to Information.** Upon reasonable notice, each of Parent and the Company (and each of their respective Subsidiaries) shall afford to the other Party and its Representatives reasonable access, during normal business hours during the period prior to the Effective Time, to all its personnel, properties, books, contracts, commitments and records and, during such period, each of Parent and the Company shall, and shall cause each of its respective Subsidiaries to, furnish promptly to the other (a) copies of monthly financial reports and development reports, (b) a copy of each report, schedule, registration statement and other documents filed or received by it during such period pursuant to the requirements of federal or state securities laws and (c) all other information concerning its business, Assets, personnel and tax status as the other Party may reasonably request; _provided, however_ , the foregoing shall not require the Company or Parent to permit any inspection or disclose any information that would result in the disclosure of confidential information of Third Parties or violate a confidentiality obligation of such party or any material bearing on an Acquisition Proposal made prior to the date of this Agreement by any Third Party, or any advice or analysis by the Company or any of its representatives or any such Third Party or any such Acquisition Proposal or of any report from its financial advisors, counsel or management regarding Parent. Each Party making such requests will hold any such information furnished to it by the other Party or Parties which is nonpublic in confidence in accordance with the letter agreement dated as of October 10, 2002, between Parent and the Company (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "). All requests for information made pursuant to this Section shall be directed to an executive officer of the Company or Parent, as the case may be, or such Person designated by such officers. No information or knowledge obtained in any investigation pursuant to this _Section 6.4_ shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement or the conditions to the obligations of the Parties to consummate the Merger.

 **Section 6.5**   **Termination of Company s 401(k) Plan.** Unless Parent otherwise requests in writing, prior to the Closing, the Company Board shall (i) adopt resolutions terminating, effective prior to the Effective Time, the Companys 401(k) Plan (" _Company 401(k) Plan_ ") and (ii) amend the Company 401(k) Plan in the manner necessary to cause the tax-qualified status of such Company 401(k) Plan to be maintained at the time of termination.

 **Section 6.6**   **Governmental Approvals.**

 (a) The Parties shall cooperate with each other and use commercially reasonable efforts to promptly prepare and file all necessary documentation, to effect all applications, notices, petitions and filings, to obtain as promptly as practicable all permits, registrations, licenses, consents, variances, exemptions, orders, approvals and authorizations of all Third Parties and Governmental Entities which are necessary to consummate the transactions

**Execution Copy**

55 contemplated by this Agreement (" _Governmental Approvals_ "), and to comply
with the terms and conditions of all such Governmental Approvals. Each of the
Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to, and shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause their respective Representatives and
other Affiliates to, file within 30 days after the date hereof, and in all
events shall file within 60 days after the date hereof, all required initial
applications and documents in connection with obtaining the Governmental
Approvals and shall act reasonably and promptly thereafter in responding
to additional requests in connection therewith. Parent and the Company shall
have the right to review in advance, and to the extent practicable, each will
consult the other on, in each case subject to applicable laws relating to the
exchange of information, all the information relating to Parent and the
Company, as the case may be, and any of their respective Subsidiaries,
directors, officers and stockholders which appear in any filing made with, or
written materials submitted to, any Third Party or any Governmental Entity in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Without
limiting the foregoing, each of Parent and the Company (the " _Notifying
Party_ ") will notify the other promptly of the receipt of comments or
requests from Governmental Entities relating to Governmental Approvals, and
will supply the other Party with copies of all correspondence between the
Notifying Party or any of its Representatives and Governmental Entities with
respect to Governmental Approvals.

 (b) Parent and the Company shall promptly advise each other upon receiving any communication from any Governmental Entity whose consent or approval is required for consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement which causes such Party to believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that any approval needed from a Governmental Entity will not be obtained or that the receipt of any such approval will be materially delayed. Parent and the Company shall take any and all actions reasonably necessary to vigorously defend, lift, mitigate and rescind the effect of any litigation or administrative proceeding adversely affecting this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, including, without limitation, promptly appealing any adverse court or administrative order or injunction to the extent reasonably necessary for the foregoing purposes.

 (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement, Parent shall have no obligation or affirmative duty under this _Section 6.6_ to cease or refrain from the ownership of any Assets, or the association with any Person which association is material to the operations of Parent, whether on the date hereof or at any time in the future.

 **Section 6.7**   **Publicity.** Parent and the Company shall agree on the form and content of the initial press release regarding the transactions contemplated hereby and thereafter shall consult with each other before issuing any press release or other public statement with respect to any of the transactions contemplated hereby and shall not issue any such press release or make any such public statement prior to such consultation, except as may be required by law or obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with, or rules of any national securities exchange.

 **Section 6.8**   **Affiliate Agreements.** No later than 45 days prior to the Closing the Company shall deliver to Parent a list identifying, in the view of the Company, each person

**Execution Copy**

56 who will be, at the time of the Company Stockholders Meeting, a Company
Affiliate. The Company shall provide to Parent such information and documents
as Parent shall reasonably request for purposes of reviewing such list and
shall notify Parent in writing regarding any change in the identity of the
Company Affiliates prior to the Closing Date; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that
no such Person identified to Parent shall be added to the list of Company
Affiliates if Parent shall receive from the Company, on or before the date of
the Company Stockholders Meeting, an opinion of counsel
reasonably satisfactory to Parent to the effect that such Person is not a
Company Affiliate. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
deliver or cause to be delivered to Parent as promptly as practicable but in
no event later than 15 days prior to the Closing an Affiliate Agreement, in
the form attached hereto as Exhibit B, from each of its Affiliates.

 **Section 6.9**   **Tax Treatment of Reorganization.**

 (a) The Parties intend the Merger to qualify as a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code and shall use their best efforts (and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to use their best efforts) to cause the Merger to so qualify. Neither the Company, Parent, nor any of their respective Subsidiaries or other controlled Affiliates shall take any action that is not specifically provided for by this Agreement that could be reasonably likely to adversely affect the treatment of the Merger as a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code.  Parent and the Company shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to, take the position for all purposes that the Merger qualifies as a reorganization under that Section of the Code. None of the Company, Parent, or any Subsidiary of either makes any representation or warranty to the other(s) or to any stockholder regarding the tax treatment of the Merger or whether the Merger will qualify as a reorganization under the Code. Each of the Company, Parent, and the Subsidiaries of both acknowledge that they are relying on their own advisors in connection with the tax treatment of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 (b) Parent and the Company shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to, cooperate and use their best efforts in obtaining the opinions of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP, counsel to the Company, and Latham and Watkins, counsel to Parent, dated as of the Closing Date, to the effect that the Merger will qualify for federal income tax purposes as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. Parent and Company shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to, use their best efforts to provide Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP and Latham and Watkins with such representations or certificates as may reasonably be required to enable such counsel to render the opinions referred to in the preceding sentence.

 **Section 6.10**   **Further Assurances and Actions.** Subject to the terms and conditions herein, each of the Parties agrees to use its reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate action, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable on its part under applicable laws and regulations to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including, without limitation, (i) using their respective reasonable efforts to obtain all licenses, permits, consents, approvals, authorizations,

with each Party as are necessary for consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and (ii) to fulfill all conditions precedent
applicable to such Party pursuant to this Agreement, subject, in the case of
the Company, to the rights of the Company and the Company Board
under Sections _6.3(b)_ , _6.3(d)_ and _8.1(f)_.

 **Section 6.13**   **Letter of Parent s Accountants.** Parent shall use all reasonable efforts to cause to be delivered to the Company and Parent a letter of KPMG LLP, Parents independent auditors, dated (i) a date within two Business Days before the date on which the Registration Statement shall become effective and (ii) the Closing Date, in each case addressed to the Company and its directors, in form reasonably satisfactory to the Company and customary in scope and substance for letters delivered by independent public accountants in connection with registration statements similar to the Registration Statement. 

 **Section 6.14**   **Company REIT Status.** Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company from taking, and the Company hereby agrees to take, any action at any time or from time to time that in the reasonable judgment of the Company Board, upon advice of counsel, is legally necessary for the Company to maintain its qualification as a REIT within the meaning of Sections 856-860 of the Code for any period or portion thereof ending on or prior to the Effective Time, including without limitation, making dividend or distribution payments to Company Stockholders in accordance with _Section 5.3_ or otherwise.

 **Section 6.15**   **Parent REIT Status.** Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit Parent from taking, and Parent hereby agrees to take any action at any time or from time to time that in the reasonable judgment of Parent Board, upon advice of counsel, is legally necessary for Parent to maintain its qualification as a REIT within the meaning of Sections 856-860 of the Code for any period or portion thereof ending on, prior to or including the Effective Time, including without limitation, making dividend or distribution payments to stockholders of Parent, in accordance with _Section 5.3_ or otherwise.

 (b) The Company shall give (or shall cause its Subsidiaries to give) any notices to Third Parties, and use, and cause its Subsidiaries to use, their reasonable best efforts to obtain any Third Party consents related to or required in connection with the Merger that are (i) disclosed or required to be disclosed in the Company Disclosure Schedule, or (ii) required to prevent a Company Material Adverse Effect from occurring prior to or after the Effective Time.

 **Section 6.17**   **Non-Solicitation of Employees.** During the period from the date hereof to the earlier of the Effective Time and the one year anniversary date of the termination of this Agreement, neither Party hereto will, or will permit their respective Subsidiaries to, employ or solicit for employment any of the officers or management level employees of the other Party hereto.

 **Section 6.18**   **Indemnification and Insurance.**

 (a) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Company shall provide exculpation and indemnification for each Person who is now or has been at any time prior to the date hereof or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, an officer, or director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") which is at least as favorable to such persons as the exculpation and indemnification provided to the Indemnified Parties by the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time in their respective Organizational Documents, as in effect on the date hereof; provided, that such exculpation and indemnification covers actions on or prior to the Effective Time, including, without limitation, all transactions contemplated by this Agreement.  

 (b) In addition to the rights provided in  _Section 6.18(a)_ above, in the event of any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal or administrative, including without limitation, any action by or on behalf of any or all security holders of the Company or Parent, or any Subsidiary of the Company or Parent, or by or in the right of the Company or Parent, or any Subsidiary of the Company or Parent, or any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (collectively, for this  _Section 6.18_ " _Claims_ ") in which any Indemnified Party is, or is threatened to be, made a party based in whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to (i) the fact that he is or was an officer, employee or director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any action or omission or alleged action or omission by such Person in his capacity as an officer, employee or director, or (ii) this Agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby, whether in any case asserted or arising before or after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Company (the " _Indemnifying_

**Execution Copy**

59 _

_Parties_ ") shall from and after the Effective Time jointly and severally
indemnify and hold harmless the Indemnified Parties from and against any
losses, claims, liabilities, expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees
and expenses), judgments, fines or amounts paid in settlement arising out of
or relating to any such Claims. Parent, the Surviving Company and the
Indemnified Parties hereby agree to use their reasonable best efforts to
cooperate in the defense of such Claims. In connection with any such Claim,
the Indemnified Parties shall have the right to select and retain one
counsel, at the cost of the Indemnifying Parties, subject to the consent of
the Indemnifying Parties (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed) and more than one counsel if the interests of such Indemnified
Persons with respect to such Claim diverge or could be reasonably expected to
diverge. In addition, after the Effective Time, in the event of any such
threatened or actual Claim, the Indemnifying Parties shall promptly pay and
advance reasonable expenses and costs incurred by each Indemnified Person as
they become due and payable in advance of the final disposition of the Claim
to the fullest extent and in the manner permitted by law. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Indemnifying Parties shall not be obligated to advance any
expenses or costs prior to receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the
Indemnified Party, such undertaking to be accepted without regard to the
creditworthiness of the Indemnified Party, to repay any expenses advanced if
it shall ultimately be determined that the Indemnified Party is not entitled
to be indemnified against such expense. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth in this Agreement, the Indemnifying Parties (i) shall not
be liable for any settlement effected without their prior written consent
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), and (ii) shall
not have any obligation hereunder to any Indemnified Party to the extent that
a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine in a final and non-
appealable order that such indemnification is prohibited by applicable law. In
the event of a final and non-appealable determination by a court that any
payment of expenses is prohibited by applicable law, the Indemnified Party
shall promptly refund to the Indemnifying Parties the amount of all such
expenses theretofore advanced pursuant hereto. Any Indemnified Party wishing
to claim indemnification under this  _Section 6.18_ , upon learning of any
such Claim, shall promptly notify the Indemnifying Parties of such Claim and
the relevant facts and circumstances with respect thereto; provided however,
that the failure to provide such notice shall not affect the obligations of
the Indemnifying Parties except to the extent such failure to notify
materially prejudices the Indemnifying Parties ability to defend such Claim;
and provided, further, however, that no Indemnified Party shall be obligated
to provide any notification pursuant to this _Section 6.18(b)_ prior to the
Effective Time.

 (c) For six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall maintain in effect the Companys current directors and officers liability insurance covering acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time with respect to those persons who are currently covered by the Companys directors and officers liability insurance policy on terms with respect to such coverage and amount no less favorable in the aggregate to the Companys directors and officers, as the case may be, currently covered by such insurance than those of such policy in effect on the date of this Agreement; provided, that in the event that the aggregate premiums for maintaining such insurance for the benefit of persons currently covered by the Companys officers and directors insurance policy under this _Section 6.18(c)_ are in excess of $750,000, then Parent shall

**Execution Copy**

60 only be obligated to maintain such insurance coverage as is reasonably
available for such amount.

 (d) This _Section 6.18_ is intended for the irrevocable benefit of, and to grant third-party rights to, the Indemnified Parties and their successors, assigns and heirs and shall be binding on all successors and assigns of Parent, including without limitation the Surviving Company. Each of the Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to enforce the covenants contained in this _Section 6.18_ and Parent acknowledges and agrees that each Indemnified Party would suffer irreparable harm and that no adequate remedy at law exists for a breach of such covenants and such Indemnified Party shall be entitled to injunctive relief and specific performance in the event of any breach of any provision in this _Section 6.18_.

 (e) In the event that the Surviving Company or any of its respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, the successors and assigns of such entity shall assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 6.18_ , which obligations are expressly intended to be for the irrevocable benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each director and officer covered hereby.

 **Section 6.19**   **Termination of Stockholders Agreement.**

 At or prior to Closing, the Company shall enter into the Agreement to Terminate Stockholders Agreement, attached hereto as Exhibit C.

 **Section 6.20**   **Company OP Units.** From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Company to, comply with Section 11.2.B(ii) of the Operating Partnership Agreement in connection with the Merger.

 (a) by mutual written consent of each of Parent and the Company;

 (b) by either the Company or Parent, if the Effective Time shall not have occurred on or before April 30, 2003 (the " _Termination Date_ "); _provided_ _however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section 8.1(b)_ shall not be available to any Party whose failure to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement has been the cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the Effective Time to occur on or before the Termination Date;

 (c) by either the Company or Parent, if a Governmental Entity shall have issued an order, decree or injunction having the effect of making the Merger illegal or permanently prohibiting the consummation of the Merger, and such order, decree or injunction shall have become final and nonappealable;

**Execution Copy**

65 Termination Date, for so long as the Company continues in good faith to
attempt to cure such breach, Parent may not terminate this Agreement under
this _Section 8.1(f)_ ; or

 **Section 8.2**   **Expenses; Break-Up Fee.**

 (a) Except as otherwise provided in this _Section 8.2_ , all Expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the Party incurring such Expenses. As used in this Agreement, " _Expenses_ " includes all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including, without limitation, all reasonable fees and expenses of counsel, accountants, investment bankers, experts and consultants to a party hereto and its Affiliates) incurred by a party or on its behalf in connection with or related to the authorization, preparation, negotiation, execution and performance of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the preparation, printing, filing and mailing of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and Registration Statement and the solicitation of stockholder approvals and all other matters related to the transactions contemplated hereby.

 (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, 

 (i) if (A) after the receipt by the Company of an Acquisition Proposal, this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)_ or (B) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(f)_ , then the Company shall pay the Expenses incurred by Parent up to the Maximum Expense Amount (as defined below); _provided, however,_ that the Company shall not be obligated to pay such Expenses incurred by Parent if it is obligated to pay a Break-Up Fee pursuant to _Section 8.2(c)_.

 (ii) if this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to _Section 8.1(g)_ , then Parent shall pay the Expenses incurred by the Company up to the Maximum Expense Amount (as defined below).

 The " _Maximum Expense Amount_ " shall be an amount equal to the lesser of (i) $2,500,000 (the "Maximum Amount") and (ii) the maximum amount, if any, that can be paid to the Company or Parent, as the case may be, without causing it to fail to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code for such year determined as if (a) the payment of such

**Execution Copy**

66 amount did not constitute income described in Sections 856(c)(2)(A)-(H) and
856(c)(3)(A)-(I) of the Code (" _Qualifying Income_ "), and (b) the recipient
has $1,000,000 of income from unknown sources during such year which was not
Qualifying Income (in addition to any known or anticipated income which was
not Qualifying Income), in each case as determined by independent accountants
to the Company or Parent, as the case may be. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
in the event the Company or Parent, as the case may be, receives a reasoned
opinion from outside counsel or a ruling from the IRS ( " _Tax Guidance_ ")
providing that the Companys or Parents receipt of the Maximum Amount would
either constitute Qualifying Income or would be excluded from gross income
within the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code (the " _REIT
Requirements_ "), the Maximum Expenses Amount shall be an amount equal to the
Maximum Amount and Parent or the Company, as the case may be, shall, upon
receiving notice that the Company or Parent, as the case may be, has received
the Tax Guidance, pay to the Company or Parent, as the case may be, the unpaid
Maximum Amount within five Business Days. In the event that the Company or
Parent, as the case may be, is not able to receive the full Maximum Amount
due to the above limitations, Parent or the Company, as the case may be, shall
place the unpaid amount in escrow by wire transfer within three days of
termination and shall not release any portion thereof to the Company or
Parent, as the case may be, unless and until the Company or Parent, as the
case may be, receives either one or a combination of the following once or
more often: (i) a letter from the Companys or Parents, as the case may be,
independent accountants indicating the maximum amount that can be paid at
that time to Parent without causing Parent to fail to meet the REIT
Requirements (calculated as described above) or (ii) the Tax Guidance, in
either of which events Parent or the Company, as the case may be, shall pay
to the Company or Parent, as the case may be, the lesser of the unpaid Maximum
Amount or the maximum amount stated in the letter referred to in (i) above
within five Business Days after Parent or the Company, as the case may be,
has been notified thereof. The obligation of Parent or the Company, as the
case may be, to pay any unpaid portion of the Maximum Expense Amount shall
terminate on the December 31 following the date which is three years from the
date of this Agreement. Amounts remaining in escrow after the obligation of
Parent or the Company, as the case may be, to pay the Maximum Expense Amount
terminates shall be released to the party that placed such funds into escrow.

 

The Companys payment of the Expenses incurred by the Parent pursuant to this
subsection shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent against the
Company and any of its Subsidiaries and their respective directors, officers,
employees, agents, advisors or other representatives with respect to the
occurrences giving rise to such payment, except for liabilities or damages
caused by the willful breach of any representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements herein by the Company. Parents payment of the Expenses incurred by
the Company pursuant to this subsection shall be the sole and exclusive remedy
of the Company against Parent and any of its Subsidiaries and
their respective directors, officers, employees, agents, advisors or other
representatives with respect to the occurrences giving rise to such payment,
except for liabilities or damages caused by the willful breach of any
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements herein by Parent.

**Execution Copy**

67 (c) The Company shall pay Parent a Break-Up Fee upon the earliest to occur of the following events:

 (i) the termination of this Agreement by either Parent or the Company pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)_, if a proposal for an Alternative Transaction involving the Company shall have been publicly announced prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting and either a definitive agreement for an Alternative Transaction is entered into, or such Alternative Transaction (or another Alternative Transaction with the proponent of such transaction or an Affiliate of such proponent) is consummated, within twelve months of such termination, it being understood that the Break-Up Fee under this clause 8.2(c)(i) shall be payable only upon the earlier of the execution of such definitive agreement or the consummation of such Alternative Transaction; or

 

 (ii) the termination of this Agreement by Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(e)_.

The Companys payment of a Break-Up Fee pursuant to this subsection shall be
the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent against the Company and any of its
Subsidiaries and their respective directors, officers, employees, agents,
advisors or other representatives with respect to the occurrences giving rise
to such payment; _provided_ that this limitation shall not apply in the event
of a willful breach of this Agreement by the Company.

 (d) As used in this Agreement, " _Alternative Transaction_ " means either (i) a transaction pursuant to which any Third Party acquires more than 19.9% of the outstanding Company Common Stock pursuant to a tender offer or exchange offer or otherwise, (ii) a merger or other business combination involving the Company pursuant to which any Third Party (or the stockholders of a Third Party) acquires more than 19.9% of the outstanding Company Common Stock or 19.9% of the equity securities of the entity surviving such merger or business combination, or (iii) any other transaction (other than a transaction permitted by _Section 5.1(f)_ ) pursuant to which any Third Party acquires control of assets (including for this purpose the outstanding equity securities of Subsidiaries of the Company and the entity surviving any merger or business combination including any of them) of the Company or the Operating Partnership having a fair market value (as determined by the Company Board in good faith) equal to more than 19.9% of the fair market value of all the assets of the Company, the Operating Partnership and their Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, immediately prior to such transaction.

 (e) The " _Break-Up Fee_ " shall be an amount equal to the lesser of (i) the Base Amount (as defined below) and (ii) the maximum amount, if any, that can be paid to Parent without causing it to fail to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code for such year determined as if (a) the payment of such amount did not constitute Qualifying Income, and (b) Parent has $1,000,000 of income from unknown sources during such year which was not Qualifying Income (in addition to any known or anticipated income of Parent which was not Qualifying Income), in each case as determined by independent accountants to Parent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event Parent receives Tax Guidance providing that Parents

**Execution Copy**

68 receipt of the Base Amount would either constitute Qualifying Income or would
be excluded from gross income within the meaning of the REIT Requirements,
the Break-Up Fee shall be an amount equal to the Base Amount and the Company
shall, upon receiving notice that Parent has received the Tax Guidance, pay to
Parent the unpaid Base Amount within five Business Days. In the event that
Parent is not able to receive the full Base Amount due to the above
limitations, the Company shall place the unpaid amount in escrow by wire
transfer within three days of termination and shall not release any portion
thereof to Parent unless and until Parent receives either one or a
combination of the following once or more often: (i) a letter from Parents
independent accountants indicating the maximum amount that can be paid at that
time to Parent without causing Parent to fail to meet the REIT Requirements
(calculated as described above) or (ii) the Tax Guidance, in either of which
events the Company shall pay to Parent the lesser of the unpaid Base Amount or
the maximum amount stated in the letter referred to in (i) above within five
Business Days after the Company has been notified thereof. The payment of the
Break-Up Fee shall be compensation and liquidated damages for the loss
suffered by Parent as a result of the failure of the Merger to be consummated
and to avoid the difficulty of determining damages under the circumstances and
neither Party shall have any other liability to the other after the payment of
the Break-Up Fee. The obligation of Company to pay any unpaid portion of the
Break-Up Fee shall terminate on the December 31 following the date which is
three years from the date of this Agreement. Amounts remaining in escrow after
the obligation of the Company to pay the Break-Up Fee terminates shall be
released to the Company. As used in this Section 8.2(e), the " _Base Amount_ "
shall mean $7,500,000.

 **Section 8.3**   **Effect of Termination.** In the event of termination of this Agreement by either the Company or Parent as provided in _Section 8.1_ , this Agreement shall forthwith become void and there shall be no liability or obligation on the part of Parent or the Company or their respective officers, members or directors except as (i) set forth in _Section 8.2_ , (ii) with respect to any actual liabilities or damages incurred or suffered by a party as a result of the willful breach by the other party of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements set forth in this Agreement and (iii) with respect to provisions that survive the termination hereof pursuant to _Section 9.1_.

 **Section 8.4**   **Amendment.** This Agreement may be amended by the Parties by action taken by or on behalf of their respective Boards at any time before or after any required approval of matters presented in connection with the Merger by Company Stockholders; _provided_ , _however_ , that after any such approval, there shall be made no amendment that by law requires further approval by such stockholders without the further approval of such stockholders.  This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed by the Parties.

 **Section 8.5**   **Waiver. **At any time prior to the Closing Date, any Party may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other Parties hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other Parties contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive compliance by any other Party with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein. Any such extension or waiver shall be valid if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by the Party or Parties to be 

**Execution Copy**

69 bound thereby. The failure of any Party to this Agreement to assert any of its
rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of
such rights.

**ARTICLE IX. 
 GENERAL PROVISIONS**

 **Section 9.1**   **Non-Survival of Representations, Warranties and Agreements.** The representations, warranties and agreements in this Agreement shall terminate at the Effective Time or upon the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1_ , as the case may be, except that (a) the agreements set forth in _Article II_ and _Sections 6.18_ , _6.20_ and _9.1_ through _9.11_ shall survive the Effective Time and (b) the agreements set forth in the Confidentiality Agreement and in _Sections 6.9_ , _6.17_ , _8.2,_ _8.3_ and _9.1_ through _9.11_ shall survive termination indefinitely.
