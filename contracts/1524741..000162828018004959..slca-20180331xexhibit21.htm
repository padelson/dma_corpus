Stockholders' Representative Expense Fund Amount (as set forth in Section
2.05) will be deducted from the cash payable to such Stockholder pursuant to
Section 2.04(a) above;

(ii) Each share of Common Stock owned by the Company, Buyer, MergerSub or any
direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of Buyer or MergerSub immediately
prior to the Effective Time will be cancelled and retired and will cease to
exist without payment of any consideration with respect thereto; and

(c) Each share of common stock of MergerSub outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time will be converted into and become one share of common stock
of the Surviving Corporation with the same rights, powers and privileges as
the shares so converted.

Section 2.05 Adjustment Escrow Amount; Closing Date Payments. At the Effective
Time:

(a) Buyer will cause the Adjustment Escrow Amount to be delivered to the
Escrow Agent for deposit into the Adjustment Escrow Account, established in
accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement. The Escrow Agent will hold
the Adjustment Escrow Amount, and all interest and other amounts earned
thereon, in escrow pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, and for purposes of this
Agreement the "Adjustment Escrow Property" means, at any given time, the funds
contained in the Adjustment Escrow Account at that time. Buyer shall be
treated as the owner of the Adjustment Escrow Property (and related interest
and earnings) for income Tax purposes until such amounts are released. The
Adjustment Escrow Property shall be released from the Adjustment Escrow
Account in accordance with the terms of Section 2.12 and the Escrow Agreement.

(b) Buyer will cause the Stockholders' Representative Expense Fund Amount to
be delivered to an account established by the Stockholders' Representative.
The Stockholders' Representative Expense Fund Amount, and all interest (if
any) and other amounts earned thereon (if any) (the "Stockholders'
Representative Fund Property"), will be held in the account in escrow for the
purpose of paying Charges incurred by the Stockholders' Representative as
contemplated by Article 10. The Stockholders will be responsible for and will
pay and discharge their Pro Rata Share of all Taxes, assessments and
governmental charges imposed on or with respect to the Stockholders'
Representative Fund Property. The Stockholders' Representative will be
entitled to deduct and withhold from any funds or other assets otherwise
payable out of the Stockholders' Representative Fund Property to any
Stockholder pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as the Stockholders'
Representative is required to deduct and withhold under any provision of
federal, state, local or foreign Tax law. If the Stockholders' Representative
so withholds amounts, such amounts will be treated for the purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Stockholders in respect of which the
Stockholders' Representative made such deductions and withholding. At such
time as the Stockholders' Representative determines (in its reasonable
discretion) that all or a portion of the Stockholders' Representative Fund
Property is not necessary to pay Charges, the Stockholders' Representative
shall cause such portion of the Stockholders' Representative Fund Property to
be released to each Stockholder in accordance with such Stockholder's Pro Rata
Share of the Stockholders' Representative Fund Property.

(c) Buyer will deliver to the recipients thereof specified in the Estimated
Closing Statement, for and on behalf of the Company, such recipient's portion
of (i) the Estimated Closing Transaction Expenses and (ii) the Debt Payoff
Amount.

Section 2.06 Surrender and Payment.

(a) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Company
shall provide each Stockholder, (i) a letter of transmittal in the form
attached hereto as Exhibit B (a "Letter of Transmittal") and (ii) instructions
for use in effecting the surrender of the Common Stock Certificates in
exchange for the Per-Share Consideration.

(b) At or prior to the Effective Time, the Stockholders' Representative will
appoint a paying agent (the "Paying Agent") for the purpose of exchanging
Common Stock Certificates for the applicable Per-Share Consideration. Buyer
will deliver to the Paying Agent, at the Closing, cash in an amount equal to
the Aggregate Merger Consideration (less the Adjustment Escrow Amount and the
Stockholders' Representative Expense Fund Amount deposited pursuant to Section
2.05 in respect of Shares).

(c) Each Stockholder whose Shares have been converted into the right to
receive payment pursuant to Section 2.04, will be entitled to receive, after
surrender to the Paying Agent of such Stockholder's Common Stock Certificates,
and, in each case, after the delivery of a properly completed Letter of
Transmittal, the Per-Share Consideration for such Common Stock represented by
such Common Stock Certificate, in each case, in the manner and at the times
set forth in this Agreement. Until so surrendered, each such Common Stock
Certificate will represent after the Effective Time for all purposes only the
right to receive payment as provided in this Agreement. The Stockholders'
Representative will cause the Paying Agent not to make any payment of any Per-



Active 37496756.2 17

* * *



Share Consideration to any Stockholder that has failed to properly deliver the
required Letter of Transmittal and Common Stock Certificates (a "Non-Signatory
Holder") unless and until such Non-Signatory Holder shall have duly executed
and delivered a Letter of Transmittal with respect to, and shall have so
delivered, the Common Stock Certificates (or lost certificate affidavit as
provided herein) previously evidencing such Shares, to the Paying Agent.
Promptly after each such payment, the Stockholders' Representative will cause
the Paying Agent to deliver such Letter of Transmittal and Common Stock
Certificate(s) to Buyer.

(d) Subject to Section 2.04(b) and Section 2.05, Buyer will pay, or cause the
Paying Agent pursuant to the Paying Agent Agreement to pay, to each
Stockholder into an account designated in such Stockholder's Letter of
Transmittal, such Stockholder's Per-Share Consideration. No interest will
accrue or be paid on any amount payable to a Stockholder pursuant to this
Agreement.

(e) If any portion of the Per-Share Consideration is to be paid to a Person
other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Common Stock Certificate
is registered on the books and records of the Company, it will be a condition
to such payment that the Common Stock Certificate so surrendered will be
properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the
Person requesting such payment will pay to the Surviving Corporation any
transfer or other taxes required as a result of such payment to a Person other
than the registered holder of such Common Stock Certificate, or establish to
the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such tax has been paid or
is not payable.

(f) After the Effective Time, there will be no further registration of
transfers of Common Stock. All Common Stock Certificates presented to the
Paying Agent or the Surviving Corporation, as contemplated by this Section
2.06, will be canceled upon such presentment.

(g) Any portion of the amount made available to the Paying Agent pursuant to
Section 2.06(a) that remains unclaimed by the Stockholders one (1) year after
the Effective Time will be returned to Buyer, and any Stockholder who has not
exchanged its Common Stock for the applicable Per-Share Consideration prior to
such time will thereafter look only to Buyer for payment thereof without any
interest thereon. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
none of Buyer, the Stockholders' Representative, the Surviving Corporation or
any party hereto will be liable to any Person for any amount properly paid to
a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Applicable Law.

(h) Each Stockholder, by his, her or its adoption of this Agreement or
acceptance of any portion of the Per-Share Consideration expressly
acknowledges and affirms that none of Buyer, MergerSub, the Company or the
Surviving Corporation will incur any liability to such Stockholder by virtue
of the remittance of the Per-Share Consideration in the manner set forth in
this Article 2 or for any actions or omissions of the Stockholders'
Representative or the Paying Agent in respect of the distribution thereof.

Section 2.07 Dissenting Common Stock. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time that are held by a Stockholder who did
not vote in favor of the Merger or consent thereto in writing and who is
entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal for such shares of Common



Active 37496756.2 18

* * *



Stock ("Dissenting Shares") pursuant to, and who complies in all respects
with, the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL will not be converted into the
right to receive the Per-Share Consideration, but instead will be entitled to
payment of the fair value of such shares in accordance with the provisions of
Section 262 of the DGCL. At the Effective Time, the Dissenting Shares, if any,
will no longer be outstanding and will automatically be canceled and will
cease to exist, and each holder of Dissenting Shares will cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the fair value of
such shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any such Stockholder fails to perfect,
withdraws or loses its right to appraisal, the Dissenting Shares held by such
Stockholder will be treated as if they had been converted as of the Effective
Time into a right to receive the applicable Per-Share Consideration (less any
amounts deducted for deposit into the Adjustment Escrow Account and any
amounts deducted for deposit into the Stockholders' Representative Fund
Property account), to be paid as provided in Section 2.06(d). Promptly
following the date of this Agreement, the Company will provide each record
holder of shares of Common Stock that has not voted in favor of the Merger or
consented thereto in writing with notice of such holder's appraisal rights
pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL. The Company will give Buyer prompt notice
of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of Common Stock,
withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to
Applicable Law that are received by the Company relating to Stockholders'
rights of appraisal, and Buyer will have the right to participate in all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company will comply with those provisions of Section 262
of the DGCL which are required to be performed by the Company prior to the
Effective Time to the reasonable satisfaction of Buyer. Except with the prior
written consent of Buyer (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned), the Company will not voluntarily make any payment
with respect to any demands for appraisal, or offer to settle or settle, any
such demands. Any portion of the Per-Share Consideration paid to the Paying
Agent in respect of any Dissenting Shares will be returned to Buyer, upon
demand.

Section 2.08 Adjustments. If during the period between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time any change in the outstanding shares of
Common Stock will occur by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization,
stock split or combination, exchange or readjustment of Common Stock, or stock
dividend thereon with a record date during such period, or any similar event
relating to the Common Stock, the applicable Per-Share Consideration and the
Aggregate Merger Consideration, and any other amounts payable pursuant to this
Agreement, will be appropriately adjusted; provided, that no such change or
event contemplated by this Section 2.08 will give rise to a change to the
aggregate amount to be paid by or on behalf of Buyer under this Agreement.

Section 2.09 Lost Certificates. If any Common Stock Certificate will have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact and
the provision of such bond or other security that the Surviving Corporation
may determine to be appropriate by the Person claiming such Common Stock
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Surviving Corporation will
pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Common Stock Certificate,
the applicable Per-Share Consideration (subject to Section 2.04(b)(i)) to be
paid in respect of the Common Stock represented by such Common Stock
Certificate as contemplated by this Article 2.



Active 37496756.2 19

Section 2.10 Rights Not Transferable. The rights of the Stockholders as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time are personal to each such
securityholder and shall not be transferable for any reason otherwise than by
operation of law, will or the laws of descent and distribution or with the
prior written consent of Buyer. Any attempted transfer of such right by any
holder thereof (otherwise than as permitted by the immediately preceding
sentence) shall be null and void.

Section 2.11 Withholding Rights. Each of Buyer, the Company, the Paying Agent,
and the Escrow Agent will be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Agreement. Any
such amounts deducted and withheld will be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the applicable Person in respect of whom such
deduction and withholding was made. If Buyer or the Company intends to so
withhold on any amounts payable to the Stockholders pursuant to this
Agreement, Buyer or the Company, as applicable, shall notify the Stockholders'
Representative no later than three (3) days prior to the Closing Date and
shall reasonably cooperate with the Stockholder's Representative to reduce or
eliminate such withholding tax to the extent possible and allowable under
Applicable Law; provided, however, that no such notification or cooperation
requirements will be required with respect to amounts payable to a Stockholder
for withholding pursuant to Section 1445 of the Code if the Stockholder's
Representative fails to deliver at or prior to the Closing the certificate in
Section 8.02(f)(i) with respect to such Stockholder and the Company fails to
deliver the documentation in Section 8.02(f)(ii).

Section 2.12 Purchase Price Adjustment.

(a) Estimated Closing Statement. The Company will prepare in good faith and
provide to Buyer no later than three (3) Business Days prior to the
anticipated Closing Date (i) a written statement setting forth in reasonable
detail its good faith estimates of the Closing Working Capital (the "Estimated
Working Capital"), the Closing Cash Balance (the "Estimated Closing Cash
Balance"), the Closing Transaction Expenses (the "Estimated Closing
Transaction Expenses") and the intended recipients thereof, the Closing Debt
Amount (the "Estimated Closing Debt Amount") and the Debt Payoff Amount
(together, the "Estimated Closing Statement") and (ii) the Company's
calculation of the estimated Per-Share Consideration (the "Estimated Per-Share
Consideration") and the estimated Aggregate Merger Consideration, each
calculated in accordance with the definitions thereof and using the Estimated
Working Capital as the amount of the Closing Working Capital, the Estimated
Closing Cash Balance as the amount of the Closing Cash Balance, the Estimated
Closing Transaction Expenses as the amount of the Closing Transaction Expenses
and the Estimated Closing Debt Amount as the Closing Debt Amount. The
Company's good faith estimates of the Closing Working Capital, the Closing
Cash Balance, the Closing Transaction Expenses and the Closing Debt Amount
contained in the Estimated Closing Statement will be prepared in accordance
with the definitions thereof and in accordance with the accounting policies,
principles, practices and methodologies used in the preparation of the audited
Financials of EP Minerals and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of November 30,
2017 and otherwise in accordance with GAAP.

(b) Estimated Aggregate Merger Consideration. The Aggregate Merger
Consideration payable at the Effective Time will be calculated using the
Estimated Working Capital, the Estimated



Active 37496756.2 20

* * *



Closing Cash Balance, the Estimated Closing Transaction Expenses and the
Estimated Closing Debt Amount set forth in the Estimated Closing Statement
(the "Estimated Aggregate Merger Consideration").

(c) Proposed Final Closing Statement. As promptly as possible and in any event
within sixty (60) calendar days after the Closing Date, Buyer will prepare or
cause to be prepared, and will provide to the Stockholders' Representative, a
written statement setting forth in reasonable detail its proposed final
determination of the Closing Working Capital, the Closing Cash Balance, the
Closing Transaction Expenses, the Closing Debt Amount, the Per-Share
Consideration and the Aggregate Merger Consideration (together, the "Proposed
Final Closing Statement"). The determination of the Closing Working Capital,
the Closing Cash Balance, the Closing Transaction Expenses and the Closing
Debt Amount reflected on the Proposed Final Closing Statement will be prepared
in accordance with the definitions thereof and in accordance with the
accounting policies, principles, practices and methodologies used in the
preparation of the audited Financials of EP Minerals and its consolidated
Subsidiaries as of November 30, 2017 and otherwise in accordance with GAAP.
Buyer will afford, and cause the Company to afford, the Stockholders'
Representative and its Representatives reasonable access to the work papers
and other books and records (including Tax records) of the Company for
purposes of assisting the Stockholders' Representative and its Representatives
in their review of the Proposed Final Closing Statement.

(d) Dispute Notice. The Proposed Final Closing Statement (and the proposed
final determinations of the Closing Working Capital, the Closing Cash Balance,
the Closing Transaction Expenses, the Closing Debt Amount, the Per-Share
Consideration and the Aggregate Merger Consideration reflected thereon) will
be final, conclusive and binding on the parties hereto for purposes of this
Section 2.12 unless the Stockholders' Representative provides a written notice
(a "Dispute Notice") to Buyer no later than the twentieth (20th) Business Day
after the delivery to the Stockholders' Representative of the Proposed Final
Closing Statement (the "Dispute Period"); provided, that the Dispute Period
shall be automatically tolled during any period in which Buyer fails to
afford, or cause the Company to afford, the Stockholders' Representative and
its Representatives reasonable access to the work papers and other books and
records (including Tax records) of the Company as required by Section 2.12(c)
above. Any Dispute Notice must set forth in reasonable detail (i) any item on
the Proposed Final Closing Statement which the Stockholders' Representative
believes has not been prepared in accordance with this Agreement and the
correct amount of such item and (ii) the Stockholders' Representative's
alternative calculation of the Closing Working Capital, the Closing
Transaction Expenses, the Closing Cash Balance, the Closing Debt Amount, the
Per-Share Consideration and the Aggregate Merger Consideration, as applicable.
Any item or amount to which no dispute is raised in the Dispute Notice will be
final, conclusive and binding on the parties hereto for purposes of this
Section 2.12 from and after the expiration of the Dispute Period.

(e) Resolution of Disputes. Buyer and the Stockholders' Representative will
attempt to promptly resolve the matters raised in any Dispute Notice in good
faith. Beginning ten (10) Business Days after delivery of any Dispute Notice
pursuant to Section 2.12(d), or any mutually-agreed extension thereof, either
Buyer or the Stockholders' Representative may provide written notice to the
other (the "Dispute Submission Notice") that it elects to submit the remaining
disputed items



Active 37496756.2 21

* * *



to a nationally recognized independent accounting firm chosen jointly by Buyer
and the Stockholders' Representative (the "Accounting Firm"); provided, that
if the Stockholders' Representative and Buyer are unable to select a firm
within thirty (30) calendar days after delivery of the Dispute Notice, either
Buyer or the Stockholders' Representative may request the American Arbitration
Association to appoint an independent accounting firm meeting the requirements
set forth above or a neutral and impartial certified public accountant with
significant arbitration experience related to purchase price adjustment
disputes relating to transactions of a similar nature. The parties will
instruct the Accounting Firm to promptly (and in any event within 30 calendar
days), in accordance with such procedures as it deems fair and equitable,
provided, that each party will be afforded an opportunity to submit a written
statement in favor of its position and to advocate for its position orally
before the Accounting Firm, review only those unresolved items and amounts
specifically set forth and objected to in the Dispute Notice and make a
binding determination with respect thereto. A single partner of the Accounting
Firm selected by such Accounting Firm in accordance with its normal procedures
and having expertise with respect to settlement of such disputes and the
industry in which the Company operates will (acting as an expert and not as an
arbitrator) act for the Accounting Firm in the determination proceeding, and
the Accounting Firm will render a written decision with respect to such
disputed matters, including a statement in reasonable detail of the basis for
its decision. In resolving the disputed matters, the Accounting Firm may not
assign a value to any item greater than the greatest value for such item
claimed by either party or less than the smallest value for such item claimed
by either party. The fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be
allocated to be paid by Buyer, on the one hand, and/or the Company, on the
other hand, based upon the percentage which the portion of the contested
amount not awarded to each party bears to the amount actually contested by
such party, as determined by the Accounting Firm. The decision of the
Accounting Firm with respect to the disputed items of the Proposed Final
Closing Statement submitted to it will be final, conclusive and binding on the
parties for purposes of this Section 2.12. As used herein, the Proposed Final
Closing Statement, as adjusted to reflect any changes agreed to by the parties
and/or the decision of the Accounting Firm, pursuant to this Section 2.12, is
referred to herein as the "Final Closing Statement". Each of the parties to
this Agreement agrees to cooperate with the Accounting Firm (including by
executing a customary engagement letter reasonably acceptable to it) and to
cause the Accounting Firm to resolve any such dispute as soon as practicable
after the commencement of the Accounting Firm's engagement.

(f) Purchase Price Adjustment. If the Closing Working Capital, the Closing
Debt Amount, the Closing Transaction Expenses or the Closing Cash Balance (as
finally determined pursuant to this Section 2.12 and as set forth in the Final
Closing Statement) differs from the estimated amounts thereof set forth in the
Estimated Closing Statement, the Per-Share Consideration will be recalculated
using such final figures in lieu of such estimated figures, and

(i) Buyer will remit or cause to be remitted to the Paying Agent (for
distribution to the Stockholders in accordance with each Stockholder's Pro
Rata Share) an aggregate amount equal to the excess of the Aggregate Merger
Consideration over the Estimated Aggregate Merger Consideration, and each of
Buyer and the Stockholders' Representative shall authorize and direct the
Escrow Agent to release to the Paying Agent (for distribution



Active 37496756.2 22

* * *



to the Stockholders in accordance with each Stockholder's Pro Rata Share) all
funds in the Adjustment Escrow Account; or

(ii) Buyer and the Stockholders' Representative will jointly direct the Escrow
Agent to transfer to (A) Buyer, or at Buyer's discretion, to the Surviving
Corporation, by wire transfer of immediately available funds out of the
Adjustment Escrow Property an aggregate amount equal to the excess of the
Estimated Aggregate Merger Consideration over the Aggregate Merger
Consideration (solely to the extent of the funds available in the Adjustment
Escrow Account) and (B) the Paying Agent (for distribution to the Stockholders
in accordance with each Stockholder's Pro Rata Share), any funds that remain
in the Adjustment Escrow Account following the distribution contemplated by
clause (A) of this Section 2.12(f)(ii).

(g) Methodology. If and to the extent that the Final Closing Statement
includes as part of its calculation a number resulting from correction of an
error or inconsistency, or a noncompliance with an accounting policy or
procedure, that was used in the calculation of the Target Working Capital (or
the account balances that were used by the parties in discussions to finalize
the Target Working Capital), then the Target Working Capital shall be
similarly adjusted for the same matter giving rise to such correction in the
same manner (based on facts existing as of the dates of the accounts used to
finalize the Target Working Capital) that such correction was applied in the
Final Closing Statement so that the same item is not reflected differently on
the Final Closing Statement than it was in the account balances used to
finalize the Target Working Capital.

of the Company, by any other party under any of the Leases, and no

provide for the accrued benefit obligations, as of the date of this Agreement,
with respect to all current and former participants in such plan according to
the actuarial assumptions and valuations most recently used to determine
employer contributions to such Foreign Plan, and no transaction contemplated

been registered and has been maintained in good standing with applicable
regulatory authorities.

course of business consistent with past practice;

(xvi) incur any Debt or guarantee any such Debt or issue or sell any debt

or other distribution of cash to its shareholders or other equity interest

Other than the right to consent or withhold consent with respect to the
foregoing matters (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or

Acquired Companies prior to the Closing.

Section 5.02 Access to Information. From the date hereof until the Effective
Time, upon reasonable notice, the Company will (a) give Buyer, its counsel,
financial advisors, auditors and other authorized Representatives reasonable
access to the offices, properties, books and records of the Acquired Companies
and (b) furnish to Buyer, and its counsel, financial advisors, auditors and
other authorized representatives, such financial, tax and operating data and
other information relating to the Company or each of its Subsidiaries as such

Subsidiaries to cooperate in all reasonable respects with Buyer and its
Representatives (including through interviews) in their investigation of the
Company and its Subsidiaries for purposes of verifying the accuracy of the
representations and warranties herein, confirming compliance with the
covenants hereunder and determining if conditions to Closing hereunder have
been satisfied; provided, however, that any such access or furnishing of
information will be conducted at Buyer's expense, during normal business
hours, under the supervision of the Company's personnel and in such a manner
as not unreasonably to interfere with the normal operations of the Acquired
Companies. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, (A) no such Person will have access (x) to personnel records of the
Company and any of its Subsidiaries relating to individual performance or
evaluation records, medical histories or other information which in the
Company's good faith opinion is sensitive or the disclosure of which could
subject any Acquired Company to risk of liability or (y) for purposes of
conducting any environmental sampling or testing except with the Company's
prior written consent, and (B) the Company will not be required to disclose to
Buyer or its counsel, financial advisors, auditors and other authorized
Representatives any information if doing so (x) could violate any contract or
Applicable Law to which any Acquired Company is a party or is subject or (y)
it believes in good faith based on advice of counsel could result in a loss of
the ability to successfully assert a claim of privilege (including the
attorney-client and work product privileges), provided, however, that the
Company shall promptly communicate to Buyer or its applicable Representatives
the substance of any such materials, whether by redacting parts of such
materials or otherwise, so that disclosure would not violate such
confidentiality



Active 37496756.2 47

* * *



obligations or cause the loss of privilege with respect thereto, and otherwise
shall make all reasonable and appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements.
Subject to compliance with Applicable Laws, from the date hereof until the
Effective Time, the Company shall confer from time to time as requested by
Buyer with one or more Representatives of Buyer to discuss any material
changes or developments in the operational matters of the Acquired Companies
and the general status of the ongoing operations of the Acquired Companies.
Buyer hereby acknowledges and agrees that all information and access provided
hereunder shall be subject to the terms and conditions of that certain
Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of December 8, 2017, by and between GGPE
and Buyer (the "Confidentiality Agreement") and that Buyer will abide by the
terms of the Confidentiality Agreement with respect thereto.

Section 5.03 Data Room CD ROM. As promptly as practicable (and in any event
not more than two (2) Business Days) after the date hereof, the Company will
deliver or cause to be delivered to Buyer four copies on CD ROM of all the
documents posted to the Data Room on or before March 22, 2018 in a manner
fully readable by Buyer and not removed prior to the execution of this
Agreement.

Section 5.04 Insurance Policy. In connection with the Insurance Policy, the
Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with Buyer,
including using such efforts to provide, as promptly as practicable, financial
and other information relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the
applicable insurance brokers or carriers, including information regarding the
business, operations, financial projections and prospects of the Company and
its Subsidiaries, that is customary for the underwriting of such policies or
reasonably necessary for the issuance of the Insurance Policy.

Section 5.05 Cooperation with Financing and Financial Reporting. The Company
shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their respective officers,
managers, employees, consultants, counsel, accountants, agents, advisors and
other representatives to, use its and their commercially reasonable efforts to
provide such cooperation as may be reasonably requested by Buyer in connection
with the arrangement of the Debt Financing to be consummated in connection
with the Merger and the Contemplated Transactions, including using such
efforts to (a) provide, or cause to be provided, to Buyer customarily and
readily available information to assist in Buyer's preparation of customary
marketing materials reasonably deemed necessary by Buyer to complete the
syndication of such financial arrangement (including, but not limited to,
audited and unaudited historical financial statements of the Company and its
Subsidiaries but excluding pro forma financial statements or pro forma
adjustments related to any such financial arrangement) and assist in Buyer's
preparation of a customary confidential information memorandum to be used in
connection with the syndication of such financial arrangement, (b) participate
in a reasonable number of (x) meetings of prospective lenders at the times and
locations mutually agreed upon (and to the extent necessary, one or more
conference calls with prospective lenders in addition to any such meetings)
and (y) due diligence sessions and road shows in connection with the Debt
Financing, (c) furnish Buyer or MergerSub and the Financing Sources as
promptly as reasonably practicable with the Required Information, (d) obtain

assist Buyer in obtaining



Active 37496756.2 48

* * *



any corporate credit and family ratings from any ratings agencies contemplated
by the Debt Commitment Letter, and (f) assist the Financing Sources in
benefitting from the existing lending relationships of the Company and its
Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 5.05
shall require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective directors, officers, managers or employees to (i) take any action
in respect of any such financial arrangement to the extent that such action
would cause any condition to Closing set forth in Article 8 to fail to be
satisfied by the Outside Date or otherwise result in a breach of this
Agreement or any other Contractual Obligation to which the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries is a party; (ii) execute, deliver or perform any letter,
agreement, document or certificate in connection with any such financial
arrangement (except customary borrowing notices) or take any corporate action
(including adopting resolutions approving the agreements, documents and
instruments pursuant to which any such financial arrangement is obtained)
prior to the Closing Date; (iii) pay any commitment fee or other fee or
payment to obtain consent or incur any liability or obligation with respect to
or cause or permit any Lien to be placed on any of their respective assets in
connection with any such financial arrangement prior to the Closing Date; or
(iv) provide any legal opinion or other opinion of counsel or any information
that would, in its good faith opinion, result in a violation of Applicable Law
or loss of attorney-client privilege prior to the Closing Date in connection
with the Debt Financing. Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company,
its Subsidiaries and their respective representatives from and against any and
all losses, Damages, claims or out-of-pocket costs or expenses directly or
indirectly suffered or incurred by any of them of any type in connection with
the arrangement and consummation of any such financial arrangement and any
information used in connection therewith. The Company acknowledges and
understands that Buyer or its Affiliates may be required to obtain certain
information relating to the Acquired Companies, including audited or unaudited
financial statements, and disclose such information in registration statements
and other documents filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
under the federal securities laws or in disclosure documents provided to
investors or lenders in certain securities offerings or other financings. The
Company agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to provide such
cooperation as may be reasonably requested by Buyer in the preparation of any
such information, and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause its
Affiliates, accountants, counsel and other agents and representatives to
cooperate fully and promptly, with Buyer in connection therewith. The Company
consents to the limited use of the Company's and its Subsidiaries' names and
logos in connection with written marketing materials to be used in arranging
the Debt Financing; provided that, in no event shall such names and logos be
used in a manner that is intended to harm or disparage the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or the reputation or goodwill of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries.

Section 5.06 280G Approvals. To the extent determined to be necessary by Buyer
in its reasonable judgment in consultation with the Company and the
Stockholders' Representative, prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall (a)
use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain from each "disqualified
individual" (as defined in Section 280G(c) of the Code) a waiver by such
individual of any and all payments (or other benefits) contingent on the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (within the
meaning of Section 280G(b)(2)(A)(i) of the Code) to the extent necessary so
that such payments and benefits would not be "excess parachute payments" under
Section 280G of the Code (any such waivers that are in fact obtained are
referred to herein as the "Obtained Waivers") and (b) submit to the
Stockholders for a vote all such waived payments



Active 37496756.2 49

* * *



in a manner such that, if such vote is adopted by the Stockholders in a manner
that satisfies the stockholder approval requirements under Section
280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and regulations promulgated thereunder, no payment
received by such "disqualified individual" would be a "parachute payment"
under Section 280G(b) of the Code. Such vote shall establish the "disqualified
individual's" right to the payment or other compensation. In addition, the
Company shall provide adequate disclosure to Stockholders entitled to vote of
all material facts concerning all payments that, but for such vote, could be
deemed "parachute payments" to any such "disqualified individual" under
Section 280G of the Code in a manner intended to satisfy Section
280G(b)(5)(B)(ii) of the Code and regulations promulgated thereunder. Prior to
the Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to Buyer evidence that (i) a
Stockholder vote was held to approve any payments that would, separately or in
the aggregate, constitute "parachute payments" absent such approval in
conformity with Section 280G of the Code and the regulations promulgated
thereunder, and if the requisite Stockholder approval was obtained with
respect to any payments or benefits that were subject to the Stockholder vote,
then such payments and benefits shall not be deemed "parachute payments" under
Section 280G of the Code (the "280G Approval"), or (ii) the 280G Approval was
not obtained, in which case the Company shall not make or pay any amounts that
were waived under the Obtained Waivers. The Company agrees to provide to Buyer
written drafts of the stockholder disclosure statement, waivers, and
stockholder approval forms that will be provided to disqualified individuals
and Stockholders in advance of delivering such documents to the disqualified
individuals and Stockholders, as applicable, and allow Buyer a reasonable
opportunity to provide comments on such documents.

Section 5.07 Termination of Affiliate Contracts and Transactions. Prior to the
Closing, unless otherwise instructed by Buyer in writing, the Company will,
and will cause each other Acquired Company to, (a) terminate each Contractual
Obligation and transaction required to be set forth on Section 3.15 of the
Disclosure Schedules pursuant to documentation reasonably satisfactory to
Buyer and with no ongoing liability or obligation of the Company or any other
Acquired Company (other than contingent indemnification obligations) and (b)
settle all accounts receivable and accounts payable (excluding ordinary course
expense reimbursements and 401k loans) between any Acquired Company, on one
hand, and any Stockholder or its Affiliates or any director or officer of any
Acquired Company or any Affiliates of such director or officer or employee of
any Acquired Company, on the other hand, in each case pursuant to
documentation reasonably satisfactory to Buyer and with no ongoing liability
or obligation of any Acquired Company.

COVENANTS OF BUYER

Section 6.01 Access. Buyer will, and agrees to cause the Surviving Corporation
and each Company Subsidiary to, preserve and keep all books and records and
all information relating to the accounting, legal, Tax, regulatory, business
and financial affairs of the Acquired Companies and their businesses for a
reasonable period (not less than three years) after the Effective Time, or for
any longer period as may be (a) required by Applicable Law (including any
statute of limitations and applicable extensions thereof) or any Governmental
Authority or (b) reasonably necessary with respect to the prosecution or
defense of any audit or other legal or regulatory action that is then pending
or threatened and with respect to which the Stockholders' Representative has
notified the



Active 37496756.2 50

* * *



Surviving Corporation as to the need to retain such books, records or
information. Buyer will, and agrees to cause the Surviving Corporation and
each Company Subsidiary to, from and after the Effective Time, afford promptly
to the Stockholders' Representative and its counsel, financial advisors,
auditors and other authorized Representatives reasonable access to their
properties, books, records (including Tax records), employees and auditors to
the extent necessary to permit the Stockholders' Representative to determine
any matter relating to its rights and obligations (or the rights and
obligations of any Stockholder) hereunder or relating to any period ending at
or before the Effective Time; provided, that any such access by the
Stockholders' Representative and its counsel, financial advisors, auditors and
other authorized Representatives will not unreasonably interfere with the
conduct of the business of the Surviving Corporation or any such Subsidiary.

Section 6.02 Employees and Offers of Employment. Effective as of the Effective
Time, each employee of the Company and any of its Subsidiaries so employed as
of the Effective Time (including employees not actively at work due to injury,
vacation, military duty, disability or other leave of absence) will remain the
employee of the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries as applicable
(collectively, the "Continuing Employees"). Buyer will, and will cause the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, for the twenty-four (24) month
period following the Effective Time, provide or make available to each
Continuing Employee who remains employed with Buyer or the Surviving
Corporation or its Subsidiaries the following: (i) annual base salary or base
wage rates and incentive compensation opportunities (excluding equity based
compensation) that are no less favorable in the aggregate than those provided
or made available to such Continuing Employee as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time; and (ii) employee benefits that are no less favorable in the
aggregate to the employee benefit plans, programs, arrangements and policies
provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time;
provided, that nothing in this Section 6.02 will require Buyer, the Surviving
Corporation or its Subsidiaries to continue any specific employee benefit plan
during such period.

Section 6.03 Company Employee Plans. Buyer agrees to honor, and to cause the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to honor, the obligations of the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries under the provisions of each
Company Plan required to be set forth in Section 3.12 of the Disclosure
Schedules. Notwithstanding the foregoing in this Section 6.03, no provision of
this Section 6.03 is intended to prevent Buyer or the Surviving Corporation or
its Subsidiaries from amending or terminating any such Company Plan in
accordance with its terms and Applicable Law, so long as Buyer is not in
violation of its obligations set forth in Section 6.02.

Section 6.04 Buyer Employee Plans. Buyer will, or will cause one of its
Affiliates to, credit all service of the Continuing Employees with any
Acquired Company, or any predecessor entity thereto (but only to the extent
that service with such predecessor is recognized under a Company Plan), prior
to the Effective Time for all purposes (including for purposes of
participation, coverage, vesting and level of benefits but not for purposes of
benefit accrual under any defined benefit plan) under all employee benefit
plans of Buyer or its Affiliates (collectively, "Buyer Benefit Plans") in
which the Continuing Employees may be eligible to participate after the
Effective Time. Buyer will use its reasonable best efforts to cause such Buyer
Benefit Plans to provide credit for any co-payments or deductibles and maximum
out-of-pocket payments made by Continuing Employees under the corresponding
employee plan during the plan year in which the Closing occurs



Active 37496756.2 51

* * *



and waive all pre-existing condition exclusions and waiting periods, other
than to the extent of limitations or waiting periods that had not been
satisfied under the corresponding employee plan. Buyer will recognize, or
cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to recognize, vacation
days previously accrued and reserved for by the Acquired Companies immediately
prior to the Effective Time under the corresponding employee plan.

Section 6.05 Limitation of Rights. Nothing in Section 6.02, Section 6.03 or
Section 6.04, express or implied, is intended to confer upon any Person not a
party hereto any right, benefit, or remedy of any nature whatsoever, including
any right to employment or continued employment for any period of time by
reason of this Agreement, or any right to a particular term or condition of
employment. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, no provision in this Agreement is intended to, or does, constitute
the establishment of, or an amendment to, any Employee Plan.

Section 6.06 Obligations of MergerSub and Surviving Corporation. Buyer agrees
to cause MergerSub to perform its obligations under this Agreement and to
consummate the Merger on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement.
From and after the Effective Time, Buyer agrees to cause the Surviving
Corporation to perform its obligations under this Agreement.

Section 6.07 Director and Officer Liability. Buyer will cause the Surviving
Corporation, and the Surviving Corporation hereby agrees, to do the following:

(a) From and after the Effective Time until the sixth (6th) anniversary
thereof, the Surviving Corporation will indemnify and hold harmless the
present (as of the Effective Time) and former officers and directors of the
Company and each of its Subsidiaries in respect of any acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior
to, at or after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted by the
DGCL or any other Applicable Laws and as provided under the certificate of
incorporation, bylaws or similar Organizational Documents of the Acquired
Companies as in effect on the date hereof; provided, that the Surviving
Corporation will not be liable for any settlement effected without the
Surviving Corporation's prior written consent (which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned).

(b) From and after the Effective Time until the sixth (6th) anniversary
thereof, Buyer will cause the Organizational Documents of the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries, or any successor to the Surviving
Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries, to contain provisions that are no less
favorable with respect to indemnification, advancement of costs and
exculpation of former or present directors and officers than as are set forth
in the applicable governing documents of the Acquired Companies as of the date
of this Agreement.

(c) Prior to the Closing, the Company will obtain and fully pay for "tail"
insurance policies to continue the coverage under the existing director and
officer liability insurance policy (or a policy substantially similar thereto)
for a period of six (6) years from the Closing with the same coverage and
amount and containing terms and conditions that are not less advantageous to
the directors and officers of the Acquired Companies as the Company's existing
policy with respect to claims arising out of or relating to events which
occurred before or at the Effective Time (including in connection with the
Contemplated Transactions) (the "Tail Policy"). The Company will bear the



Active 37496756.2 52

* * *



cost of the Tail Policy, and such costs, to the extent not paid prior to
Closing, will be included in the determination of Closing Transaction
Expenses. During the term of the Tail Policy, Buyer will not (and will cause
the Surviving Corporation not to) take any action following the Closing Date
to cause the Tail Policy to be cancelled or any provision therein to be
amended or waived; provided, that none of Buyer, the Surviving Corporation or
any Affiliate thereof will be required to pay any premiums or other amounts in
respect of the Tail Policy.

(d) If Buyer, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors
or assigns consolidates with or merges into any other Person and will not be
the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger, or transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision will be
made so that the successors and assigns of Buyer or the Surviving Corporation,
as the case may be, will readily assume the obligations set forth in this
Section 6.07.

(e) The rights of each Person subject to indemnification under this Section
6.07 will be in addition to any rights such Person may have under the
certificate of incorporation, bylaws or similar Organizational Documents of
the Acquired Companies, or under the DGCL or any other Applicable Law or under
any agreement of any such Person with any Acquired Company. These rights will
survive consummation of the Merger and are intended to benefit, and will be
enforceable by, each such Person.

COVENANTS OF BUYER, MERGERSUB AND THE COMPANY

Section 7.01 Closing Efforts.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Buyer, MergerSub
and the Company will use all of their respective reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary or desirable under Applicable Law or otherwise to cause all
conditions to closing hereunder to be satisfied and to consummate and make
effective the Merger and the Contemplated Transactions, including making all
necessary registrations and filings (including filings under the HSR Act and
any other Applicable Law) with any Governmental Authority, and obtaining all
necessary Approvals from, and taking all steps to avoid any action or
proceeding by, any Governmental Authority. Each of Buyer, MergerSub and the
Company agrees to execute and deliver all such other documents, certificates,
agreements and other writings and to take all such other actions as may be
necessary or desirable in order to consummate or implement expeditiously the
Merger and the Contemplated Transactions. Without limiting the foregoing, the
Company will, upon receipt of written request from Buyer, use commercially
reasonable efforts (excluding any obligation to pay money or make any material
financial accommodation) to obtain prior to the Closing all Approvals in
respect of Disclosed Contracts described in Section 3.03(b)(iv) of the
Disclosure Schedules. Notwithstanding the foregoing in this Section 7.01, none
of the Acquired Companies will be obligated to make any payments or otherwise
pay any consideration to any third party to obtain any applicable Approval.

(b) To the extent required, promptly upon execution and delivery of this
Agreement, each of Buyer, MergerSub and the Company will use its reasonable
best efforts to promptly prepare

later than ten (10) Business Days after the date of this Agreement, with the
appropriate Governmental Authorities, a notification with respect to the
Contemplated Transactions pursuant to the HSR Act, in which each requests
early termination of the waiting period thereunder, and any other applicable
antitrust or competition legal requirements (collectively, "Other Regulatory
Laws"), supply all information requested by Governmental Authorities in
connection with the HSR Act notification and such other filings under Other
Regulatory Laws and cooperate with each other in responding to any such
request. Buyer will be solely responsible for all filing fees required to be
paid in connection therewith. Each of Buyer, MergerSub and the Company will
furnish to the other and, upon request, to any Governmental Authorities such
information and assistance as may be reasonably requested in connection with
the foregoing, including by responding promptly to and complying fully with
any request for additional information or documents under the HSR Act or Other
Regulatory Laws.

(c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the efforts referred to above in
this Section 7.01, if any objections are asserted with respect to the
Contemplated Transactions under the HSR Act or Other Regulatory Laws, or if
any action, suit or proceeding is instituted (or threatened to be instituted)
by the Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division of the United States
Department of Justice or any other Governmental Authority or any third party
challenging the Contemplated Transactions or that would otherwise prohibit or
materially impair or materially delay the consummation of such transactions,
each party hereto will use its reasonable best efforts to resolve any such
objections or actions, suits or proceedings so as to permit the consummation
of the Contemplated Transactions as expeditiously as possible. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, however, in no event will Buyer or any of its Affiliates be
required to agree to (i) divest, offer for sale, abandon, hold separate or
otherwise dispose of all or any portion of any property or other assets
(tangible or intangible) or businesses, or the operations of any such property
or other asset or business, or (ii) become subject to any limitations on their
respective rights to control, operate or exercise the full rights of ownership
of any such assets (tangible or intangible), businesses, or operations of any
such assets, including, in each case, the assets, properties and businesses of
Buyer and its Affiliates and the assets purchased hereunder and the operations
thereof from and after the Closing.

Section 7.02 Public Announcements. The Company, the Stockholders'
Representative and Buyer agree to communicate with each other and cooperate
with each other prior to any public disclosure of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Without the consent of the others, which
consent will not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned, neither the
Company, nor the Stockholders' Representative nor Buyer will issue or make any
report, statement or release to the public (including employees, customers and
suppliers of the parties), whether or not in response to an inquiry, with
respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, except for
any SEC filings or other filings or disclosures required by Applicable Law or
stock exchange requirement (provided, that, to the extent practicable, the
party required to make any such filing will have afforded the other parties,
for a reasonable period prior to the making of such filing, a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment upon the intended form and substance of such
filing). The parties shall agree on a form of initial press release announcing
the Contemplated Transactions.

Section 7.03 Confidentiality. Buyer and MergerSub will treat, and will cause
their respective Affiliates, counsel, accountants and other advisors and
Representatives to treat all nonpublic information of the Acquired Companies
obtained in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby as confidential in accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement. The terms of the Confidentiality Agreement are hereby incorporated
by reference and will continue in full force and effect until the Closing, at
which time such Confidentiality Agreement will terminate. If this Agreement
is, for any reason, terminated prior to the Closing, the Confidentiality
Agreement will continue in full force and effect as provided in Section 9.02
in accordance with its terms.

Section 7.04 Tax Matters.

(a) In the case of a Straddle Period, the amount of any Taxes of the Acquired
Companies not based upon or measured by income, activities, events, the level
of any item, gain, receipts, proceeds, profits or similar items for the Pre-
Closing Tax Period will be deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for the
entire Tax period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the
number of days in the Tax period ending on and including the Closing Date and
the denominator of which is the number of days in such Straddle Period. The
amount of any other Taxes for a Straddle Period that relate to the Pre-Closing
Tax Period will be determined based on an interim closing of the books as of
the close of business on the Closing Date; provided, however, that any item
determined on an annual or periodic basis (such as deductions for depreciation
or real estate Taxes) shall be apportioned on a daily basis. Any franchise Tax
paid or payable with respect to any Acquired Company shall be allocated to the
taxable period during which the gross receipts, income, operations, assets,
margin, or capital comprising the base of such Tax is measured, regardless of
whether the right to do business for another period is obtained by the payment
of such franchise Tax, and if the taxable period to which such franchise Tax
is so allocated is a Straddle Period, then such franchise Tax allocated to a
Straddle Period shall be determined in the manner set forth in the immediately
preceding sentence of this Section 7.04(a).

(b) Subject to the last sentence of this Section 7.04(b), after the Closing,
the Stockholders, jointly and severally, will indemnify, defend and hold the
Buyer Covered Parties harmless from and will reimburse the Buyer Covered
Parties for any and all Damages, directly or indirectly, to the extent
resulting from, relating to, arising out of, or attributable to any and all
(i) Taxes (or the non-payment thereof) of, or attributable to, any Acquired
Company for any Tax period (or portion thereof) ending on or prior to the
Closing Date (in the case of any Straddle Period, determined in the manner set
forth in Section 7.04(a)); (ii) to the extent not otherwise included or
covered in (i), Taxes arising from the payment of Transaction Expenses or from
any inclusions by the Acquired Companies under Section 965 of the Code (or any
analogous or similar provision under any state or foreign Tax Applicable Law);
and (iii) Taxes for which any Acquired Company becomes liable by reason of (A)
being a member of an affiliated, combined, consolidated, unitary, or aggregate
group at any time prior to the Closing, including pursuant to Treasury
Regulations Section 1.1502-6 or any analogous or similar provision under any
state, local, or foreign Tax Applicable Law, (B) being a successor-in-interest
or transferee of any other Person, by contract, any Applicable Law, or
otherwise, which Taxes relate to an event or transaction occurring prior to
the Closing, or (C) having an express or implied obligation to indemnify any
other Person under



Active 37496756.2 55

* * *



any Tax sharing, allocation, indemnity, or similar agreement that was executed
or in effect at any time prior to the Closing; provided, however, only if and

for and on behalf of each such Stockholder for purposes of

actions contemplated to be taken by the Stockholders' Representative under
this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement and such other actions on behalf of
such Stockholders as it may deem necessary or appropriate in connection with
or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, including
(i) taking all actions and making all filings on behalf of such Stockholders
with any Governmental Authority or other Person necessary to effect the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Escrow
Agreement, (ii) agreeing to, negotiating, entering into settlements and
compromises of, complying with orders of courts with respect to, and otherwise
administering and handling any claims under this Agreement or the Escrow
Agreement on behalf of such Stockholders, (iii) negotiating and executing any
waivers or amendments of this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement (provided,
that any amendment that will adversely and disproportionately affect the
rights or obligations of any Stockholder as compared to other Stockholders
will require the prior written consent of such Stockholder) and (iv) taking
all other actions that are either necessary or appropriate in its judgment for
the accomplishment of the foregoing or contemplated by the terms of this
Agreement or the Escrow Agreement. The Stockholders' Representative will have
no authority or power to act on behalf of the Company. The Stockholders'
Representative hereby accepts such appointment.

(b) A decision, act, consent or instruction of the Stockholders'
Representative hereunder will constitute a decision, act, consent or
instruction of all Stockholders and will be final, binding and conclusive upon
each of such Stockholders, and the Escrow Agent and Buyer may rely upon any
such decision, act, consent or instruction of the Stockholders' Representative
as being the decision, act, consent or instruction of each and every such
Stockholder. The Escrow Agent and Buyer will be relieved from any liability to
any Person for any acts done by them in accordance with such decision, act,
consent or instruction of the Stockholders' Representative. In particular,
notwithstanding any notice received by Buyer, MergerSub or the Surviving
Corporation to the contrary, Buyer, MergerSub and the Surviving Corporation
will be fully protected in relying upon and will be entitled to rely upon, and
will have no liability to the Stockholders with respect to actions, decisions
or determinations of the Stockholders' Representative. Any payments made, in
accordance with the Stockholders' Representative's request and instruction, by
Buyer or the Surviving Corporation pursuant to the terms of this Agreement
will fully discharge Buyer and the Surviving Corporation from any liability to
any Stockholders in connection with such payment, as fully and completely as
if such payment had been made directly to such Stockholder. Buyer, MergerSub
and the Surviving Corporation will be entitled to assume that all actions,
decisions and determinations of the Stockholders' Representative are fully
authorized. The Stockholders' Representative will not be entitled to receive
any compensation, directly or indirectly, from Buyer, MergerSub or the
Surviving Corporation in connection with performing its functions as the
Stockholders' Representative under this Agreement.

sole discretion, from the Stockholders' Representative Fund Property, prior to
any distribution to the Stockholders, (i) the Stockholders' Representative's
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including fees and charges of counsel,
accountants or other agents) incurred in serving in that capacity and (ii) any
amounts to which it is entitled pursuant to the indemnification provision in
paragraph (e) of this Article 10 (each item in clauses (i) and (ii) of this
paragraph (c) referred to as a "Charge", and



Active 37496756.2 61

* * *



collectively the "Charges"). In the event the amount of the Stockholders'
Representative Fund Property available to satisfy Charges (the "Remaining
Escrow Property") is insufficient to satisfy all Charges, then each
Stockholder will be obligated to pay its Pro Rata Share of the Charges in
excess of the Remaining Escrow Property. The Stockholders' Representative
shall hold the Stockholders' Representative Fund Property on behalf of the
Stockholders as an agent of the Stockholders and shall provide periodic
statements to the Stockholders with respect to the release of any portion of
the Stockholders' Representative Fund Property.

(d) The Stockholders' Representative will incur no liability with respect to
any action taken or suffered by any party in reliance upon any notice,
direction, instruction, consent, statement or other document believed by such
Stockholders' Representative to be genuine and to have been signed by the
proper person (and the Stockholders' Representative will have no
responsibility to determine the authenticity thereof), nor for any other
action or inaction, except its own gross negligence, bad faith or willful
misconduct. In all questions arising under this Agreement or the Escrow
Agreement, the Stockholders' Representative may rely on the advice of outside
counsel, and the Stockholders' Representative will not be liable to any
Stockholder for anything done, omitted or suffered in good faith by the
Stockholders' Representative based on such advice.

(e) The Stockholders will severally (each based on and limited to its Pro Rata
Share) but not jointly indemnify the Stockholders' Representative and hold the
Stockholders' Representative harmless against any loss, liability or expense
incurred without gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct, on the
part of the Stockholders' Representative and arising out of or in connection
with the acceptance or administration of the Stockholders' Representative's
duties hereunder, including the reasonable fees and expenses of any legal
counsel or other agents retained by the Stockholders' Representative.

(f) At any time during the term of the Escrow Agreement, a majority-in-
interest of Stockholders may, by written consent, appoint a new representative
as the Stockholders' Representative. Notice together with a copy of the
written consent appointing such new representative and bearing the signatures
of Stockholders of a majority-in-interest of those Stockholders must be
delivered to Buyer and, if applicable, the Escrow Agent not less than ten (10)
days prior to such appointment. Such appointment will be effective upon the
later of the date indicated in the consent or the date such consent is
received by Buyer and, if applicable, the Escrow Agent; provided, that until
such notice is received, Buyer, MergerSub and the Surviving Corporation will
be entitled to rely on the decisions of the prior Stockholders' Representative
as described in paragraph (b) above. For the purposes of this paragraph (f), a
"majority-in-interest of the Stockholders" will mean Stockholders representing
in the aggregate over 50% of the percentage interests in the Remaining Escrow
Property.

(g) In the event that the Stockholders' Representative becomes unable or
unwilling to continue in its capacity as Stockholders' Representative, or if
the Stockholders' Representative resigns as a Stockholders' Representative, a
majority-in-interest of the Stockholders may, by written consent, appoint a
new representative as the Stockholders' Representative; provided, that in no
event will the Stockholders' Representative resign without the majority-in-
interest of Stockholders having first appointed a new representative as the
Stockholders' Representative. Notice and a copy



Active 37496756.2 62

of the written consent appointing such new representative and bearing the
signatures of a majority-in-interest of the Stockholders must be delivered to
Buyer and, if applicable, the Escrow Agent. Such appointment will be effective
upon the later of the date indicated in the consent or the date such consent
is received by Buyer and, if applicable, the Escrow Agent; provided, that
until such notice is received, Buyer, MergerSub and the Surviving Corporation
will be entitled to rely on the decisions of the prior Stockholders'
Representative as described in paragraph (b) above.

Section 11.04 Waiver of Conflicts Regarding Representation; Non-Assertion of
Attorney Client Privilege. Buyer, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates
(including the Acquired Companies following the Closing) (Buyer and all such
other Persons, "Buyer Related Parties") hereby waives, any claim that Kirkland
and Ellis LLP, Nob Hill Law Group, P.C. or any other legal counsel representing
any of the Acquired Companies prior to the Closing (each, a "Prior Company
Counsel") in connection with this Agreement or its subject matter or the
transactions contemplated hereby ("Pre-Closing Representation") has a conflict
of interest or is otherwise prohibited from representing any Stockholder, the
Stockholders' Representative or any of their respective officers, directors,
members, managers or Affiliates ("Stockholder Related Parties") in any dispute
with any of the Buyer Related Parties or any other matter involving this
Agreement or its subject matter or the transactions contemplated hereby, in
each case, after the Closing Date ("Post-Closing Representation"), even though
the interests of one or more of the Stockholder Related Parties in such
dispute or other matter may be directly adverse to the interests of one or
more of the Buyer Related Parties and even though Prior Company Counsel may
have represented one or more of the Acquired Companies in a matter
substantially related to such dispute or other matter and may be handling
ongoing matters for one or more of the Buyer Related Parties. Buyer, on behalf
of the Buyer Related Parties, hereby covenants and agrees, that, as to all
communications between any Prior Company Counsel, on the one hand, and any
Stockholder Related Parties or any Acquired Company (with respect to the
Acquired Companies, solely prior to the Closing), on the other hand, that
relate in any way to the Pre-Closing Representation, the attorney-client
privilege and the expectation of client confidence shall be owned solely by
and controlled by such Stockholder Related Party (and, in the case of the
Acquired Companies with respect to any matters and disputes adverse to, prior
to the Closing, the Stockholders' Representative), and shall not pass to or be
claimed by any Buyer Related Parties. This Section 11.04 shall survive the
Closing and shall remain in effect. Without limitation of the foregoing, no
Buyer Related Parties may use or rely on any communications described in the
immediately preceding sentence in any claim, dispute, action, suit or
proceeding against or involving any of the Stockholder Related Parties.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if after the Closing a dispute arises between
Buyer or the Acquired Companies, on the one hand, and a third party other than
(and unaffiliated with) any Stockholder Related Party, on the other hand, then
the Company (to the extent applicable) may assert the attorney-client
privilege to prevent disclosure to such third party of confidential
communications by Prior Company Counsel; provided, however, that neither Buyer
nor any Acquired Company may intentionally waive such privilege without the
prior written consent of the Stockholders' Representative, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. Further, no Stockholder
Related Party may intentionally waive the privilege applicable to any
confidential communications between an Acquired Company and Prior Company
Counsel without the prior written consent of Buyer, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. This Section 11.04 is for the
benefit of the Stockholders' Representative and the Stockholder Related
Parties and each Prior Company Counsel, and the Stockholder Related Parties
and each Prior Company Counsel are express third party beneficiaries of this
Section 11.04. This Section 11.04 shall be irrevocable, and no term of this
Section 11.04 may be amended, waived or modified, without the prior written
consent of the Stockholders' Representative and the Prior Company Counsel
affected thereby.

Section 11.05 Successors and Assigns. The provisions of this Agreement will be
binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and assigns;



Active 37496756.2 65

provided, that no party may assign, delegate or otherwise transfer any of its
rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent
of each other party hereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer will be
permitted to assign its rights under this Agreement (i) to an Affiliate of
Buyer and (ii) effective at and after the Closing Date, to any parties
providing the Debt Financing pursuant to the terms thereof for purposes of
creating a security interest herein or otherwise assign as collateral in
respect of such Debt Financing, in each case without obtaining consent from
any other party; provided that no such assignment described in clause (i) or
(ii) above shall relieve Buyer of its obligations hereunder.

Section 11.06 Governing Law. This Agreement will be governed by and construed
in accordance with the law of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to
any choice or conflict of law provision or rule that would cause the
application of the domestic substantive laws of any other jurisdiction.

Section 11.07 Jurisdiction.

(a) Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, each party to
this Agreement, by its execution hereof, (i) hereby irrevocably submits to the
exclusive jurisdiction of the United States District Court located in the
State of Delaware and the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware located
in Wilmington, Delaware for the purpose of any action, claim, cause of action
or suit (in contract, tort or otherwise), in any way arising out of or

this Agreement or the subject matter hereof may not be enforced in or by such
court and (iii) hereby agrees not to commence or prosecute any such action,
claim, cause of action or suit other than before one of the above-named
courts, nor to make any motion or take any other action seeking or intending
to cause the transfer or removal of any such action, claim, cause of action or
suit to any court other than one of the above-named courts, whether on the

service of process in any such proceeding in any manner permitted by Delaware
law, and further consents to service of process by nationally recognized
overnight courier service guaranteeing overnight delivery, or by registered or
certified mail, return receipt requested, at its address specified pursuant to

Section 11.10 Specific Performance. The parties hereby expressly recognize and
acknowledge that immediate, extensive and irreparable damage would result, no
adequate remedy at law would exist, and damages would be difficult to
determine in the event that any provision of this Agreement is not performed
in accordance with its specific terms or otherwise breached. Therefore, in
addition to, and not in limitation of, any other remedy available to any party
hereto, a party under this Agreement will be entitled to specific performance
of the terms hereof and immediate injunctive relief, without the necessity of
proving the inadequacy of money damages as



Active 37496756.2 69

* * *



a remedy and without bond or other security being required. Such remedies, and
any and all other remedies provided for in this Agreement, will, however, be
cumulative in nature and not exclusive and will be in addition to any other
remedies whatsoever which any party may otherwise have. Each of the parties
hereto hereby acknowledges and agrees that it may be difficult to prove
damages with reasonable certainty, that it may be difficult to procure
suitable substitute performance, and that injunctive relief and/or specific
performance will not cause an undue hardship to the parties. Each of the
parties hereto hereby further acknowledges that the existence of any other
remedy contemplated by this Agreement does not diminish the availability of
specific performance of the obligations hereunder or any other injunctive
relief. Each party hereto hereby further agrees that in the event of any
action by any other party for specific performance or injunctive relief, it
will not assert that a remedy at law or other remedy would be adequate or that
specific performance or injunctive relief in respect of such breach or
violation should not be available on the grounds that money damages are
adequate or any other grounds. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, Buyer and MergerSub shall not be entitled and shall not seek, and in
no event shall this Section 11.10 be used, alone or together with any other
provision of this Agreement, to require the Company to remedy any breach of
any representation or warranty of the Company made herein.

Section 11.11 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, each of which when executed will be deemed to be an original and
all of which together will be deemed to be one and the same instrument binding
upon all of the parties hereto notwithstanding the fact that all parties are
not signatory to the original or the same counterpart. For purposes of this
Agreement, facsimile and pdf signatures will be deemed originals.

Section 11.12 Third Party Beneficiaries; No Recourse Against Third Parties.

(a) No provision of this Agreement is intended to confer upon any Person other
than the parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder; provided however,
that the following Persons are expressly intended as third party beneficiaries
with respect to the following specified sections of this Agreement and will
have the right to enforce such specified sections against the parties to this
Agreement: with respect to Section 6.07, the Persons who are the beneficiaries
of the indemnification under such Section; with respect to Section 2.04,
Section 2.05, Section 2.06, Section 2.12, Section 6.01, Section 7.01, Section
7.02, and Article 9, the Stockholders; with respect to Section 11.12(b), the
Nonparty Affiliates; with respect to Section 11.04, each Prior Company
Counsel; and, with respect to Section 11.12(a) and Section 11.02(c), Section
11.07(b), Section 11.08 and Section 11.18, each Financing Source.

(b) Buyer shall not assert any claim against any Person who is not party to
this Agreement, including without limitation any Stockholders, partners,
members, controlling persons, directors, officers, employees, incorporators,
managers, agents, Representatives, or Affiliates of any party hereto (or any
Affiliate of any of the foregoing) (each a "Nonparty Affiliate" and,
collectively, the "Nonparty Affiliates") and Financing Sources with respect to
matters arising under or relating to this Agreement or the Contemplated
Transactions (including the Debt Financing) or hold or attempt to hold any
Nonparty Affiliate or Financing Source liable for any actual or alleged
inaccuracies, misstatements or omissions with respect to information furnished
by the Company or



Active 37496756.2 70

* * *



such Persons concerning the Business, the Company, this Agreement or the
Contemplated Transactions, to the maximum extent permitted by law.

(c) Notwithstanding the preceding clause (b), Buyer retains the right, and
nothing in this Agreement is intended to, or will have the effect of, waiving
any rights of Buyer, to pursue claims against any Nonparty Affiliate for Fraud
solely to the extent provided in the last sentence of Section 11.09.

Section 11.13 Entire Agreement. This Agreement and the Confidentiality
Agreement constitute the entire agreement between the parties with respect to
the subject matter of this Agreement and supersede all prior agreements and
understandings, both oral and written, between the parties with respect to the
subject matter of this Agreement.

Section 11.14 Severability. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of
this Agreement is held by any Governmental Authority to be invalid, void or
unenforceable, the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and
restrictions of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect and will
in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated so long as the economic or
legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such a determination, the parties
hereto will negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect
the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable
manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as
originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

Section 11.15 Negotiation of Agreement. Each of the parties hereto
acknowledges that it has been represented by independent counsel of its choice
throughout all negotiations that have preceded the execution of this Agreement
and that it has executed the same with consent and upon the advice of said
independent counsel. Each party hereto and its counsel cooperated in the
drafting and preparation of this Agreement and the documents referred to
herein, and any and all drafts relating thereto will be deemed the work
product of the parties and may not be construed against any party by reason of
its preparation. Accordingly, any rule of law or any legal decision that would
require interpretation of any ambiguities in this Agreement against the party
that drafted it is of no application and is hereby expressly waived.

Section 11.16 Schedules; Construction.

(a) Generally. Attached to this Agreement are certain schedules supplementing
the terms and conditions of this Agreement, which schedules are hereby
incorporated into and made a part of this Agreement as if set forth in full
herein. Except solely in the case of the Disclosure Schedules, the provisions
set forth in the schedules shall constitute binding agreements of the parties
hereto and shall be construed to constitute an integral part of this Agreement
and this Agreement and such schedules shall together constitute one and the
same agreement.

(b) Disclosure Schedules. The headings, if any, of the individual sections of
each of the Disclosure Schedules are inserted for convenience only and will
not be deemed to constitute a part thereof or a part of the Agreement. The
Disclosure Schedules are arranged in sections corresponding to those contained
in this Agreement merely for convenience, and the disclosure of an item in one



Active 37496756.2 71

* * *



section of the Disclosure Schedules referenced in Article 3 as an exception to
any particular representation or warranty in Article 3 will be deemed
adequately disclosed as an exception with respect to all other representations
or warranties in Article 3, notwithstanding the presence or absence of an
appropriate section of the Disclosure Schedules with respect to such other
representations or warranties or an appropriate cross-reference thereto;
provided that the relevance of such disclosure to the specific representation
or warranty or a given part of the Disclosure Schedules referenced in Article
3 is reasonably apparent from the face and terms of such disclosure. The mere
inclusion of an item in the Disclosure Schedules as an exception to a
representation or warranty will not be deemed an admission or acknowledgment,
in and of itself and solely by virtue of the inclusion of such information in
the Disclosure Schedules, that such information is required to be listed in
the Disclosure Schedules or that such item (or any non-disclosed item or
information of comparable or greater significance) represents a material
exception or fact, event or circumstance, that such item has had, or is
expected to result in, a Material Adverse Effect, or that such item actually
constitutes noncompliance with, or a violation of, any Applicable Law, Permit
or contract or other topic to which such disclosure is applicable.

Section 11.17 Treatment of Confidential Information.

(a) GGPE, for itself and any other Golden Gate entities, funds and Affiliates,
acknowledges that it has or may have had in the past, currently has and in the
future may have access to Confidential Information of the Acquired Companies
and the Business and Buyer and its Affiliates. GGPE, for itself and any other
Golden Gate entities, funds and Affiliates, agrees that it will, and will
cause all other Golden Gate entities, funds and Affiliates to, keep
confidential all that Confidential Information furnished to Golden Gate and,
except with the specific prior written consent of Buyer, will not disclose
that Confidential Information to any Person except (i) Representatives of
Buyer and (ii) Golden Gate's own Representatives, provided that those
Representatives agree to the confidentiality provisions of this Section 11.17;
provided, however, that, for purposes of this Section 11.17, Confidential
Information does not include such information as (A) is publicly available as
of the date hereof, (B) later becomes known to the public generally through no
fault of Golden Gate, (C) is independently developed by Golden Gate without
reference to or reliance on any information referenced hereunder or (D) is
required to be disclosed by Applicable Law or Governmental Order, provided,
that prior to the disclosure by Golden Gate of any information under this
clause (D), Golden Gate will give prior written notice thereof to Buyer and
provide Buyer with the opportunity to contest that disclosure (to the extent
allowable by the Applicable Law or Governmental Order).

(b) Because of (i) the difficulty of measuring economic losses as a result of
the breach of the foregoing covenants in Section 11.17(a) and (ii) the
immediate and irreparable damage that would be caused to Buyer for which it
would have no other adequate remedy, in the event of a breach or threatened
breach by Golden Gate of the provisions of this Section 11.17 with respect to
any Confidential Information, Buyer will be entitled to an injunction
restraining Golden Gate from disclosing, in whole or in part, that
Confidential Information. Nothing herein shall be construed as prohibiting
Buyer from pursuing any other available remedy for such breach or threatened
breach, including the recovery of damages.

Section 11.18 Provisions Related to Financing Sources. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, each of the Company and the Stockholders'
Representative agrees that neither it, nor any of its former, current or
future representatives, Affiliates, successors or assigns (collectively,
"Seller Related Parties"), shall have any claim against any Financing Source
participating in the Debt Financing or any of their respective former, current
or future representatives, Affiliates, successors or assigns (collectively,
"Financing Related Parties"), nor shall any Financing Related Party have any
liability whatsoever to the Company, the Stockholders' Representative or any
Seller Related Party, in connection with the Debt Financing or in any way
relating to this Agreement or any of the Contemplated Transactions, whether at
law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise, in each case, whether
arising, in whole or in part, out of comparative, contributory or sole
negligence by any Financing Related Party. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing
contained herein is intended to, nor shall it, result in the waiver of any
rights or privileges of Buyer, the Company or their respective Affiliates
under the documents entered into in connection with the Debt Financing.
