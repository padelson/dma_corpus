 ** **

  

This Purchase Agreement and Escrow Instructions (this " **Agreement**
"), dated September 19, 2005 for reference purposes only, is made by and
between KERASOTES SHOWPLACE THEATRES, LLC, a Delaware limited liability
company (" **Seller** "), and REALTY INCOME CORPORATION, a Maryland
corporation (" **Buyer** "), and is made with reference to the recitals set
forth below, and constitutes (i) a contract of purchase and sale between the
parties and (ii) escrow instructions to STEWART TITLE GUARANTY COMPANY ("
**Title Company** ").

  



  

 **RECITALS**

  



  

A. _Properties_. Seller, or one or more wholly-owned subsidiaries controlled
by Seller, owns seventeen (17) certain real properties, together with all
improvements located thereon and appurtenances thereunto belonging, which
real properties are identified on the " **Property List** ," attached hereto
and incorporated herein as _Exhibit "A."_  The terms " **Property** " and "
**Properties** " as used in this Agreement (i) shall mean certain or all (as
the context may require) of the real properties identified on the Property
List, and (ii) shall not include any of Sellers furniture, trade fixtures
(including without limitation any theater seats), equipment, machinery,
furnishings, face plates of signage and other articles of movable property at
the Properties as may be deemed necessary or desirable by Seller for the
conduct of Sellers business at the Properties under each Lease (as defined
below).

  



  

B. _Purchase and Sale_. Seller desires to sell all of Sellers right, title
and interest in and to the Properties upon the terms and conditions set forth
below. Buyer desires to purchase all of Sellers right, title, and interest
in and to the Properties upon the terms and conditions set forth below.

  



  

C. _Leasehold Interest_. Concurrently with the Closing (as defined in Section
8), Buyer, as landlord, shall lease the Properties to Seller, as tenant,
pursuant to certain Land and Building Lease Agreements (each, a " **Lease** ")
which Lease shall be in form and substance acceptable to Landlord and Tenant.

  



  

# **1.** PURCHASE PRICE

  

# ** **

  

In consideration of the covenants contained in this Agreement, Seller shall
sell and Buyer shall purchase the Properties for a total purchase price TWO
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS ($200,000,000) (" **Purchase Price** ") which shall
be delivered by Buyer to Title Company on or before the Closing in Cash
(defined as an amount credited by wire transfer into Title Companys
bank account). The portion of the Purchase Price allocated to each of the
Properties (" **Individual Purchase Price** ") is listed on " _Exhibit "A_."
Buyer reserves the right to reallocate the Individual Purchase Prices among
the Properties at any time prior to the Closing subject to Sellers consent,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

# **2.** OPENING OF ESCROW

  

# ** **

  

Within two (2) business days following the execution of this Agreement, Buyer
and Seller shall open an escrow (" **Escrow** ") with Title Company for the
Properties and shall deposit with Title Company fully executed
counterparts of this Agreement for use as escrow instructions. Buyer and
Seller shall execute Title Companys usual form of supplemental escrow
instructions for transactions of this type; provided, however, that such
escrow instructions shall be for the purpose of implementing this Agreement,
shall incorporate this Agreement by reference, and shall specifically provide
that no provisions shall have the effect of modifying this Agreement unless
it is so expressly stated and initialed on behalf of Buyer and Seller.

  



  

# **3.** TITLE TO PROPERTIES

  

# ** **

  

At Closing, Seller shall convey to Buyer fee simple title to the Properties
by execution and delivery of deeds (" **Deeds** ") for the Properties in the
forms customarily used in connection with commercial real
property transactions in the states and counties in which the Properties are
situated (which Deeds shall specifically exclude any and all trade fixtures,
including without limitation theater seats **,** at the Properties). At the
Closing Buyer shall receive from Title Company an ALTA Owners Extended
Policy of Title Insurance (" **Title Policy** ") with liability in the
full amount of the Individual Purchase Price insuring fee simple title to
each of the Properties in Buyer, subject only to exceptions approved by Buyer
as provided in Section 4.1, together with such endorsements as may be
reasonably requested by Buyer, including, without limitation survey, access,
owners comprehensive and contiguity (these four (4) endorsements being
referred to herein as the " **Endorsements** "). Indemnification of the Title
Company to induce it to insure any otherwise non-permitted exception to title
except for (1) matters that can be satisfied by the payment of money, and (2)
matters which individually or in the aggregate are not expected to affect
adversely the operation or use of any Property as a theater, shall not be
allowed except with the prior written consent of Buyer not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed, after full disclosure to Buyer of the
nature and substance of such exception and indemnity. The Title Policy shall
provide survey coverage and shall provide full coverage against mechanics
and materialmens liens arising out of the construction, repair or alteration
of any of improvements located on the Properties.

# **15.** COVENANTS

  

# ** **

  

Matters as to which Title Company need not be concerned, Seller and Buyer
covenant and agree with one another as follows:

  



  

15.1 _Indemnification by Parties; Damage Deductible and Cap_.

  



  

Each party shall indemnify the other party and hold the other party harmless
from and against any and all claims, demands, liabilities, liens, costs,
expenses, penalties, damages, and losses, including, without limitation,
reasonable attorneys fees and costs, suffered as a direct or indirect result
of:

  



  

### 15.1.1 Any misrepresentation, breach of warranty, or breach of covenant
made pursuant to this Agreement or in any document, certificate, or exhibit
given or delivered pursuant to or in connection with this Agreement; and

  

### 

  

### 15.1.2 Any and all obligations, liabilities, claims, liens, or
encumbrances, whether direct, contingent, or consequential and no matter how
arising or accruing, which are in any way related to or arising from any act,
conduct, omission, contract, or commitment of a party (or any of its agents
or employees) at any time or times before the Closing. The provisions of this
Section shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the
delivery of the Deeds, and transfer of title.

  

### 

  

### 15.1.3 Buyer shall indemnify and hold Seller harmless from and against
any and all claims, demands, damages, losses, liabilities, costs and expenses
(including reasonable attorneys, accountants, consultants and expert
witness fees) arising out of or in connection with any claimed damage to or
loss of property or injury to persons, arising out of or in connection with
any inspection by Buyer or its representatives of any of the Properties prior
to the Closing. Such obligation shall survive the closing or termination of
this Agreement.

  



  

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Buyer shall not be
entitled to reimbursement for and Seller shall not have any responsibility to
the extent of any misrepresentation, breach or other items described in
Section 15.1.1 or Section 15.1.2, above, except and to the extent that the
aggregate damage to Buyer resulting from all such items is in excess of
$500,000; and in no event shall Sellers aggregate liability for all such
misrepresentation, breaches or other obligations exceed the sum of
$3,000,000.

  



  

17   

     
   

  



  

15.2 _Maintenance_

  



  

Between the Sellers execution of this Agreement and the Closing, Seller
shall, at Sellers sole cost and expense, maintain the Properties in good
order, condition, and repair, reasonable wear and tear excepted, and shall
operate the Properties in the same manner as before the making of this
Agreement as though Seller were retaining the Properties.

  



  

15.3 _Ordinary Course_

  



  

Pending the Closing, Seller shall operate its business in the ordinary
course. After Buyer has approved or waived the items described in Section 4,
Seller shall not enter into or terminate any contracts or agreements of a
material pertaining to the Properties without in each case obtaining Buyers
prior written consent thereto, not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed.

  



  

15.4 _Closing After Breach by Seller_

  



  

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, in the
event Buyer shall become aware, prior to Closing, of a breach of a
representation, warranty, covenant or obligation of Seller, or other
condition to Buyers obligations hereunder, then, unless the same shall be
the result of Sellers gross negligence or deliberately wrongful act or
omission or fraud upon Buyer, Buyers remedy shall be limited to (i)
termination of this Agreement and the receipt of the return of Buyers
Earnest Money Deposit, or (ii) proceeding to close without adjusting the
Purchase Price, in which event Seller shall have no further responsibility to
Buyer with regard to such breach or condition.

  



  

# **16.** LOSS BY FIRE OR OTHER CASUALTY; CONDEMNATION

  



  

16.1 _Damage or Destruction_

  



  

In the event that any of the improvements on the Properties are damaged or
destroyed by fire or other casualty prior to the Closing, then Seller may
terminate this Agreement as to each damaged or destroyed Property, or may
agree to restore and repair such damage, either before or after the Closing.
 Termination shall be by written notice to Buyer within five (5) days after
the occurrence of the damage or destruction. Buyer shall have no obligation to
accept Sellers offer to restore or repair such damage if such restoration
and repair would cause the Closing Date to be extended.  If the restoration
or repair shall take place after the Closing, a portion of the proceeds of
sale equal to the estimated cost of such restoration or repair, shall be held
in escrow by Escrow until Seller has completed the restoration or repair to
the reasonable satisfaction of Buyer. Seller shall pay escrow and title costs,
if any, that exist as a result of terminating this Agreement under this
Section.

  



  

18   

     
   

  



  

16.2 _Condemnation_

  



  

In the event that prior to the Closing a governmental entity shall threaten
or commence any condemnation proceeding to take any portion of the
Properties, Buyer shall have the option to make either of the following
elections:

  



  

### 16.2.1 Terminate this Agreement by written notice to Seller within five
(5) days of its receiving notice of such action of condemnation; or

  

### 

  

### 16.2.2 Proceed with the transaction in which case the Purchase Price
shall not be reduced and Buyer shall be entitled to the net award paid to
Seller or Sellers mortgagee for the taking, if any, and Seller shall assign
and transfer to Buyer all right, title, and interest in and to any awards.

  

###
