ARTICLE II

PURCHASE AND SALE OF SHARES

Section 2.1. _Purchase and Sale_. At the Closing, upon the terms and subject
to the conditions of this Agreement, Seller shall sell, transfer, assign,
convey and deliver to Purchaser, and Purchaser shall purchase and accept from
Seller, the Shares for the Purchase Price.

Section 2.2. _Purchase Price_.

(a) Subject to withholding pursuant to Section 2.2(b) and the adjustments
pursuant to Section 2.3, the purchase price (the " _Purchase Price_ ") to be
paid to Seller for the Shares shall be U.S.$442,000,000.



 

8 (b) Prior to the Closing, Seller shall obtain and deliver to Purchaser a
certificate issued by the Tax Authority pursuant to Section 116(2) of the ITA
(a " _Section 116 Certificate_ ") which shall specify a "certificate limit"
(as defined in Section 116(2) of the ITA) that is no less than the Purchase
Price. If Seller does not deliver a Section 116 Certificate prior to the
Closing, (i) Purchaser shall be entitled to withhold part of the Purchase
Price as required by Section 116(5) of the ITA (the " _Withholding Amount_ ")
and (ii) Purchaser and Seller shall be required to enter into the Section 116
Escrow Agreement.

Section 2.3.  _Purchase Price Adjustment_.

(a) No less than five Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall
deliver to Purchaser an unaudited balance sheet of the Company and its
Subsidiaries based on the prior months ending balance sheet (the " _Estimated
Closing Date Balance Sheet_ "), together with Sellers good faith estimation
of the Net Equity as of the anticipated Closing Date (the " _Estimated Net
Equity_ "). If, during Sellers preparation of the Estimated Closing Date
Balance Sheet, Seller determines that the Estimated Net Equity is reasonably
likely to exceed the Target Net Equity by more than $5,000,000 without giving
effect to any cash that has not been distributed out of the Company as a
result of any paid up capital issues or restrictions, Seller shall deliver, no
less than ten Business Days prior to the Closing Date, to Purchaser a draft
of the Estimated Closing Date Balance Sheet and a draft of the calculation of
the Estimated Net Equity, together with such documents, schedules, analyses,
working papers and other materials used by Seller in its preparation of the
Estimated Closing Date Balance Sheet and the Estimated Net Equity, and shall
cooperate with Purchaser in its review thereof. To the extent that a draft of
the Estimated Closing Date Balance Sheet is delivered to Purchaser pursuant
to the immediately preceding sentence, in determining such estimates, Seller
shall consider in good faith any comments or concerns raised by Purchaser in
connection with the draft Estimated Closing Date Balance Sheet and the draft
of the calculation of the Estimated Net Equity. The Estimated Closing Date
Balance Sheet shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP on a basis consistent
with the preparation of the Financial Statements as set forth in _Section
2.3(a) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule _and the Estimated Net Equity shall
be calculated using the procedures set forth in _Section 2.3(a) of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule_. The amount to be paid on the Closing Date (the "
_Estimated Purchase Price_ ") will be equal to the Purchase Price (i) _plus_
the amount by which the Estimated Net Equity exceeds the Target Net Equity or
(ii) _minus_ the amount by which the Target Net Equity exceeds the Estimated
Net Equity.

(b) As promptly as practicable, and in any event within 60 days after the
Closing Date, Seller shall at its expense prepare and deliver to Purchaser an
unaudited balance sheet of the Company and its Subsidiaries (the " _Closing
Date Balance Sheet_ ") as of the close of business on the Closing Date setting
forth its calculation of the Net Equity of the Company as of the Closing Date
(such Net Equity as finally determined in accordance with this Section, the "
_Final Net Equity_ "), together with Sellers final calculation of the Final
Purchase Price. The Closing Date Balance Sheet shall be prepared in
accordance with GAAP on a basis consistent with the preparation of the
Financial Statements, except as set forth in _Section 2.3(a) of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule _and the Final Net Equity and Final Purchase Price shall
be calculated using the procedures and methodologies set forth in _Section
2.3(a) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule_. For purposes of this Agreement, "
_Final Purchase Price_ " means the dollar amount resulting from the sum of
the Purchase Price (i) _plus_ the amount by which the Final Net Equity
exceeds the Target Net Equity or (ii) _minus_ the amount by which the Target
Net Equity exceeds the Final Net Equity, as the case may be. 

(c) Purchaser shall cause the employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries to
assist Seller in the preparation of the Closing Date Balance Sheet and the
calculation of the Final Net Equity and Final Purchase Price and shall provide
Seller and its independent auditors reasonable on-site access during normal
business hours to the personnel, properties, books and records of the Company
and its  



 

9  Subsidiaries solely for such purpose; _provided_ that such access shall be
during normal business hours and shall not unreasonably interfere with
the operation of the Business.

(d) During the 30-day period following Purchasers receipt of the Closing Date
Balance Sheet and Sellers calculation of the Final Net Equity and Final
Purchase Price, Purchaser and its independent auditors shall be permitted to
review and make copies of the working papers of Seller relating to the Closing
Date Balance Sheet and Sellers calculation of the Final Net Equity and Final
Purchase Price. Sellers calculation of the Final Net Equity and Final
Purchase Price shall become final and binding upon the parties on the 30th day
following receipt by Purchaser thereof, unless Purchaser gives written notice
of its disagreement with Sellers calculation of the Final Net Equity and
Final Purchase Price (" _Notice of Disagreement_ ") to Seller prior to such
date. Any Notice of Disagreement shall specify in reasonable detail the
nature of any disagreement so asserted. The calculation of the Final Net
Equity and Final Purchase Price (as revised in accordance with Section 2.3(e),
if a Notice of Disagreement is delivered) shall become final and binding upon
the parties on the first to occur of (i) 5:00 p.m., Toronto time, on the 30th
day following the date of delivery of the Notice of Disagreement, unless prior
to that time Seller shall have notified Purchaser in writing of its objection
to the Notice of Disagreement, (ii) the date Seller and Purchaser agree in
writing on the resolution of any differences they have with respect to all the
matters specified in the Notice of Disagreement and (iii) the date any
disputed matters are finally resolved in writing by the Accounting Firm (as
defined below) pursuant to Section 2.3(e).

(e) During the 30-day period following the receipt by Seller of a Notice of
Disagreement, Seller and Purchaser shall seek in good faith to resolve
differences specified in the Notice of Disagreement. During such period,
Seller and its independent auditors shall have reasonable on-site access
during normal business hours to the personnel, properties, books, records,
schedules, analyses and working papers (subject, if required, to the execution
by Seller of a customary agreement relating to such access) of the Company
and its Subsidiaries and shall be permitted to review and make copies of the
working papers of Purchaser and its independent auditors (if any) relating
only to the Notice of Disagreement. If, at the end of such 30-day period,
Seller and Purchaser have not so resolved such differences, Seller and
Purchaser shall submit to Ernst and Young LLP (the " _Accounting Firm_ ") for
review and resolution any and all matters which remain in dispute. Seller and
Purchaser shall use reasonable efforts to cause the Accounting Firm to render
a decision resolving the matters in dispute within 30 days following the
submission of such matters to the Accounting Firm. Seller and Purchaser agree
that the determination of the Accounting Firm shall be final and binding on
the parties. Except as specified in the following sentence, the fees and
expenses of the Accounting Firm pursuant to this Section 2.3(e) shall be
borne by Seller and Purchaser in inverse proportion as they may prevail on
matters resolved by the Accounting Firm. The proportionate allocations shall
also be calculated by the Accounting Firm at the time the Accounting Firm
resolves the matters in dispute. The fees and expenses of Sellers
independent auditors incurred in connection with the review of any Notice of
Disagreement shall be borne by Seller, and the fees and expenses of
Purchasers independent auditors incurred in connection with their review of
the Closing Date Balance Sheet and the calculation of the Final Net Equity and
Final Purchase Price shall be borne by Purchaser.

(f) If the Estimated Purchase Price is less than the Final Purchase Price,
Purchaser shall, and if the Estimated Purchase Price is greater than the
Final Purchase Price, Seller shall, in either case within 10 Business Days
after the Closing Date Balance Sheet, the Final Net Equity and the Final
Purchase Price become final and binding upon the parties, make payment to the
other party by wire transfer of immediately available funds of the amount of
such difference. The amount payable pursuant to this Section 2.3(f) shall be
subject to reduction as provided in Section 2.3(g). In all cases, the amount
so paid shall be adjusted as appropriate to allow compliance with Section
2.2(b) and Section 116 of the ITA.



 

10 (g) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.3, if the
Closing Date Balance Sheet delivered by Seller pursuant to Section 2.3(b) and
any Notice of Disagreement delivered by Purchaser pursuant to Section 2.3(d)
both reflect a calculation of Final Net Equity and Final Purchase Price that
if correct would require a payment by Purchaser pursuant to Section 2.3(f),
then within 10 days after delivery of the Notice of Disagreement, Purchaser
shall make a payment to Seller, in the manner provided in Section 2.3(f), in
an amount equal to the lesser of (i) the amount payable by Purchaser pursuant
to the calculation reflected in the Closing Date Balance Sheet delivered
pursuant to Section 2.3(b) and (ii) the amount payable by Purchaser pursuant
to the calculation reflected in the Notice of Disagreement. Any amount paid
pursuant to this Section 2.3(g) shall be applied against, and correspondingly
reduce, the amount payable under Section 2.3(f).

Section 2.4. _Closing_. The Closing shall be held at the offices of Fasken
Martineau DuMoulin LLP, Suite 370066 Wellington Street West, Box 20 Toronto
Dominion Centre, Toronto, Ontario, Canada, at 10:00 a.m. local time, on the
second Business Day following the satisfaction or waiver of all conditions set
forth in Article VI (other than conditions that, by their nature, are to be
satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those
conditions) or at such other time or place as Purchaser and Seller mutually
agree, except that in no event shall the Closing take place outside of Canada.
The date of the Closing is referred to in this Agreement as the " _Closing
Date_." The Closing shall be deemed effective at 12:01 a.m., local time, on
the Closing Date.

Section 2.5. _Closing Deliveries by Purchaser_. At the Closing, Purchaser will
deliver or cause to be delivered to Seller:

(a) Subject to Section 2.2(b), the Estimated Purchase Price by wire transfer
of immediately available funds to such account as Seller may direct by
written notice delivered to Purchaser, which written notice shall be delivered
by Seller to Purchaser at least three days prior to the Closing;

(b) duly executed counterparts of the Transaction Documents to which Purchaser
is a party; and

(c) a duly executed certificate referred to in Section 6.3(d).

(a) stock certificates or such other documents evidencing the Shares, in each
case duly endorsed in blank or with a duly executed blank stock power
attached sufficient to vest good and valid title to the Shares in Purchaser

Agreement and the Transaction Documents will not (i) conflict with or result
in a breach of any provision of the certificate of incorporation or bylaws (or
other comparable organizational documents) of Seller, the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, (ii) result in a violation or breach of or constitute a

registered and beneficial owner of the Shares and owns the Shares free and
clear of all Encumbrances and any other rights of others, except for any

corporate power and authority to carry on its business as now being conducted
and to own, use and lease its assets. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries
is duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in good standing (to
the extent such concept is recognized) as a foreign or extra provincial
corporation in every jurisdiction in which such qualification or licensing is
necessary because of the nature of the property owned, leased or operated by

do so would not have a Business Material Adverse Effect. The Company is up to
date in the filing of all corporate and similar returns under the Laws of
every province in Canada except where such failure to be up to date would not
have a Business Material Adverse Effect. Seller has made available to
Purchaser complete and correct copies of the certificate of incorporation,

other rights of any kind to acquire from the Company any shares of capital

warrant, right or security. All issued and outstanding capital stock of each
of the Subsidiaries of the Company is owned by the Company or a Subsidiary of
the Company free and clear of all Encumbrances except for restrictions on
transfer under federal, state and provincial securities Laws or the charter of
the relevant Subsidiary. The Company does not have, directly or indirectly,
any equity interest in any Person other than its Subsidiaries listed in
_Section 3.3 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule _(other than equity interests
held in the ordinary course of Business).

Section 3.7. _Financial Statements_.

(a) The books and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries are true and
correct in all material respects and present fairly and disclose in all
material respects the financial position of the Company and its Subsidiaries
at the relevant dates and all material financial transactions of the Company
and its Subsidiaries have been accurately recorded in such books and records
in all material respects.

(b) _Section 3.7(b) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule _sets forth the audited
financial statements of E*TRADE Canada Securities Corporation, including the
balance sheet as at December 31, 2007, the statements of income, comprehensive
income and retained earnings, and of cash flows for the year ended December

(except to the extent that changes in GAAP require a different treatment or
method than the treatment or method employed for prior periods) and fairly
presents in all material respects the financial position and results of
operations of E*TRADE Canada Securities Corporation as of and for the period
then ended.

(c) _Section 3.7(c) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule_ sets forth the
combined unaudited balance sheet of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of
March 31, 2008 (the " _Balance Sheet Summary_ "). The column entitled "E*TRADE
Canada" on the Balance Sheet Summary represents the combined balance sheet of
the Company and its Subsidiaries as of March 31, 2008 and has been prepared
in accordance with GAAP on a basis consistent with prior periods (except to
the extent that changes in GAAP require a different treatment or method than
the treatment or method employed for prior periods) and fairly presents in
all material respects the financial position of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as of such date, subject to normal year end adjustments and the
absence of footnotes and similar presentation items therein. The column
entitled "Adjusted E*TRADE Canada" on the Balance Sheet Summary represents
the combined balance sheet of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of March 31,
2008 after giving effect to the adjustments in the column entitled
"Excluded Assets" which adjustments reflect the repatriation of capital as
contemplated by this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by the
Technology Transfer Agreement as if such repatriation and transactions had

unaudited profit and loss statement for each of the Company and its
Subsidiaries for the year ended December 31, 2007  



 

14  (the " _P andL Bridge_"). Each such profit and loss statement, prior to giving
effect to the adjustments set forth in the PandL Bridge, has been prepared in
accordance with GAAP on a basis consistent with prior periods (except to the
extent that changes in GAAP require a different treatment or method than the
treatment or method employed for prior periods) and fairly presents in
all material respects the pre-Tax income and losses of each of the Company
and its Subsidiaries for the period then ended, subject to normal year end
adjustments and the absence of footnotes and similar presentation items
therein. The eliminations and adjustments reflected on the PandL Bridge reflect
consolidating eliminations as well as the removal of revenues and costs and
related items which are not included in the Business being sold to Purchaser
pursuant to this Agreement.

(e) _Section 3.7(e) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule_ sets forth the
unaudited profit and loss statement for the Business for the three month
period ended March 31, 2008 (the " _March 2008 P andL_"). The March 2008 PandL
gives effect, on a pro forma basis, to the consolidating eliminations as well
as the removal of revenues and costs and related items from the pre-Tax
income and losses of each of the Company and its Subsidiaries for such three
month period (the " _GAAP P andL_," which GAAP PandL has been prepared, in each
case, in accordance with GAAP on a basis consistent with prior periods except
to the extent that changes in GAAP require a different treatment or method
than the treatment or method employed for prior periods) which are not
included in the Business being sold to Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement,
and fairly presents in all material respects, on such pro-forma basis, the
pre-Tax income and losses of the Business for the three-month period then
ended. The consolidating eliminations and revenue and cost and other

Taxes shown as due and payable on such Tax Returns have been timely paid to
the appropriate Tax Authority.



 

15 (b) For purposes of the Tax Treaty, Seller is resident of the United States

Subsidiaries is a "registered pension plan" (as defined in the ITA) or
supplementary pension plan, and no such plan has ever been established or
maintained for the benefit of any employee or former employee of the Company

waive, pursuant to subsection 113(c) of the Competition Act (Canada), the
obligation to give the requisite notice (and if the Commissioner or one of the
parties hereto requests a short-form or long-form pre-merger notification,
they shall file such short-form or long-form pre-merger notification, as
applicable, in addition to the application for an advance ruling certificate)
pursuant to Part IX of the Competition Act in respect of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(c) Purchaser and Seller shall (and Seller shall cause the Company to)
promptly furnish to the Commissioner any additional information required or
reasonably requested under the Competition Act. All requests and enquiries
from the Commissioner shall be dealt with by the parties and the Company in
consultation with the others (and Seller shall cause the Company to so
consult). Each of the parties shall, and Seller shall cause the Company to:

(i) not extend or consent to any extension of any waiting period under the
Competition Act or enter into any agreement with the Commissioner to not
consummate any of the transactions contemplated in this Agreement, except with
the consent of the others;

(ii) promptly notify the others of written communications of any nature from
the Commissioner relating to such transactions and provide the others with
copies thereof, except to the extent of competitively sensitive information,
which competitively sensitive information will be provided only to the
external legal counsel or external expert of the other and will not be shared
by such counsel or expert with any other Person;

(iii) permit the others to review in advance any proposed written
communications of any nature with the Commissioner relating to such
transactions, and provide the others with final copies thereof, except to the
extent of competitively sensitive information, which competitively sensitive
information will be provided only to the external legal counsel or external
expert of the other and will not be shared by such counsel with any other
Person; and

(iv) not participate in any substantive meeting or discussion (whether in
person, by telephone or otherwise) with the Commissioner in respect of any
filing, investigation  



 

26  or inquiry concerning such transactions unless it consults with the others
in advance and gives the others the opportunity to attend and participate
thereat (except where the Commissioner expressly requests that the others
should not be present at the meeting or discussion or part or parts of the
meeting or discussion, or except where competitively sensitive information may
be discussed, in which case every effort will be made to allow external legal
counsel to participate).

(d) Purchaser shall pay the filing fee relating to the filing under the
Competition Act.

Section 5.4. _Transfer Taxes_. All transfer, registration, stamp, documentary,
sales, use and similar Taxes (including all applicable real estate transfer
or gains Taxes and transfer Taxes), any penalties, interest and additions to
Tax, and fees incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (" _Transfer Taxes_ ") shall be the sole responsibility of and
be timely paid by Purchaser regardless of whether Seller is liable for such
Transfer Taxes under applicable Law. The Purchase Price shall be paid by
Purchaser to Seller without any reduction or withholding for any Transfer Tax
except as required by Section 116 of the ITA. Seller and Purchaser shall
cooperate in the timely making of all filings, returns, reports and forms as
may be required in connection with any Transfer Tax.

Section 5.5. _Employee Matters_. Purchaser shall cause the Company and its
Subsidiaries to take the following actions with respect to the Transferred
Employees under any employee plans other than a Company Plan for which such
employee may become eligible after Closing: (i) waive any limitations
regarding pre-existing conditions and eligibility waiting periods under any
welfare or other employee benefit plan maintained by any of them on and after
the Closing to the extent such pre-existing condition or waiting period did
not apply to the employee under a comparable plan of the Company
immediately prior to the Closing; (ii) provide each Transferred Employee with
credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid prior to the Closing for the
calendar year in which the Closing occurs, in satisfying any applicable
deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under such welfare plans or other
employee benefit plans; and (iii) for all purposes (other than for purposes of
benefit accruals under any defined benefit pension plan) under all
compensation and benefit plans and policies applicable to the Transferred
Employees, treat all service by the Transferred Employees with the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries before the Closing as service with Purchaser and its
Subsidiaries.

Section 5.6. _Public Announcements_. Until the Closing, neither Purchaser nor
Seller nor any of their respective Affiliates shall issue or cause
the dissemination of any press release or other public announcements or
statements with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby without consulting with the other party prior to issuing such press
release, announcement or statement.

Section 5.7. _Further Assurances; Post-Closing Cooperation_.

(a) From time to time after the Closing, without additional consideration,
each of the parties hereto will (or, if appropriate, cause their Affiliates
to) execute and deliver such further instruments and take such other action as
may be necessary to make effective the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Transaction Documents. If any party to this
Agreement following the Closing shall have in its possession any asset or
right that under this Agreement should have been delivered to the other, such
party shall promptly deliver such asset or right to the other.

(b) Following the Closing, each party will afford the other party and its
Representatives (i) such access as the other party may reasonably request to
all books, records and other data and information relating to the Company and
its Subsidiaries and (ii) the right to make copies and extracts therefrom at
the cost of the party requesting such copies and extracts. Further, each
party agrees for a period extending seven years after the Closing Date not to
destroy or otherwise dispose of any such books, records and other data unless
such party shall first offer in writing to surrender such books, records  



 

27  and other data to the other party and such other party shall not agree in
writing to take possession thereof during the ten-day period after such offer
is made.

(c) Following the Closing, Purchaser shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to cause the public filings and registrations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries with any Governmental Authority, membership organization or stock
exchange, as applicable, to be changed or updated in order to reflect the
post-Closing directors, officers and registered representatives of the
Company and its Subsidiaries.

Section 5.8. _Contact with Customers and Suppliers_. Prior to the
Closing, neither Purchaser nor any Affiliate, officer, director, advisor,
agent, employee or other representative of Purchaser shall contact any
employee, customer, supplier or other Person having a commercial relationship
with the Company or any Subsidiary about this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated herein without the prior written consent of Seller in each
instance, unless in accordance with an agreed communication plan between
Purchaser and Seller. The Seller acknowledges that there is overlap between
customers and suppliers of the Company and its Subsidiaries and the customers
and suppliers of the Purchaser and its Affiliates, and that this provision in
no way restricts the Purchaser or its Affiliates from conducting its
business with such customers and suppliers in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice.

Section 5.9. _Use of Names_. For a period of 180 days after the Closing Date
(the " _End Date_ "), Seller shall grant or cause to be granted to Purchaser
and its Affiliates a license, which shall be royalty free, non-assignable and
non-sublicenseable, to use in the Business the names, designations, symbols,
trade names, trademarks, logos and service marks used in the operation of the
Business prior to the Closing Date (except for the Trademarks which are dealt
with exclusively by the Technology Transfer Agreement) (collectively, the "
_E*TRADE Marks_ "). Following the End Date Purchaser will, and will cause its
Subsidiaries and Affiliates to, cease the use of the E*TRADE Marks, and will
eliminate the use of any other designation indicating affiliation after the
Closing Date with Parent or any of its Affiliates. As promptly as practicable
(and in any event prior to the End Date) after the Closing Date, Purchaser
shall change all names on all signage and all stationery, contracts, and
other business forms and documents to names which do not use any of the
E*TRADE Marks or the name "E*TRADE".

Section 5.10. _Purchaser Non-Compete_.

(a) Purchaser covenants and agrees that from and after the Closing Date for a
period of five years thereafter, Purchaser will not, and will cause its
Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly, employ or use the Excluded Assets
or the Retained Assets (except for the Excluded Database, the software listed
on Schedule E2 to the Technology Transfer Agreement and subject to the rights
of Purchaser and its Affiliates under Section 2.1(b) and Section 4.2(b) of the
Technology Transfer Agreement) to provide services for customers who are non-
Canadians. Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit or otherwise limit
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates from using such technology or intellectual
property referred to in the preceding sentence to provide Canadian customers
of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates any products or services following the
Closing Date (nor shall it give rise to a termination right under the
Technology Transfer Agreement).

(b) The parties hereto recognize that the laws and public policies of the
various states of the United States and provinces of Canada may differ as to
the validity and enforceability of covenants similar to those set forth in
Section 5.10 through and including Section 5.14. It is the intention of the
parties that the provisions of Section 5.10 through and including Section 5.14
be enforced to the fullest extent permissible under the Laws of each
jurisdiction in which enforcement may be sought, and that the unenforceability
(or the modification to conform to such Laws) of any provisions of Section
5.10 through  



 

28  and including Section 5.14 shall not render unenforceable, or impair, the
remainder of the provisions of the applicable section. Accordingly, if
any provision of Section 5.10 through and including Section 5.14 shall be
determined to be invalid or unenforceable, such invalidity or unenforceability
shall be deemed to apply only with respect to the operation of such provision
in the particular jurisdiction in which such determination is made and not
with respect to any other provision or jurisdiction.

(c) The parties to this Agreement acknowledge and agree: (i) that for purposes
of Section 5.10, Section 5.11 and Section 5.12, from time to time Persons
other than Purchaser and Seller may take actions that will result in
Purchaser or Seller being in technical violation of one or more of such
Sections and if such violation was not caused, facilitated or permitted by
Purchaser or Seller, as the case may be, such party shall not be deemed to
have breached such Section; _provided_ that Purchaser or Seller, as the case
may be, shall have used its reasonable best efforts to cure such violation
upon becoming aware of such violation; and (ii) that any remedy at law for any
breach of the provisions of Section 5.10, Section 5.11 or Section 5.12 would
be inadequate, and hereby consent to the granting by any court of an
injunction or other equitable relief, without the necessity of actual monetary
loss being proved, in order that the breach or threatened breach of such
provisions may be effectively restrained.

Section 5.11. _Seller Non-Compete_. Seller covenants and agrees that from and
after the Closing Date for a period of five years thereafter, Seller will not,
and will cause its Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly, engage in the
Business. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Seller nor any of its
Affiliates shall be prohibited from:

(a) using the ETN as permitted by Section 5.12;

(b) acquiring or owning as a passive investment, for its own account, directly
or indirectly, less than 10% of the outstanding capital stock of any publicly
traded company engaged in the Business (which 10% threshold shall be
calculated taking into account aggregate ownership by Seller and its
Affiliates);

(c) acquiring or owning as a passive investment, for its own account, directly
or indirectly, less than 10% of the outstanding equity or voting power of any
privately held company engaged directly or indirectly in the Business (which
10% threshold shall be calculated taking into account aggregate ownership by
Seller and its Affiliates);

(d) acquiring any entity which is engaged in the Business (the " _Entity_ ")
if, in its last full fiscal year prior to such acquisition the consolidated
revenues of the Entity from that portion of its business which if conducted by
Seller or its Affiliates would violate this Section 5.11, constituted less
than 50% of the total revenues of the Entity, whether such acquisition is
accomplished through the acquisition of shares or assets of or merger,
amalgamation or other business combination;

(e) directly or indirectly selling, or suffering the sale of, all or a
controlling interest in its shares or the shares of any of its Subsidiaries or
all or substantially all of its assets to or otherwise being acquired by any
Person or effecting a merger of equals transaction; _provided_ , that Seller
and its Affiliates shall remain bound by this Section 5.11 and provided
further that the acquiring Person and the Person who ultimately controls such
acquiring Person provides the written agreement contemplated by the Guarantee
Agreement;

(f) to the extent otherwise in compliance with clauses (b) and (c) above,
conducting merchant banking, private equity, hedge fund or asset management
activities in the ordinary course of business and in connection therewith,
acquiring, directly or indirectly, capital stock or other equity interests
(including, but not limited to, options, warrants, convertible securities and
other rights to acquire  



 

29  capital stock and other equity interests) in any Person, including, without
limitation, a Person engaged directly or indirectly in the Business;

 

(g) engaging in or providing brokerage services, including retail brokerage
services, through any business or distribution channel or in conjunction with
the provision of any other products or services, so long as such activities do
not constitute the conduct of the Business;

(h) offering, selling, trading and dealing equity securities, options,
derivatives and other securities, whether registered or unregistered,
including through distribution channels owned and operated by Parent and
its Affiliates or third parties, so long as such activities do not constitute
the conduct of the Business;

(i) engaging in correspondent securities clearing, payment and settlement
activities;

(j) acquiring, directly or indirectly, any voting stock, capital stock or
other equity interests (including convertible securities) of any Person in
connection with any hedging or other customer or proprietary driven
derivatives or foreign exchange products;

(k) providing investment banking, financial advisory, commercial financing,
banking, trust, custody, cash management, back office, outsourcing or other
similar services or products, including to or in support of another Person
engaged in the Business;

(l) providing services through Parents Corporate Services Group or its
successor through Purchaser or one of its Affiliates or, absent reaching the
agreement contemplated by Section 5.15 of this Agreement, another broker-
dealer in Canada; or

(m) performing its obligations under this Agreement and the Transaction
Documents.

Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that in any merger, amalgamation or
combination permitted by clause (d) above, as long as the proviso in Section
5.11(d) is complied with, the Entity shall not be restricted in any manner
whatsoever from continuing to operate its business in the same manner as it
did preceding such event.

Section 5.12. _Restricted Use of ETN Assets_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, Seller covenants and agrees that from and after
the Closing Date for a period of five years thereafter, Seller will not, and
will cause its Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly sell or license to a
third party or employ or use the ETN, in each case, to provide services to
Canadian customers. Nothing in this Agreement shall preclude Parent or any of
its Affiliates from routing orders initiated by Parent, its Affiliates or its
non-Canadian customers through the use of the ETN initiated outside of Canada,
to marketplaces in Canada, provided the delivery of the order to a marketplace
in Canada is not achieved directly through the use of the ETN by Parent or
its Affiliates, except if such delivery is performed by Purchaser or one of
its Affiliates.

Section 5.13. _Restricted Use of E*TRADE Brand_. Subject to the Transitional
Services Agreement and Section 5.9, from and after the Closing Date for a
period of seven years thereafter, Seller shall not, and shall cause its
Affiliates not to, license or sell to third parties or use, advertise or
display the E*TRADE Brand or the E*TRADE Marks in Canada for purposes of
acquiring online retail brokerage customers in Canada or providing online
retail brokerage services to customers in Canada (other than those customers
serviced by Parents Corporate Services Group (or such groups successor)
which shall not be prohibited by any provision of this Agreement), nor any
name or brand containing or confusingly similar to same, whether alone or in
conjunction with any other word or design components, and whether  



 

30  by or for themselves or by or through any licensee or successor in title,
and the foregoing prohibition shall apply to all use, advertising and display
as aforesaid, whether as a trademark, trade name, business name, domain name,
trading style or any other indication of origin.

Section 5.14.  _Non-Solicitation; Non-Hire_. From and after the date of this
Agreement for a period of 18 months after the Closing Date, Seller shall not,
and shall cause its Affiliates not to, in any manner, directly or indirectly,
solicit or induce any Transferred Employee or encourage any such Transferred
Employee to terminate his or her employment with Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates, or hire such Transferred Employee in any capacity without the
prior written consent of Purchaser;  _provided_ that the foregoing covenant
shall not restrict Seller or any of its Affiliates from making any general
public solicitation of employees (whether through advertisements, recruiting
firms or other means) not targeted at Transferred Employees or from employing
any Transferred Employee who responds to such general solicitation.

Section 5.15. _Provision of Other Services_. On or prior to the Closing Date,
the parties will negotiate in good faith to enter into an agreement with
respect to the provision of broker-dealer and trade execution and related
services to Parents Corporate Services Group (or such groups successor) for
all periods following the Closing Date. Purchaser shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates to, use their best efforts to provide the same customer experience
as provided to Parents Corporate Services Groups customers as of the date
of this Agreement.

Section 5.16. _Enforcement of Confidentiality Agreements_. From and after the
Closing, Seller shall not waive the benefits of, or agree to modify in any
manner, any confidentiality, non-solicitation or similar agreement, or fail to
enforce any such agreement for and on behalf of the Company and its
Subsidiaries to the fullest extent practicable, including by seeking
injunctive relief and specific performance, to the extent such
confidentiality, non-solicitation or similar agreement relates to the Company
and its Subsidiaries or their employees. Purchaser acknowledges and
agrees that its sole remedy in respect of a breach by Seller of this Section
5.16 shall be to seek specific performance.



 

31 Section 5.17. _Transitional Services_. Following the date of this Agreement
and prior to the Closing Date, Seller and Purchaser agree to use their
respective reasonable best efforts to finalize the Transition Services (as
defined in the Transitional Services Agreement) set forth on Exhibit A and
Exhibit B to the Transitional Services Agreement. Seller and Purchaser
further agree to take or cause to be taken all actions contemplated to be
taken by them or their Affiliates in advance of Closing pursuant to the terms
of the Transitional Services Agreement.

Section 5.18. _Affiliate Contracts_. On or prior to the Closing Date, the
parties will negotiate in good faith to enter into an agreement with respect
to the termination of an agreed upon list of inter-company contracts and
agreements between the Company and its Affiliates, on the one hand, and the
Seller and its Affiliates (excluding the Company and its Subsidiaries), on the
other hand, that are no longer necessary for the continued operation of the
Business after Closing. The agreement to be executed will contain a mutually
agreeable termination of the agreed contracts and agreements (including
certain categories of contracts and agreements which may be identified by
Purchaser following the Closing Date) and a release of Purchaser and its
Affiliates from all liabilities and obligations under the agreed upon
contracts and agreements.

VIII on or prior to the date on which it otherwise would terminate, until the
related claim for indemnification has been satisfied or otherwise resolved as
provided in this Article VIII, but such survival shall only be with respect to
the matters covered by such notice of claim. Except as otherwise expressly
provided in this Agreement, each covenant hereunder shall survive without
limit. None of the Seller Indemnified Parties or the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties shall be entitled to assert any claim for indemnification pursuant to
the terms of this Agreement or otherwise after the expiration of
the applicable survival period with respect to the representations and
warranties alleged to have been inaccurate in any such claim.

any Purchaser Indemnified Party that arise out of or result from (i) any
inaccuracy in or any breach of any representation and warranty made by Seller
in this Agreement as of the date of this Agreement or as of the Closing Date
as if such representation or warranty was made on the Closing Date, except in
the case of representations and warranties that expressly speak as of a
specified date or time which shall only be made as of such specified date (in
both cases, without regard to any qualification therein as to Business
Material Adverse Effect except with respect to the representations and
warranties of Seller contained in Section 3.8 and Section 3.9), (ii)
any failure by Seller to perform or fulfill any of its covenants or
agreements required to be performed by Seller under this Agreement (other than
the covenant contained in Section 5.16), and (iii) the matters set forth on
_Schedule 8.2(a)(iii)_ to this Agreement.

(b) _Taxes_. Seller shall indemnify and save harmless the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties from and against any Liability for Taxes owing or which
may become owing by the Company or  



 

35  any of its Subsidiaries, including any Liability for Taxes under the Code as
a result of consolidated tax returns filed by Seller or any of its
Affiliates, in respect of any Pre-Closing Tax Period and in respect of the
portion of any Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date, but only to the
extent that the Liability for Taxes exceeds the amount accrued or reserved for
Tax in the determination of Final Net Equity pursuant to Section 2.3. For the
avoidance of doubt, in the event of any indemnification by Seller pursuant to
this Section 8.2 against a Liability for Taxes for a Pre-Closing Tax Period or
the portion of a Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date in respect of a
timing difference (such as, for example, the acceleration of an item of income
from a Post-Closing Tax Period to a Pre-Closing Tax Period or the deferral of
a deduction from a Pre-Closing Tax Period to a Post-Closing Period), the
amount of indemnification shall be reduced by the amount of the applicable Tax
benefit reasonably expected to be realized by the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties in Post-Closing Tax Periods or the portion of Straddle
Periods beginning after the Closing Date. For purposes of the preceding
sentence, the amount of Tax for a Straddle Period that is attributable to the
portion of such period ending on the Closing Date shall be determined (x) in
the case of a Tax on gross or net income, revenue, sales or receipts, as if
the applicable Tax period ended on the Closing Date and (y) in the case of all
other Taxes, on a per diem basis based on the number of days in such period
through the Closing Date and the number of days in the remainder of such
period.

Section 8.3. _Indemnification of Seller_. Purchaser shall indemnify and hold
harmless Seller and its Affiliates and their respective successors and their
respective officers, directors, employees and agents (collectively, the "
_Seller Indemnified Parties_ ") from and against any and all Losses that may
be asserted against, or paid, suffered or incurred by any Seller Indemnified
Party that arise out of or result from (a) any inaccuracy in or any breach of
any representation and warranty made by Purchaser in this Agreement as of the
date of this Agreement or as of the Closing Date as if such representation or
warranty was made on the Closing Date, except in the case of representations
and warranties that expressly speak as of a specified date or time which shall
only be made as of such specified date, and (b) any failure by Purchaser to
perform or fulfill any of its covenants or agreements required to be performed
by Purchaser under this Agreement, (c) any action brought by an employee
(including any Transferred Employee and specifically excluding those
individuals listed on _Schedule 1_ to this Agreement) of the Company or its
Subsidiaries against the Seller or its Affiliates in respect of the dismissal
of such employee in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or a constructive dismissal of such employee following the Closing
or the enforcement of any other rights of such employee arising in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except to the extent
such Losses result from the breach of any representation and warranty of
Seller in Section 3.11 or Section 3.12 (irrespective of whether the period set
forth in Section 8.1(c) has expired), and (d) any action taken by Purchaser,
the Company or their respective Affiliates after the Closing in connection
with the conduct of the Business.

Section 8.4.  _Limitations_.

(a) No amounts of indemnity shall be payable as a result of any claim arising
under Section 8.2(a)(i), other than as a result of any claim arising under
any inaccuracy in or any breach of any representation and warranty made by
Seller pursuant to Sections 3.1 [organization and qualification], 3.2(a)
[authority], 3.3 [ownership of Shares and Subsidiaries] and 3.24 [brokers],
unless and until the Purchaser Indemnified Parties have suffered, incurred,
sustained or become subject to Losses in excess of $8,840,000 (the "
_Deductible_ ") in the aggregate, in which case the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties may bring a claim for all Losses in excess of such amount.

(b) Other than any claim arising under Section 8.2(a)(ii), Section
8.2(a)(iii) or Section 8.2(b), no claim for Losses arising from a single event
or a series of related events or from the same events or circumstances may be
brought by Purchaser unless the aggregate amount of such claim or series of
related claims or same events or circumstances is in excess of $50,000 (the "
_De Minimis_  



 

36   _Claim_ "). Any losses not exceeding the De Minimis Claim amount will not
be used in computing the Deductible.

(c) Other than as a result of any claim arising under Section 8.2(a)(ii),
Section 8.2(a)(iii), Section 8.2(b) or any inaccuracy in or any breach of any
representation and warranty made by Seller pursuant to Sections 3.1
[organization and qualification], 3.2(a) [authority], 3.3 [ownership of Shares
and Subsidiaries] and 3.24 [brokers], the maximum liability of Seller under
Section 8.2 shall not exceed $66,300,000 in the aggregate (the " _Indemnity
Amount_ ").

(d) Without duplication the amount of indemnification payable to an
Indemnified Party under this Article VIII shall be reduced to take account of
any net Tax benefit reasonably expected to be realized by the Indemnified
Party or its Affiliates as a result of the incurrence or payment of any Loss
being indemnified. In connection with any claim for indemnification, the
Indemnified Party will (i) seek full recovery from any third parties and under
all insurance policies covering any Loss and (ii) use its commercially
reasonable efforts to mitigate any actual or potential Loss, in each case to
the same extent as it would if such Loss were not subject to indemnification
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. In the event that a net insurance or
other recovery is received by the Indemnified Party with respect to any Loss
for which an Indemnified Party has been indemnified by the Indemnifying Party
hereunder, then a refund equal to the aggregate amount of the net recovery by
the Indemnified Party will be made, which refund will be paid promptly to the
Indemnifying Party that provided such indemnification to the Indemnified
Party.

(e) None of the limitations set forth in this Section 8.4 or otherwise in this
Agreement shall apply to claims for fraud.

(f) For the avoidance of doubt the indemnity set forth in Section 8.2(b) is
not subject to any of the limitations applicable to the representations and
warranties set forth in Section 3.10 [taxes].

Section 8.5. _Method of Asserting Claims_. All claims for indemnification by
any Indemnified Party under this Article VIII shall be asserted and resolved
as follows:

(a) If an Indemnified Party intends to seek indemnification under this
Article VIII, it shall promptly notify the Indemnifying Party in writing of
such claim. The failure to provide such notice will not affect any rights
hereunder except to the extent the Indemnifying Party is materially
prejudiced thereby.

(b) If such claim involves a claim by a third party against the Indemnified
Party, the Indemnifying Party may, within ten days after receipt of such
notice and upon notice to the Indemnified Party, assume, with counsel
reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, at the sole cost and expense
of the Indemnifying Party, the settlement or defense thereof (in which case
any Loss associated therewith shall be the sole responsibility of the
Indemnifying Party); _provided_ , that the Indemnified Party may participate
in such settlement or defense through counsel chosen by it at its sole
expense. If the Indemnified Party determines in good faith that representation
by the Indemnifying Partys counsel of both the Indemnifying Party and the
Indemnified Party may present such counsel with a conflict of interest, then
the Indemnifying Party shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of the
Indemnified Partys counsel. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the
Indemnified Party may take over the control of the defense or settlement of a
third-party claim at any time if it irrevocably waives its right to indemnity
under this Article VIII with respect to such claim and (ii) the Indemnifying
Party may not, without the consent of the Indemnified Party, settle
or compromise any action or consent to the entry of any judgment, other than
a judgment solely for money, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld. The
 



 

37  Indemnified Party shall not pay or settle any such claim without the
Indemnifying Partys consent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld. 

Section 8.6. _Character of Indemnity Payments_. The parties agree that any
indemnification payments made with respect to this Agreement shall be treated
for all purposes as an adjustment to the Final Purchase Price.

Section 8.7. _Exclusive Remedy, etc._ This Article VIII (and Article VII)
shall be the exclusive remedy following the Closing for any matters in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, other
than any remedies for fraud. Purchaser or Seller, as applicable, shall
provide any information in connection with the matters covered by this Article
VIII as the other may reasonably request.

ARTICLE IX

TERMINATION OF AGREEMENT

Section 9.1. _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated, and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be abandoned, at any time
prior to the Closing by:

(a) the mutual written agreement of Seller and Purchaser;

(b) either Seller or Purchaser if any court of competent jurisdiction or other
competent Governmental Authority shall have issued a statute, rule,
regulation, order, decree or injunction or taken any other action permanently
restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting all or any portion of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and such statute, rule,
regulation, order, decree or injunction or other action shall have become
final and nonappealable;

(c) Seller or Purchaser, in the event (i) the non-terminating party shall
have breached or failed to perform in any material respect any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement, which failure to perform would result in a failure of a condition
to Closing of the terminating party (assuming the date of such determination
is the Closing Date) and if such non-terminating party fails to cure such
breach within twenty Business Days following notification thereof by
the terminating party or (ii) the satisfaction of any condition to the
terminating partys obligations under this Agreement becomes impossible if the
failure of such condition to be satisfied is not caused by a breach of this
Agreement by the terminating party or its Affiliates; or

(d) Seller if the Closing shall not have occurred on or before January
30, 2009, unless the failure to consummate the Closing is due to the failure
to act by the terminating party (or its Affiliates).

Section 9.2.  _Effect of Termination_. If this Agreement is validly
terminated pursuant to Section 9.1, this Agreement will forthwith become null
and void, and have no further effect, without any liability on the part of any
party hereto or its Affiliates, directors, officers or shareholders, other
than the provisions of this Section 9.2 and Article X hereof. Nothing
contained in this Section 9.2 shall relieve any party from liability for any
intentional or willful breach of this Agreement occurring prior to
termination.

interests and obligations under this Agreement to any Affiliate; _provided_
that if Purchaser makes any such assignment, such Affiliate agrees in writing
