stockholders to enter into this Agreement and consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby pursuant to which, among other things, and as a single

Company (the "First Step Merger") in accordance with the applicable provisions
of the DGCL. Immediately following the First Step Merger, Parent will cause
the Company to merge with and into Merger Sub Two, with Merger Sub Two
continuing as the surviving entity (the "Second Step Merger" and, taken
together with the First Step Merger, the "Merger"). For U.S. federal income
tax purposes, it is intended that the Merger will qualify as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended, the "Code", and that this Agreement will be, and
is hereby, adopted as a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of
Section 1.368-2(g) of the U.S. Income Tax Regulations promulgated under the
Code (the "Treasury Regulations").

B. Pursuant to the Merger, among other things, and subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, (i) all issued and outstanding Company Capital
Stock will be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration set
forth herein, (ii) all outstanding and unvested Company Options to purchase
Company Common Stock not otherwise exercised prior to the Merger will be
cancelled in accordance with the terms hereof and (iii) all issued and
outstanding Company Warrants to purchase Company Capital Stock not otherwise
exercised prior to the Merger will be cancelled in accordance with the
terms hereof.

C. Concurrent with the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the parties
hereto, certain holders of shares of capital stock of the Company (each, a
"Principal Stockholder," and together, the "Principal Stockholders") will
execute and deliver voting agreements, in the form attached hereto as Exhibit
A (each, a "Stockholder Voting Agreement" and collectively, the "Stockholder
Voting Agreements"). Concurrent with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement by the parties hereto, certain holders of shares of capital
stock of Parent (each, a "Parent Principal Stockholder") will execute and
deliver voting agreements, in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A-1 (each, a
"Parent Stockholder Voting Agreement" and collectively, the "Parent
Stockholder Voting Agreements").

D. Concurrent with the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the
parties hereto, each Principal Stockholder shall execute and deliver a
Principal Stockholder Option in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B (each, a
"Stockholder Option" and collectively, the "Stockholder Options"). _EXECUTION COPY_



 

E. Concurrent with the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the parties
hereto, each Principal Stockholder shall execute and deliver a Lock-up
Agreement in the form attached hereto as Exhibit G (each, a "Lock-up
Agreement" and collectively, the "Lock-up Agreements").

F. Contemporaneously with the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the
parties hereto, as a material inducement to Parent and the Merger Subs to
enter into this Agreement, John Vincent is entering into a Retention
Agreement, in the form attached hereto as Exhibit C, (the "Critical Person
Retention Agreement") to be effective as of the Effective Time.

I. The Company, on the one hand, and Parent and the Merger Subs, on the other
hand, desire to make certain representations, warranties, covenants and other
agreements in connection with the Merger.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual agreements, covenants and
other premises set forth herein, the mutual benefits to be gained by the

-21- _EXECUTION COPY_



 

 including shares underlying any Company Warrant, based upon such holders
Pro Rata Portion of the Escrow Amount contributed with the Escrow Agent on
such holders behalf pursuant to Section 2.9(a). Upon the surrender of any
such Company Stock Certificate, the Company Stock Certificate so surrendered

Certificate outstanding after the Effective Time will be deemed, for all
corporate purposes thereafter, to evidence only the right to receive the
Merger Consideration payable in exchange for shares of Company Capital Stock
(without interest) into which such shares of Company Capital Stock shall have
been converted pursuant to Section 2.7.

(iv) As soon as reasonably practicable following the determination of the
Final Adjusted Cash Consideration pursuant to Section 2.10, if the Final
Adjusted Cash Consideration is less than the Estimated Adjusted Cash
Consideration (such amount, the "Shortfall Amount"), then Parent and the
Stockholders Representative shall instruct the Escrow Agent to promptly
release the Shortfall Amount from the Escrow Fund. As soon as reasonably
practicable following the determination of the Final Adjusted Cash
Consideration pursuant to Section 2.10, if the Final Adjusted Cash
Consideration is greater than the Estimated Adjusted Cash Consideration (such
amount, the "Excess Amount"), then Parent shall deposit an amount of cash
equal to the Excess Amount with the Exchange Agent for distribution to the
Company Securityholders in accordance with their Pro Rata Portions.

(v) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, to the extent
that either (i) the payment of the Excess Amount pursuant to Section
2.9(b)(iv) or (ii) any payment resulting from the Estimated Adjusted Cash
Consideration or the Base Aggregate Cash Consideration being in excess of
Sixty-Two Million Dollars ($62,000,000) would result (absent this provision)

of this Section 2.9(v), the Escrow Amount and the Deferred Merger
Consideration) payable by Parent pursuant to this Agreement comprising more
than sixty percent (60%) of the total consideration paid in the Merger (as
determined pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section 1.368-1T(e)(2)), Parent
shall substitute a sufficient number of shares of Parent Common Stock (valued
at the per share closing price as of the date prior to the date hereof) for
cash to satisfy its obligations under Sections 2.9(b)(iv) and any payment
resulting from the Estimated Adjusted Cash Consideration or the Base Adjusted
Cash Consideration being in excess of Sixty-Two Million Dollars ($62,000,000))
as applicable.

(vi) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall be permitted to instruct
the Exchange Agent to pay any holder of Company Options not exercised prior
to the Effective Time the Merger Consideration into which the shares of
Company Capital Stock underlying such Company Options could have been
converted as of immediately prior to the Effective Time had such Company
Option been exercised (such amount, the "Option Consideration") _less_ (A)
the exercise price of such Company Options, _less_ (B) the Pro Rata Portion of
the Escrow Amount attributable to such shares of Company Capital Stock, based
on such holders Pro Rata Portion of the Escrow Amount contributed with the
Escrow Agent on such holders behalf pursuant to Section 2.9(a). The Option
Consideration of a Company Option _less_ the exercise price of such Company
Option is referred to herein as the "Optionholders Portion of the Merger
Consideration". If any Company Option expires prior to the end of the Escrow
Period without having been exercised, then the Optionholders Portion of the
Merger Consideration with respect to their Company Options outstanding and
unexercised as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be distributed
to the Company Stockholders by the Exchange Agent at the end of the Escrow
Period in accordance with the distribution procedures set forth in Section

greater than or equal to the Estimated Cash, then the Estimated Adjusted Cash
Consideration shall be increased by the amount of such difference;

pursuant to this Section 2.10) then the Estimated Adjusted Cash Consideration
shall be decreased by the amount of such difference;

is greater than or equal to the Estimated Company Debt, then the Estimated

dispute pursuant to Section 2.9(d), Parent shall provide the
Stockholder Representative with reasonable access to the Final Surviving
Entitys headquarters, during normal business hours, and without significant
disruption to Parent or the Final Surviving Entity, and to the books, records

relevant information concerning the preparation of the Actual Closing
Statement and the determination of Actual Working Capital, the Actual Cash,
the Actual Company Debt and the Actual Excess Fees. 

(e) In the event that the Stockholder Representative shall not deliver a

thereof shall be final and binding upon Parent and the
Stockholder Representative; and

respective properties and to carry on its respective business as currently
conducted. Each of the Companys Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed

Liens and free of any other restriction (including any restriction on the

3.12  _Restrictions on Business Activities_. There is no Contract (non-

to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or, to the
Knowledge of the Company, otherwise binding upon the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries which has or may reasonably be expected to have the effect of

-40- _EXECUTION COPY_



 

 and there is not, under any of such Lease Agreements, any existing default,
or event of default by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, nor to the
Knowledge of the Company by any other party thereto, (or event which with
notice or lapse of time, or both, would constitute a default by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, nor to the Knowledge of the Company by any other
Party thereto), that is or would reasonably be expected to be, individually
or in the aggregate material to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any
written notice of a default, alleged failure to perform, or any offset or
counterclaim with respect to any such Lease Agreement, which has not been
fully remedied and withdrawn. The Company and its Subsidiaries currently
occupy all of the Leased Real Property for the operation of its business.
Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries owes brokerage commissions or

real property that are no longer in effect and have no continuing
liability with respect to such terminated agreements.

Real Property to bring it into compliance therewith, and (ii) neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to expend more that
$25,000 under any Lease Agreement to restore the Leased Real Property at the
end of the term of the applicable Lease Agreement to the condition required
under the Lease Agreement (assuming the conditions existing in such Leased
Real Property as of the date hereof and as of the Closing).

is in all material respects in good operating condition and regularly and
properly maintained subject to normal wear and tear.

subsisting (except for the applications) and enforceable, and has not
expired, been cancelled or abandoned. With respect to each item of Company
Registered Intellectual Property, all necessary registration, maintenance and
renewal fees currently due in connection with such Company Registered
Intellectual Property have been made and all necessary documents, recordations
and certificates in connection with such Company Registered Intellectual
Property have been filed with the relevant patent, copyright, trademark or
other authorities in the United States or foreign jurisdictions, as the case
may be, for the purposes of prosecuting, perfecting and maintaining such
Company Registered Intellectual Property. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has claimed any status in the application for or registration of
any registered intellectual property rights, including "small business
status," that would not be applicable to Parent. Neither the Company nor any
of its Subsidiaries has misrepresented, or failed to disclose, any facts or
circumstances in any application for any Company Registered Intellectual
Property that would constitute fraud or a misrepresentation with respect to
such application or that would otherwise affect the validity or
enforceability of any Company Registered Intellectual Property.

(c) _Ownership_.

(i) No Company Intellectual Property or Company Product is subject to any
claim, proceeding or outstanding decree, order, judgment, or stipulation or
Contract restricting in any material manner, the use, transfer, or licensing
thereof by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or which may materially
affect the validity, use or enforceability of such Company Intellectual
Property or Company Product.

transferable, alienable or licensable by the Final Surviving Entity and/or
Parent without restriction and without payment of any kind to any person.

Company Intellectual Property free and clear of any Lien. Without limiting the
foregoing: (A) the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is the exclusive owner
of all Trademarks that are used to designate the source or origin of the
Company Products or Services; (B) the Company or one of its Subsidiaries owns
exclusively, and has good title to, all copyrighted works that are embodied in
any Company Product; and (C) the Company or one of its Subsidiaries is the
exclusive owner of any Patents that cover the manufacture, use, sale or import
of any Company Products or Services.

(iv) In each case in which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has engaged
or hired a third party, other than employees of the Company or its
Subsidiaries acting within the scope of their employment, to develop or create
any Intellectual Property or technology for the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has acquired or
purported to acquire ownership of any Intellectual Property or technology
from any third party, the Company and its Subsidiaries have obtained a valid
and enforceable assignment sufficient to irrevocably transfer all such
Intellectual Property (including the right to seek past and future damages
with respect thereto) and technology to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, and where any such Intellectual Property is Company Registered
Intellectual Property, to the maximum extent provided for by, and
in accordance with, applicable Laws, the Company or its Subsidiaries has
recorded each such assignment with the relevant Governmental Entity.

(v) No person who has licensed or assigned any Intellectual Property to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries has ownership rights or license rights to
improvements or modifications made by or for the Company or any of its

The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and the Representatives of
any of the foregoing to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated any such
negotiations, discussion or agreements (other than with Parent) that are the
subject matter of clause (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) of this Section 5.3(a). An

equity or other voting securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries

transaction. A "Superior Proposal" shall mean any written offer or proposal
(which has not been withdrawn) for a transaction or series of transaction
providing for the acquisition of all of the Company Capital Stock which the
Company Board shall have determined in good faith (after consultation with its
financial advisor and its outside legal counsel) is more favorable, from a
financial point of view, to the Companys stockholders (in their capacity as
such) than the Merger, in each case taking into consideration, in addition to
any other factors determined by the Company Board to be relevant, (i) all
financial considerations relevant thereto, (ii) the identity of the Person(s)
making such offer or proposal and the parties providing any of the financing
for the transaction contemplated thereby, and the prior history of
such Person(s) and sources of financing in connection with the consummation
or failure to consummate similar transactions, (iii) the anticipated timing,
conditions and prospects for completion of the transaction contemplated by
such offer or proposal, (iv) the other terms and conditions of such offer or
proposal and the implications thereof on the Company, and (v) any proposal
made by Parent in connection therewith or response thereto.

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing terms of Section 5.3(a), at any time prior
to obtaining the Requisite Company Stockholder Approval, the Company Board
may, directly or indirectly through advisors, agents or other intermediaries,
(i) engage or participate in discussions or negotiations with any Person that
has made (and not withdrawn) an unsolicited bona fide Acquisition Proposal in
writing after the date hereof, and/or (ii) furnish or make available to any
Person that has made (and not withdrawn) an unsolicited bona fide Acquisition
Proposal in writing after the date hereof, any non-public information
relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; _provided, however_ , the
Company may take any action contemplated by the foregoing clauses (i) or (ii)
if and only if all of the following conditions have been satisfied prior to
taking such action (and continue to be satisfied at all times during which any
of the foregoing actions are being taken):

(i) the Company Board shall have determined in good faith (after consultation
with its financial advisor and its outside legal counsel) that (x) such
Acquisition Proposal either constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a
Superior Proposal and (y) the failure to take such action would reasonably be
expected to be a breach of its fiduciary duties to the Companys stockholders
under the DGCL;

(ii) none of the Company or any of its Representatives shall have breached or
violated in any material respect the terms of this Section 5.3 in connection
with such Acquisition Proposal or in connection with any other Acquisition
Proposal made by any Person (or any Affiliate or agent thereof) making such
Acquisition Proposal;

(iii) the Company shall have entered into a confidentiality agreement with
such Person, the terms of which are no less favorable to the Company than
those contained in the Reciprocal Confidentiality Agreement;



 

-63- _EXECUTION COPY_



 

(iv) the Company shall have given Parents Chief Executive Officer at
least forty-eight (48) hours prior written notice of (x) its intent to take
the action permitted by this Section 5.3(b) and (y) the identity of the
Person(s) making the Acquisition Proposal forming the basis for taking
the action permitted by this Section 5.3(b), and (z) all of the material
terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal (and if such Acquisition
Proposal is in written form, prior to taking any action with respect to such
Person, the Company shall have given Parent a copy of such Acquisition
Proposal and all related agreements, commitment letters and other material
documents constituting such Acquisition Proposal provided or otherwise
furnished by the Person(s) making such Acquisition Proposal in connection
therewith); and

(v) prior to or contemporaneously with furnishing any non-public information
to such Person, the Company shall have furnished or made available such non-
public information to Parent (to the extent such information has not been
previously furnished or made available by the Company to Parent).

(c) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in this Section
5.3, the Company shall promptly, and in all cases within twenty-four (24)
hours of its receipt, advise Parent in writing of the receipt by the Company,
any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives of (i) any
Acquisition Proposal, (ii) any request for information that would reasonably
be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, or (iii) any inquiry with
respect to, or which would reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition
Proposal, the material terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal,
request or inquiry (and all related agreements, commitment letters and other
documents constituting or relating to such Acquisition Proposal or otherwise
furnished by the Person(s) making such Acquisition Proposal in connection
therewith), and the identity of the Person or group making any such
Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry. At all times from and after the
Companys, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
Representatives receipt thereof, the Company shall keep Parent reasonably
informed of the status and material terms and conditions (including all
amendments or proposed amendments) of any such Acquisition Proposal, request
or inquiry.

(d) The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event
that the provisions of this Section 5.3 were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed by
the parties hereto that Parent shall be entitled to an immediate injunction or
injunctions, without the necessity of proving the inadequacy of money damages
as a remedy and without the necessity of posting any bond or other security,
to prevent breaches of the provisions of this Section 5.3 and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any court of the
United States or any state having jurisdiction, this being in addition to any
other remedy to which Parent may be entitled at law or in equity. Without
limiting the foregoing, it is understood that any violation of the
restrictions set forth above by any officer, director, agent, representative,
Affiliate or Subsidiary of the Company shall be deemed to be a breach of this
Agreement by the Company.

shall give prompt notice to the other party of: (a) the occurrence or non-

(a) Parent or its Affiliates shall offer each employee of the Company and its

Requirements, for a period of one (1) year following the Effective Time,
Parent shall, or shall cause the Final Surviving Entity to, provide each
Continuing Employee base and salary compensation (excluding, for the avoidance
of doubt, any equity based compensation) that is no less than the
compensation provided to the Continuing Employee immediately prior to the
Effective Time.

(b) Following the Effective Time, Parent, in its sole discretion, will either
(a) continue (or cause the Final Surviving Entity to continue) to maintain the
Company Employee Plans on the same terms as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, or (b) arrange for each participant (including, without
limitation, all dependents) in the Company Employee Plans to participate in a
substantially similar plans or arrangements, as determined on a plan-by-plan
or arrangement-for-arrangement basis, of Parent or its applicable subsidiary
("Parent Plans"), or (c) a combination of clauses (a) and (b) so that each
Company Participant shall have benefits that are substantially similar in the
aggregate to benefits provided to similarly situated employees of Parent
under Parent Plans and in each case at least equivalent to the benefits
provided to each the Company Participant under the Company Employee Plans
prior to the Effective Time.

(c) As promptly as practicable following the Effective Time, Parent shall
allocate and grant in its sole discretion after consultation with John
Vincent options to acquire 1,000,000 shares of Parent Common Stock (the
"Continuing Employee Options") among the Continuing Employees and (ii) notify
each Continuing Employee of their respective allocation. The
Continuing Employee Options shall (i) be issued pursuant to the Parent Stock
Option Plan and (ii) vest twenty-five percent (25%) on the first anniversary
of their issuance date and monthly over a three-year term thereafter;
_provided, however that_ in the event a Continuing Employee does not remain
an employee or service provider of Parent or its Affiliates on each vesting

continuing Employee shall be forfeited without consideration.

(d) As promptly as practicable following the Effective Time, Parent shall (i)
establish and maintain an employee retention plan for the Continuing
Employees, (ii) issue 1,000,000 Restricted Stock Units of Parent (the
"Continuing Employee Restricted Stock Units") under the Parent Stock Option
Plan to the Continuing Employees, (iii) allocate the Continuing Employee
Restricted Stock Units among the Continuing Employees as determined in
Parents sole discretion after consultation with John Vincent and (iv) notify
each Continuing Employee of their respective allocation. Each Continuing
Employee Restricted Stock Unit issued hereunder shall be subject to forfeiture
without consideration as set forth in Section 6.11(e).

(e) The "Earned Employee Restricted Stock Units" shall equal the product of
(x) the total number of Continuing Employee Restricted Stock Units multiplied
by (y) a fraction, the numerator of which shall equal (A) the consolidated
revenue of the Final Surviving Entity during the Performance Period calculated
in accordance with GAAP using the same accounting methods, 



 

-71- _EXECUTION COPY_



 

 standards, policies, practices and estimation methodologies used to prepare
Parents Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010 (the
"RSU Revenue"), _provided, however_ that, in the event, the RSU Revenue
exceeds $60,000,000, it shall be deemed to be $60,000,000 for all purposes of
and under this Agreement _minus_ (B) _ _ the Revenue Target, and
the denominator shall equal (A) $60,000,000 _minus_ (B) the Revenue Target.
Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, the Earned Employee Restricted Stock
Units shall equal zero if the gross margin on the Performance Period EBITDA
does not equal or exceed twenty-five percent (25%). As promptly as
practicable following the Performance Period and calculation of the RSU
Revenue, an aggregate number of Continuing Employee Restricted Stock Units
equal to the number of Continuing Employee Restricted Stock Units _minus_ the
number of Earned Employee Restricted Stock Units shall be forfeited without
consideration by the Continuing Employees and each Continuing Employee shall
be deemed to have forfeited a proportional portion of such Continuing
Employees allocation of Continuing Employee Restricted Stock Units. Following
the Performance Period, the Continuing Employee Restricted Stock Units held
(and not forfeited pursuant to the previous sentence) by each
Continuing Employee shall vest quarterly over a four-year period with vesting
dates on March 1st, June 1st, September 1st and December 1 st of each
calendar year beginning on June 1, 2011. 

(f) No provision of this Agreement is intended, or will be interpreted, to
provide to nor create for any third-party beneficiary rights or any other
rights of any kind in any stockholder, Employee or partner of any party hereto
or any other Person including, but not limited to, any rights of employment
for any specified period and/or any employee benefits, in favor of any
Person, union, association, Continuing Employee, Key Employee, Employee, other
employee or former employee, contractor or other entity, other than the
parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns, and
all provisions hereof will be personal solely among the parties to this
Agreement.

6.12 _Termination of Certain Benefit Plans_. The Company and Parent shall
discuss prior to the Closing Date whether to terminate any of the Companys
group severance, separation or salary continuation plans, programs or
arrangements or any Company Employee Plans intended to include a Code Section
401(k) arrangement (each, a "401(k) Plan"). If the Company and Parent mutually
agree that any such plans should be terminated, then the Company shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to terminate such plans in accordance with
such mutual agreement. (unless Parent provides written notice to the Company
that such 401(k) plans shall not be terminated). The form and substance of any
Company Board resolutions terminating any such plans shall be subject to
review and approval of Parent. The Company also shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to take such other actions in furtherance of terminating
any such Company Employee Plans as Parent may reasonably require.

6.13 _Section 280G_. The Company shall promptly submit to the stockholders of
the Company for approval (in a manner satisfactory to Parent), by such number
of stockholders of the Company as is required by the terms of Section
280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code, any payments and/or benefits that may separately or
in the aggregate, constitute "parachute payments" pursuant to Section 280G of
the Code ("Section 280G Payments") (which determination shall be made by the
Company and shall be subject to review and approval by Parent), such that such
payments and benefits shall not be deemed to be Section 280G Payments, and
prior to the Effective Time the Company shall deliver to Parent evidence
satisfactory to Parent that (A) a vote of the stockholders of the Company was
solicited in conformance with Section 280G and the regulations promulgated
thereunder and the requisite stockholder approval was obtained with respect to
any payments and/or benefits that were subject to the shareholder vote (the
"280G Stockholder Approval"), or (B) that the 280G Stockholder Approval was
not obtained and as a consequence, that such payments and/or benefits shall
not be made or provided to the extent they would cause any amounts to
constitute Section 280G Payments, pursuant to the waivers of those payments
and/or benefits, which were executed by the affected individuals prior to the
stockholder vote.

(a) None of Parent, Merger Sub One, Merger Sub Two or the Company shall, and

(b) Each of Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain the Tax opinions described in Section 7.1(h) (collectively, the "Tax

(a) After the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Final
Surviving Entity to, indemnify and hold harmless the individuals who on or

an officer, director or employee of any other corporation, partnership or
joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise with respect

Effective Time to the extent currently provided in the Charter Documents

-74- _EXECUTION COPY_



 

(c) For a period of six (6) years following the Effective Time, Parent and
the Final Surviving Entity shall cause to be maintained in effect the
existing policy of the Companys directors and officers liability insurance
(the "DandO Policy") covering claims arising from facts or events that occurred
at or prior to the Effective Time (including for acts or omissions occurring
in connection with this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby to the extent that such acts or omissions are covered by
the DandO Policy) and covering each Company Indemnified Party who is covered as
of the Effective Time by the DandO Policy on terms with respect to coverage and
amounts that are no less favorable in the aggregate than those terms in effect
on the date hereof; _provided, however_ , that in no event shall Parent or
the Final Surviving Entity be required to expend an amount in excess of two
hundred percent (200%) of the current annual premium for such insurance for
the entire six (6) year period (such amount, the "Maximum Aggregate
Premium"); and provided further, however, that if the aggregate premium of
such insurance coverage exceeds such amount, Parent and the Final Surviving
Entity shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage
available for a cost not exceeding the Maximum Aggregate Premium. Prior to the
Effective Time, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
the Company shall purchase a six-year "tail" prepaid policy on the DandO Policy
on terms and conditions no less advantageous than the DandO Policy. Parent and
the Final Surviving Entity shall maintain such "tail" policy in full force and
effect and continue to honor their respective obligations thereunder, in lieu
of all other obligations of Parent and the Final Surviving Entity under the
first sentence of this Section 6.23(c) for so long as such "tail" policy shall
be maintained in full force and effect.

(d) The obligations under this Section 6.23 shall not be terminated, amended
or otherwise modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Company
Indemnified Party (or any other person who is a beneficiary under the DandO
Policy or the "tail" policy referred to in Section 6.23(c) (and their heirs
and representatives)) without the prior written consent of such affected
Company Indemnified Party or other person who is a beneficiary under the DandO
Policy or the "tail" policy referred to in Section 6.23(c) (and their
heirs and representatives). Each of the Company Indemnified Parties or other
persons who are beneficiaries under the DandO Policy or the "tail" policy
referred to in Section 6.23(c) (and their heirs and representatives)
are intended to be third party beneficiaries of this Section 6.23, with full
rights of enforcement as if a party thereto. The rights of the Company
Indemnified Parties (and other persons who are beneficiaries under the DandO
Policy or the "tail" policy referred to in Section 6.23(c) (and their heirs
and representatives)) under this Section 6.23 shall be in addition to, and not
in substitution for, any other rights that such persons may have under
the certificate or articles of incorporation, bylaws or other equivalent
organizational documents, any and all indemnification agreements of or entered
into by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or applicable Legal
Requirement (whether at law or in equity).

(e) In the event that Parent, the Final Surviving Entity or any of their
Subsidiaries (or any of their respective successors or assigns) shall
consolidate or merge with any other person and shall not be the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger, or transfers
at least fifty percent (50%) of its properties and assets to any other
person, then in each case proper provision shall be made so that the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity (or its successors or assigns,
if applicable), or transferee of such assets, as the case may be, shall assume
the obligations set forth in this Section 6.23.

(f) Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the individuals who on or prior
to the Effective Time were officers or directors of the Company with respect
to any claim made by or on behalf of a Company Stockholder who has not
executed a Stockholder Option that the board of directors or officers of the
Company breached its fiduciary duties in connection with the approval,
execution, delivery or performance of the Stockholder Options; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that this indemnification obligation 



 

-75- _EXECUTION COPY_



 

 shall be strictly excess of the insurance coverage provided by the DandO
Policy and Parent shall not be obligated to make any payments under this
Section 6.23(f) except for amounts in excess of the full limit of such DandO
Policy. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall be obligated to make any
payments under this Section 6.23(f) in any amount in excess of Five Million
Dollars ($5,000,000) in the aggregate for all payments under this Section
6.23(f).

6.24 _Parent Board_. The Parent Board shall take all action necessary such
that, effective as of the Effective Time, (a) the Parent Board shall consist
of ten (10) directors, and (b) Thomas Faulk and John Vincent are appointed to
the Parent Board, appointed to the class of directors with a term expiring in
2011 and 2012, respectively.

6.25 _Stockholder Release_. By virtue of the approval of the Merger and this
Agreement by the Company Securityholders, each of the Company Securityholders
shall be deemed to have agreed to the following:

(a) Each of the Company Securityholders acknowledges (i) that certain prior
purported issuances by the Company of shares of Company Series B Preferred
Stock to certain persons (the " _Affected Stockholders_ ") may have been
improper under the DGCL because they may have been issued prior to the filing
of a certificate of amendment creating the Company Series B Preferred Stock,
and that, as a result, the shares may not represent Company Series B
Preferred Stock and may be void (the " _Issue Defect_ "); and (ii) that the
Company has or may enter into exchange agreements with the Affected
Stockholders pursuant to which the Company expects to issue newly issued
shares of Company Series B Preferred Stock to the Affected Stockholders in
exchange for (the " _Exchange_ ") (A) the interests of the Affected
Stockholders related to the Company Series B Preferred Stock purportedly
previously issued to such Affected Stockholders, (B) the other agreements
described in such exchange agreements, including the full and complete release
by the Affected Stockholders described therein with respect to the Issue
Defect, and (C) other good and valuable consideration, in order to preserve
for the Affected Stockholders the economic interests and other rights in the
Company that the Company intended to convey upon the Affected
Stockholders, and which would have been conveyed upon the Affected
Stockholders if not for the Issue Defect.

(b) Each of the Company Securityholders, on behalf of itself and its
successors, assigns and beneficiaries (the foregoing, collectively the "
_Releasing Parties_ "), hereby irrevocably, unconditionally, fully and finally
releases, remises, acquits and forever discharges the Company and its past,
present and future affiliates, stockholders, controlling persons, partners,
trustees, officers, directors, managers, employees, representatives,
principals, agents, subsidiaries, predecessors, successors, assigns,
beneficiaries, insurers and attorneys (each a " _Company Released Party_ " and
collectively, " _Company Released Parties_ ") of and from any and all actions,
debts, claims, counterclaims, demands, liabilities (including tax
liabilities), damages, causes of action, costs and expenses of every kind and
nature whatsoever, past or present, whether known or unknown, suspected or
unsuspected, both at law and in equity, which any of the Releasing Parties
now has, have ever had or may hereafter have against the Company Released
Parties or any of them relating to or arising out of the Issue Defect, the
Exchange and the issuance of Company Series B Preferred Stock to the Affected
Stockholders in connection with the Exchange, from the beginning of time
through the date this Agreement is adopted and approved at the Company
Stockholders Meeting (the " _Released Claims_ "). Each Releasing Party hereby
irrevocably covenants to refrain from, directly or indirectly, asserting any
claim or demand, or commencing, instituting or causing to be commenced, any
litigation, lawsuit, claim or action of any kind against any Company Released
Party, which arises from, or is alleged to arise from, or relates to, or is
based on, or is any way connection with, in whole or in part, the Released
Claims. Without in any way limiting any of the rights and remedies otherwise
available to any Company Released Party, each Releasing Party, severally and
not jointly, shall 



 

-76- _EXECUTION COPY_



 

 indemnify and hold harmless each Company Released Party from and against all
loss, liability (including tax liabilities), claim, damage (including
incidental and consequential damages) or expense (including costs of
investigation and defense and reasonable attorneys fees) whether or not
involving third party claims, arising directly or indirectly from or in
connection with (i) the assertion by or on behalf of any Releasing Party of
any claim or other matter purported to be released pursuant to this Section
6.25 and (ii) the assertion by any third party of any claim or demand against
any Company Released Party which claim or demand arises directly
or indirectly from, or in connection with, any assertion by or on behalf of
any Releasing Party against such third party of any claims or other matters
purported to be released pursuant to this Section 6.25.

8.5 _Indemnification Claims Procedures._

(a) With respect to Section 8.2(a), any Indemnified Parties may make an
indemnification claim pursuant to Section 8.2(a) by delivering a certificate
(a "Claim Certificate") to the Stockholder Representative, with a copy to the
Escrow Agent (if and to the extent that the Indemnified Parties are seeking
recourse against the Escrow Fund) and to one or more Company Securityholders
(if and to the extent that the Indemnified Parties are seeking recourse
directly against any such Company Securityholders) and any of such parties
also being referred to herein as the "Indemnifying Party"), (i) stating that
such Indemnified Parties have paid, sustained, suffered, incurred or accrued
(or reasonably anticipate that they will have to pay, sustain, suffer, incur,
or accrue) Losses, and (ii) specifying in reasonable detail the Losses
included in the amount so stated, if available, the date each such item was
paid, sustained, suffered, incurred or accrued, if applicable, or the basis
for such anticipated liability, if applicable, and the nature of the
misrepresentation, breach of warranty or covenant to which such item is
related. The failure of an Indemnified Party to exercise promptness in such
notification shall not amount to a waiver of such claim to the extent the
Indemnifying Party is not prejudiced as a result of such failure.

(b) Following its receipt of a Claim Certificate, the Stockholder
Representative shall have thirty (30) calendar days to object to any item(s)
or amount(s) set forth therein by delivering written notice thereof (an
"Objection Notice") to the Indemnified Parties submitting such Claim
Certificate at the addresses of such Indemnified Parties set forth in such
Claim Certificate, with a copy to the Escrow Agent (if and to the extent that
the Indemnified Parties are seeking recourse against the Escrow Fund
in connection with Section 8.2(a). In the event that the Stockholder
Representative shall fail to object, pursuant to this Section 8.5(b) to any
item or amount set forth in an Claim Certificate within the foregoing
thirty (30) calendar day period, the Stockholder Representative shall be
deemed to have irrevocably agreed and consented to each such item or amount.
With respect to claims against the Escrow Fund, upon the expiration of such
thirty (30) day calendar day period, the Escrow Agent shall promptly release
from the Escrow Fund and deliver to any Indemnified Parties that have
previously delivered the Claim Certificate an amount of cash and shares (in
proportion to the relative amount of cash and shares of Parent Common Stock
originally deposited with the Escrow Agent following the Closing) whose
combined value equals any item(s) and amount(s) that the Indemnifying Party is
deemed to have accepted pursuant to this Section 8.5(b).

(c) In the event that the Stockholder Representative shall object, pursuant
to Section 8.5(b) to any item(s) or amount(s) set forth in any Claim
Certificate, the Stockholder Representative and the Indemnified Parties shall
attempt in good faith to agree upon the rights of the respective parties with
respect to each of such claims. If the Stockholder Representative and the
Indemnified Parties should so agree, a memorandum setting forth such agreement
shall be prepared and signed by both parties and, in the case of a claim
against the Escrow Fund, shall be furnished to the Escrow Agent. The Escrow
Agent shall be entitled to rely on any such memorandum and make distributions
from the Escrow Fund in accordance with the terms hereof.

(d) If no such agreement can be reached after good faith negotiation and prior
to thirty (30) calendar days after delivery of an Objection Notice, either
the Stockholder Representative or the Indemnified Parties may demand
arbitration of the matter unless the amount of the Loss that is at issue is
the subject of a pending litigation with a third party, in which
event arbitration shall not be commenced until such amount is ascertained or
both parties agree to arbitration, and in either such event the matter shall
be settled by arbitration conducted by one arbitrator mutually agreeable to
the Stockholder Representative and the Indemnified Parties. In the event
that, within thirty (30) calendar days after submission of any dispute to
arbitration, the Stockholder Representative and the Indemnified Parties cannot
mutually agree on one arbitrator, then, within fifteen (15) calendar days
after the end of such thirty (30) calendar-day period, the Stockholder
Representative and the Indemnified Parties shall each select one (1)
arbitrator. The two (2) arbitrators so selected shall select a third
arbitrator, who shall have relevant industry experience, to conduct the
arbitration.



 

-84- _EXECUTION COPY_



 

(e) Any such arbitration shall be held in Wilmington, Delaware, under the
rules then in effect of the American Arbitration Association. The
arbitrator(s) shall determine how all expenses relating to the arbitration
shall be paid, including the respective expenses of each party, the fees of
each arbitrator and the administrative fee of the American Arbitration
Association. The arbitrator or arbitrators, as the case may be, shall set a
limited time period and establish procedures designed to reduce the cost and
time for discovery while allowing the parties an opportunity, adequate in the
sole judgment of the arbitrator or majority of the three arbitrators, as the
case may be, to discover relevant information from the opposing parties about
the subject matter of the dispute. The arbitrator, or a majority of the
three arbitrators, as the case may be, shall rule upon motions to compel or
limit discovery and shall have the authority to impose sanctions, including
attorneys fees and costs, to the same extent as a competent court of law or
equity, should the arbitrators or a majority of the three arbitrators, as the
case may be, determine that discovery was sought without substantial
justification or that discovery was refused or objected to without substantial
justification. The decision of the arbitrator or a majority of the three
arbitrators, as the case may be, as to the validity and amount of any claim in
such Claim Certificate shall be final, binding, and conclusive upon the
Indemnifying Party or Parties (as a single group, if applicable) and the
Indemnified Parties. Such decision shall be written and shall be supported by
written findings of fact and conclusions which shall set forth the award,
judgment, decree or order awarded by the arbitrator(s). With respect
to claims against the Escrow Fund, the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely
on, and make distributions from the Escrow Fund in accordance with, the terms
of such award, judgment, decree or order as applicable. Within fifteen (15)
calendar days of a decision of the arbitrator(s) requiring payment by one (1)
party to another, such party shall make the payment to such other party,
including any distributions out of the Escrow Fund with respect to Section
8.2(a).

 

(f) Judgment upon any award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered in
any court having jurisdiction.

(g) The foregoing arbitration provisions shall apply to any dispute among any
Indemnifying Party or Parties (as a single group, if applicable) and the
Indemnified Parties under this Article VIII

(h) For purposes of determining the value of Parent Common Stock in the
Escrow Fund used to satisfy indemnification claims for Losses under this
Article VIII, each share of Parent Common Stock shall be valued at $3.75.

8.6 _Third-Party Claims_. In the event that any Indemnified Parties become
aware of a third party claim (a "Third Party Claim") which would reasonably
be expected to result in an indemnification claim pursuant to this Article
VIII, such Indemnified Parties shall promptly notify the Stockholder
Representative (or, in the event indemnification is being sought hereunder
directly from an Indemnifying Party, such Indemnifying Party) of such Third
Party Claim; _provided, however_ , that the failure to give prompt notice
shall not affect the indemnification provided hereunder except to the extent
the Stockholder Representative, on behalf of the Indemnifying Parties, has
been actually prejudiced as a result of such failure. The notice of Third
Party Claim shall include, based on the information then available to the
Indemnified Parties, a summary in reasonable detail of the basis for the Third
Party Claim and a reasonable estimate of the Losses (if such Losses can be
estimated at such time). The Stockholder Representative may upon written
notice to the Indemnified Party undertake and conduct the defense of such
Third Party Claim if (i) the Stockholder Representative provides written
notice to such Indemnified Party that the Stockholder Representative intends
to undertake such defense and that  



 

-85- _EXECUTION COPY_



 

 the Company Securityholders will indemnify the Indemnified Parties against
all Losses resulting from or relating to such Third Party Claim, subject to
the limitations set forth in this Article VIII; (ii) the Stockholder
Representative has the financial resources to defend against such Third Party
Claim and fulfill their indemnification obligations hereunder in respect
thereto; (iii) the Third Party Claim involves only monetary damages that will
be fully covered by the Escrow Fund (taking into account all other pending
claims against the Escrow Fund) and does not seek an injunction or other
equitable relief; and (iv) the defense of the Third Party Claim is conducted
actively and diligently by legal counsel reasonably acceptable to such
Indemnified Party. If the Stockholder Representative does not assume control
of the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall
control such defense. The party not controlling such defense may participate
therein at its own expense; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the Stockholder
Representative assumes control of such defense of a Third Party Claim and the
Indemnified Party determines, based on advice of counsel, that the
Indemnified Party may have available to it one or more defenses or
counterclaims that are inconsistent with one or more of those that may be
available to the Indemnifying Party in respect of such Third Party Claim, the
reasonable fees and expenses of counsel to the Indemnified Party solely in
connection therewith shall be considered "Losses" for purposes of this
Agreement, subject to the limitations of this Article VIII; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in no event shall the Indemnifying Parties be responsible for
the fees and expenses of more than one counsel for all Indemnified Parties.
The Indemnified Party and the Stockholders Representative will render to each
other such assistance as may reasonably be required of each other in order to
insure proper and adequate defense of any Third Party Claim subject to this
Section 8.6. To the extent that the Indemnified Party or the Stockholder
Representative does not participate in the defense of a particular Third Party
Claim, the party so proceeding with such Third Party Claim shall keep the
other party informed of all material developments and events relating to such
Third Party Claim. No Third Party Claim subject to this Section 8.6 shall be
settled, adjusted or compromised without the written consent of both the
Indemnified Party and the Stockholder Representative, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. The Escrow Agent shall
not disburse any portion of the Escrow Fund to any third party except in
accordance with joint written instructions received from Parent and the
Stockholder Representative. In the event that the Stockholder Representative
has consented to any settlement with respect to an indemnification claim under
Section 8.2(a), the Company Securityholders immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall have no power or authority to object under any provision of this
Article VIII to the amount of any Third Party Claim by Parent against the
Escrow Fund with respect to such settlement.

8.7 _Escrow Arrangements_

(a) _Escrow Fund_. By virtue of this Agreement and as security for the
Indemnified Parties under Section 8.2(a) at the Effective Time, Parent shall
deposit with the Escrow Agent the Escrow Amount, such deposit of the Escrow
Amount to constitute an escrow fund to be governed by the terms set forth
herein. The Escrow Amount (collectively, the "Escrow Fund") shall be available
to compensate the Indemnified Parties for any claims by such parties for any
Losses suffered or incurred by them and for which they are entitled to
recovery under this Article VIII; _provided, however_ , that any remaining
portion of the Escrow Fund from and after the end of the Escrow Period shall
be available to compensate the Indemnified Parties for (x) any Unresolved
Claims as of the end of the Escrow Period by such parties for any Losses
suffered or incurred by them and for whom they are entitled to recovery under
Section 8.2(a).

  _provided, however_ , that the Escrow Fund shall not terminate with respect
to any amount in respect of any unsatisfied claims specified in any Claims
Certificate in connection with Section 8.2(a) delivered prior to the Escrow
Period termination date with respect to facts and circumstances existing prior
to the Expiration Date ("Unresolved Claims"), and any such amount shall not be
distributed to the Company Securityholders at such time. As soon as all
Unresolved Claims have been resolved, the Escrow Agent shall deliver the
remaining portion of the Escrow Fund, if any, required to satisfy such
Unresolved Claims, (i) first, to the Stockholder Representative for any
Stockholder Representative Expenses (as defined below), and (ii) second, to
the Company Securityholders. Deliveries of the Escrow Amount out of the Escrow
Fund to the Company Securityholders pursuant to this Section 8.7 shall be
made in proportion to their respective Pro Rata Portions of the remaining
amounts in the Escrow Fund, with the amount delivered to each Company
Securityholders rounded to the nearest one hundredth (0.01) (with amounts
0.005 and above rounded up) of a cent or nearest whole share of Parent Common
Stock, as applicable. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
Escrow Amount payable pursuant to this Agreement to any former holder of
Company Capital Stock, or a Company Warrant such amounts as may be required to
be deducted or withheld therefrom under any provision of federal, state, local
or foreign tax Law or under any applicable legal requirement. To the extent
such amounts are so deducted or withheld, such amounts shall be treated for
all purposes as having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would
otherwise have been paid.

(c) _Protection of Escrow Fund_.

(i) The Escrow Agent shall hold and safeguard the Escrow Fund during the
Escrow Period, shall treat such fund as a trust fund in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement and shall hold and dispose of the Escrow Fund only in
accordance with the terms of this Article VIII and Section 2.9.

(ii) The Escrow Agent shall follow the joint written instructions of Parent
and the Stockholder Representative (a "Joint Instruction") concerning any
investment or reinvestment from time to time of the funds held in the Escrow
Account;  _provided that_ permissible investments shall be limited to: (a)
obligations issued or guaranteed by the United States or by any Person
controlled or supervised by or acting as an instrumentality of the United
States or by any Person controlled or supervised by or acting as an
instrumentality of the United States pursuant to authority granted by
Congress; (b) obligations issued or guaranteed by any state or political
subdivision thereof rated either AA or higher, or MIG 1 or higher, by Moodys
Investors Service, Inc. ("Moodys") or AA or higher, or an equivalent, by
Standard and Poors Corporation ("Standard and Poors"); (c) commercial
or finance paper which is rated either Prime-1 or higher or an equivalent by
Moodys or A-1 or higher or an equivalent by Standard and Poors or their
successors; and (d) certificates of deposit, time deposits, or short-
term market instruments of banks or trust companies, organized under the laws
of the United States and having minimum equity of $500,000,000; (e) money
market funds subject to the requirements of the Investment Company Act of
1940, as amended, invested in any one or more of the aforementioned types of
instruments, which have a rating in the highest category granted thereby by a
nationally recognized credit rating agency at the time of investment. In the
absence of the Joint Instruction described above, the Escrow Agent shall
invest the Escrow Funds, to the extent reasonably practicable, in the
Federated Prime Obligations Trust Shares Fund #700. For Tax reporting and
withholding purposes, the Escrow Fund shall be treated as owned by Parent,
which shall be treated as having received interest or other income actually
earned on the Escrow Fund and contributed such interest or other income to the
Escrow Fund. Upon release of amounts from the Escrow Fund, a portion of any
such amounts distributed to the Company Securityholders shall be treated as
interest under the imputed interest rules of the Code, which shall be treated
as a deduction by Parent. Each Company Stockholder shall provide any necessary
Tax forms, including Form W-9 or the appropriate series of Form W-8, as
applicable, or any similar form requested by the Escrow Agent with respect to
any "original issue discount" or "unstated interest" with respect to
distributions from the Escrow Fund.

duties as are specifically set forth herein, and as set forth in any
additional written escrow instructions which the Escrow Agent may receive
after the date of this Agreement which are signed by an officer of Parent and
the Stockholder Representative, and may rely and shall be protected in relying

arbitrators. In case the Escrow Agent obeys or complies with any such order,
judgment or decree of any court, award of arbitrator or instructions, the

Person by reason of such compliance, notwithstanding any such order, judgment,
decree or award being subsequently reversed, modified, annulled, set aside,
vacated or found to have been entered without jurisdiction.

protected in any act taken, suffered, or permitted by him/her in good faith in
accordance with the advice of counsel. The Escrow Agent is not responsible for
determining and verifying the authority of any person acting or purporting to
act on behalf of any party to this Agreement.

(vi) If any controversy arises between the parties to this Agreement, or with
any other party, concerning the subject matter of this Agreement, its terms or
conditions, the Escrow Agent will not be required to determine the controversy
or to take any action regarding it. The Escrow Agent may hold all documents
and the Escrow Amount and may wait for settlement of any such controversy by
final appropriate legal proceedings or other means as, in the Escrow Agents
discretion, may be required, despite what may be set forth elsewhere in this
Agreement. In such event, the Escrow Agent will not be liable for damages.
Furthermore, the Escrow Agent may at its option, file an action of

be paid by the Company Securityholders on the basis of the Company
Securityholders and such holders respective Pro Rata Portions; _provided,

that Parent may at its option pay such Company Stockholders or holders Pro
Rata Portion of the Agent Interpleader Expenses and recover an equal amount
from such Company Stockholders or holders Pro Rata Portion of the Escrow
Fund. Upon initiating such action, the Escrow Agent shall be fully released
and discharged of and from all obligations and liability imposed by the terms
of this Agreement.

(vii) The parties and their respective successors and assigns agree jointly
and severally to indemnify and hold Escrow Agent harmless against any and all
losses, claims, damages, liabilities, and expenses, including reasonable costs
of investigation, counsel fees, including allocated costs of in house counsel
and disbursements that may be imposed on Escrow Agent or incurred by Escrow
Agent in connection with the performance of his/her duties under this
Agreement, including any litigation arising from this Agreement or involving
its subject matter, other than those arising out of the negligence or willful
misconduct of the Escrow Agent (the "Agent Indemnification Expenses") as
follows: 50% to be paid by Parent and 50% to be paid by the Company
Securityholders on the basis of the Company Securityholders and holders
respective Pro Rata Portions; _provided, however_ , that in the event any

Agent Indemnification Expenses and recover an equal amount from such Company
Stockholders or holders Pro Rata Portion of the Escrow Fund.

written notice to Parent and the Stockholder Representative;  _provided,
however_ , that no such resignation shall become effective until the
appointment of a successor escrow agent which shall be accomplished as
follows: Parent and the Stockholder Representative shall use their best
efforts to mutually agree on a successor escrow agent within thirty (30) days
after receiving such notice. If the parties fail to agree upon a successor
escrow agent within such time, the Escrow Agent shall have the right to
appoint a successor escrow agent. The successor escrow agent shall execute
and deliver an instrument accepting such appointment, and it shall, without
further acts, be vested with all the estates, properties, rights, powers, and
duties of the predecessor escrow agent as if originally named as escrow
agent. Upon appointment of a successor escrow agent, the Escrow Agent shall be
discharged from any further duties and liability under this Agreement.

(e) _Fees_. All fees of the Escrow Agent for performance of its duties
hereunder shall be paid by Parent in accordance with the standard fee schedule
of the Escrow Agent. It is understood that the fees and usual charges agreed
upon for services of the Escrow Agent shall be considered compensation for
ordinary services as contemplated by this Agreement. In the event that the
conditions of this Agreement are not promptly fulfilled, or if the Escrow
Agent renders any service not provided for in this Agreement but that has been
requested by an officer of Parent, or if the parties request a substantial
modification of the terms of the Agreement, or if any controversy arises, or
if the Escrow Agent is made a party to, or intervenes in, any litigation
pertaining to the Escrow Fund or its subject matter, the Escrow Agent shall be
reasonably compensated for such extraordinary services and reimbursed for all
costs, attorneys fees, including allocated costs of in house counsel, and
expenses occasioned by such default, delay, controversy or litigation.

(f) _Successor Escrow Agents_. Any corporation into which the Escrow Agent in
its individual capacity may be merged or converted or with which it may be
consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or
consolidation to which the Escrow Agent in its individual capacity shall be a
party, or any corporation to which substantially all the corporate trust
business of the Escrow Agent in its individual capacity may be transferred,
shall be the Escrow Agent under this Agreement without further act.

8.8 _Stockholder Representative._

(a) By virtue of the approval of the Merger and this Agreement by the Company
Securityholders, each of the Company Securityholders shall be deemed to have
agreed to appoint John Vincent as its agent and attorney-in-fact, as the
Stockholder Representative for and on behalf of the Company Securityholders to
give and receive notices and communications, to authorize payment to any
Indemnified Parties from the Escrow Fund in satisfaction of claims by such
Indemnified Parties pursuant to Section 8.1(a), to object to such payments, to
agree to, negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of, and demand
arbitration and comply with orders of courts and awards of arbitrators
with respect to such claims, to assert, negotiate, enter into settlements and
compromises of, and demand arbitration and comply with orders of courts and
awards of arbitrators with respect to, any other claim by any Indemnified
Parties against any Company Stockholder or by any such Company Stockholder or
holder against any Indemnified Parties or any dispute between any Indemnified
Parties and any such Company Stockholder or holder, in each case relating to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, and to take all other
actions that are either (i) necessary or appropriate in the judgment of the
Stockholder Representative for the accomplishment of the foregoing or (ii)
specifically mandated by the terms of this Agreement. Such agency may be
changed by the Company Securityholders from time to time upon not less than 30
days prior written notice to Parent; _provided, however_ , that the
Stockholder Representative may not be removed unless holders of a majority of
the Company Capital Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time agree to
such removal and to the identity of the substituted agent. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, a vacancy in the position of Stockholder Representative may be
filled by the holders of a majority of the Company Capital Stock immediately
prior to the Effective Time. No bond shall be required of the Stockholder
Representative, and the Stockholder Representative shall not receive any
compensation for its services. Notices or communications to or from the
Stockholder Representative shall constitute notice to or from the Company
Securityholders.

(b) The Stockholder Representative shall not be liable for any act done or
omitted hereunder as Stockholder Representative while acting in good faith and
in the exercise of reasonable judgment. The Company Securityholders shall
indemnify the Stockholder Representative and hold the Stockholder
Representative harmless against any loss, liability or expense incurred
without gross negligence or bad faith on the part of the Stockholder
Representative and arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or
administration of the Stockholder Representatives duties hereunder, including
the reasonable fees and expenses of any legal counsel retained by the
Stockholder Representative and any fees and expenses incurred by
the Stockholder Representative in connection with this Agreement
(collectively, "Stockholder Representative Expenses"). If then available after
satisfaction of all claims of Indemnified Parties, the Stockholder
Representative shall have the right to recover Stockholder Representative
Expenses from the Escrow Fund prior to any distribution to the Company
Securityholders, and prior to any such distribution, shall deliver to the
Escrow Agent or Parent, as the case may be, a certificate setting forth the
Stockholder Representative Expenses actually incurred. A decision, act,
consent or instruction of the Stockholder Representative, including an
amendment, extension or waiver of this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.4 and
Section 9.5, shall constitute a decision of the Company Securityholders and
shall be final, binding and conclusive upon the Company Securityholders; and
the Escrow Agent and Parent may rely upon any such decision, act, consent or
instruction of the Stockholder Representative as being the decision, act,
consent or instruction of the Company Securityholders. The Escrow Agent and
Parent are hereby relieved from any liability to any person for any acts done
by them in accordance with such decision, act, consent or instruction of the
Stockholder Representative.

the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Parent Disclosure Schedule, the
Reciprocal Confidentiality Agreement, and the documents and instruments and
other agreements among the parties hereto referenced herein constitute the
entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof
and supersede all prior agreements and understandings both written and oral,
among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof.

10.5 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement, the Exhibits and
Schedules hereto, the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Parent Disclosure
Schedule, the Reciprocal Confidentiality Agreement, and the documents and

reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties further
agree to replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a

the economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable
provision.

10.8 _Other Remedies_. Any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a

MERGER SUBS OR THE COMPANY IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION,
PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT HEREOF.

10.12 _Specific Performance_. The parties agree that irreparable damage would
occur and that the parties would not have any adequate remedy at law in the
event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is

injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement, this being in addition to any
