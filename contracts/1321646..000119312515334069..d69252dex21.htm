(e) Buyer, Seller and the Company shall make such other deliveries as are

1.6 _Purchase Price Determination_.

 

(a) _Estimated Closing Statement_. Not less than three (3) Business Days
(provided that such time period shall be one (1) Business Day if Buyer makes
the election set forth in clause (ii) of the proviso in _Section 1.3_) prior
to the anticipated Closing Date, Seller shall deliver to Buyer a statement
(the " _Estimated Closing Statement_ ") setting forth SellerÂ’s good faith
calculation of the Estimated Purchase Price and reasonably detailed supporting
calculations demonstrating each component thereof,

 



2  including Estimated Cash, Estimated Indebtedness, Estimated Net Working
Capital and Estimated Transaction Expenses. The Estimated Closing Statement
shall be prepared based upon the books and records of the Company and its
Subsidiaries in accordance with the definitions as provided in this Agreement
and the Accounting Methodology, and shall be accompanied with all supporting
schedules on which such estimates are based or from which they are derived.
Not less than three (3) Business Days (provided that such time period shall be
one (1) Business Day if Buyer makes the election set forth in clause (ii) of
the proviso in _Section 1.3_) prior to the anticipated Closing Date, Buyer
shall deliver to Seller a statement (the " _Estimated Adjustment Amount
Statement_ ") setting forth BuyerÂ’s good faith calculation of the Estimated
Adjustment Amount and reasonably detailed supporting calculations thereto.
The Estimated Closing Statement and the Estimated Adjustment Amount Statement
shall be binding on the parties hereto for purposes of this _Section 1.6(a)_
and for purposes of determining the Estimated Purchase Price in _Section
1.5(a)_. Attached hereto as _Exhibit A_ is a calculation of (i) Cash and Cash
Equivalents, (ii) Indebtedness and (iii) Net Working Capital, in each case, as
of the Balance Sheet Date and based upon the books and records of the Company
and its Subsidiaries in accordance with the definitions as provided in this
Agreement and the Accounting Methodology.

 

(b) _Post-Closing Date Purchase Price Adjustments_. As promptly as
practicable, but no later than ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, Buyer
shall cause to be prepared (with assistance from Seller, as reasonably
requested and upon reasonable notice) and delivered to Seller a statement (the
" _Closing Statement_ ") setting forth BuyerÂ’s good faith calculation of the
Purchase Price and reasonably detailed supporting papers and calculations
demonstrating each component thereof, including Cash and Cash Equivalents,
Indebtedness, Net Working Capital, Transaction Expenses and Adjustment Amount.
The Closing Statement shall (i) be prepared based upon the books and records
of the Company and its Subsidiaries in accordance with the definitions as
provided in this Agreement and the Accounting Methodology, and shall be
accompanied with all supporting schedules on which such estimates are based
or from which they are derived, and (ii) not include any changes in assets or
liabilities as a result of purchase accounting adjustments or other changes
arising from or resulting as a consequence of the transactions contemplated
hereby. The post-Closing purchase price adjustment as set forth in this
_Section 1.6(b)_ is not intended to permit the introduction of different
accounting methods, policies, practices, procedures, classifications,
conventions, categorizations, definitions, principles, judgments, assumptions,
techniques or estimation methods with respect to financial statements
(including any of the foregoing as they relate to the nature of accounts,
calculation of levels of reserves or levels of accruals) from the Accounting
Methodology or the accounts used and included in determining the amount of the
Target Net Working Capital.

 

(c) _Dispute Resolution Procedures_.

 

(i) If Seller disagrees with BuyerÂ’s calculation of the Purchase Price or any
component thereof, including the calculation of Cash and Cash Equivalents,
Indebtedness, Net Working Capital, Transaction Expenses or Adjustment Amount
as set forth in the Closing Statement delivered pursuant to _Section 1.6(b)_,
Seller may, within thirty (30) days after delivery of the Closing Statement,
deliver a notice to Buyer providing reasonable detail of the reasons for such
disagreement and setting forth SellerÂ’s calculation of the items and amounts
in dispute. Any such notice of disagreement shall specify all items
or amounts as to which Seller disagrees, and Seller shall be deemed to have
agreed with all other items and amounts, and the calculation thereof, set
forth in the Closing Statement.

 

(ii) If a notice of disagreement shall be properly delivered pursuant to
_Section 1.6(c)(i)_, Seller and Buyer shall, during the thirty (30) days
following such delivery, negotiate in good faith to reach written agreement on
the disputed items or amounts. The matters set forth in any written resolution
executed by Seller and Buyer shall be final and binding on the parties on the
date of such written resolution.

 



3 (iii) If Seller and Buyer are unable to reach such agreement during such
thirty (30) day period, they shall promptly (and in any event, within thirty
(30) days) thereafter submit any matters in dispute to the independent
accounting firm of Grant Thornton LLP (the " _Independent Accountant_ ") for
resolution, who shall act as an accounting expert and not as an arbitrator.
The Independent Accountant shall deliver to Seller and Buyer, as promptly as
practicable (but in no event later than thirty (30) days from the date of
engagement of the Independent Accountant), a written report as to the
resolution of each disputed item, accompanied by a certificate of the
Independent Accountant that it reached such determination in accordance with
the definitions as provided in this Agreement and the Accounting Methodology.
Such report shall be final and binding on the parties and shall not be subject
to further review or appeal (absent manifest arithmetical error). The
Independent Accountant shall consider only those items and amounts
in SellerÂ’s and BuyerÂ’s respective calculations of Cash and Cash Equivalents,
Indebtedness, Net Working Capital, Transaction Expenses or Adjustment Amount,
including each of the components thereof, that are identified as being items
and amounts to which Seller and Buyer have been unable to agree. The
Independent AccountantÂ’s determination of any disputed item shall be (x) based
solely on (i) written materials submitted by Seller and Buyer (or by in-person
or telephonic conferences if mutually agreed to by Buyer, Seller and the
Independent Accountant) and not by independent review, and (ii) the Accounting
Methodology, _Exhibit A_ and the definitions and the other provisions included
herein, and (y) within the range of the amounts proposed by Buyer and Seller.
Until the calculations of Cash and Cash Equivalents, Indebtedness, Net Working
Capital, Transaction Expenses or Adjustment Amount, including each of the
components thereof, have been finally determined pursuant hereto, neither
Buyer nor Seller shall without the prior consent of Seller (in the case of
Buyer) or Buyer (in the case of Seller), (A) have any ex parte conversations
or meetings with the Independent Accountant, or (B) engage the Independent
Accountant or any of its Affiliates to perform any new services other than as
Independent Accountant pursuant hereto. Each party agrees to execute a
reasonable engagement letter, if such letter is required by the Independent
Accountant. The fees and expenses of the Independent Accountant with respect
to any disputed amounts that are submitted to the Independent Accountant for
resolution as provided in this _Section 1.6(c)(iii)_ (the " _Accountant
Fees_ ") will be paid by and apportioned between Buyer and Seller based on the
aggregate dollar amount of the amount in dispute and inversely related to the
relative recovery as determined by the Independent Accountant of Seller and
Buyer, respectively. For example, if the aggregate dollar amount in dispute is
$1,000,000 and the relative recovery of Seller and Buyer as determined by the
Independent Accountant is $900,000 and $100,000, respectively, then Buyer will
be apportioned responsibility for 90% of the Accountant Fees and Seller will
be apportioned responsibility for 10% of the Accountant Fees.

 

(iv) The Closing Statement (and each of the components thereof) shall become
final and binding on the parties (A) on the thirty-first (31st) day following
the delivery of the Closing Statement if a notice of disagreement has not been
delivered to Buyer by Seller, (B) with such changes as are necessary to
reflect matters resolved pursuant to any written resolution executed pursuant
to _Section 1.6(c)(ii)_, on the date such resolution is executed, if all
outstanding matters are resolved through such resolution, and/or (C) with such
changes as are necessary to reflect the Independent AccountantÂ’s resolution
of the matters in dispute (together with any changes necessary to reflect
matters previously resolved pursuant to any written resolution executed
pursuant to _Section 1.6(c)(ii)_ and any matters not disputed pursuant to a
notice of disagreement), on the date the Independent Accountant delivers its
final, binding resolution pursuant to _Section 1.6(c)(iii)_ (the Closing

(f) The parties hereto (i) shall, and shall cause their respective
representatives to, cooperate and (ii) shall make available to one another and
their respective employees and representatives and, if applicable, the

Termination Fee to, or as directed by, Seller, as promptly as reasonably
practicable (and, in any event, within three (3) Business Days following such
termination) by wire transfer of same day funds.

 

(b) The parties hereto acknowledge that the agreements contained in this
_Section 2.3_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the parties hereto would not
otherwise enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if Buyer fails to pay the
Buyer Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 2.3(a)_ on or prior to the date
such amount is due hereunder, and, in order to obtain such payment, an action
or proceeding is commenced by any party with respect to the potential payment
of the Buyer Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 2.3(a)_, the non-
prevailing party in such action shall pay, or cause to be paid, to the
prevailing party (i) the reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable
attorneyÂ’s fees and expenses) incurred by the prevailing party and its
Affiliates in connection with such action or proceeding and (ii) if the
prevailing party is Seller, interest on the Buyer Termination Fee at an annual
rate equal to the prime rate as published in the Wall Street Journal in effect

Company) against Buyer (including its Affiliates) and the Financing Sources
for, and Seller shall be deemed to have waived all other remedies (including
equitable remedies) with respect to, the failure of the Transaction to be
consummated or with respect to any loss or damage suffered as a result
thereof, any breach by Buyer of its obligation to consummate the
Transaction or the Financing or any breach by Buyer of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement set forth herein or in the Commitment Letter
or in any document related to the Financing, and upon payment of such amount,
Buyer shall have no further liability or obligation relating to or arising
out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
_provided_ , _however_ , that, for the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this
Agreement shall be construed to relieve Buyer of its obligation to pay the
Buyer Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 2.3(a)_ in connection with the
termination of this Agreement by reason of Seller seeking to obtain specific
performance of this Agreement in accordance with  _Section 8.2_ prior to the
termination of this Agreement.

(d) The parties hereto hereby agree that the Buyer Termination Fee
is liquidated damages in a reasonable amount and not a penalty, and the
payment of the Buyer Termination Fee in the circumstances specified in this
Agreement is supported by due and sufficient consideration. For the avoidance
of doubt, under no circumstances shall Seller be entitled or permitted to
receive (i) monetary damages for any breach by Buyer of this Agreement the
aggregate amount of which, together with any portion of the Buyer Termination
Fee paid to Seller by Buyer pursuant to _Section 2.3(a)_, exceeds the amount
of the Buyer Termination Fee, (ii) both a grant of an injunction, specific
performance or other equitable relief pursuant to _Section 8.2_, pursuant to
which the Closing occurs, and any money damages, including all or any portion
of the Buyer Termination Fee, or (iii) the Buyer Termination Fee on more than

6.8_, _Article 8_ and  _Article 9_ , in the event that this Agreement is
validly terminated in accordance with _Section 2.1_, then each of the parties
shall be relieved of its duties and obligations arising under this Agreement
after the date and time of such termination and such termination shall be
without liability to the Company and Seller on the one hand, or Buyer on the
other hand; _provided_ , _however_ , subject to _Section 2.3(c)_, that no
such termination shall relieve any party hereto from liability or damages
(which the parties acknowledge and agree shall not be limited to reimbursement
of expenses or out-of-pocket costs) for Willful Breach of any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement prior to termination.

(b) The Confidentiality Agreement shall survive any termination of this
Agreement in accordance with its terms, shall be automatically extended until

5.7 _Financial Capability_. The financing for the purpose of paying the
Purchase Price, including all amounts set forth in  _Section 1.2_ and
BuyerÂ’s fees and expenses relating to the Transaction will consist of debt
and/or equity financing provided to Buyer, which may consist of proceeds from
a loan or the sale of debt and/or equity securities (collectively, the "
_Financing_ "). Buyer has delivered to Seller true and complete copies of that
certain fully executed debt commitment letter (including all exhibits,
annexes, schedules, term sheets and an executed fee letter (which may be
redacted to omit fee amounts, pricing caps and market "flex" provisions
contained therein to the extent required by the terms of such debt commitment
letters (none of which would reasonably be expected to adversely affect or
delay the availability of the Financing)), each dated as of the date hereof,
from Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, Credit Suisse AG, Nomura Securities
International, Inc., Deutsche Bank AG New York Branch, Deutsche Bank AG Cayman
Islands Branch and Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., pursuant to which such
financial institutions have agreed, subject to the terms and conditions
thereof, to lend the amounts set forth therein for the purposes of funding the
Estimated Purchase Price at Closing (collectively, the " _Commitment Letter_
"). As of the date hereof, the Commitment Letter is in full force and effect

the Company). As of the date hereof, assuming the accuracy of the
representations and warranties of Seller and the Company under this Agreement
and the performance by the Seller and the Company of their obligations
hereunder, Buyer has no reason to believe that it or any of the other parties
to the Commitment Letter will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis any term
or condition of the Commitment Letter required to be satisfied by it, and that
any portion of the Financing to be made thereunder will otherwise not be
available to Buyer as of the Closing. Buyer has fully paid any fees or
other amounts to the Financing Sources in connection with the

 



27  Financing required to be paid prior to the execution of this Agreement. The
obligations of the other parties to the Commitment Letter to fund the full
amount of the Financing to Buyer pursuant to the terms of the Commitment
Letter are not subject to any conditions precedent, "flex" provisions or other
conditions related to the funding of the full amount of the Financing other
than as set forth in the Commitment Letter, and Buyer has not agreed to any
other contingencies or rights that would permit the parties thereto to reduce
the total amount of the Financing contemplated by the Commitment Letter, other
than as set forth in the Commitment Letter. As of the date hereof, there are
no contracts, agreements, "side letters", arrangements or understandings
(other than for customary fee credit letters, structuring fee letters and
engagement letters) related to the Financing under the Commitment Letter
other than as expressly set forth in the Commitment Letter. Assuming the
Financing is funded in accordance with the Commitment Letter, the aggregate
proceeds contemplated by the Commitment Letter (after netting out fees,
expenses, original issue discount, and similar premiums and charges and after
giving effect to the maximum amount of "flex" and original issue discount
provided under the Commitment Letter or "flex" arrangements entered into in
connection therewith), together with available and unrestricted cash of

any adjustments thereto in accordance with this Agreement) and all fees,
costs, expenses and other amounts payable by Buyer on the terms or in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.

had access to and the opportunity to review all of the documents in the "data
room" maintained by Intralinks, Inc. on behalf of the Company and Seller, and

and to do, or cause to be done as promptly as practicable, all things
necessary, proper and advisable under applicable Laws to consummate and make
effective as promptly as practicable the Transaction. Subject to appropriate
confidentiality protections, each party hereto shall furnish to the other
parties such necessary information and reasonable assistance as such other
party may reasonably request in connection with the foregoing.

 

(b) Each of the parties shall cooperate with one another in good faith and use
its reasonable best efforts to prepare all necessary documentation (including

by this Agreement. Each party hereto shall provide to the other parties copies

Antitrust Entity relating to the Transaction or any of the matters described
in this  _Section 6.3_. Each such party shall promptly inform the other
parties hereto of any oral communication with, and provide copies of written
communications with any Governmental Body regarding any such filings or any
such transaction. No party hereto shall independently participate in any
formal meeting with any Governmental Body in respect of any such filings,

notice of the meeting and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Body,
the opportunity to attend and/or participate. Subject to applicable Law, the
parties hereto will consult and cooperate with one another in connection with
any analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments,
opinions and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any party hereto
relating to proceedings under the HSR Act or other Competition Laws.

 

(c) Without limiting the generality of the undertakings pursuant to this
_Section 6.3_, the parties hereto shall provide or cause to be provided as
promptly as practicable to any Governmental Antitrust Entity information and
documents requested or required to be submitted by any Governmental Antitrust

Competition Law, as set forth in _Schedule X_. Fees associated with filings
required by the HSR Act and any other applicable Competition Law shall be
borne by Buyer.

 



32 (d) Further, each of the parties hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts
to resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted by any Governmental
Antitrust Entity with respect to the Transaction under any Competition Law. In
connection therewith, if any Legal Proceeding is instituted (or threatened to
be instituted) challenging the Transaction as in violation of any Competition
Law, each of parties hereto shall cooperate and use its reasonable best
efforts to contest and resist any such Legal Proceeding. Buyer and the Company
shall make reasonable best efforts to take any and all actions necessary as
may be required to cause the expiration of the notice periods under the HSR
Act or other Competition Laws with respect to the Transaction as promptly as
possible after the execution of this Agreement, _provided_ ,  _however_ ,
that, solely to the extent that it would constitute an Adverse Competition
Effect, neither Buyer or Company shall be required to:

 

(i) (A) sell, divest, hold separate, license, cause a third party to acquire,
or otherwise dispose of, any Subsidiary, operations, divisions, businesses,
product lines, customers or assets of Buyer, its Affiliates, the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries contemporaneously with or after the Closing and
regardless as to whether a third party Buyer has been identified or approved
prior to the Closing (a " _Divestiture_ "), (B) take or commit to take such
other actions that may limit Buyer, its Affiliates, the Company or any of its
SubsidiariesÂ’ freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to retain, one
or more of its operations, divisions, businesses, products lines, customers
or assets, or (C) to enter into any Order, consent decree or other agreement
to effectuate any of the foregoing, or to

 

(ii) terminate any Contract or other business relationship as may be required
to obtain any necessary clearance of any Governmental Antitrust Authority or
to obtain termination of any applicable waiting period under any Competition
Laws.

(e) Buyer shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, acquire or agree
to acquire, by merging with or into or consolidating with, or by purchasing a
substantial portion of the assets of or equity in, or by any other manner, any
business or any corporation, partnership, association or other business
organization or division thereof, or otherwise acquire or agree to acquire any
assets, if the entering into of a definitive agreement relating to, or the
consummation of such acquisition, merger or consolidation could reasonably
be expected to: (i) impose any delay in the obtaining of, or increase the
risk of not obtaining, any consents of any Governmental Antitrust Entity
necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or the expiration
or termination of any applicable waiting period; (ii) increase the risk of
any Governmental Antitrust Entity entering an Order prohibiting the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby; (iii) increase the risk
of not being able to remove any such Order on appeal or otherwise; or (iv)
delay or prevent the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

6.4 _Further Assurances_. Other than as provided in _Section 6.3_, each of
the parties hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i) take all
actions necessary or appropriate to consummate the Transaction and (ii) cause
the fulfillment at the earliest practicable date of all of the conditions to
their respective obligations to consummate the Transaction.

6.5  _Confidentiality_.

(a) The terms of the Confidentiality Agreement are incorporated into this
Agreement by reference and the parties covenant and agree to keep
confidential in accordance with the provisions of the Confidentiality
Agreement information provided to each other pursuant to this Agreement.
Effective upon, and only upon, the Closing Date, the Confidentiality
Agreement shall terminate, and (in accordance with _Section 2.4(b)_)
effective upon the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 2.1_,
the Confidentiality Agreement shall be automatically extended until the date
that is two (2) years following the date of such termination.

(b) For a period of one (1) year from and after the Closing, Seller
shall, and shall cause AS-AZC Holdings LLC and its affiliated investment
funds to, hold in confidence any and all information, whether written or oral,
relating to the Company, except to the extent that Seller can show that such
information (a) is generally available to and known by the public through no
fault of Seller, any of its affiliates or their respective advisors and
representatives; or (b) is lawfully acquired by Seller, any of its affiliates
or their respective advisors and representatives from and after the Closing
from sources which are not prohibited from disclosing such information by a
legal, contractual or fiduciary obligation; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
foregoing shall not prevent (i) any investment fund affiliated with American

 



33  Securities LLC or Rhone Capital III L.P. from distributing investment return
and other similar information to such investment fundÂ’s underlying investors,
or (ii) the use of any general information with respect to the business of
the Company and its Subsidiaries or the industry in which they operate, so
long as such information is not specific to the Company and its Subsidiaries.
If Seller or any of its Affiliates or their respective advisors and
representatives are compelled to disclose any information by judicial or
administrative process or by other requirements of Law, Seller shall promptly
notify Buyer in writing and shall disclose only that portion of
such information which Seller is advised by its counsel in writing is legally
required to be disclosed, provided that Seller shall use reasonable best
efforts to obtain an appropriate protective order or other reasonable
assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded such information. This
_Section 6.5(b)_ does not apply to Tax Returns and records relating to Taxes,
which are subject to _Section 6.10(a)_.

 

6.6 _Director and Officer Indemnification and Insurance_.

 

(a) Buyer agrees that after the Closing, it shall not permit the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries to amend, repeal or modify any provision in their
respective certificate of incorporation, by-laws or comparable organizational
documents or any indemnification agreements or arrangements of the Company and
its Subsidiaries in a manner that would adversely affect the rights
and/or exculpation or indemnification of present or former directors and
officers of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date, it
being the intent of the parties that the directors and officers of the Company
and its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing shall continue thereafter to be
entitled to such rights of exculpation and indemnification to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable Laws until at least the sixth (6th)
anniversary of the Closing, and Buyer agrees to cause the Company and its
Subsidiaries to perform in a timely manner and to otherwise honor such
obligations in all respects.

(b) On or immediately prior to the Closing Date, Buyer and the Company shall
cause to be purchased a six (6) year tail insurance policy (the cost of which
shall be borne by Buyer) with respect to officersÂ’ and directorsÂ’ liability
insurance covering the Persons who are presently covered by the CompanyÂ’s and
its SubsidiariesÂ’ officersÂ’ and directorsÂ’ liability insurance policy, with
respect to actions and omissions occurring prior to the Closing, on terms
which are at least as favorable as the terms of such insurance in effect for
the Company and its Subsidiaries on the date hereof and from an insurer or
insurers having claims paying ratings no lower than the CompanyÂ’s and its
SubsidiariesÂ’ current insurer.

(c) The obligations of Buyer under this _Section 6.6_ shall not be terminated
or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any of the individuals
who on or prior to the Closing Date were directors, officers, managers,
agents, stockholders or employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(collectively, the " _Indemnitees_ ") to whom this _Section 6.6_ applies
without the consent of the affected Indemnitee (it being expressly agreed that
the Indemnitees to whom this _Section 6.6_ applies shall be third party
beneficiaries of this _Section 6.6_). 

(d) In the event that Buyer or the Company (following the Closing) or any of
their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into
any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, Buyer shall take all action reasonably necessary so that the
successors or assigns of Buyer or the Company (following the Closing), as the
case may be, shall assume all of the obligations of Buyer and the Company, as
applicable, set forth in this _Section 6.6_.

6.7 _Preservation of Records_. Buyer shall, and following the Closing shall
cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to, preserve and keep the records held
by them relating to the respective business for a period of seven (7) years
from the Closing Date (or longer if required by applicable Law) 

 



34  and shall make such records and personnel available to Seller as may be
reasonably required by Seller in connection with, among other things, any
insurance claims by, Legal Proceedings or tax audits against or governmental
investigations of, Seller or any of its Affiliates or in order to enable
Seller to comply with its obligations under this Agreement and each of the
Company Documents and the Seller Documents, as applicable. In the event Buyer
wishes to destroy such records after that time, Buyer shall first give thirty
(30) days prior written notice to Seller and Seller shall have the right at
its option and expense, upon prior written notice given to Buyer within
such thirty (30) day period, to take possession of the records. This _Section
6.7_ does not apply to Tax Returns and records relating to Taxes, which are
subject to _Section 6.10(a)_.

 

6.8 _Publicity_. Neither Buyer nor Seller shall, directly or indirectly, issue
any press release, public announcement or filing of any kind concerning the
Transaction without the prior written consent of the other parties hereto,
except where such press release, public announcement or filing is required by
applicable Law or stock exchange requirements and only to the extent required
by such Law or stock exchange requirement; _provided_ , that Buyer, Seller and
their Affiliates are permitted to report and disclose the status of this
Agreement and the Transaction to its direct and indirect limited partners
and prospective limited partners in connection with fund raising, marketing,
information or reporting activities of the kind customarily provided with
respect to investments of this kind; and, _provided_ , _further_ , that the
foregoing shall not restrict or prevent the Company or Buyer from making any
announcements to their respective employees, customers, and other business
relations to the extent the Company or Buyer, as applicable, determines in
good faith that such announcement is necessary or advisable. In the event any
such press release, public announcement or filing is required by applicable
Law or stock exchange requirement, Buyer and the Company will use commercially
reasonable efforts to allow the other parties reasonable time to comment on
such press release, public announcement or filing in advance of its issuance.

6.9 _Employees_.

 

(a) For a period of twelve (12) months following the Closing, Buyer shall, or
shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to, (i) provide those employees
who are employed by the Company and its Subsidiaries on the Closing Date
(including employees on vacation, leave of absence, short or long-term
disability) and who are not Represented Employees (the " _Continuing
Employees_ ") with base salary, target bonus opportunity, and target
commission opportunity that are no less favorable in the aggregate than those
being provided to Continuing Employees immediately prior to the Closing
and employee retirement, health, welfare and fringe benefits that are
substantially similar in the aggregate to those being provided or made
available to Continuing Employees immediately prior to the Closing, subject to
applicable Law. Except as provided by the CBAs and subject to applicable Law
and any existing Contracts with such individuals in the case of individuals
employed outside of the United States, all Continuing Employees shall be "at
will" employees and thus Buyer, the Company or its Subsidiaries may terminate
the employment of any such Continuing Employees at any time after the Closing
Date (subject to applicable severance or termination obligations). The
foregoing notwithstanding, the employment terms and conditions of the
Represented Employees shall be as set out in the applicable CBA until such
CBAÂ’s expiration, modification or termination in accordance with its terms or
applicable Law.

 

(b) Following the Closing, Buyer shall (i) provide to Continuing Employees
full credit for all purposes, including eligibility, vesting and calculation
of vacation or severance benefits, under any employee benefit plans or
arrangements maintained by Buyer, the Company or its Subsidiaries
(collectively, the " _Buyer Plans_ ") for such Continuing EmployeesÂ’
service with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (or any predecessor
entity) to the same extent recognized by the Company and its Subsidiaries;
_provided_ , _however_ , that no such service shall be recognized to the
extent such recognition (A) results in the duplication of benefits or (B)
provides for benefit accruals under a defined benefit

 



35  pension plan, and such service shall not be recognized under a newly
established plan for which prior service is not taken into account for
employees of Buyer and its Affiliates generally; (ii) waive all limitations
as to preexisting conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to
participation and coverage requirements applicable to the Continuing Employees
under any Buyer Plan that is a welfare benefit plan subject to the Laws of
the United States that such employees may be eligible to participate in after
the Closing Date; and (iii) provide credit under any such welfare plan subject
to the Laws of the United States for any co-payments, deductibles and out-of-
pocket expenditures for the remainder of the coverage period during which any
transfer of coverage occurs.

(c) Prior to the Closing, Seller and the Company agree (i) that the form and
content of any written communications to any Company employee with regard to
Buyer or its Affiliates or this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby shall be first reviewed and approved by Buyer, which approval will not
be unreasonably withheld and (ii) Seller and the Company shall reasonably
cooperate with and reasonably assist Buyer in identifying, and will provide
access to, potential key employees identified by Buyer and reasonably
approved by Seller critical for the business and to whom additional
compensation and/or benefits might be offered by Buyer.

 

(d) Prior to the Closing, Seller and its Affiliates shall not take any action
or inaction with the intention of causing a payment to be triggered under the
Pension Guarantee.

(e) Seller shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use commercially
reasonable efforts to enter an agreement with the works council and take all
necessary actions for the ZwitserLeven (Pension Scheme) to be compliant with
all applicable Laws; _provided_ , that notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, neither entering into an agreement with the works council nor the
ZwitserLeven (Pension Scheme) being compliant with all applicable Laws shall
be a condition to Closing.

 

(f) The provisions of this _Section 6.9_ are solely for the benefit of the
parties hereto, and shall not confer upon any Person any third-party
beneficiary rights. Nothing contained in this _Section 6.9_, whether express
or implied: (i) shall be treated as establishing, amending or modifying for
any purpose any Company Benefit Plan or Buyer Plan; (ii) shall alter or limit
the ability of Buyer, the Company, or any of their respective Affiliates to
amend, modify or terminate any benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement
at any time assumed, established, sponsored or maintained by any of them;
or (iii) is intended to confer upon any current or former employee or any
other Person any right to employment or continued employment for any period of
time by reason of this Agreement, or any right to a particular term or
condition of employment; _provided_ , _however_ , that any severance or other
Liability resulting from the termination of any employee of the Company or its
Subsidiaries after the Closing Date shall be borne by Buyer.

 

6.10 _Tax Matters_.

(a)  _Cooperation_. Each party hereto will, and will cause its Affiliates to,
provide to the other party hereto such cooperation and information as any of
them reasonably may request in filing any Tax Return or claim for Tax refund,
determining a liability for Taxes or a right to refund of Taxes or in
conducting any audit, examination, claim, adjustment, litigation or other
proceeding in respect of Taxes. This cooperation and information shall include
providing copies of all relevant portions of the relevant Tax Returns,
together with such accompanying schedules and work papers, documents relating
to rulings or other determinations by Taxing Authorities and records
concerning the ownership and Tax bases of property, in each case, as are
relevant and which such party possesses or controls. Each party will make
itself and its employees, if any, reasonably available on a mutually
convenient basis at its cost to provide an explanation of any documents or
information so provided. Buyer and Seller agree to retain, to cause their
respective Affiliates to retain, all Tax Returns and related records with
respect to Tax

 



36  matters pertinent to the Company in accordance with their respective normal
record retention policies, but in all events until the expiration of the
statute of limitations for the taxable periods to which such Tax Returns and
records relate.

(b) _Transaction-Related Tax Reporting_. To the extent permitted under
applicable Law, the parties shall take all actions reasonably necessary to
(i) terminate the taxable year of the Company and its Subsidiaries on the
Closing Date, and (ii) deduct all Transaction-Related Tax Deductions in the
taxable year of the Company and its Subsidiaries ending on the Closing Date.

(c) _Transfer Taxes_. All Transfer Taxes shall be borne one-half by Buyer
and one-half by Seller. Buyer shall procure any stock transfer stamps
required by any Transfer Tax, and timely file, to the extent required by
applicable Law, all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect
to all such Transfer Taxes. 

(d) _Ordinary Course of Business on the Closing Date_. The Company and its
Subsidiaries shall not engage in, and Buyer and Seller shall cause the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries not to engage in, any transactions or
actions outside of the Ordinary Course of Business on the Closing Date that
would increase the taxable income of the Company and its Subsidiaries for
the taxable period ending on the Closing Date or would reduce any Tax
deductions or refunds for Taxes of the Company and its Subsidiaries for the
taxable period ending on the Closing Date.

 

(e) _FIRPTA_. On or prior to the Closing Date and in form reasonably
acceptable to Buyer, the Company shall deliver to Buyer a certification from
the Company and signed by a duly authorized corporate officer of the Company,
to the effect that the Company is not, and has not been at any time during the
five years preceding the date of such certification, a United States
real property holding company as defined in Section 897(c)(2) of the Code. If
the Company fails to deliver such certification to Buyer on or prior to the
Closing Date, BuyerÂ’s sole recourse shall be to affect any withholding
pursuant to  _Section 1.7_.

(f) _Refunds_. If at the time of the receipt of a Tax refund (including any
interest received in respect thereof) by the Company which relates to one of
the claims listed as items 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9 and 10 on _Schedule 4.8(c)_ , the
Company has incurred Tax liabilities for Pre-Closing Tax Periods that as of
the Closing Date were not included as accrued but unpaid Tax liabilities in
the Final Closing Statement, Buyer shall cause the Company first to apply such
refund (and interest received in respect thereof) to any such Tax liabilities,
and second, to the extent that such refund (including any interest received
in respect thereof) is greater than any such Tax liabilities, to promptly pay
over to Seller the amount of such excess. For the avoidance of doubt, any Tax
liability for Pre-Closing Tax Periods that as of the Closing Date was not
included as an accrued but unpaid Tax liability in the Final Closing Statement
shall only be netted against any refund (and interest received in respect
thereof) pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence once. Seller shall
be entitled to receive from the Company any Tax refunds (and equivalent
benefits in the form of credits for overpayment of Taxes) which relate to the
Transaction-Related Tax Deductions (other than Transaction-Related Tax
Deductions that were netted against accrued but unpaid Tax liabilities for
Pre-Closing Tax Periods in the Final Closing Statement pursuant to the
definition of Net Working Capital). Buyer shall cause the Company to promptly
file for and diligently pursue any available refund relating to the
Transaction-Related Tax Deductions, including through the carryback to a Pre-
Closing Tax Period; _provided_ , that nothing in this _Section 6.10(f)_ shall
entitle Seller to the benefit of any carryforward of any Tax attribute
(including, a net operating loss, net capital loss of foreign tax credit) that
relates to Transaction-Related Tax Deductions; _provided_ , _further_ , that
for the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this _Section 6.10(f)_ shall allow
double counting of amounts taking into account in the determination of the
Final Purchase Price.

(g) _Structuring Cooperation_. To the extent reasonable and not unduly
burdensome, the parties agree to cooperate and use commercially reasonable
efforts to work together to determine the most efficient purchasing entity,
from a legal, tax, and operational perspective so that Buyer may determine
whether it wishes to make an assignment of its rights, interests and
obligations pursuant to and in accordance with _Section 8.11_.

 



37 6.11 _280G Matters_.

 

(a) Before the Closing Date, the Company will (to the extent the requisite
Waiver Agreements described below are obtained) seek the approval by such
number of stockholders of the Company as is required by the terms of Section
280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code so as to render the parachute payment provisions of
Section 280G of the Code inapplicable to any and all vesting, payments and/or
benefits provided pursuant to any Company Benefit Plan or any other agreement,
contract or arrangement that might otherwise result from the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, separately or in the
aggregate, in the payment of any amount and/or the provision of any benefit
that would not be deductible by reason of Section 280G of the Code, with such
shareholder vote to be obtained in a manner that satisfies all applicable
requirements of Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and the Treasury
Regulations promulgated thereunder (the " _280G Shareholder Vote_ ").

 

(b) The Company shall take commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and
deliver to Buyer, prior to the initiation of the 280G Shareholder Vote, a
parachute payment waiver agreement (a " _Waiver Agreement_ ") from each Person
the Company reasonably believes to be a "disqualified individual" (within the
meaning of Section 280G(c) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations
promulgated thereunder), as determined immediately prior to the 280G
Shareholder Vote, and who might otherwise have, receive or have the right or
entitlement to receive any payments or benefits from the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement that would be subject to
treatment as excess parachute payments within the meaning of Section 280G.
Pursuant to a Waiver Agreement, each such Person shall agree to waive any and
all right or entitlement to receive vesting, payments or benefits to the
extent the value thereof would result in the imposition of an excise tax on
such Person pursuant to Section 4999 of the Code, assuming such Person is
subject to U.S. tax jurisdiction, unless the requisite shareholder approval
of such payments or benefits is obtained pursuant to the 280G Shareholder
Vote.

(c) All materials produced by the Company in connection with the 280G
Shareholder Vote shall be provided to Buyer at least ten (10) Business Days in
advance for BuyerÂ’s review and comment, which the Company shall consider in
good faith and not unreasonably omit to reflect in the final versions of such
documents.

6.12 _Consents_. Seller shall use (and shall cause the Company to use)
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain at the earliest practicable date
all consents and approvals listed on _Schedule 4.3(a)_ and _Schedule 7.1(f)_ ;
provided, that Seller, the Company and their respective Affiliates shall not
be required to (i) expend any money to obtain any such consents and
approvals, or (ii) offer or grant any accommodation (financial or otherwise)
to obtain any third-party consent. For the avoidance of doubt, the receipt of
any consent or approval set forth on _Schedule 4.3(a)_ but not _Schedule
7.1(f)_ shall not be a condition to the obligation of any party to consummate
the Closing.

 

6.13 _Non-Solicitation_.

 

(a) For a period of two (2) years following the Closing Date, Seller shall
not, and shall not permit AS-AZC Holdings LLC or any of its affiliated
investment funds to, directly or indirectly, hire or solicit any employee of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries set forth on _Schedule 6.13(a)_ or
encourage any such employee to leave such employment or hire any such employee
who has left such

 



38  employment, except pursuant to a general solicitation which is not directed
specifically to any such employees; _provided_ , that nothing in this _Section
6.13(a)_ shall prevent Seller or AS-AZC Holdings LLC and its affiliated
investment funds from hiring (i) any such employee whose employment has been
terminated by the Company or Buyer or (ii) after 180 days from the date of
termination of employment, any employee whose employment has been terminated
by such employee.

(b) Seller acknowledges that the restrictions contained in this  _Section
6.13_ are reasonable and necessary to protect the legitimate interests of
Buyer and constitute a material inducement to Buyer to enter into this
Agreement and consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In
the event that any covenant contained in this _Section 6.13_ should ever be
adjudicated to exceed the time, geographic, product or service, or other
limitations permitted by applicable Law in any jurisdiction, then any court is
expressly empowered to reform such covenant, and such covenant shall be
deemed reformed, in such jurisdiction to the maximum time, geographic, product
or service, or other limitations permitted by applicable Law. The covenants
contained in this  _Section 6.13_ and each provision hereof are severable
and distinct covenants and provisions. The invalidity or unenforceability of
any such covenant or provision as written shall not invalidate or render
unenforceable the remaining covenants or provisions hereof, and any such
invalidity or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or
render unenforceable such covenant or provision in any other jurisdiction.

 

6.14 _No-Shop_. Seller will not, nor will Seller permit any of its Affiliates
or the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, (i)
discuss, negotiate, undertake, authorize, recommend, propose or enter into,
either as the proposed surviving, merged, acquiring or acquired corporation,
any transaction involving a merger, consolidation, business
combination, purchase or disposition of any amount of the assets of the
Company (other than the UK Land or any sales or other dispositions of assets
in the Ordinary Course of Business as permitted under this Agreement) or any
equity interests in the Company or any of its Subsidiaries other than the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (an " _Acquisition Transaction_
"); (ii) facilitate, solicit or initiate discussions, negotiations or
submissions of proposals or offers in respect of an Acquisition Transaction;
(iii) furnish or cause to be furnished, to any Person, any information
concerning the business, operations, properties or assets of the Company of
any of its Subsidiaries in connection with an Acquisition Transaction; or
(iv) otherwise cooperate in any way with, or assist or participate in,
facilitate or encourage, any effort or attempt by any other Person to do or
seek any of the foregoing. Seller shall and shall cause the Company and
its respective Affiliates to immediately cease and cause to be terminated any
existing discussions or negotiations with any Person (other than Buyer)
conducted heretofore with respect to any of the foregoing. Seller agrees not
to, and to cause the Company and its respective Affiliates not to, release
any third party from the confidentiality and standstill provisions of any
agreement to which either (i) the Company is a party or (ii) Seller is a party
and the agreement relates to the Company. Seller agrees that the rights and
remedies for noncompliance with this _Section 6.14_ shall include having such
provision specifically enforced by any court having equity jurisdiction, it
being acknowledged and agreed that any such breach or threatened breach shall
cause irreparable injury to Buyer and that money damages would not provide an
adequate remedy to Buyer.

 

6.15 _Financing_.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Buyer shall use
all reasonable best efforts to arrange, consummate and obtain the Financing on
the terms and conditions described in the Commitment Letter, including using
all reasonable best efforts (i) to maintain in full force and effect the
Commitment Letter and to negotiate and enter into definitive agreements with
respect thereto on the terms and conditions contained in the Commitment Letter
(including any related "flex" provisions) or on other terms no less
favorable, in the aggregate, to Buyer (including with respect to the
conditionality thereof), (ii) to satisfy on a timely basis (taking into
account the expected timing of the 

 



39  Marketing Period), or obtain a waiver of on a timely basis, all conditions
in such definitive agreements that are applicable to Buyer and within BuyerÂ’s
control, (iii) in the event that the conditions in _Section 7.1_ and
_Section 7.2_ and the conditions contemplated in the Commitment Letter have
been satisfied or upon funding would be satisfied, to cause the Persons
providing the Financing to fund the Financing contemplated by the Commitment
Letter on or prior to the Closing Date (including by enforcing its rights
under the Commitment Letter), and (iv) to consummate the Refinancing (as
defined in the Commitment Letter). Without SellerÂ’s or the CompanyÂ’s prior
written consent, Buyer may not enter into any replacement, amendment,
supplement or other modification of, or waive any of its rights under, all or
a portion of the Commitment Letter if such replacement, amendment,
supplement, modification or waiver would or could reasonably be expected to
(1) reduce the aggregate amount of the Commitment Letter (other than to the
extent Buyer has sufficient available and unrestricted cash on hand including
through any equity offering to pay the Estimated Purchase Price (and
adjustments thereto) in accordance with _Section 5.7_, it being understood
that any cash escrowed for purpose of consummating the Financing shall not be
deemed to be unavailable or restricted), (2) impose new or additional
conditions or otherwise amend, expand or modify any of the conditions to the
Financing in any respect that could make such conditions less likely to be
satisfied on or before the Closing or that would expand the possible
circumstances under which such conditions would not be satisfied on or before
the Closing Date or (3) prevent, delay or impede the Closing or the date on
which the Financing would be obtained or (4) adversely impact the ability of
Buyer to enforce its rights under the Commitment Letter, _provided that_ , for
the avoidance of doubt, the Buyer may amend, supplement, modify or waive any
terms of the Commitment Letter or definitive agreements with respect
thereto without the consent of the Company in order to (1) correct
typographical errors, (2) add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners,
syndication agents or similar entities (by assignment or otherwise) or (3)
reallocate commitments or assign or reassign titles or roles to, or between
or among, any entities party thereto in each case, to similarly creditworthy
parties (together, the " _Permitted Debt Commitment Amendments_ "). Buyer
shall give Seller and the Company prompt notice (but in any event, within
three (3) Business Days) (a) upon becoming aware of any material breach or
default by any party to the Commitment Letter or any such definitive
agreements, (b) receipt by it or any of its Affiliates of any notice or other
communication from any person in writing with respect to (i) any failure to
comply with the material terms of the Commitment Letter or any such definitive
agreements by any party thereto, (ii) any actual or threatened written
termination or repudiation (whether in whole or in part) of any of the
Commitment Letter or any such definitive agreements by any party thereto or
(iii) any material dispute or disagreement between or among any of the parties
to any of the Commitment Letter or any such definitive agreements solely to
the extent such disagreement or dispute relates to the obligation (including
with respect to the conditions, "flex" provisions or termination provisions
thereto) of the parties thereto to fund their commitments thereunder or the
availability of the Financing at the Closing (but excluding, for the avoidance
of doubt, any ordinary course negotiations with respect to the terms of the
Financing or such definitive documents) or (c) if Buyer believes in good
faith it will not be able to obtain any portion of the Financing on terms, in
the manner and from sources contemplated by the Commitment Letter (including
any related "flex" terms) or the definitive agreements with respect thereto
(other than to the extent Buyer funds such portion of the Financing by
available and unrestricted cash on hand including through any equity offering,
which is sufficient to pay the Estimated Purchase Price (and adjustments
thereto) in accordance with _Section 5.7_, it being understood that any cash
escrowed for purpose of consummating the Financing shall not be deemed to be
unavailable or restricted). If any portion of the Financing
becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated in the
Commitment Letter (including any related "flex" terms) for any or no reason
(other than to the extent Buyer funds such portion of the Financing by
available and unrestricted cash on hand including through any equity
offering, which is sufficient to pay the Estimated Purchase Price (and
adjustments thereto) in accordance with _Section 5.7_, it being understood
that any cash escrowed for purpose of consummating the Financing shall not be
deemed to be unavailable or restricted), Buyer shall promptly notify Seller
and the Company thereof and Buyer shall use reasonable best efforts to arrange
as promptly as practicable, but in no event later than one (1) day prior to
the Closing Date, any such portion from

 



40  alternative debt financing sources, on terms and conditions in the aggregate
not materially less favorable in the aggregate to Buyer than the Financing
contemplated in the Commitment Letter and to obtain a new financing
commitment letter (including any associated engagement letter and related fee
letter) copies of which shall be promptly provided to the Company, and, for
the purposes of this Agreement, all references to the Financing shall be
deemed to include such alternative financing, all references to the Commitment
Letter and other definitive documents shall include the applicable documents
for the alternative financing, and all references to the Financing Sources
shall include the Persons providing or arranging the alternative financing.
Buyer shall keep Seller and the Company informed on a reasonably current basis
and in reasonable detail of the status of BuyerÂ’s efforts to arrange the
Financing and to satisfy the conditions thereof and of all material
developments concerning the status and timing of closing of the Financing.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, obtaining the Financing or
any alternative financing by Buyer is not a condition to Closing and the
obligations of Buyer to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement are not subject to the availability of the Financing. Buyer shall
indemnify and hold harmless Seller, the Company and their respective
Affiliates and their respective pre-Closing directors, officers, employees
and representatives from and against any and all Losses suffered or incurred
by any of them in connection with any of their cooperation or assistance with
respect to the Financing or the provision of any information utilized in
connection therewith or otherwise arising from the Financing, except to the
extent suffered or incurred as a result of the gross negligence, willful
misconduct or breach of this Agreement by Seller, the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective representatives or Affiliates.

(b) From the date hereof until the Closing Date or the earlier termination of
this Agreement in accordance with its terms, Seller and the Company shall use
reasonable best efforts to, and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause
their respective Subsidiaries, directors, officers, employees, agents and
representatives to, at BuyerÂ’s sole cost and expense, use reasonable best
efforts to provide all cooperation as may be reasonably requested by Buyer and
that is necessary for the Financing by Buyer or any of its Affiliates in
connection with the transaction contemplated by this Agreement, including,
without limitation: (i) using reasonable best efforts to (A) furnish to Buyer
and its Financing Sources, as promptly as practicable, the Required
Financial Information and (B) providing Buyer and its representatives with
reasonable access to the representatives, employees, properties and books and
records of the Company; (ii) using reasonable best efforts to make senior
management of the Company available, at reasonable times and upon reasonable

investors and rating agencies in connection with the Financing, including
through a customary "roadshow" and reasonably cooperating with the marketing
efforts for the Financing; (iii) using reasonable best efforts to assist with

searches, appraisals and title insurance as reasonably requested by Buyer and
taking all corporate actions, subject to the occurrence of the Closing,
reasonably requested by the Buyer to permit the consummation of the Financing;
and (viii) taking all actions reasonably necessary to (A) permit the Financing
Sources to (x) evaluate the current assets, cash management and accounting
systems, policies and procedures relating thereto of the Company and its
Subsidiaries for the purpose of establishing collateral arrangements
contemplated by the Commitment Letter and (y) conduct customary field
examinations and inventory appraisals, and (B) facilitate the establishment
of bank and other accounts and blocked account agreements and lockbox

commitment or other similar fee or incur any other liability or obligation or
to enter into any agreement effective in connection with the Financing unless
and until the Closing occurs, (ii) none of Seller, the Company, any of their
Subsidiaries or Affiliates, or any of their respective directors, officers,
employees or agents shall be required to execute or enter into any
certificate, instrument, agreement or other document in connection with the
Financing which will be effective prior to the Closing, and (iii) nothing
herein shall require the board of directors or similar governing body of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, prior to the Closing Date, to adopt
resolutions approving or otherwise approve the agreements, documents or
instruments pursuant to which the Financing is made. Buyer shall promptly,
upon request by Seller, reimburse Seller for all reasonable and documented
out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable and documented outside
attorneysÂ’ fees) incurred by Seller, in connection with the cooperation
contemplated by this _Section 6.15(b)_. All non-public information provided
from one Party or its representatives to the other Party or its
representatives pursuant to this _Section 6.15(b)_ shall be kept confidential
in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement, except that Buyer shall be
permitted to disclose such information regarding the Company to potential
lenders, investors or their respective agents, advisors or other
representatives in connection with the Financing, subject to the
confidentiality undertakings by the Financing Sources and potential
lenders, investors or their respective agents, advisors or other
representatives in accordance with the terms of the Commitment Letter. Seller
and the Company hereby consent to the reasonable use of their respective logos
in connection with the Financing, provided that such logos are not used in a
manner that is intended or reasonably likely to harm or disparage Seller, the
Company or their respective marks, reputation or goodwill. Nothing in this
_Section 6.15(b)_ shall require any cooperation or other action by Seller,
the Company, any of their Subsidiaries or Affiliates, or any of their
respective directors, officers, employees or agents to the extent such
cooperation or action would materially and unreasonably interfere with the
business and operations of Seller, the Company or any of their Subsidiaries or
Affiliates. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Buyer
acknowledges and agrees that the contemplated Financing relates to the Buyer
and its Subsidiaries and the Company and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated
basis and therefore, all obligations of Seller, the Company and their
respective Subsidiaries and representatives to provide cooperation as set
forth in this  _Section 6.15(b)_ shall refer to and be limited to the
Company and its Subsidiaries.

ARTICLE 8

 

MISCELLANEOUS

8.1  _Survival_. The agreements in _Article 1_ , this _Article 8_ and
_Sections 6.5_ , _6.6_ , _6.7_ , _6.8_ , _6.9_ , _6.10_ and _6.13_ of this
Agreement shall survive the Closing. Subject to  _Section 2.3(a)_, the

 



44  remainder of the Agreement (including the representations and warranties in
_Article 3_ , _Article 4_ , and _Article 5_ ) shall terminate at the earlier
of the Closing or the time of termination of this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 2.1_.

8.2 _Specific Performance; Remedies_. The parties agree that irreparable
damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement
or any Transaction Document are not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or are otherwise breached, including if the parties hereto fail
to take any action required of them hereunder to consummate this Agreement.
It is accordingly agreed that, in addition to any other applicable remedies at
law or equity, the parties and the third party beneficiaries of this Agreement
shall be entitled to seek and obtain an injunction or injunctions, without
proof of damages, to prevent breaches of this Agreement or any Transaction
Document and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement and any Transaction Document. If any party brings any action to
enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof by any
other party, the party bringing such action may unilaterally extend the
Outside Date (notwithstanding the termination provisions of  _Section 2.1_),
so long as the party bringing such action is seeking a court order for an
injunction or injunctions or to specifically enforce the terms and provisions
of this Agreement. Each party hereto agrees that it will not oppose
the granting of an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief
on the basis that (i) the other party has an adequate remedy at law or (ii) an
award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at
law or in equity. Each of the parties hereto hereby waives any requirement
under any law to post a bond or other security as a prerequisite to obtaining
equitable relief. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, no party
shall be entitled to specific performance to enforce the other partyÂ’s
obligation to consummate the Transaction unless (i) all conditions to the
other partyÂ’s obligation to close set forth in _Section 7.1_ or _7.2_ , as
the case may be, have been satisfied or waived (other than those to be
satisfied at Closing, but subject to such conditions being capable of being
satisfied at Closing), (ii) the party seeking to enforce such obligation
stands ready and willing to close the Transaction and (iii) in the case of a
suit by Seller or the Company seeking to enforce BuyerÂ’s obligation to
consummate the Transaction, the Financing has been funded or will be funded in
accordance with the terms thereof at the Closing.

 

8.3 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, each of the
Company, Seller and Buyer shall bear its own expenses incurred in connection
with the negotiation and execution of this Agreement and each Transaction
Document and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby.

 

8.4 _Governing Law_. This Agreement and/or the other Transaction Documents and
all claims or causes of action (whether in contract or tort) that may be
based upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement and/or the other
Transaction Documents or the negotiation, execution or performance of this
Agreement and/or the other Transaction Documents (including any claim or cause
of action based upon, arising out of or related to any representation or
warranty made in or in connection with this Agreement and/or the other
Transaction Documents), shall be governed by and construed in accordance with
the internal Laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to the
conflict of laws principles thereof that might require the application of the
laws of another jurisdiction. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, any and all claims arising directly or indirectly out of or
concerning the Financing (including any claim, controversy or dispute against
or involving any Financing Source, including their respective successors and
permitted assigns, each of which is hereby intended to be an express third
party beneficiary of this _Section 8.4_) shall be governed by, and construed
and enforced in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York, without
giving effect to any choice of law or conflicts of laws rules or
provisions (whether of the State of New York or any other jurisdiction) that
would cause the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than the
State of New York

 



45 8.5 _Jurisdiction; Consent to Service of Process_. All claims, actions and
proceedings (whether in contract or tort) based upon, arising out of or
relating to this Agreement and/or the other Transaction Documents or the
negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement and/or the other
Transaction Documents (including any claim or cause of action based upon,
arising out of or related to any representation or warranty made in or in
connection with this Agreement and/or the other Transaction Documents) shall
be heard and determined in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware
(or, if the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware declines to accept
jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state or federal court within the
State of Delaware), and the parties hereto hereby irrevocably submit to the
exclusive jurisdiction of such courts (and, in the case of appeals,
appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any such action or proceeding and
irrevocably waive the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of
any such action or proceeding. The consents to jurisdiction set forth in this
paragraph shall not constitute general consents to service of process in the
State of Delaware and shall have no effect for any purpose except as provided
in this _Section 8.5_ and shall not be deemed to confer rights on any Person
other than the parties hereto. The parties hereto agree that a final judgment
in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in
any other jurisdiction by suit on the judgment or in any other manner
provided by applicable Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the parties
hereto, no Seller Related Party nor any of their respective Affiliates will
bring, or support, any action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim,
counterclaim or third-party claim of any kind or description, whether at law
or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against any
Financing Source in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including but not limited to any
dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the Financing or the
performance thereof or the transactions contemplated thereby, anywhere other
than in (i) any New York State court sitting in the Borough of Manhattan or
(ii) the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.

8.6 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST
EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY

AND COMMITMENT LETTER) WHETHER ARISING IN CONTRACT OR IN TORT OR OTHERWISE,
INCLUDING IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM AGAINST ANY FINANCING
SOURCE. EACH PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE OF ANY OTHER
PARTY HERETO HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY
WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF ANY PROCEEDING, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING
WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN
INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL
WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 8.6_.

8.7 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the Disclosure Schedule and
exhibits hereto), the Transaction Documents and the Confidentiality Agreement
represent the entire understanding and agreement among the parties hereto with
respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement supersedes all prior and
contemporaneous agreements, arrangements, contracts, discussions,
negotiations, undertakings and understandings (whether written or oral and
including any letter of intent or other similar preliminary documents)
between the parties with respect to such subject matter (other than the
Confidentiality Agreement). The parties hereto (i) have voluntarily agreed to
define their rights, liabilities and obligations with respect to
the Transaction exclusively in contract pursuant to the express terms and
provisions of this Agreement, the Transaction Documents and any other executed
agreement entered into by the parties hereto in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) expressly disclaim that they are owed
any duties or are entitled to any remedies not expressly set forth in this
Agreement, the Transaction Documents, and any other executed agreement entered
into by the parties hereto in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby and (iii) hereby agree that no Person shall

 



46  have a remedy or cause of action (whether in contract, tort or otherwise)
for any statements, communications, disclosures, failure to disclose, or
representations or warranties not explicitly set forth in this Agreement.
Furthermore, the parties each hereby acknowledge that this Agreement embodies
the justifiable expectations of sophisticated parties derived from
armÂ’s-length negotiations, and all parties specifically acknowledge that no
party has any special relationship with another party that would justify any
expectation beyond that of an ordinary buyer and an ordinary seller in an
