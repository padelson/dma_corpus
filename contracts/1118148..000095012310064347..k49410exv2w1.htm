AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER 

   

 This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of July 7, 2010 (this " _Agreement_ "), is by and among THE DOCTORS COMPANY, a California-domiciled reciprocal inter-insurance exchange (" _Parent_ "), RED HAWK ACQUISITION CORP., a Michigan corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "), and AMERICAN PHYSICIANS CAPITAL, INC., a Michigan corporation (the " _Company_ "). 

   

RECITALS 

   

 WHEREAS, the Board of Governors of Parent and the respective Boards of Directors of Merger Sub and the Company have approved and declared advisable this Agreement and the merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ ") upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement and in accordance with the Michigan Business Corporation Act (the " _MBCA_ "); and 

   

 WHEREAS, the Board of Governors of Parent and the respective Boards of Directors of Merger Sub and the Company have determined that the Merger is in the best interest of their respective shareholders or policyholders, as applicable. 

   

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth in this Agreement and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto agree as follows: 

   

Article 1. 
 The Merger 

   

 _Section 1.1 __The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the MBCA, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company. As a result of the Merger, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation of the Merger (the " _Surviving Corporation_ "). 

   

 _Section 1.2 __Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place at the offices of Dykema Gossett PLLC, 400 Renaissance Center, Suite 2300, Detroit, Michigan 48243 (or such other place as agreed by the parties) not later than the second Business Day following the date on which all of the conditions set forth in _Article 6_ are satisfied or, if permissible, waived (other than those conditions to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or, if permissible, waiver thereof), unless the parties hereto agree to another date. 

    ##### 

  

     

 _Section 1.3 __Effective Time_. At the Closing, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the parties hereto shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing a certificate of merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") with the Michigan Department of Energy, Labor and Economic Growth, in such form as required by, and executed in accordance with the relevant provisions of, the MBCA (the date and time of such filing, or at such later date and time as Parent and the Company shall agree and specify in the Certificate of Merger, such specified date and time, being the " _Effective Time_ "). 

   

 _Section 1.4 __Effect of the Merger_. At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger shall be as provided in the applicable provisions of the MBCA. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, at the Effective Time, except as otherwise provided herein, all the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation. 

   

 _Section 1.5 __Articles of Incorporation; By-laws_. The Company Articles, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be amended at the Effective Time to read the same as the Articles of Incorporation of Merger Sub and, as so amended, shall be the articles of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation, until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable law, subject to _Section 5.11.2_; provided however, that Article I thereof shall read as follows: "The name of the corporation is: Red Hawk Acquisition Corp". The Company By-laws, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be amended at the Effective Time to read the same as the Bylaws of Merger Sub and, as so amended, shall be the by-laws of the Surviving Corporation, until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable law, subject to _Section 5.11.2_. 

   

 _Section 1.6 __Directors and Officers_. The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial directors of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with the articles of incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving Corporation. The officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with the articles of incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving Corporation. 

   

Article 2. 
 Conversion of Securities; Exchange of Certificates 

   

 _Section 2.1 __Conversion of Securities_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holders of any of the following securities: 

   

 _Section 2.1.1 Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Each share of common stock, no par value per share, of the Company (" _Company Common Stock_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any shares of Company Common Stock to be canceled pursuant to _Section 2.1.2)_ shall be converted into the right to receive $41.50 in cash, payable to the holder thereof, without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). All such shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each Certificate previously 

   ##### 

  

    

representing any such share shall thereafter represent the right to receive
the Merger Consideration therefor. 

  

 _Section 2.1.2 Cancellation of Certain Company Common Stock_. Each share of Company Common Stock held in the treasury of the Company or by any Company Subsidiary shall be cancelled and extinguished without any conversion thereof and no payment shall be made with respect thereto. 

  

 _Section 2.1.3 Merger Sub_. Each share of common stock of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and be exchanged for one newly and validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 _Section 2.1.4 Change in Company Common Stock_. If between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time the outstanding shares of the Company Common Stock shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a different class, by reason of any stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination or exchange of shares, the Merger Consideration shall be correspondingly adjusted to reflect such stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination or exchange of shares; _provided_ , that the aggregate Merger Consideration payable shall not exceed the aggregate amount contemplated pursuant to Section 2.1.1 as of the date hereof. 

  

 _Section 2.2 __Company Options_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Board of Directors of the Company (the " _Company Board_ ") (or if appropriate, any committee thereof) shall adopt appropriate resolutions and take all other actions necessary and appropriate to provide that, immediately prior to the Effective Time, each unexpired and unexercised option or similar rights to purchase Company Common Stock (the " _Company Options_ ") then outstanding, under any stock option plan of the Company, including the Companys Stock Compensation Plan, as amended and restated, or any other plan, agreement or arrangement (the " _Company Stock Option Plans_ "), shall become fully vested and exercisable, and that effective as of the Effective Time, each such Company Option shall be cancelled and, in exchange therefor, each former holder of any such cancelled Company Option shall be entitled to receive, in consideration of the cancellation of such Company Option and in settlement therefor, a payment in cash (subject to _Section 2.3.8_ hereof) of an amount equal to the product of (A) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock previously subject to such Company Option and (B) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock previously subject to such Company Option (such amounts payable hereunder being referred to as the " _Option Consideration_ "). From and after the Effective Time, any such cancelled Company Option shall no longer be exercisable by the former holder thereof and that each such former holder shall only be entitled to the payment of the Option Consideration. To the extent then in effect, after the Effective Time, all Company Stock Option Plans shall be terminated and no further Company Options or other awards shall be granted thereunder. 

   

 _Section 2.3 __Exchange Procedures_. 

   

 _Section 2.3.1 Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a bank or trust company reasonably satisfactory to the Company (the " _Paying Agent_ "), 

   ##### 

  

    

to act as agent for Parent for purposes of, among other things, mailing and
receiving letters of transmittal, and distributing the Merger Consideration
to the Companys shareholders. 

  

 _Section 2.3.2 Exchange Procedures for Company Common Stock_. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent, for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock for payment in accordance with this _Article 2_ , cash in U.S. dollars in an amount sufficient to pay the Merger Consideration (the " _Exchange Fund_ "). No later than two Business Days after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate or Book-Entry Shares as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (A) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificate or Book-Entry Shares shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificate or Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent and shall be in customary form) and (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificate or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration, to which such holder is entitled pursuant to this Agreement. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent together with such letter of transmittal, properly completed and duly executed (or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares, upon adherence to the applicable procedures set forth in such letter of transmittal for surrendering such shares), and upon surrender of such other documents as may be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration, that such holder has the right to receive in respect of the Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares, and the Certificate or Book-Entry Shares so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. No interest will be paid or accrued on the Merger Consideration payable upon surrender of any Certificate or Book-Entry Share. In the event of a permitted transfer of ownership of shares of Company Common Stock represented by a Certificate which is not registered in the transfer records of the Company or the Companys transfer agent on behalf of the Company, the Merger Consideration may be paid to a transferee if the Certificate is presented to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence that any applicable transfer Taxes have been paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 2.3.2_, each Certificate and Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration. 

  

 _Section 2.3.3 Payment for Company Options_. At the Closing, Parent will make (or cause to be made) payment to the Surviving Corporation, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account or accounts designated by the Company in writing no later than two Business Days prior to the Closing, in an amount equal to the aggregate Option Consideration, to the extent payable as provided in _Section 2.2_, plus the amount of any employment Taxes payable by the Surviving Corporation in respect of the payment of such Option Consideration (provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, the Surviving Corporation shall have no obligation to pay any taxes that may be payable by the holders of Company Options upon receiving the Option Consideration). At the Effective Time, or as soon as practicable thereafter (but not later than two Business Days thereafter), the Surviving Corporation shall, in consideration of cancellation of the Company Options that became entitled to receive the consideration specified in _Section 2.2_, pay the Option Consideration in respect of each such Company Option to each holder of a Company Option. 

   ##### 

  

  

 _Section 2.3.4 Further Rights in Company Securities_. All Merger Consideration and Option Consideration paid in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Company Common Stock and Company Options with respect to which such payments are made, respectively. 

  

 _Section 2.3.5 Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock for twelve months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent upon demand, and any holders of Company Common Stock who have not theretofore complied with this _Article 2_ shall thereafter look only to Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat and similar Laws) as general creditors thereof for payment of the Merger Consideration without any interest thereon. 

  

 _Section 2.3.6 No Liability_. Neither Parent nor the Company nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any holder of Company Common Stock for any cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. 

  

 _Section 2.3.7 Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration without interest thereon. 

  

 _Section 2.3.8 Withholding_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Company Common Stock and Company Options, such amounts as Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent are required to deduct and withhold under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), the treasury regulations thereunder or any other provision of U.S. Tax Law, or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law, with respect to the making of such payment. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Company Common Stock or Company Options in respect of whom such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent. 

  

 _Section 2.4 __Stock Transfer Books_. At the close of business, New York time, on the day the Effective Time occurs, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and there shall be no further registration of transfers of Company Common Stock or Company Options that were outstanding on the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates or Book Entry Shares immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Company Common Stock, except as otherwise provided herein or by Law. On or after the Effective Time, any Certificates presented to the Paying Agent or Parent for any reason shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this _Article 2_. 

    ##### 

  

     

Article 3. 
 Representations and Warranties of the Company 

   

 Except as set forth in the Disclosure Schedule delivered by the Company to Parent at or prior to the execution of this Agreement (the " _Company Disclosure Schedule_ "), the Company hereby makes the following representations and warranties to Parent. Unless otherwise specified, no disclosure made in any particular Section of the Company Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed made in any other Section of the Company Disclosure Schedule unless expressly made therein (by cross reference or otherwise). 

   

 _Section 3.1 __Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries_. The Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Michigan. Each Company Subsidiary is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or organization, as the case may be. The Company and each of the Company Subsidiaries has the requisite corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted. The Company and each of the Company Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed to do business, and is in good standing, in each jurisdiction where the character of the properties owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of its business makes such qualification, licensing or good standing necessary, except for such failures to be so qualified, licensed or in good standing that would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect or otherwise prevent or delay (beyond the Outside Date as determined pursuant to Section 7.1.2) consummation of the Merger. _Section 3.1_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true, complete and correct list of all of the subsidiaries of the Company (each a " _Company Subsidiary_ " and, collectively, the " _Company Subsidiaries_ "), together with the jurisdiction of incorporation of each Company Subsidiary, the jurisdictions in which each Company Subsidiary is licensed to conduct business and the authorized capitalization of each Company Subsidiary. Except as set forth in _Section 3.1_ of the Company Disclosure Schedules, none of the Company or any Company Subsidiary holds an Equity Interest in any other person. 

   

 _Section 3.2 __Articles of Incorporation and By-laws_. The copies of the Companys Articles of Incorporation, as amended (the " _Company Articles_ "), and Amended and Restated Bylaws (the " _Company By-laws_ ") which were previously furnished or made available to Parent are true, complete and correct. The Company has made available to Parent a true, complete and correct copy of the charter and bylaws (or equivalent organizational documents) of each of the Company Subsidiaries. 

   

 _Section 3.3 __Capitalization_. 

   

 _Section 3.3.1 _The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 55,000,000 shares of capital stock, of which 50,000,000 are designated Company Common Stock and 5,000,000 are designated preferred stock, no par value per share (" _Company Preferred Stock_ "). As of July 7, 2010, (A) 9,323,087 shares of Company Common Stock were issued and outstanding, all of which were validly issued, fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive rights and (B) 348,687 shares of Company Common Stock were reserved for issuance upon exercise of Company Options granted under the Company Stock Option Plans. As of July 7, 2010 and as of the Effective Time, (i) no shares of Company Preferred Stock were (or will be) 

   ##### 

  

 

designated, issued and outstanding and (ii) no shares of Company Common Stock
were (or will be) held in the treasury of the Company or by the Company
Subsidiaries. There are no bonds, debentures, notes or other debt securities
issued by the Company that have the right to vote (or are convertible into,
or exchange for, securities having the right to vote) on any matters on which
holders of Company Common Stock may vote.
