Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent, for the benefit
of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock for payment in accordance with this <U>Article
2</U>, cash in U.S. dollars in an amount sufficient to pay the Merger Consideration (the
&#147;<U>Exchange Fund</U>&#148;). No later than two Business Days after the Effective Time, Parent shall
cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate or Book-Entry Shares as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time (A)&nbsp;a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificate or Book-Entry Shares
shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificate or Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent
and shall be in customary form) and (B)&nbsp;instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificate or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration, to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to this Agreement. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the
Paying Agent together with such letter of transmittal, properly completed and duly executed (or, in
the case of Book-Entry Shares, upon adherence to the applicable procedures set forth in such letter
of transmittal for surrendering such shares), and upon surrender of such other documents as may be
required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled
to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration, that such holder has the right to receive
in respect of the Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry
Shares, and the Certificate or Book-Entry Shares so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. No
interest will be paid or accrued on the Merger Consideration payable upon surrender of any
Certificate or Book-Entry Share. In the event of a permitted transfer of ownership of shares of
Company Common Stock represented by a Certificate which is not registered in the transfer records
of the Company or the Company&#146;s transfer agent on behalf of the Company, the Merger Consideration
may be paid to a transferee if the Certificate is presented to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all
documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence that any applicable
transfer Taxes have been paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this <U>Section&nbsp;2.3.2</U>,
each Certificate and Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration.

made) payment to the Surviving Corporation, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the
account or accounts designated by the Company in writing no later than two Business Days prior to
the Closing, in an amount equal to the aggregate Option Consideration, to the extent payable as
provided in <U>Section&nbsp;2.2</U>, plus the amount of any employment Taxes payable by the Surviving
Corporation in respect of the payment of such Option Consideration (provided that, for the
avoidance of doubt, the Surviving Corporation shall have no obligation to pay any taxes that may be
payable by the holders of Company Options upon receiving the Option Consideration). At the
Effective Time, or as soon as practicable thereafter (but not later than two Business Days
thereafter), the Surviving Corporation shall, in consideration of cancellation of the Company
Options that became entitled to receive the consideration specified in <U>Section&nbsp;2.2</U>, pay the
Option Consideration in respect of each such Company Option to each holder of a Company Option.
