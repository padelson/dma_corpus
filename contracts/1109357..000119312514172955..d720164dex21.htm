and Purple Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ ," the Company and Merger Sub sometimes
being hereinafter collectively referred to as the " _Constituent Corporations_
").

 

RECITALS

WHEREAS, the respective boards of directors of each of Parent, Merger Sub and
the Company have approved and declared advisable this Agreement and the merger
of Merger Sub with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ ") upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and have authorized the
execution hereof, and the board of directors of the Company has adopted a
resolution recommending that the plan of merger set forth in this Agreement be
adopted by the stockholders of the Company;

WHEREAS, pursuant to a subscription agreement between the Company and Parent

and restrictions as set forth in a certificate of designation substantially in
the form of Exhibit C hereto (the " _Nonvoting Preferred Stock_ "), on the

(as of any date of determination, the purchase price actually paid to the
Company for such shares is referred to as the " _Nonvoting Preferred Stock

WHEREAS, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with this
Agreement.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, and of the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, the parties hereto
agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

 

 _The Merger; Closing; Effective Time_

 

1.1. _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and
into the  Company and the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall thereupon
cease. The Company shall be the surviving corporation in the Merger (sometimes
hereinafter referred to as the " _Surviving Corporation_ "), and the separate
corporate existence of the Company, with all of its rights, privileges,
immunities, powers and franchises, shall continue unaffected by the Merger,
except as set forth in Article II. The Merger shall have the effects
specified in the Delaware General Corporation Law, as amended (the " _DGCL_
").

1.2.  _Closing_. Unless otherwise mutually agreed in writing between the

business day (the " _Closing Date_ ") following the day on which the last to
be satisfied or waived of the conditions set forth in Article VII (other than
those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the fulfillment or waiver of those conditions) shall be satisfied
or waived in accordance with this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement,
the term " _business day_ " shall mean any day ending at 11:59 p.m. (Eastern
Time) other than a Saturday or Sunday or a day on which banks are required or
authorized to close in the City of New York.

 

1.3. _Effective Time_. At the Closing, the Company and Parent will cause a
certificate of merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") to be executed,
acknowledged and filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware as
provided in Section 251 of the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective at the
time when the Certificate of Merger has been duly filed with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware or at such later time as may be agreed by the
parties in writing and specified in the Certificate of Merger (the "
_Effective Time_ ").

 

ARTICLE II

shall be amended in its entirety to read as set forth in Exhibit A hereto,
until thereafter amended as provided therein or by applicable Law.

 

2.2. _The Bylaws_. The parties hereto shall take all actions necessary so that
the bylaws of the Company in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time

thereafter amended as provided therein or by applicable Law.

 



-2- ARTICLE III

 

 _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation_

 

3.1. _Directors_. The parties hereto shall take all actions necessary so that
the board of directors of Merger Sub at the Effective Time shall, from and

Corporation until their successors have been duly elected or appointed and
qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance
with the Charter and the Bylaws.

3.2. _Officers_. The officers of the Company at the Effective Time shall, from
and after the Effective Time, be the officers of the Surviving Corporation
until their successors shall have been duly elected or appointed and qualified
or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the
Charter and Bylaws.

 

ARTICLE IV

_Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock;_

_Exchange of Certificates_

 

4.1. _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, as a result of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any capital stock
of the Company or the sole stockholder of Merger Sub:

(a) _Merger Consideration_. Each share of the common stock, par value $0.01
per share, of the Company (a " _Share_ " or, collectively, the " _Shares_ ")
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time other than (i)
Shares owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any other direct or indirect wholly-
owned Subsidiary of Parent and Shares owned by the Company or any direct or
indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company, and in each case not held on
behalf of third parties (but not including Shares held by the Company in any
"rabbi trust" or similar arrangement in respect of any compensation plan or
arrangement) and (ii) Shares that are owned by stockholders (" _Dissenting
Stockholders_ ") who have perfected and not withdrawn a demand for appraisal
rights pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL (each Share referred to in clause
(i) or clause (ii) being an " _Excluded Share_ " and collectively, " _Excluded
Shares_ ") shall be converted into the right to receive $27.25 per Share in
cash, without interest (the " _Per Share Merger Consideration_ "). At the
Effective Time, all of the Shares shall cease to be outstanding, shall be
cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each certificate (a " _Certificate_
") formerly representing any of the Shares (other than Excluded Shares) and
each non-certificated Share represented by book-entry (a " _Book Entry Share_
") (other than Excluded Shares) shall thereafter represent only the right to
receive the Per Share Merger Consideration, without interest, and each
Certificate formerly representing Shares or Book Entry Shares owned by
Dissenting Stockholders shall thereafter only represent the right to receive
the payment to which reference is made in Section 4.2(f).

 



-3- (b) _Cancellation of Excluded Shares_. Each Excluded Share shall, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, cease to
be outstanding, shall be cancelled without payment of any consideration
therefor and shall cease to exist, subject to any rights the holder thereof
may have under Section 4.2(f).

(c) _Merger Sub_. At the Effective Time, each share of common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be converted into one share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

 

(d) _Nonvoting Preferred Stock_. Each share of Nonvoting Preferred Stock
issued and outstanding at the Effective Time shall remain outstanding
following the Effective Time.

4.2. _Exchange of Shares_.

 

(a) _Paying Agent_. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall
deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with a paying agent selected by
Parent with the Companys prior approval (such approval not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed) (the " _Paying Agent_ "), for the benefit of the holders
of Shares, a cash amount in immediately available funds necessary for the
Paying Agent to make payments under Section 4.1(a) (such cash being
hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Paying Agent
agreement pursuant to which Parent shall appoint the Paying Agent shall be in
form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Company. The Paying Agent
shall invest the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent; _provided_ that such
investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States
of America, in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by
Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors, respectively, in
certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances
of commercial banks with capital exceeding $1 billion, or in money market
funds having a rating in the highest investment category granted by a
recognized credit rating agency at the time of investment. Any interest and
other income resulting from such investment shall become a part of the
Exchange Fund, and any amounts in excess of the amounts payable under Section
4.1(a) shall be promptly returned to the Surviving Corporation. To the extent
that there are any losses with respect to any such investments, or the
Exchange Fund diminishes for any reason below the level required for the
Paying Agent to make prompt cash payment under Section 4.1(a), Parent shall,
or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, promptly replace or restore the
cash in the Exchange Fund so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all
times maintained at a level sufficient for the Paying Agent to make such
payments under Section 4.1(a).

 

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. (i) Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any
event within two business days), the Surviving Corporation shall cause the
Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate representing
Shares (other than holders of Excluded Shares) (A) a letter of transmittal in
customary form specifying that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss
and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in

 



-4-  Section 4.2(e)) to the Paying Agent, such letter of transmittal to be in
such form and have such other provisions as Parent and the Company may
reasonably agree, and (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section
4.2(e)) in exchange for the Per Share Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of
a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section
4.2(e)) to the Paying Agent in accordance with the terms of such letter of
transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled
to receive in exchange therefor a cash amount in immediately available funds
(after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in Section
4.2(g)) equal to (x) the number of Shares represented by such Certificate (or
affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 4.2(e)) multiplied
by (y) the Per Share Merger Consideration, and the Certificate so surrendered
shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any
amount payable upon due surrender of the Certificates. In the event of a
transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered in the transfer records
of the Company, a check for any cash to be exchanged upon due surrender of the
Certificate may be issued to such transferee if the Certificate
formerly representing such Shares is presented to the Paying Agent,
accompanied by all documents reasonably required to evidence and effect such
transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been
paid or are not applicable.

 

(ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any holder of
Book Entry Shares shall not be required to deliver a Certificate or an
executed letter of transmittal to the Paying Agent to receive the Per Share
Merger Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to this
Article IV. In lieu thereof, each holder of record of one or more Book Entry
Shares whose Shares were converted into the right to receive the Per Share
Merger Consideration shall upon receipt by the Paying Agent of an "agents
message" in customary form (or such other evidence, if any, as the
Paying Agent may reasonably request), be entitled to receive, and Parent
shall cause the Paying Agent to pay and deliver as promptly as reasonably
practicable after the Effective Time, the Per Share Merger Consideration in
respect of each such Share and the Book Entry Shares of such holder shall
forthwith be cancelled.

(c) _Transfers_. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of the Shares that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, any Certificate or Book Entry Share is presented to the Surviving
Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent for transfer, it shall be cancelled
and exchanged for the cash amount in immediately available funds to which the
holder thereof is entitled pursuant to this Article IV.

 

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains unclaimed by
the stockholders of the Company 180 days after the Effective Time shall be
delivered to the Surviving Corporation. Any holder of Shares (other than
Excluded Shares) who has not theretofore complied with this Article IV shall
thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of the Per
Share Merger Consideration (after giving effect to

 



-5-  any required Tax withholdings as provided in Section 4.2(g)) upon due
surrender of its Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as
provided in Section 4.2(e)) or Book Entry Shares, without any interest
thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Surviving Corporation,
Parent, the Paying Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any former
holder of Shares for any amount properly delivered to a public official
pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws. For the
purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Person_ " shall mean any individual,
corporation (including not-for-profit), general or limited
partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, estate, trust,
association, organization, Governmental Entity or other entity of any kind or
nature.

 

(e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in
customary amount and upon such terms as may be required by Parent as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or the Surviving
Corporation with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue a
check in the amount (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as
provided in Section 4.2(g)) equal to (i) the number of Shares represented by
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate multiplied by (ii) the Per Share
Merger Consideration.

 

(f) _Appraisal Rights_. No Person who has perfected a demand for appraisal
rights pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL shall be entitled to receive the
Per Share Merger Consideration with respect to the Shares owned by such Person
unless and until such Person shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such
Persons right to appraisal under the DGCL. Each Dissenting Stockholder shall
be entitled to receive only the payment provided by Section 262 of the DGCL
with respect to Shares owned by such Dissenting Stockholder. The Company shall
give Parent (i) prompt notice of any demands for appraisal, threatened
demands for appraisal, attempted withdrawals of such demands, and any other
instruments that are received by the Company relating to stockholders rights
of appraisal (any of the foregoing, a " _Demand_ ") and (ii) the opportunity
to participate in and control all negotiations and proceedings with respect to
any Demand. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of
Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to any Demand, offer to
settle or settle any such Demand.

(g) _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Company, Parent, the Surviving
Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any
holder of Shares, Company RSUs, Company PSUs and Company Awards (each as
defined in Section 4.3) such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold
with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the " _Code_ ") or any other applicable state, local or
foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Company,
the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent, as the case may be,
such withheld amounts (i) shall be remitted by the Company, Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as applicable, to the applicable
Governmental Entity, and (ii) shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Shares in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made by the Company, the Surviving
Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent, as the case may be.

 



-6- 4.3. _Treatment of Stock Plans_.

 

(a) _Company Restricted Stock Units_. At the Effective Time, each outstanding
Company restricted stock unit that vests based solely on continued service to
the Company and its Subsidiaries (a " _Company RSU_ ") under the Stock Plans
(as defined in Section 5.1(b)), vested or unvested, shall be cancelled and
converted into the right of the holder thereof to receive, as soon as
reasonably practicable (but no later than three business days) after the
Effective Time (or, to the extent such Company RSU is deferred compensation
subject to Section 409A of the Code, at the earliest time permitted under
the applicable Stock Plan or Benefit Plan that will not trigger a tax or
penalty under Section 409A of the Code, with interest at the U.S. prime rate
as shown at the end of the day on Bloomberg screen BTMM or PRIME INDEX HP,
whichever is higher (the " _Interest Rate_ ") from the Closing Date through
such payment date), an amount in cash equal to the product of (x) the total
number of Shares subject to such Company RSU immediately prior to the
Effective Time, multiplied by (y) the Per Share Merger Consideration;
_provided_ , _however_ , that any Company RSUs granted after the date hereof
will only payout on a prorated basis based on the number of days elapsed from
the grant date (or, in the case of the annual 2015 grants, January 1, 2015)
through the Closing Date relative to 1,095 days (and the remainder of such
awards will be cancelled without payment).

 

(b) _Company Performance Stock Units_. At the Effective Time, each outstanding
Company restricted stock unit that vests, in whole or in part, based on the
achievement of performance objectives (a " _Company PSU_ ") under the Stock
Plans, vested or unvested, shall be cancelled and converted into the right of
the holder thereof to receive, as soon as reasonably practicable (but no
later than three business days) after the Effective Time (or, to the extent
such Company PSU is deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code,
at the earliest time permitted under the applicable Stock Plan or Benefit
Plan that will not trigger a tax or penalty under Section 409A of the Code,
with interest at the Interest Rate from the Closing Date through such payment
date), an amount in cash equal to the product of (x) the total number
of Shares subject to such Company PSU immediately prior to the Effective
Time, determined (without proration) based on achievement of applicable
performance objectives at the greater of (1) actual performance as reasonably
determined by the compensation committee of the board of directors of the
Company prior to the Effective Time based on performance through a day that is
no more than five business days prior to the Effective Time and (2) the target
level of 100%, multiplied by (y) the Per Share Merger Consideration;
_provided_ , _however_ , that any Company PSUs granted after the date hereof
will have performance determined based on the greater of (1) actual
performance (determined as described above) and (2) the target level of 100%,
and will only payout on a prorated basis based on the number of days elapsed
from the grant date (or, in the case of the annual 2015 grants, January 1,
2015) through the Closing Date relative to 1,095 days (and the remainder of
such awards will be cancelled without payment).

 



-7- (c) _Company Awards_. At the Effective Time, each right of any kind,
contingent or accrued, vested or unvested, to acquire or receive Shares or
benefits measured by the value of Shares, and each award of any kind
consisting of Shares that may be held, awarded, outstanding, payable or
reserved for issuance under the Stock Plans and any other Benefit Plans,
other than Company RSUs and Company PSUs (the " _Company Awards_ "), shall be
cancelled and shall only entitle the holder thereof to receive, as soon as
reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (or, to the extent such
Company Award is deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code, at
the earliest time permitted under the applicable Stock Plan or Benefit Plan
that will not trigger a tax or penalty under Section 409A of the Code, with
interest at the Interest Rate from the Closing Date through such payment
date), an amount in cash equal to (x) the number of Shares subject to such
Company Award immediately prior to the Effective Time determined (without
proration) based on achievement of any applicable performance objectives at
the greater of (1) actual performance as reasonably determined by the
compensation committee of the board of directors of the Company prior to the
Effective Time based on performance through a day that is no more than five
business days prior to the Effective Time and (2) the target level of 100%,
multiplied by (y) the Per Share Merger Consideration (or, if the Company Award
provides for payments to the extent the value of the Shares exceeds a
specified reference or exercise price, the amount, if any (or zero, if no such
excess), by which the Per Share Merger Consideration exceeds such reference or
exercise price).

 

(d) _Corporate Actions_. At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the
board of directors of the Company and the compensation committee of the board
of directors of the Company, as applicable, shall adopt any resolutions and
take any actions which are necessary to effectuate the provisions of Sections
4.3(a) through 4.3(c).

 

4.4. _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. In the event that the Company changes
the number of Shares or securities convertible or exchangeable into or
exercisable for Shares issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a
result of a reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split),
stock dividend or distribution, recapitalization, merger, issuer tender or
exchange offer, or other similar transaction, the Per Share Merger
Consideration shall be equitably adjusted.

ARTICLE V

 

 _Representations and Warranties_

events, occurrences, effects or developments set forth in clauses (A), (B),
(C), (D), (E), (F), and (G), above may be taken into account in determining
whether there has been or is a Company Material Adverse Effect to the extent
such matters, changes, events, occurrences, effects or developments have a
materially disproportionate adverse effect on the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as compared to other entities (if any) engaged
in the relevant business in the geographic area affected by such matters,
changes, events, occurrences, effects or developments.

 



-11- (b) _Capital Structure_. The authorized capital stock of the Company consists
of 400,000,000 Shares, of which 251,025,051 Shares were outstanding as of the

par value $0.01 per share, none of which are outstanding as of the close of
business on April 28, 2014, of which 9,000 shares of Nonvoting Preferred
Stock are to be authorized, issued and outstanding pursuant to the
Subscription Agreement on the Initial Closing Date (as such term is defined in
the Subscription Agreement). All of the outstanding Shares have been duly
authorized and are validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. When issued
pursuant to the Subscription Agreement, the shares of Nonvoting Preferred
Stock issued to Parent will be validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable. As of April 28, 2014, other than 774,201 Shares reserved for
issuance in respect of Company RSUs, 2,468,233 Shares reserved for issuance in
respect of Company PSUs, and 5,725,564 Shares reserved for issuance under the

reserved for issuance in respect of Company Awards under the Pepco Holdings,
Inc. Long-Term Incentive Plan, the Pepco Holdings, Inc. 2012 Long-Term
Incentive Plan, the Pepco Holdings, Inc. Non-Management Directors
Compensation Plan, and the Pepco Holdings, Inc. Retirement Savings Plan
(collectively, the " _Stock Plans_ "), the Company has no Shares reserved for
issuance. Each of the outstanding shares of capital stock or other equity
securities of each of the Companys Subsidiaries is duly authorized, validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable and owned by the Company or by a direct
or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company, free and clear of
any lien, charge, pledge, security interest, claim, or other encumbrance
(each, a " _Lien_ "). Except as set forth above, there are no preemptive or
other outstanding rights, options, warrants, conversion rights, stock
appreciation rights, performance units, redemption rights, repurchase rights,
agreements, arrangements, calls, commitments or rights of any kind that
obligate the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to issue or sell any shares of
capital stock or other equity securities of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or any securities or obligations convertible or exchangeable into
or exercisable for, or giving any Person a right to subscribe for or acquire,
any equity securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and no
securities or obligations evidencing such rights are authorized, issued or
outstanding. Upon any issuance of any Shares in accordance with the terms of
the Stock Plans, such Shares will be duly authorized, validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable and free and clear of any Liens. The Company
does not have outstanding any bonds, debentures, notes or other obligations
the holders of which have the right to vote (or convertible into or
exercisable for securities having the right to vote) with the stockholders of
the Company on any matter. For purposes of this Agreement, a wholly-owned
Subsidiary of the Company shall include any Subsidiary of the Company of which
all of the shares of capital stock of such Subsidiary are owned by the
Company (or a wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company).

(c) _Corporate Authority; Approval and Fairness_.

 

(i) The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority and has taken
all corporate action necessary in order to execute and deliver this Agreement
and, subject only to adoption of this Agreement by the holders of a majority
of the outstanding Shares entitled to vote on such matter at a

 



-12-  stockholders meeting duly called and held for such purpose (the " _Company
Requisite Vote_ "), to perform its obligations under this Agreement and to
consummate the Merger. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by
the Company and constitutes a valid and binding agreement of the Company
enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, subject to
bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and
similar Laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors
rights and to general equity principles (the " _Bankruptcy and Equity
Exception_ ").

 

(ii) The board of directors of the Company has (A) unanimously determined that
the Merger is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders,
approved and declared advisable this Agreement and the Merger and resolved to
recommend adoption of this Agreement to the holders of Shares (the " _Company
Recommendation_ "), (B) directed that this Agreement be submitted to the
holders of Shares for their adoption and (C) received the opinion of its
financial advisors, Lazard Freres and Co. LLC and Morgan Stanley and Co. LLC, to
the effect that the Per Share Merger Consideration to be received by the
holders of Shares in the Merger is fair from a financial point of view, as of
the date of such opinions, to such holders. It is agreed and understood that
such opinions are for the benefit of the Companys board of directors and may
not be relied on by Parent or Merger Sub. The board of directors of the
Company has taken all action so that Parent will not be an "interested
stockholder" or prohibited from entering into or consummating a "business
combination" with the Company (in each case as such term is used in Section
203 of the DGCL) as a result of the execution of this Agreement or the
consummation of the transactions in the manner contemplated hereby.

 

(d) _Governmental Filings and Approvals; No Violations; Certain Contracts_.

 

(i) Other than the filings, approvals and/or notices (A) pursuant to Section

amended (the " _HSR Act_ "), (C) under the Exchange Act, (D) under stock
exchange rules, (E) with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (the "
_FERC_ ") under the Federal Power Act (the " _FERC Approval_ "), (F) with the
Federal Communications Commission (the " _FCC_ ") (the " _FCC Approval_ "),
(G) with the Delaware Public Service Commission, the District of Columbia
Public Service Commission, the Maryland Public Service Commission, the New

Section 5.1(d)(i) of the Company Disclosure Letter (together with the other
approvals referred to in clauses (B) through (G) of this Section 5.1(d)(i),
the " _Company Approvals_ "), no notices, reports or other filings are
required to be made by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with, nor are
any consents, registrations, approvals, permits or authorizations required to
be obtained by the Company

 



-13-  from, any domestic or foreign governmental or regulatory authority, agency,
commission, body, court or other legislative, executive or judicial
governmental entity (each, a " _Governmental Entity_ "), NERC or PJM, in
connection with the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by
the Company and the consummation of the Merger, except those, the failure to
make or obtain are not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably likely
to have a Company Material Adverse Effect or prevent, materially delay or
materially impair the consummation of the Merger.

 

(ii) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company
do not, and the consummation of the Merger will not, constitute or result in
(A) a breach or violation of, or a default under, the certificate of
incorporation or bylaws of the Company or the comparable governing documents
of any of its Subsidiaries, (B) with or without notice, lapse of time or
both, a breach or violation of, a termination (or right of termination) or a
default under, the creation or acceleration of any obligations under, or the
creation of a Lien on any of the assets of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries pursuant to, any agreement, lease, license, contract, note,
mortgage, indenture, arrangement or other obligation (each, a " _Contract_ ")
not otherwise terminable by the other party thereto on 90 days or less notice
without penalty, binding upon the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (C)
assuming compliance with the matters referred to in Section 5.1(d)(i), a
violation of any Law to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is
subject, except, in the case of clause (B) or (C) of this Section 5.1(d)(i),
for any such breach, violation, termination, default, creation, acceleration
or change that, individually or in the aggregate, is not reasonably likely to
have a Company Material Adverse Effect or prevent, materially delay or
materially impair the consummation of the Merger.

(e) _Company Reports; Financial Statements_.

(i) The Company has filed or furnished, as applicable, on a timely basis, all
forms, statements, certifications, reports and documents required to be filed
or furnished by it with the SEC pursuant to the Exchange Act or the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended (the " _Securities Act_ "), since December 31, 2011
(the " _Applicable Date_ ") (the forms, statements, certifications, reports
and documents filed or furnished since the Applicable Date and those filed or
furnished subsequent to the date hereof, including any amendments thereto,
the " _Company Reports_ "). Each of the Company Reports, at the time of its
filing or being furnished complied or, if not yet filed or furnished, will
comply in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the
Securities Act and the Exchange Act and any rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder applicable to the Company Reports. As of their respective dates
(or, if amended prior to the date hereof, as of the date of such amendment),
the Company Reports did not, and any Company Reports filed with or furnished
to the SEC subsequent to the date hereof will not, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements made therein, in light of
the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading.

 



-14- (ii) The Company is in compliance in all material respects with the
applicable listing and corporate governance rules and regulations of the
NYSE.

(iii) Each of the consolidated balance sheets included in or incorporated by
reference into the Company Reports (including the related notes and schedules)

filed after the date hereof, will fairly present in all material respects the
consolidated financial position of the Company and its consolidated
Subsidiaries as of its date and each of the consolidated statements of (loss)
income, comprehensive (loss) income, cash flows and equity included in or
incorporated by reference into the Company Reports (including any related
notes and schedules) fairly presents in all material respects, or, in the case

material respects, the financial position, results of operations and cash

for the periods set forth therein (subject, in the case of unaudited
statements, to notes and year-end adjustments), in each case in accordance
with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (" _GAAP_ ") applied
consistently during the periods presented, except as may be noted therein.

 

(iv) The Company maintains internal control over financial reporting (as
defined in Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15, as applicable, under the Exchange Act).
Such internal control over financial reporting is effective in providing
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
with GAAP in all material respects. Except as has not had, and would not be
reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect, (A) the Company maintains disclosure controls and
procedures required by Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15 under the Exchange Act that are
effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company
is recorded and reported on a timely basis to the individuals responsible for

disclosure documents and (B) the Company has disclosed, based on its most
recent evaluation prior to the date of this Agreement, to the Companys
outside auditors and the audit committee of the board of directors of the
Company (1) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design

affect the Companys ability to record, process, summarize and report
financial information and (2) any fraud, known to the Company, whether or not
material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant
role in the Companys internal controls over financial reporting.

its Subsidiaries have conducted their respective businesses only in, and have
not engaged in any material transaction other than according to, the ordinary
and usual course of such businesses and there has not been:

 

(i) any change, event, occurrence or effect in the financial condition,
business or results of operations that, individually or in the aggregate, has
had or is reasonably likely to have, a Company Material Adverse Effect;

(ii) any material damage, destruction or other casualty loss with respect to
any material asset or property owned, leased or otherwise used by the Company

Company Material Adverse Effect;

(iii) other than regular quarterly dividends on Shares, any declaration,
setting aside or payment of any dividend or other distribution with respect to
any shares of capital stock of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (except
for dividends or other distributions by any direct or indirect wholly-
owned Subsidiary to the Company or to any other wholly-owned Subsidiary of
the Company);

(iv) any material change in any method of accounting or accounting practice
by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; or

(v) any action taken that, if taken after the date of this Agreement without
Parents consent, would constitute a breach of the covenants set forth in
clauses (v), (vii), (viii) or (xiv) of Section 6.1.

 

(g) _Litigation and Liabilities_.

 

(i) There are no civil, criminal or administrative actions, suits, claims,
hearings, arbitrations, investigations or other proceedings pending or, to
the Knowledge of the Company, threatened against the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries that, individually or in the aggregate, has or are reasonably
likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Company nor any
of its Subsidiaries is a party to or subject to the provisions of any
judgment, order, settlement, writ, injunction, decree or award of any
Governmental Entity specifically imposed upon the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries which, individually or in the aggregate, has or is reasonably
likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

(ii) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liabilities or
obligations of any nature (whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise)
required by GAAP to be set forth on a consolidated balance sheet of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, other than liabilities and obligations (A) set
forth in the Companys consolidated balance sheet (and the notes thereto)
included in the Company Reports filed prior to the date of this Agreement, (B)
incurred in the

 



-16-  ordinary course of business since December 31, 2013, (C) incurred in
connection with the Merger or any other transaction or agreement contemplated
by this Agreement, or (D) that are not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

The term " _Knowledge_ " when used in this Agreement with respect to the
Company shall mean the actual knowledge of those persons set forth in Section
5.1(g) of the Company Disclosure Letter.

 

(h) _Employee Benefits_.

 

(i) All material benefit and compensation plans, contracts (including
employment and consulting contracts), policies or arrangements covering
current or former employees, directors or other individual service providers
of the Company and its Subsidiaries that are maintained, sponsored or
administered by the Company or its Subsidiaries, under which the Company or
its Subsidiaries is subject to continuing financial obligations or with
respect to which the Company or its Subsidiaries could reasonably be expected
to incur any liability, including, but not limited to, "employee benefit
plans" within the meaning of Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act of 1974, as amended (" _ERISA_ "), and deferred compensation,
severance, pension, retirement, bonus, health and welfare, stock option, stock
purchase, stock appreciation rights, stock based, and incentive plans
(whether or not material, the " _Benefit Plans_ ") are listed on Section
5.1(h)(i) of the Company Disclosure Letter. True and complete copies of all
Benefit Plans listed on Section 5.1(h)(i) of the Company Disclosure Letter
and, as applicable, the most recent actuarial valuation and audit reports, and
the IRS determination letter currently in effect have been made available to
Parent.

 

(ii) All Benefit Plans, other than "multiemployer plans" within the meaning of
Section 3(37) of ERISA (each, a " _Multiemployer Plan_ ") have been
established, maintained, funded and administered and are in compliance with
their terms, the terms of any applicable collective bargaining agreement,
ERISA, the Code and other applicable Laws, except as would not, individually
or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect. No Benefit Plan is a Multiemployer Plan. Each Benefit Plan (other than
any Multiemployer Plan) which is subject to ERISA (an " _ERISA Plan_ ") that
is an "employee pension benefit plan" within the meaning of Section 3(2) of
ERISA intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code, has received
a favorable determination or opinion letter from the Internal Revenue Service
(the " _IRS_ ") or has applied to the IRS for such favorable determination or
opinion letter under Section 401(b) of the Code. To the Knowledge of the
Company, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any other Person
has engaged in a transaction with respect to any ERISA Plan that, assuming the
taxable period of such transaction expired as of the date hereof, would
reasonably be expected to subject the Company or any Subsidiary to a tax or
penalty imposed by either Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502(i) of ERISA
in an amount which would be material.

 



-17- (iii) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has or is
reasonably expected to incur any liability under Subtitle C or D of Title IV
of ERISA with respect to any ongoing, frozen or terminated "single-employer
plan", within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(15) of ERISA, currently or
formerly maintained by any of them, or the single-employer plan of any entity
which is considered one employer with the Company under Section 4001 of ERISA
or Section 414 of the Code (an " _ERISA Affiliate_ "), except as would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect. The Company and its Subsidiaries have not incurred
and do not expect to incur any withdrawal liability with respect to a
Multiemployer Plan under Subtitle E of Title IV of ERISA (regardless of
whether based on contributions of an ERISA Affiliate) that has not been
satisfied, except as would not reasonably be expected, individually or in the
aggregate, to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 

(iv) There are no pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company threatened,
claims, audits, investigations, proceedings or litigation relating to the
Benefit Plans, other than routine claims for benefits, except as would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect. Other than pursuant to an existing
collective bargaining or similar agreement between the Company and any labor
union, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any obligations for
retiree health and life benefits under any ERISA Plan.

 

(v) Neither the execution of this Agreement, the approval of the Merger by the
stockholders of the Company nor the consummation of the Merger will (A)
entitle any Designated Officer to severance pay or any material increase in
severance pay upon any termination of employment after the date hereof (other
than severance pay required by any Law) or (B) accelerate the time of payment
or vesting or result in any material payment or funding (through a grantor
trust or otherwise) of compensation or benefits under, increase the amount
payable or result in any other material obligation pursuant to, any of the
Benefit Plans.

(vi) No amount that could be received (whether in cash or property or the
vesting of property), as a result of the consummation of the Merger, by any
employee, director or other individual service provider of the Company or its
Subsidiaries under any Benefit Plan or otherwise would not be deductible by
reason of Section 280G of the Code or would be subject to an excise tax under
Section 4999 of the Code, except as would not individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.
Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any indemnity obligation
on or after the Effective Time for any Taxes imposed under Section 4999 or
409A of the Code.

 



-18- The term " _Designated Officer_ " when used in this Agreement shall mean
an "officer" of the Company for purposes of Rule 16a-1(f) under the Exchange
Act. Section 5.1(h) of the Company Disclosure Letter contains a correct and
complete list of the Designated Officers as of the date of this Agreement.

 

(i) _Compliance with Laws; Licenses_. The businesses of each of the Company
and its Subsidiaries have not been since the Applicable Date, and are not
being, conducted in violation of any federal, state, local or foreign law,
statute or ordinance, common law, or any rule, regulation, standard, judgment,
order, writ, injunction, decree, arbitration award, agency requirement,
license or permit of any Governmental Entity (collectively, " _Laws_ "),
except for violations that, individually or in the aggregate, are not
reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Except with
respect to regulatory matters covered by Section 6.5, no investigation or
review by any Governmental Entity, NERC or PJM with respect to the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries is pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company,
threatened, nor has any Governmental Entity indicated an intention to conduct
the same, except for such investigations or reviews, the outcome of which is
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably likely to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect. The Company and its Subsidiaries each has obtained
and is in compliance with all permits, certifications, approvals,
registrations, consents, authorizations, franchises, variances, exemptions and
orders issued or granted by a Governmental Entity, NERC or PJM (" _Licenses_
") necessary to conduct its business as presently conducted, except those the
absence of which would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 

(j) _Company Material Contracts_. Except as has not had (since December 31,
2013) or would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect, (i) neither the Company nor any
Subsidiary of the Company is in breach of or default under the terms of any
Contract that would be required to be filed by the Company as a "material
contract" (as such term is defined in item 601(b)(10) of Regulation S-K of the
Securities Act, except for any such Contract that is a Benefit Plan or would

effect on Parent and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or prevent,
materially delay or materially impair the ability of Parent and Merger Sub to
consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

(ii) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by Parent and

suits, claims, hearings, investigations or proceedings pending or, to the

any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except as would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to prevent or
materially delay the ability of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

The term " _Knowledge_ " when used in this Agreement with respect to Parent
shall mean the actual knowledge of the Chief Executive Officer, Chief
Financial Officer and General Counsel.

Each of Parents Subsidiaries that directly owns generating facilities and
operates their power generation facilities is in compliance with all
applicable standards of NERC, other than non-compliance that would not
reasonably be expected to prevent, materially delay or impair Parent from
consummating the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the
Agreement or have, individually or in the aggregate, a material impact
on Parent. There are no pending, or to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened,
judicial or administrative proceedings (i) that would reasonably be expected

that would revoke a Parents Subsidiarys market-based rate authorization.

projections, forecasts and other forward-looking information, as well as
certain business plan and cost-related plan information, regarding the
Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective businesses and operations.
Parent and Merger Sub hereby acknowledge that there are uncertainties inherent
in attempting to make such estimates, projections, forecasts and other
forward-looking statements, with which Parent and Merger Sub are familiar,
that Parent and Merger Sub are taking full responsibility for making their own
evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of all estimates, projections,
forecasts and other forward-looking information, as well as such business
plans and cost-related plans, so furnished to them (including the
reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such estimates, projections,
forecasts, forward-looking information, business plans or cost-related
plans), and that Parent and Merger Sub will have no claim against the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, or any of their respective stockholders,
directors, officers, employees, Affiliates, advisors, agents or
representatives, or any other Person, with respect thereto. Accordingly,
Parent and Merger Sub hereby acknowledge that neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries, nor any of their respective stockholders, directors,
officers, employees, Affiliates, advisors, agents or representatives, nor any
other Person, has made or is making any representation or warranty with

supervision over its and its Subsidiaries respective operations.

 

6.2. _Acquisition Proposals_.

 

(a) _No Solicitation or Negotiation_. The Company agrees that except as
expressly permitted by this Section 6.2, neither it nor any of its
Subsidiaries, nor any of its or their respective directors, officers or
employees, shall, and that it shall instruct and use its reasonable best
efforts to cause its and its Subsidiaries investment bankers, attorneys,
accountants and other advisors and representatives not to (such investment
bankers, attorneys, accountants and other advisors and representatives,
collectively, " _Representatives_ "), directly or indirectly:

 

(i) initiate, solicit or encourage any inquiries or the making of any proposal
or offer that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, any
Acquisition Proposal;

(ii) engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions
or negotiations regarding, or provide any non-public information or data to
any Person relating to, or that could reasonably be expected to lead to, any
Acquisition Proposal;

 

(iii) facilitate knowingly any effort or attempt to make an Acquisition
Proposal;

 

(iv) grant any waiver, amendment or release under any standstill agreement, or
otherwise fail to enforce any standstill agreement (other than in each case,
the right to waive or fail to enforce any prohibition on requests for
amendments to any standstill agreement (or other similar "dont ask, dont
waive" provisions) with any Person who, or any of whose Affiliates, did not
submit an Acquisition Proposal between April 1, 2014 and the date of this
Agreement); _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not be prohibited
from taking (or, in the case of enforcement, shall not be required to take)
any such action if the board of directors of the Company shall have determined
in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that failing to
take such action (or in the case of enforcement, taking such action) would be
reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties
under applicable Law;

(v) execute or enter into any letter of intent, agreement in principle, term
sheet, memorandum of understanding, merger agreement, acquisition agreement or
other similar agreement relating to an Acquisition Proposal (other than an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement) (an " _Alternative Acquisition
Agreement_ "); or

 



-31- (vi) resolve or agree to do any of the foregoing.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary, prior to the
time, but not after, the Company Requisite Vote is obtained, the Company may
(A) provide information in response to a request therefor by a Person who has
made an unsolicited _bona fide_ written Acquisition Proposal if prior to
providing such information the Company receives from the Person so requesting
such information an executed confidentiality agreement on terms that are not
less restrictive to the other party than those contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement, it being understood that such confidentiality
agreement need not prohibit the making, or amendment, of an Acquisition
Proposal (an " _Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement_ "); and promptly
discloses (and, if applicable, provides copies of) any such information to
Parent to the extent not previously disclosed or provided; (B) engage or
participate in any discussions or negotiations with any Person who has made
such an unsolicited _bona fide_ written Acquisition Proposal; or (C) after
having complied with Section 6.2(d), make a Change of Recommendation or
approve, recommend, or otherwise declare advisable or propose to approve,
recommend or declare advisable (publicly or otherwise) with respect to such
Acquisition Proposal; if and only to the extent that, (x) prior to taking any
action described in clause (A), (B) or (C) above, the board of directors of
the Company shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel, that failure to take such action would be reasonably
likely to be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under
applicable Law, (y) in each case referred to in clause (A) and (B), the board
of directors of the Company shall have determined in good faith,
after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel,
that such Acquisition Proposal either constitutes a Superior Proposal or is
reasonably likely to result in a Superior Proposal, and (z) in the case
referred to in clause (C) above, the board of directors of the Company
determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and
outside legal counsel) that such Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal.

 

(c) _Definitions_. For purposes of this Agreement:

 

" _Acquisition Proposal_ " means (i) any proposal or offer with respect to a
merger, joint venture, partnership, consolidation, dissolution, liquidation,
tender offer, recapitalization, reorganization, share exchange, business
combination or similar transaction involving the Company and/or any of its
Significant Subsidiaries or (ii) any direct or indirect acquisition by any
Person or "group" (as defined in the Exchange Act) resulting in, or proposal
or offer, which if consummated would result in, any Person or "group" (as
defined in the Exchange Act) becoming the beneficial owner, directly or
indirectly, in one or a series of related transactions, of 15% or more of the
total voting power or of any class of equity securities of the Company, or
assets representing 15% or more of the net revenues, net income or
consolidated total assets (measured by fair market value) of the Company and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (including equity securities of its
Subsidiaries), in each case other than the Merger.

 



-32- " _Superior Proposal_ " means a _bona fide_ Acquisition Proposal (for
purposes of this definition, replacing all references in the definition of
"Acquisition Proposal" to 15% with 75%), that the board of directors of the
Company has determined in its good faith judgment is reasonably likely to be
consummated in accordance with its terms, after consultation with its
financial advisors and outside legal counsel, taking into account all legal,
financial, and regulatory aspects of the Acquisition Proposal, and the Person
making the Acquisition Proposal, and, if consummated would result in a
transaction more favorable to the Companys stockholders from a financial
point of view than the transaction contemplated by this Agreement (after
taking into account any proposed revisions to the terms of the transactions
contemplated by Section 6.2(d) of this Agreement).

(d) _No Change in Recommendation or Alternative Acquisition Agreement_. The
board of directors of the Company and each committee of the board of directors
shall not:

(i) (A) withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify (or publicly propose or resolve
to withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify), in a manner adverse to Parent, the
Company Recommendation (B) fail to include the Company Recommendation in the
Proxy Statement, (C) approve, recommend or otherwise declare advisable or
propose or resolve to approve, recommend or otherwise declare advisable
(publicly or otherwise), any Acquisition Proposal, or (D) fail to publicly
reaffirm the Company Recommendation within ten business days after Parent so
requests in writing (provided, that Parent shall be entitled to make such a
written request for reaffirmation only once for each Acquisition Proposal and
once for each material amendment to such Acquisition Proposal) (any action
described in clauses (A) and (D) a " _Change of Recommendation_ "); or

(ii) Except as expressly permitted by, and after compliance with this Section
6.2(d), cause or permit the Company to enter into any Alternative Acquisition
Agreement.

 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, prior to
the time, but not after, the Company Requisite Vote is obtained, the board of
directors of the Company (x) may make a Change of Recommendation and in
connection therewith, approve, recommend or otherwise declare advisable, and
enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement in connection with a Superior
Proposal made after the date of this Agreement (if such Superior Proposal did
not result from a material breach of Section 6.2(a) and such Superior Proposal
is not withdrawn) or (y) may make a Change of Recommendation as a result of
the occurrence of an Intervening Event, if, the board of directors of the
Company determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal
counsel, that failure to do so would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent
with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the board of

 



-33-  directors of the Company shall not (i) in the case of clause (x) make a
Change of Recommendation with respect to a Superior Proposal and authorize the
Company to enter into any Alterative Acquisition Agreement or (ii) in the
case of clause (y) make a Change of Recommendation unless:

(i) the Company has notified Parent in writing that it intends to effect a
Change of Recommendation, describing in reasonable detail the reasons for such
Change of Recommendation (a " _Recommendation Change Notice_ ") (it being
agreed that the Recommendation Change Notice and any amendment or update to
such notice and the determination to so deliver such notice, or update or
amend public disclosures with respect thereto shall not constitute a Change of
Recommendation for purposes of this Agreement), and if such proposed Change
of Recommendation relates to an Acquisition Proposal, has provided copies of
the most current version of all documents relating to such Acquisition
Proposal, and if such proposed Change of Recommendation relates to an
Intervening Event, such Recommendation Change Notice specifies the facts and
circumstances of such Intervening Event; and

 

(ii) (x) if requested by Parent, the Company shall have made its
Representatives available to discuss and negotiate in good faith with Parent
and its Representatives any proposed modifications to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement during the three business days following the date on which
the Recommendation Change Notice is delivered to Parent and (y) if Parent
shall have delivered to the Company a written, binding and irrevocable offer
to alter the terms or conditions of this Agreement during such three business
day period, the board of directors of the Company shall have determined in
good faith after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal
counsel, after considering the terms of such offer by Parent, that the failure
to effect a Change of Recommendation would be reasonably likely to be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, and that in the
case of a Change of Recommendation with respect to an Acquisition Proposal,
such Acquisition Proposal would continue to constitute a Superior Proposal if
the changes offered by Parent were given effect, and that in the case of an
Intervening Event, the board of directors of the Company still intends to
effect a Change of Recommendation if the changes offered by Parent were given
effect; _provided_ that in the event the Acquisition Proposal is thereafter
modified by the party making such Acquisition Proposal, the Company shall
notify Parent in writing of such modified Acquisition Proposal and shall again
comply with the requirements of this clause (ii).

 

" _Intervening Event_ " shall mean any change, event or occurrence that is (a)
unknown to or by the board of directors of the Company as of the date of this
Agreement (or if known, the magnitude or material consequences of which were
not known or understood by the board of directors of the Company as of the
date of this Agreement) and (b) becomes known to or by the board of directors
of the Company prior to obtaining the Company Requisite Vote.

 



-34- (e) _Certain Permitted Disclosure_. Nothing contained in this Section 6.2
shall be deemed to prohibit the Company or the board of directors of the
Company from (i) complying with its disclosure obligations under U.S. federal
or state Law with regard to an Acquisition Proposal, including taking and
disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule
14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act (or any similar communication to
stockholders); or (ii) making any "stop, look and listen" communication to the
stockholders of the Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act.

(f) _Existing Discussions_. The Company agrees that it and its
Subsidiaries will, and that it will instruct and use its reasonable best
efforts to cause its and its Subsidiaries Representatives to immediately
cease and cause to be terminated any existing activities, discussions or
negotiations with any parties conducted heretofore with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal. The Company agrees that it will take the necessary steps
to promptly inform the individuals or entities referred to in the first
sentence hereof of the obligations undertaken in this Section 6.2.

(g) _Notice_. The Company agrees that it will promptly (and, in any event,
within 24 hours) notify Parent if any proposals or offers with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal are received by, any non-public information is requested
from, or any discussions or negotiations are sought to be initiated or
continued with, the Company or any of its Representatives indicating, in
connection with such notice, the identity of the Person or group of Persons
making the proposal, offer or request and the material terms and conditions of
any proposals or offers (including, if applicable, copies of any
written requests, proposals or offers, including proposed agreements) and
thereafter shall keep Parent reasonably informed, on a prompt basis (and, in
any event, within 24 hours), of the status and terms of any such proposals or
offers (including any material amendments thereto or any change to the scope
or material terms or conditions thereof, and including copies of additional
written materials or material modifications thereof) and the status of any
such discussions or negotiations, including any change in the Companys
intentions as previously notified.

6.3. _Proxy Statement_.

 

(a) The Company shall, as promptly as practicable after the date of this
Agreement (and in any event within 30 business days following the date of
this Agreement), prepare and file a proxy statement in preliminary form
relating to the Stockholders Meeting (such proxy statement, including any
amendment or supplement thereto, the " _Proxy Statement_ ") with the SEC. The
Company agrees that as of the date of mailing to stockholders of the Company
and at the time of the Stockholders Meeting, (i) the Proxy Statement will
comply in all material respects with the applicable provisions of the Exchange
Act and the rules and regulations thereunder and (ii) none of the information
supplied by it or any of its Subsidiaries for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in the Proxy Statement will contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not

 



-35-  misleading. Parent and Merger Sub agree that none of the information
supplied by either of them or any of their Affiliates for inclusion in the
Proxy Statement will contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading.

 

(b) The Company shall promptly notify Parent of the receipt of all comments
from the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement and of any request by the
SEC for any amendment or supplement thereto or for additional information and
shall promptly provide to Parent copies of all correspondence between the
Company and/or any of its Representatives and the SEC with respect to the
Proxy Statement. The Company and Parent shall each use its reasonable best
efforts to promptly provide responses to the SEC with respect to all comments
received on the Proxy Statement from the SEC. The Company shall cause the
definitive Proxy Statement to be mailed promptly after the date the SEC staff
advises that it has no further comments thereon or that the Company may
commence mailing the Proxy Statement.

 

6.4. _Stockholders Meeting_. Subject to fiduciary obligations under applicable
Law, the Company will take, in accordance with applicable Law and its
certificate of incorporation and bylaws, all reasonable action necessary to
convene a meeting of holders of Shares (the " _Stockholders Meeting_ ") as
promptly as practicable (but in any event within 60 days) after the date on
which the SEC staff advises that it has no further comments thereon or that
the Company may commence mailing the Proxy Statement to consider and vote upon
the adoption of this Agreement; _provided_ , that the Company shall not
postpone, recess or adjourn such meeting except (a) to the extent required by
Law, (b) to allow reasonable additional time for the filing and/or mailing of
any supplemental or amended disclosure that the board of directors of the
Company has determined in good faith after consultation with outside legal
counsel is necessary under applicable Law and for such supplemental or amended
disclosure to be disseminated and reviewed by the Companys stockholders prior
to the Stockholders Meeting, or (c) one adjournment for a period of up to 10
days only to solicit additional proxies so as to establish a quorum or to
obtain the Company Requisite Vote, with the consent of Parent (such consent
not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Subject to Section
6.2, the board of directors of the Company and any committee thereof shall
recommend such adoption and, unless and until there has been a Change of
Recommendation, shall include the Company Recommendation in the Proxy
Statement and take all reasonable lawful action to solicit such adoption of
this Agreement. Notwithstanding any Change of Recommendation, unless this
Agreement is terminated pursuant to Article VIII, this Agreement shall be
submitted to the holders of Shares at the Stockholders Meeting for the purpose
of adopting this Agreement.

6.5. _Filings; Other Actions; Notification_.

(a) _Cooperation_. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this
Agreement, including Section 6.5(e) below, the Company and Parent shall
cooperate with each other and use (and shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries to use) their respective

 



-36-  reasonable best efforts to take or cause to be taken all actions, and do or
cause to be done all things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its
part under this Agreement and applicable Laws to consummate and make
effective the Merger as soon as practicable, including preparing and filing as
promptly as practicable (and in any event shall make all filings with the
State Commissions, the FERC, the FCC and pursuant to the HSR Act within 60
days of the date hereof) all documentation to effect all necessary notices,
reports and other filings and to obtain as promptly as practicable all
consents, registrations, approvals, permits and authorizations necessary or
advisable to be obtained from any third party and/or any Governmental Entity
in order to consummate the Merger. The Company and Parent will each request
early termination of the waiting period with respect to the Merger under the
HSR Act. Subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information,
Parent and the Company shall have the right to review in advance and, to the
extent practicable, each will consult with the other on and consider in good
faith the views of the other in connection with, all of the information
relating to Parent or the Company, as the case may be, and any of their
respective Subsidiaries, that appears in any filing made with, or written
materials submitted to, any third party and/or any Governmental Entity in
connection with the Merger (including the Proxy Statement). In exercising the
foregoing rights, each of the Company and Parent shall act reasonably and as
promptly as practicable. Nothing in this Agreement shall require the Company
or its Subsidiaries to take or agree to take any action with respect to its
business or operations unless the effectiveness of such agreement or action is
conditioned upon Closing.

 

(b) _Information_. Subject to applicable Laws, the Company and Parent each
shall, upon request by the other, furnish the other with all information
concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and stockholders and
such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection
with the Proxy Statement or any other statement, filing, notice or
application made by or on behalf of Parent, the Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries to any third party and/or any Governmental Entity in
connection with the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including under the HSR Act and any other applicable antitrust
Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that either party may designate information "for
outside counsel only" and either party may redact information related to the
value of the transaction. Subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange
of information and except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, Parent and
the Company shall have the right to review in advance, and to the extent
practicable each will consult with the other regarding, and consider in good
faith the views of the other in connection with, all of the information
relating to Parent or the Company, as the case may be, and any of their
respective Affiliates and Representatives, that appears in any filing made
with, or written materials submitted to, any Governmental Entity in
connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. In exercising the foregoing rights, each of the Company and Parent
shall act reasonably and as promptly as practicable.

(c) _Status_. Subject to applicable Laws and the instructions of any
Governmental Entity, the Company and Parent each shall keep the other
apprised of the status of matters relating to completion of the transactions
contemplated hereby,

 



-37-  including promptly furnishing the other with copies of notices or other
communications received by Parent or the Company, as the case may be, or any
of their respective Representatives, from any third party and/or any
Governmental Entity with respect to the Merger; _provided_ , _however_ , that
either party may designate information or notices or other communications as
"for outside counsel only". Neither the Company nor Parent shall permit any
of its officers or any other Representatives to participate in any meeting or
substantive telephone discussion with any Governmental Entity in respect of
any filings, investigation or other inquiry with respect to the Merger unless
to the extent practicable (i) it consults with the other party in advance and
(ii) and to the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity, gives the other
party the opportunity to attend and participate in such meeting
or substantive telephone discussion.

(d) _Regulatory Matters_. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in
this Agreement, without limiting the generality of the other undertakings
pursuant to this Section 6.5, each of the Company (in the case of Sections
6.5(d)(i) and 6.5(d)(iii) set forth below) and Parent (in all cases set forth
below) agree to take or cause to be taken the following actions:

(i) the prompt provision to each and every federal, state, local or foreign
court or Governmental Entity (including the FERC, the FCC and the State
Commissions) with jurisdiction over any Company Approvals or Parent Approvals
of non-privileged information and documents requested by any such Governmental
Entity that are necessary, proper or advisable to permit consummation of the
Merger;

(ii) the prompt use of its reasonable best efforts to avoid the entry or
enactment of any permanent, preliminary or temporary injunction or other
order, decree, decision, determination, judgment or Law that would delay,
restrain, prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit consummation of the Merger;
and

 

(iii) the prompt use of its reasonable best efforts to take, in the event that
any permanent, preliminary or temporary injunction, decision, order,
judgment, determination, decree or Law is entered, issued or enacted, or
becomes reasonably foreseeable to be entered, issued or enacted, in any
proceeding, review or inquiry of any kind that would make consummation of the
Merger in accordance with the terms of this Agreement unlawful or that would
delay, restrain, prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit consummation of the
Merger, any and all steps (including the appeal thereof, the posting of a bond
or the taking of the steps contemplated by clause (ii) of this Section
6.5(d)) necessary to resist, vacate, modify, reverse, suspend, prevent,
eliminate, avoid or remove such actual, anticipated or threatened injunction,
decision, order, judgment, determination, decree or enactment so as to permit
such consummation on a schedule as close as possible to that contemplated by
this Agreement;

 

 _provided_ that nothing herein shall require (and reasonable best efforts
shall in no event require) any party or its Subsidiaries to agree to or
take any action that would otherwise

 



-38-  constitute a Burdensome Condition. A " _Burdensome Condition_ " shall mean
any terms, conditions, liabilities, obligations, commitments or sanctions
imposed upon Parent, the Company or their respective Subsidiaries (A) in the
Regulatory Approvals, or (B) in any Laws enacted for the purpose of imposing
terms, conditions, liabilities, obligations, commitments or sanctions in
connection with the Merger (any of the foregoing in clause (B) a " _Merger
Law_ "), that, individually or in the aggregate, would constitute or be
reasonably likely to constitute a Regulatory Failure (as defined below),
_provided_ , _however_ , that any such terms, conditions, liabilities,
obligations, commitments or sanctions shall not be taken into account in
determining whether there has been or is such a Regulatory Failure to the
extent they implement the Regulatory Commitments. A " _Regulatory Failure_ "
shall mean terms, conditions, liabilities, obligations, commitments or
sanctions (giving effect to the value of any negative effects net of their
benefits) that in an aggregate amount constitute a material and adverse
effect on the condition (financial or otherwise), assets, liabilities,
businesses or results of operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken
as a whole, _provided_ , _that_ , for the purposes of determining the
existence of a Regulatory Failure, (i) the Company and its Subsidiaries shall
be deemed to have 50% of the assets, liabilities, businesses and results of
operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and (ii) any
terms, conditions, liabilities, obligations, commitments or sanctions imposed
upon Parent and its Subsidiaries shall be deemed to have been imposed on the
Company and its Subsidiaries.

 

(e) _Regulatory Commitments_. The Company and Parent agree (i) that the
applications submitted to FERC and the State Commissions with respect to the
Merger shall include the information concerning the Merger, the Company and
its Subsidiaries, and Parent required by applicable Laws of the District of
Columbia, the States of Delaware, Maryland, and New Jersey, the
Commonwealth of Virginia and such other jurisdictions as may be mutually
determined by the Company and Parent, as the case may be, (ii) that such
applications and any amendments or supplements thereto shall include the
Regulatory Commitments to the extent applicable to such jurisdictions and
such additional agreements or commitments as the Company and Parent agree are
advisable to obtain prompt approval of such applications, and (iii) that
neither the Company nor Parent shall agree to, or accept, any additional or
different agreements, commitments or conditions in connection with the Merger
pursuant to any settlement or otherwise with any State Commissions or any
other Person, in the case of any agreement, commitment or condition to which
the Company of any of its Subsidiaries is a party or otherwise affecting the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, without the prior written consent of
Parent, and in the case of any agreement, commitment or condition to which
Parent is a party and affecting the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
without the prior written consent of the Company if such agreement, commitment
or condition is effective prior to the Effective Time. Parent further agrees
that, subject to obtaining the consent of the Company as required by this
Section 6.5(e), it will agree to, or accept, any additional or different
agreements, commitments or conditions that do not, individually or in the
aggregate, constitute a Burdensome Condition to obtain any governmental
approvals necessary to promptly consummate the Merger, including any Parent
Approval or the FERC Approval, the State Approvals and the FCC Approval.



 



-39- (f) _Rate Cases_. Between the date of this Agreement and the Closing, the
Company and its Subsidiaries shall be permitted to continue to diligently
pursue the rate cases set forth on Section 6.5(f) of the Company Disclosure
Letter (collectively, the " _Rate Cases_ ") consistent with past practice, and
to the extent permitted by Law, notify Parent about any material
developments, or material communications with the FERC or the applicable State
Commission, relating thereto. Except as required by Exhibit B, prior to making
any commitments or settlement offers in the Rate Cases, the Company shall
(and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) consult with Parent and consider in good
faith any suggestions made by Parent in connection therewith. The Company
shall not (and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to) settle the Rate Cases
without the prior written consent of Parent (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) to the extent that such
settlement would result in an outcome for the Company and its Subsidiaries
that would be materially adverse to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
taking into account the requests made by the Company and its Subsidiaries in
the proceeding, the resolution of similar recent proceedings by the Company
and its Subsidiaries and the reasonable expectations of Parent as of the date
hereof for such outcome.

6.6. _Access and Reports_.

 

(a) Subject to applicable Law, upon reasonable notice, the Company shall (and
shall cause its Subsidiaries to) afford Parents officers and other
authorized Representatives (including financing sources) reasonable access,
during normal business hours throughout the period prior to the Effective
Time, to its employees, properties, books, contracts and records and, during
such period, the Company shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) furnish
promptly to Parent all information concerning its business, properties and
personnel as may reasonably be requested, provided that no investigation
pursuant to this Section 6.6 shall affect or be deemed to modify any
representation or warranty made by the Company herein, and provided, further,
that the foregoing shall not require the Company (i) to permit any inspection,
or to disclose any information, that in the reasonable judgment of the
Company would result in the disclosure of any trade secrets of third parties
or violate any obligations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with
respect to confidentiality if the Company shall have used reasonable best
efforts to obtain the consent of such third party to such inspection or
disclosure or (ii) to disclose any privileged information of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries. All requests for information made pursuant to
this Section 6.6 shall be directed to the executive officer or other Person
designated by the Company. All such information shall be governed by the terms
of the Confidentiality Agreement.

 

(b) _Financing Cooperation_. The Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, use its and their reasonable best efforts to provide such
cooperation as may be reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the
financing of the Transactions, including using reasonable best efforts to (i)
provide reasonable assistance with the preparation of any discussions of
business, financial statements, pro forma financials, projections, management
discussion and analysis, and other customary financial data of the Company and
its Subsidiaries, all for use in connection therewith

 



-40-  and (ii) direct its independent accountants to provide customary and
reasonable assistance to Parent including in connection with providing
customary comfort letters. Parent shall reimburse the Company for all
reasonable out-of-pocket costs or expenses incurred by the Company and its
Subsidiaries in connection with cooperation provided for in this Section
6.6(b) to the extent the information requested of the Company was not
otherwise prepared or available in the ordinary course of business. For the
avoidance of doubt, Parent hereby expressly acknowledges that its obligations
under this Agreement are not subject to the availability of any financing.

 

6.7. _Stock Exchange De-listing_. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall
cooperate with Parent and use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions, and do or cause to be done all things, reasonably
necessary, proper or advisable on its part under applicable Laws and rules and
policies of the NYSE to enable the delisting by the Surviving Corporation
of the Shares from the NYSE and the deregistration of the Shares under the
Exchange Act as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time.

 

6.8. _Publicity_. The initial press release regarding the Merger shall be a
joint press release and thereafter the Company and Parent each shall consult
with each other prior to issuing any press releases or otherwise making public
announcements with respect to the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and prior to making any filings with any third
party and/or any Governmental Entity (including any national securities
exchange or interdealer quotation service) with respect thereto, and no public
release or announcement concerning the Merger or any other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall be issued or made by any party without
the prior consent of the other parties except as may be required by Law or by
obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with or rules of any national
securities exchange or interdealer quotation service or by the request of any
Governmental Entity (in which case the party required to issue or make such
press release or announcement shall give reasonable notice to the other party
or parties, including the opportunity to review or comment on such press
release or announcement to the extent practicable).

6.9. _Employee Benefits_.

 

(a) Parent agrees that, during the period commencing at the Effective Time and
ending two years after the Effective Time (" _Benefit Period_ "), Parent
shall provide, or shall cause to be provided (1) to each employee of the
Company and its Subsidiaries (other than any employee who is covered by a
collective bargaining or similar agreement between the Company and any labor
union) who is employed as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and
continues employment with the Company or its Subsidiaries immediately after
the Effective Time (each, a " _Continuing Employee_ "), base salary,
annual incentive opportunity and long-term incentive compensation
opportunities, which are, in each case, no less than those provided by the
Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time to each
such Continuing Employee, (2) to the Continuing Employees, pension and
welfare benefits and perquisites (to the extent described in the Company
Disclosure Letter) that are no less favorable in

 



-41-  the aggregate than those provided by the Company and its Subsidiaries
immediately prior to the Effective Time and (3) to the Continuing Employees,
severance benefits that are no less favorable than the severance benefits
provided by the Company and its Subsidiaries to such Continuing Employees
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 

(b) For purposes of vesting, benefit accrual (but not for benefit accrual
purposes under any defined benefit pension plan), vacation and sick time
credit and eligibility to participate under the employee benefit plans,
programs and policies of Parent and its Subsidiaries providing benefits to any
Continuing Employee after the Effective Time (including the Benefit Plans)
(the " _New Plans_ "), each Continuing Employee shall be credited with his or
her years of service with the Company and its Subsidiaries and their
respective predecessors before the Effective Time, to the same extent and for
the same purpose as such Continuing Employee was entitled, before the
Effective Time, to credit for such service under any similar Benefit Plan in
which such Continuing Employee participated or was eligible to participate
immediately prior to the Effective Time;  _provided_ that the foregoing shall
not apply to the extent that its application would result in a duplication of
benefits with respect to the same period of service. In addition, and without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent shall cause (i) each
Continuing Employee to be immediately eligible to participate, without any
waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the extent coverage under such New
Plan is replacing comparable coverage under a Benefit Plan in which such
Continuing Employee participated immediately before the Effective Time (such
plans, collectively, the " _Old Plans_ "), and (ii) for purposes of each New
Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any
Continuing Employee, any evidence of insurability requirements, all pre-
existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New
Plan to be waived for such Continuing Employee and his or her covered
dependents, to the extent such conditions were inapplicable or waived under
the comparable Old Plan. Parent shall cause any eligible expenses incurred by
any Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion
of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the date such Continuing
Employees participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into
account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible,
coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to
such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable
plan year; _provided_ that such amount was taken into account for the same
purpose under the similar Benefit Plan for such period and would not result in
the duplication of benefits.

(c) Parent hereby acknowledges that a "change in control" or other event with
similar import, within the meaning of the Benefit Plans that contain such
terms will occur upon the Effective Time. Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation and any successor thereto to, honor, assume, fulfill and
discharge the Companys and its Subsidiaries obligations under the Companys
Change in Control Severance Plan and the other Benefit Plans listed on Section
6.9(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter. Parent agrees that it will not (nor
cause any other Person or entity to) request that the Company or any
Continuing Employee waive or relinquish any compensation or benefit
entitlement or right (including any severance entitlement) existing as of the
Effective Time.

 



-42- (d) (i) If the Effective Time occurs during calendar year 2014, at the
Effective Time the Company shall pay each participant in the Companys
incentive plans (the " _Incentive Plans_ ") who remains employed through the
Effective Time, an annual incentive amount in respect of the 2014 fiscal year,
equal to the higher of (A) the target level (at 100% funding) and (B) the
actual level of performance achieved as of the Effective Time (with such
performance measure pro-rated, if applicable, for the portion of the

and based on performance through the day that is no more than five business
days prior to the Effective Time.

(ii) If the Effective Time has not occurred by December 31, 2014 (or December
31, 2015), the Company shall (A) determine the amounts earned under the
Incentive Plans in respect of the 2014 fiscal year (or 2015 fiscal year), with
performance based on either (x) the target level (at 100% funding) or (y) the
actual level of performance for the 2014 fiscal year (or 2015 fiscal year),
(B) pay such amounts in respect of the 2014 fiscal year (or 2015 fiscal year)
no later than the Closing Date and (C) establish annual incentive
award targets, maximums and performance award levels and performance measures
for the 2015 fiscal year (or 2016 fiscal year) under the Incentive Plans.

 

(iii) If the Effective Time occurs during calendar year 2015, the Company

funding) and (y) the actual level of performance for the 2015 fiscal year
achieved as of the Effective Time (with such performance measure pro-rated,
if applicable, for the portion of the performance cycle completed at the
Effective Time), as determined by the compensation committee of the board of
directors of the Company prior to the Effective Time based on performance
through the day that is no more than five business days prior to the
Effective Time.

(iv) If the Effective Time occurs during calendar year 2016, the Company
shall pay such amounts in respect of the 2016 fiscal year on the Closing Date,
pro-rated based on the number of calendar days elapsed in the 2016 fiscal year
through the Closing Date, with performance determined at the higher of (x)
target level (at 100% funding) and (y) the actual level of performance for the
2016 fiscal year achieved as of the Effective Time (with such performance
measure pro-rated, if applicable, for the portion of the performance
cycle completed at the Effective Time), as determined by the compensation
committee of the board of directors of the Company prior to the Effective Time
based on performance through the day that is no more than five business days
prior to the Effective Time, and Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, honor and

 



-43-  pay incentive award amounts for the remainder of the 2016 fiscal year (with
an offset for the pro rata portion previously paid) in accordance with the
targets, levels and measures established by the Company prior to the Closing
Date and the terms of the applicable Incentive Plans.

(e) After the Effective Time, except as required by Section 304 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Company shall have no further rights to seek
recovery from employees of amounts paid under the Stock Plans or the Incentive
Plans for periods ending on or prior to the Effective Time.

 

(f) No later than the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions
reasonably necessary to cause each Continuing Employee to become 100% vested
in such Continuing Employees accounts under each Company 401(k) plan
(excluding for the avoidance of doubt any 401(k) plans maintained pursuant to
any collective bargaining or similar agreement between the Company and any
labor union), effective as of the Closing Date.

(g) With respect to each individual who is employed by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries immediately before the Effective Time whose terms and
conditions of employment are governed by a CBA between the Company and any

continue to honor such CBA, through its expiration, modification or
termination in accordance with its terms or applicable Law.

parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this Agreement, whether express or
implied, is intended to, or shall, (i) constitute the establishment or

Person, including any current or former employee of the Company or any
Subsidiary of the Company, any participant in any Benefit Plan, New Plan or
other benefit plan, agreement or arrangement (or any dependent or beneficiary
thereof).

6.10. _Expenses_. The Surviving Corporation shall pay all charges and
expenses, including those of the Paying Agent, in connection with the
transactions contemplated in Article IV, and Parent shall reimburse the
Surviving Corporation for such charges and expenses. Except as otherwise
provided in Section 8.5, whether or not the Merger is consummated, all costs
and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the party
incurring such expense.

that the Person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay
such advances if it is ultimately determined that such Person is not entitled
to indemnification), each present and former director and officer of the
Company and its Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ")
against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees),
judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities incurred in
connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or related to
such Indemnified Parties service as a director or officer of the Company or
its Subsidiaries or services performed by such persons at the request of the
Company or its Subsidiaries at or prior to the Effective Time, whether
asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, including the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall and, if the Company is
unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective
Time to, obtain and fully pay the premium for the extension of (i) the
directors and officers liability coverage of the Companys existing
directors and officers insurance policies, and (ii) the Companys existing
fiduciary liability insurance policies, in each case for a claims reporting or
discovery period of six years from and after the Effective Time from an
insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Companys
current insurance carrier with respect to directors and officers liability
insurance and fiduciary liability insurance (collectively, " _D andO
Insurance_") with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that
are at least as favorable as the Companys existing policies with respect to
any actual or alleged error, misstatement, misleading statement, act,
omission, neglect, breach of duty or any matter claimed against a director or
officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by reason of him or her
serving in such capacity that existed or occurred at or prior to the Effective
Time (including in connection with this Agreement or the transactions or
actions contemplated hereby). If the Company and the Surviving Corporation for
any reason fail to obtain such "tail" insurance policies as of the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, continue to maintain in effect for a period of at least six
years from and after the Effective Time the DandO Insurance in place as of the
date hereof with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that
are at least as favorable as provided in the Companys existing policies as
of the date hereof, or the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to, use reasonable best efforts to purchase

_however_ , that in no event shall Parent or the Surviving Corporation be
required to expend for such policies pursuant to this sentence an annual
premium amount in excess of 300% of the annual premiums currently paid by the
Company for such insurance; and _provided_ ,  _further_ , that if the annual
premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, the Surviving
Corporation shall obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a
cost not exceeding such amount.

or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfer all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any individual, corporation
or other entity, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made
so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation

omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time and rights to

any indemnification agreement between such Indemnified Party and the Company

Agreement, shall survive the Merger and shall not be amended, repealed or
otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely affect any right
thereunder of any such Indemnified Party.

approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that such transactions may
be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this
Agreement and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of
such statute or regulation on such transactions.

related to this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement is brought, or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened
in writing, against the Company and/or the members of the board of directors
of the Company after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective
Time (" _Transaction Litigation_ "), the Company shall promptly notify Parent
of any such Transaction Litigation and shall keep Parent reasonably informed
with respect to the status thereof.

as a result of a breach by Parent) (each of (i) and (ii), a " _Regulatory
Termination_ "), then (A) Parent shall pay Company a termination fee equal to
the Nonvoting Preferred Stock Purchase Price (the " _Parent Termination Fee_
") which Parent Termination Fee shall be paid by Parent by means of the
Company redeeming, as of the time of such termination, all of the outstanding
shares of Nonvoting Preferred Stock for no consideration, and all of the
outstanding shares of Nonvoting Preferred Stock will no longer be outstanding
as of the time of such redemption, and (B) Parent shall promptly, but in
no event later than five days after being notified of such by the Company,
pay all of the documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Company in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, up to a maximum amount of $40,000,000, payable by wire transfer of
immediately available funds. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, the parties hereby acknowledge that in the event that the Parent
Termination Fee (together with the expense reimbursement contemplated by the

 



-52-  immediately preceding sentence) is paid by Parent pursuant to this Section
8.5(c), the Parent Termination Fee (together with the expense reimbursement
contemplated by the immediately preceding sentence) shall be the Companys
sole and exclusive remedy for monetary damages under this Agreement, unless at
the time of such termination Parent is in breach of its obligations under
Section 6.5; _provided_ , that the Company is not then in breach of Section
6.5.

(d) In the event this Agreement is terminated by the Company or Parent
pursuant to this Article VIII other than pursuant to a Regulatory
Termination, the Company will redeem, within five business days of such
termination, all of the outstanding shares of Nonvoting Preferred Stock for an
aggregate amount equal to the Nonvoting Preferred Stock Purchase Price,
payable by the Company to Parent by wire transfer of immediately available
funds, and all of the outstanding shares of Nonvoting Preferred Stock will no
longer be outstanding as of the time of such redemption.

 

(e) In the event that this Agreement is terminated either (x) by Parent or the
Company pursuant to Section 8.2(b) or (y) in the case of termination of this
Agreement of the type contemplated by Section 8.5(b)(i) other than (i)
pursuant to Section 8.2(a) and the Parent Termination Fee is payable or (ii)
pursuant to Section 8.4(b) and (B) the Termination Fee is not then payable
pursuant to Section 8.5(b), the Company shall promptly, but in no event later
than five days after being notified of such by Parent, pay all of the
documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Parent or Merger Sub in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement up to a maximum amount of $40,000,000, payable by wire transfer of
immediately available funds (" _Parent Expenses_ "); _provided_ , that the
payment by the Company of Parent Expenses pursuant to this _Section 8.5(e)_
shall be credited against any amount that may become payable pursuant to
clause (x) of the definition of Termination Fee. The existence
of circumstances which could require the Termination Fee to become
subsequently payable by the Company pursuant to Section 8.5 shall not relieve
the Company of its obligations to pay the Parent Expenses pursuant to this
Section 8.5(e). The payment by the Company of Parent Expenses pursuant to
this Section 8.5(e) shall not relieve the Company of any subsequent obligation
to pay the Termination Fee pursuant to Section 8.5(b) (less a credit in the
amount of Parent Expenses, if applicable).

(f) The parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this Section 8.5
are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
that, without these agreements, the parties would not enter into this
Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails to promptly pay the amounts due
pursuant to Section 8.5(b) or Section 8.5(d), or Parent fails to promptly pay
the amount due pursuant to Section 8.5(c), and, in order to obtain such
payment, Parent or Merger Sub, on the one hand, or the Company, on the other
hand, commences a suit that results in a judgment against the Company for the
amounts set forth in Section 8.5(b) or Section 8.5(d), or any portion thereof,
or a judgment against Parent for the amount set forth in Section 8.5(c) or any
portion thereof, the Company shall pay to Parent or Merger Sub, on the one
hand, or Parent shall pay to the Company, on the other hand, its costs and
expenses (including attorneys fees) in connection with such suit, together
with interest on the amount of such amount or portion thereof at the Interest
Rate in effect on the date such payment was required to be made through the
date of payment.

proceeding may not be brought or is not maintainable in such courts or that
such courts are an inconvenient forum, or that the venue of such courts may

9.7. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including any exhibits hereto), the
Company Disclosure Letter, the Parent Disclosure Letter, the Subscription
Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement, dated March 7, 2014, between Parent
and the Company ( _provided_ that the Confidentiality Agreement shall not be
deemed to prevent Parent from exercising its rights under this Agreement) (as
may be amended from time to time, the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ") and the
other agreements entered into in connection with preserving the
confidentiality of information, constitute the entire agreement, and
supersede all other prior agreements, understandings, representations and
warranties both written and oral, among the parties, with respect to the
subject matter hereof. EACH PARTY HERETO AGREES THAT, EXCEPT FOR THE
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER PARENT
AND MERGER SUB NOR THE COMPANY MAKES OR RELIES ON ANY OTHER REPRESENTATIONS,
WARRANTIES OR INDUCEMENTS, AND EACH HEREBY DISCLAIMS ANY OTHER
REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES OR INDUCEMENTS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS TO

OTHER INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO ANY ONE OR MORE OF THE FOREGOING.

 

9.8. _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except as provided in Section 6.11
(Indemnification; Directors and Officers Insurance) only, Parent and the
Company hereby agree that their respective representations, warranties and
covenants set forth herein are solely for the benefit of the other party
hereto, in accordance with and subject to the terms of this Agreement, and
this Agreement is not intended to, and does not, confer upon any Person other
than the parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder, including the right
to rely upon the representations and warranties set forth herein. The
parties hereto further agree that the rights of third party beneficiaries
under Section 6.11 shall not arise unless and until the Effective Time occurs.
The representations and warranties in this Agreement are the product of
negotiations among the parties hereto and are for the sole benefit of the
parties hereto. Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are
subject to waiver by the parties hereto in accordance with Section 9.3

 



-57-  without notice or liability to any other Person. In some instances, the
representations and warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation
among the parties hereto of risks associated with particular matters
regardless of the knowledge of any of the parties hereto. Consequently,
Persons other than the parties hereto may not rely upon the representations
and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of actual facts
or circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any other date.

9.9. _Obligations of Parent and of the Company_. Whenever this Agreement
requires a Subsidiary of Parent to take any action, such requirement shall be
deemed to include an undertaking on the part of Parent to cause such

Section of this Agreement set forth opposite such term.

9.12. _Severability_. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed
severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof. If any
provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof to any Person or any
circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and equitable
provision shall be substituted therefor in order to carry out, so far as may
be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid or
unenforceable provision and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the
application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances shall not be
affected by such invalidity or unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity or
unenforceability affect the validity or enforceability of such provision, or
the application thereof, in any other jurisdiction.

9.13. _Interpretation; Construction_. (a) The table of contents and headings
herein are for convenience of reference only, do not constitute part of this
Agreement and shall not be deemed to limit or otherwise affect any of the
provisions hereof. Where a reference in this Agreement is made to a Section or
Exhibit, such reference shall be to a Section of or Exhibit to this Agreement
unless otherwise indicated. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or
"including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by
the words "without limitation."

(b) The parties have participated jointly in negotiating and drafting this
Agreement. In the event that an ambiguity or a question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly
by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provision of this
Agreement.

 



-58- (c) Each party here has or may have set forth information in its respective
Disclosure Letter in a section thereof that corresponds to the section of
this Agreement to which it relates. The fact that any item of information is
disclosed in a Disclosure Letter to this Agreement shall not be construed to
mean that such information is required to be disclosed by this Agreement.

9.14. _Assignment_. This Agreement shall not be assignable by operation of law
or otherwise;  _provided_ , _however_ , that, prior to the mailing of the
Proxy Statement to the Companys stockholders, Parent may designate, by
written notice to the Company, another wholly-owned direct or indirect
Subsidiary to be a Constituent Corporation in lieu of Merger Sub, in which
event all references herein to Merger Sub shall be deemed references to such
other Subsidiary, except that all representations and warranties made herein
with respect to Merger Sub as of the date of this Agreement shall be deemed
representations and warranties made with respect to such other Subsidiary as
of the date of such designation; _provided_ that any such designation shall
not impede or delay the consummation of the Merger or otherwise materially
impede the rights of the stockholders of the Company under this Agreement. Any
purported assignment in violation of this Agreement is void.

 



-59- IN WITNESS WHEREOF, this Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the
duly authorized officers of the parties hereto as of the date first written
above.
