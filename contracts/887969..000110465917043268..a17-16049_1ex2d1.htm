 ** _THE OFFER_**

 



 

 **Section 1.1** **_The Offer_**.

 



 

(a) As promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement (but in no
event more than ten (10) Business Days thereafter (subject to the Company
having timely complied with its obligations pursuant to this _Article I_)),
Merger Sub shall (and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to) commence (within the
meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended,
and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the " _Exchange Act_ "))
the Offer.

 



 

(b) The obligation of Merger Sub to (and of Parent to cause Merger Sub to)
accept for payment and pay for any shares of Company Common Stock validly
tendered and not validly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer shall be subject to:
(i) there being validly tendered in the Offer and not validly withdrawn
immediately prior to any then scheduled Expiration Time that number of shares
of Company Common Stock which, together with the shares beneficially owned by
Parent or Merger Sub (if any), represents at least a majority of the Company
Common Stock then outstanding (determined on a fully diluted basis (which
assumes conversion or exercise of all options and other convertible or
derivative securities regardless of the conversion or exercise price, the
vesting schedule or other terms and conditions thereof), and excluding shares
of Company Common Stock tendered pursuant to guaranteed delivery procedures
that have not yet been "received," as such term is defined in Section 251(h)
of the DGCL, by the depositary for the Offer pursuant to such procedures) (the
" _Minimum Condition_ "); and (ii) the satisfaction, or waiver by Parent or
Merger Sub, of the other conditions and requirements set forth in _Exhibit A_
(together with the Minimum Condition, the " _Offer Conditions_ ").

 



      
 

 



 

(c) The Offer shall be made by means of an offer to purchase (the " _Offer to
Purchase_ ") that describes the terms and conditions of the Offer as set forth
in this Agreement, including the Offer Conditions. The Offer Conditions are
for the sole benefit of Parent and Merger Sub, and Parent and Merger Sub
expressly reserve the right to waive, in whole or in part, any Offer Condition
in their sole and absolute discretion at any time and from time to time,
including to increase the Offer Price and to make any other changes in the
terms and conditions of the Offer; _provided_ , _however_ , that unless
otherwise provided by this Agreement or as previously approved in writing by
the Company, Merger Sub shall not (i) reduce the number of shares of Company
Common Stock subject to the Offer, (ii) reduce the Offer Price, (iii) change,
modify or waive the Minimum Condition, (iv) add to the conditions set forth in
_Exhibit A_ or modify or change any Offer Condition in a manner adverse in
any material respect to any stockholders of the Company, (v) except as
otherwise provided in this _Section 1.1_, extend or otherwise change the
expiration date of the Offer, (vi) change the form of consideration payable in
the Offer or (vii) otherwise amend, modify or supplement any of the terms of
the Offer in a manner adverse in any material respect to any stockholders of
the Company.

 



 

(d) The Offer shall expire at midnight (New York time) at the end of the date
that is twenty (20) Business Days (determined in accordance with Rule
14d-1(g)(3) under the Exchange Act) following the commencement (within the
meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) of the Offer (the " _Initial
Expiration Time_ ") or, in the event the Initial Expiration Time has been
extended pursuant to this Agreement, the date and time to which the Offer has
been so extended (the Initial Expiration Time, or such later date and time to
which the Initial Expiration Time has been extended pursuant to this
Agreement, is referred to as the " _Expiration Time_ ").

 



 

(e) Merger Sub (i) shall extend the Offer for any period required by
applicable Law, any interpretation or position of the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the " _SEC_ "), the staff thereof or the NASDAQ Stock Market ("
_NASDAQ_ ") applicable to the Offer and (ii) shall (subject to Parents right
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Article VIII_), in the event that
the Offer Conditions are not satisfied or waived (if permitted hereunder) as
of any Expiration Time, extend the Offer for successive extension periods of
at least two (2) but not more than ten (10) Business Days per extension (or
any longer period as may be approved in advance by the Company, but otherwise
with the length of any such extension to be determined by Parent in its sole
and absolute discretion) in order to allow additional time for the Offer
Conditions to be satisfied; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall
Merger Sub be required to extend the Offer (A) beyond the first Business Day
immediately prior to the January 2, 2018 (the " _End Date_ "), (B) at any time
that Parent or Merger Sub is permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Article VIII_, (C) following the valid termination of this Agreement
pursuant to _Article VIII_ or (D) beyond the fortieth (40th) Business Day
following the Initial Expiration Time if, as of such time, each of the Offer
Conditions set forth on _Exhibit A_ is satisfied or has been waived but the
Minimum Condition is not satisfied at such time.

 



 

(f) On the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, and subject
to the prior satisfaction of the Minimum Condition and the satisfaction, or
waiver by Parent or Merger Sub, of the other Offer Conditions, Merger Sub
shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, accept and pay for (subject to
any withholding of tax pursuant to _Section 3.6_) all shares of Company
Common Stock validly tendered and not validly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer
as

 



      
 

 



 

soon as practicable after the Expiration Time (as it may be extended and re-
extended in accordance with this _Section 1.1_), _provided_ , _however_ ,
that without the prior written consent of the Company, Merger Sub shall not
accept for payment or pay for any shares of Company Common Stock if, as a
result, Merger Sub would acquire less than the number of shares of Company
Common Stock necessary to satisfy the Minimum Condition. Closing of the Offer
and acceptance for payment of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to and
subject to the Offer Conditions upon the Expiration Time is referred to in
this Agreement as the " _Offer Closing_ ", and the date on which the Offer
Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the " _Offer Closing Date_
". Nothing contained in this _Section 1.1_ shall affect any termination
rights in _Article VIII_.

 



 

(g) Merger Sub shall not terminate the Offer prior to any scheduled Expiration
Time without the prior written consent of the Company, except in the event
that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Article VIII_. If the Offer is
terminated or withdrawn by Merger Sub, or this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to _Article VIII_, prior to the acceptance for payment of the
Company Common Stock tendered in the Offer, Merger Sub shall promptly return,
and shall cause any depository acting on behalf of Merger Sub to return, all
tendered Company Common Stock to the registered holders thereof.

 



 

(h) On the date of the commencement of the Offer, Parent and Merger Sub shall
file with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with respect to the
Offer (together with all amendments, supplements and exhibits thereto, the "
_Schedule TO_ "). The Schedule TO shall include, as exhibits, the Offer to
Purchase and a form of letter of transmittal and summary advertisement (such
Schedule TO and the documents included therein pursuant to which the Offer
will be made, together with any amendments and supplements thereto, the "
_Offer Documents_ "). The Company shall promptly furnish to Parent and Merger
Sub all information concerning the Company required by the Exchange Act or
other applicable Law to be set forth in the Offer Documents or as may be
reasonably requested by Parent or Merger Sub for inclusion in the Offer
Documents. Parent and Merger Sub agree to take all steps necessary to cause
the Offer Documents to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to the
stockholders of the Company, in each case as and to the extent required by the
Exchange Act. Parent and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the
other hand, agree to promptly correct any information provided by it for use
in the Offer Documents if and to the extent that such information shall have
become false or misleading in any material respect or as otherwise required by
applicable Law. Parent and Merger Sub further agree to take all steps
necessary to cause the Offer Documents, as so corrected (if applicable), to be
filed with the SEC and disseminated to the stockholders of the Company, in
each case as and to the extent required by the Exchange Act. Parent and Merger
Sub shall promptly notify the Company upon the receipt of any comments from
the SEC, or any request from the SEC for amendments or supplements, to the
Offer Documents, and shall promptly provide the Company with copies of all
correspondence between them and their representatives, on the one hand, and
the SEC, on the other hand. Prior to the filing of the Offer Documents
(including any amendments or supplements thereto) with the SEC or
dissemination thereof to the stockholders of the Company, or responding to any
comments of the SEC with respect to the Offer Documents, Parent and Merger Sub
shall provide the Company and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review
and comment on such Offer Documents or response, and Parent and Merger Sub
shall give reasonable consideration to any such comments.

 



      
 

 



 

(i) Parent shall provide or cause to be provided to Merger Sub, on a timely
basis, the funds necessary to pay for any shares of Company Common Stock that
Merger Sub becomes obligated to accept for payment, and pay for, pursuant to
the Offer.

SEC and disseminated to the stockholders of the Company, in each case
concurrently with the filing and dissemination of the Offer Documents and in
accordance with the Exchange Act. Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly furnish
to the Company all information concerning Parent and Merger Sub required by
the Exchange Act to be set forth in the Schedule 14D-9. The Company, on the
one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, agree to promptly
correct any information provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to
the extent that such information shall have become false or misleading in any
material respect or as otherwise required by applicable Law. The Company
further agrees to take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9, as so
corrected (if applicable), to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to the
stockholders of the Company, in each case as promptly as practicable and to

effects set forth herein and in the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, and subject thereto, from and after the Effective Time, all the
properties, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and
Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities
and

 



       
 

 



 

duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and
duties of the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

 **Section 2.5** **_Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws of the Surviving
Corporation_**. At the Effective Time, (a) the certificate of incorporation of
the Company shall be amended so as to read in its entirety as set forth in

the adoption of any necessary resolutions by the Board of Directors) as may be
necessary to effect as of the Effective Time the actions set forth in _Section

 **ARTICLE III**

 



 

 ** _EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK_**

 



 

 **Section 3.1** **_Effect on Capital Stock_**. At the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any
shares of Company Common Stock, any other securities of the Company or any
shares of capital stock or other securities of Merger Sub or, except as
expressly set forth herein, on the part of the Company or Merger Sub:

 



 

(a) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each issued and outstanding share of
capital stock of Merger Sub shall be converted into and become one validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01
per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock_. Any shares of
Company Common Stock that are owned by the Company as treasury stock
immediately prior to the Effective Time, and any shares of Company Common
Stock owned by Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be automatically cancelled and
shall cease to exist and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange
therefor.

 



 

(c) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Each issued and outstanding share of
Company Common Stock (other than shares to be cancelled in accordance with
_Section 3.1(b)_ and Dissenting Shares) shall be converted automatically
into, and shall thereafter represent the right to receive, subject to _Section
3.4_, an amount in cash equal to the Offer Price without interest
(collectively, the " _Merger Consideration_ ").

 



 

(d) _Cancellation of Shares_. As of the Effective Time, all shares of Company
Common Stock converted into the Merger Consideration pursuant to this _Section
3.1_ shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and
shall cease to exist; and the holders immediately prior to the Effective Time
of non-certificated shares of Company Common Stock represented by book-entry
(" _Book-Entry Shares_ "), and the holders of certificates which immediately
prior to the Effective Time represented shares of Company Common Stock (each,
a " _Certificate_ "), shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto,
except the right to receive the Merger Consideration to be paid in
consideration therefor upon surrender of such Book-Entry Share or Certificate
in accordance with _Section 3.2_, without interest and subject to any
applicable withholding Taxes.

 



 

 **Section 3.2** **_Surrender and Payment_**.

 



 

(a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a
bank or trust company, reasonably acceptable to the Company (the " _Exchange
Agent_ ") for the purpose of exchanging shares of Company Common Stock for the
Merger Consideration and enter into an agreement reasonably acceptable to the
Company with the Exchange Agent relating to the services to be performed by
the Exchange Agent. Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, the
aggregate Merger Consideration required to be paid at Closing with the
Exchange Agent prior to or promptly following the Effective Time. The Merger
Consideration so deposited with the Exchange Agent shall, pending its
disbursement to the holders, immediately prior to the Effective Time, of
Company Common Stock, be invested by the Exchange Agent as directed by Parent;
provided, however, that no such investment income or gain or loss thereon
shall affect the amounts payable to holders of shares of Company Common Stock.
Any interest and other income from such investments shall become part of the
funds held by the Exchange Agent for purposes of paying the Merger
Consideration, subject to _Section 3.2(e)_. No investment by the Exchange
Agent of the Merger Consideration shall relieve Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or the Exchange Agent from making the payments required by this
_Article III_ and Parent shall promptly replace any funds deposited with the
Exchange Agent lost through any investment made pursuant to this _Section
3.2(a)_. No investment by the Exchange Agent of the Merger Consideration shall
have maturities that could reasonably be expected to prevent or materially
delay payments to be made pursuant to this Agreement. Following the Effective
Time, Parent agrees to reasonably promptly make available to the Exchange
Agent,

 



      
 

 



 

from time to time as needed, any additional cash to pay the Merger
Consideration, to the extent required by this _Article III_. The Surviving
Corporation shall pay all charges and expenses of the Exchange Agent in
connection with the exchange of Company Common Stock for the Merger
Consideration.

 



 

(b) _Payment Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time (but in no event
more than five (5) Business Days thereafter), the Surviving Corporation shall
cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of Company Common
Stock (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the shares of Company Common Stock
shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates representing such
shares of Company Common Stock or transfer of the Book-Entry Shares to the
Exchange Agent, upon adherence to the procedures set forth in the letter of
transmittal, and shall be in such form and have such other customary
provisions as Parent and the Company may reasonably agree and shall be
prepared prior to Closing) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for payment of
the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof. Upon surrender of
Certificates for cancellation to the Exchange Agent or, in the case of Book-
Entry Shares, receipt of a satisfactory "agents message" in customary form by
the Exchange Agent or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Exchange
Agent may reasonably request (it being understood that the holders of Book-
Entry Shares shall be deemed to have surrendered such Company Common Stock
upon receipt by the Exchange Agent of an "agents message" or such other
evidence, if any, as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request), together with
such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance
with the instructions (and such other customary documents as may reasonably be
required by the Exchange Agent), the holder of such Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, subject to any
required withholding Taxes, the Merger Consideration payable in respect
thereof, without interest, for each share of Company Common Stock surrendered,
and any Certificates surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. If payment of
such Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in
whose name the surrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Share is registered, it
shall be a condition of payment that (A) the Person requesting such exchange
present proper evidence of transfer or shall otherwise be in proper form for
transfer and (B) the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any
transfer and other Taxes required by reason of the payment of such Merger
Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate
or Book-Entry Share surrendered or shall have established to the reasonable
satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Tax either has been paid
or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section
3.2_, each Certificate and Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after
the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration payable in respect thereof as contemplated by this _Article
III_, without interest and subject to any applicable withholding Taxes.

 



 

(c) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. The
applicable Merger Consideration paid in respect of shares of Company Common
Stock upon the surrender for exchange in accordance with the terms of this
_Article III_ shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock and, at the Effective
Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter
there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer
books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock that
were outstanding

 



      
 

 



 

immediately prior to the Effective Time. From and after the Effective Time,
the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares that evidenced ownership of
shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares of Company
Common Stock other than the right to receive the Merger Consideration payable
in respect thereof, except as otherwise provided for herein or by applicable
Law. Subject to _Section 3.2(e)_, if, after the Effective Time, Certificates
are validly presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall
be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this _Article III_.

 



 

(d) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit, in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Exchange Agent, of that fact
by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and,
if required by the Exchange Agent or Parent, the posting by such Person of a
bond and/or the providing by such Person of an indemnity, in such reasonable
and customary amount as Parent or the Exchange Agent may direct, as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Exchange Agent will pay (less any applicable withholding
Taxes and without interest thereon), in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the
shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate, as
contemplated by this _Article III_.

 



 

(e) _Termination of Fund_. At any time immediately following the first (1st)
anniversary of the Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled
to require the Exchange Agent to, upon demand, deliver to it any funds or
other property (including all interest received and the other proceeds of any
investments with respect thereto) that had been made available to the Exchange
Agent and which have not been disbursed in accordance with this _Article
III_, and thereafter Persons entitled to receive payment pursuant to this
_Article III_ shall be entitled to look only to the Surviving Corporation
(subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) as general
creditors thereof with respect to the payment of any Merger Consideration that
may be payable upon surrender of any Company Common Stock held by such
holders, as determined pursuant to this Agreement, in each case without any
interest thereon and subject to any applicable withholding Taxes, upon due
surrender of their Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, in each case, subject to
applicable abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws. Any amounts
remaining unclaimed by such holders at such time at which such amounts would
otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority shall
become, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the property of the
Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto. Any portion of the Merger Consideration made
available to the Exchange Agent pursuant to _Section 3.5_ in respect of any
Dissenting Shares shall be returned to Parent, upon demand.

 



 

(f) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, none of Parent, the Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, the
Company or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person for any portion of
the Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

 



      
 

 



 

 **Section 3.3** **_Treatment of Equity Awards_**.

 



 

(a) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, any then outstanding option to
acquire shares of Company Common Stock granted under a Company Stock Plan (an
" _Option_ ") whether or not then otherwise vested or exercisable, shall be
cancelled in exchange for the right of the holder of such Option (the "
_Optionholder_ ") to receive from the Surviving Corporation a cash amount
equal to the product of (i) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock
then still covered by the Option _multiplied by_ (ii) the excess, if any, of
(A) the Merger Consideration _over_ (B) the exercise price per share of
Company Common Stock under such Option, without any interest thereon and
subject to all applicable withholding; _provided_ that if the exercise price
per share under any such Option is equal to or greater than the Merger
Consideration, such Option shall be canceled immediately prior to the
Effective Time without any payment or other consideration being made or owed
in respect thereof.

 



 

(b) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each then outstanding share of
restricted stock issued pursuant to a Company Stock Plan (" _Company
Restricted Stock Award_ ") shall become fully vested and shall participate in
the Merger on the same basis as any other outstanding share of Company Common
Stock.

 



 

(c) At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall provide, or shall cause to
be provided, to the Company or the Surviving Corporation all funds necessary
to fulfill the payment obligations under this _Section 3.3_. All payments
required under this _Section 3.3_ shall be made as promptly as practicable
following the Closing Date and shall be processed through the Companys
payroll.

 



 

(d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the Company Board and the
compensation committee of such board, as applicable, shall adopt such
resolutions and take such other actions as are necessary to effectuate the
provisions of clauses (a) and (b) of this _Section 3.3_ and to validly
terminate, as of the Effective Time, all Company Stock Plans.

 



 

 **Section 3.4** **_Adjustments_**. If at any time during the period between
the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company shall occur as a result of
any reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split) or
combination, exchange or readjustment of shares or any stock dividend or stock
distribution with a record date during such period, or any similar transaction
or any transaction having the effect of any of the foregoing, in each case, in
accordance with the prior written consent of Parent, the Merger Consideration
and any other similarly dependent items shall be equitably adjusted to provide
Parent and the holders of Company Common Stock the same economic effect as
contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that nothing in this _Section 3.4_ shall be deemed to permit or authorize any
party hereto to effect any such change that it is not otherwise authorized or
permitted to undertake pursuant to this Agreement.

 



 

 **Section 3.5** **_Appraisal Rights_**. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time which are held by a
stockholder who (a) is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of
such shares pursuant to and (b) complies in all respects with, the provisions

 



      
 

 



 

of Section 262 of the DGCL (the " _Dissenting Stockholders_ ") shall not be
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration payable in
respect of such shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Dissenting Shares_ "),
but instead such Dissenting Stockholder shall be entitled to receive such
consideration as may be determined to be due to such Dissenting Stockholder
pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL (and at the Effective Time, such
Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
cancelled and shall cease to exist, and such Dissenting Stockholder shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the rights set forth in
Section 262 of the DGCL), unless and until such Dissenting Stockholder shall
have failed to perfect or shall have effectively waived, withdrawn or lost
rights to appraisal under the DGCL. If any Dissenting Stockholder shall have
failed to perfect or shall have effectively waived, withdrawn or lost such
rights to appraisal, or if appraisal rights are unavailable to the Companys
stockholders pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL in connection with the
Transactions, such Dissenting Stockholders shares of Company Common Stock
shall thereupon be treated as if they had been converted into the right to
receive, as of the Effective Time, the Merger Consideration payable in respect
of each such share of Company Common Stock, in accordance with _Section 3.1_,
without any interest thereon and less any applicable withholding Taxes, upon
surrender of such Certificate formerly representing such shares or transfer of
such Book-Entry Shares, as the case may be. The Company shall give Parent (i)
prompt notice of any written demands for appraisal of any shares of Company
Common Stock, attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments
served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company relating to
stockholders rights of appraisal and (ii) the opportunity to participate in
and direct, in each case at its own expense, all negotiations and proceedings
with respect to demands for appraisal under the DGCL. Except with the prior
written consent of Parent, prior to the Effective Time the Company shall not
make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such
demands or agree to do any of the foregoing.

 



 

 **Section 3.6** **_Withholding Taxes_**. Parent, the Surviving Corporation
and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
amounts payable pursuant to the Offer, the Merger or otherwise pursuant to
this Agreement (including, without limitation, payments under _Section 3.3_
with respect to outstanding equity compensation awards) such amounts as may be
required to be withheld from such payments under the Internal Revenue Code of
1986 (the " _Code_ "), or under any applicable provision of state, local or
foreign Law related to Taxes. To the extent amounts are so withheld and paid
over to the appropriate Governmental Authority, the withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person
in respect of whom such deduction and withholding was made.

 



 

 **ARTICLE IV**

 



 

 ** _REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY_**

 



 

The Company represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub that, except as
disclosed in the letter delivered by the Company to Parent simultaneously with
the execution of this Agreement (the " _Company Disclosure Letter_ "), which

subsection of this Agreement, or as set forth in (or incorporated by reference
in) any of the Company SEC Documents filed with the SEC since January 1, 2016

modification to the representations and

 



      
 

 



 

warranties set forth in _Sections 4.1_ , _4.2_ , _4.3_ , _4.4_ , _4.21_ and
_4.22_ and (ii) in no event shall any risk factor disclosure under the heading
"Risk Factors" or disclosure set forth in any "forward looking statements"

qualified to do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which
the nature of the business conducted by it or the character or location of the

aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(b) _Section 4.1(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter lists each Subsidiary
of the Company as of the date hereof and its place of organization. Each of

where the failure to be so qualified or in good standing would not reasonably
have, or be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect. All the outstanding shares of capital stock of, or
other equity interests in, each such Subsidiary of the Company are owned
directly or indirectly by the Company (collectively, the " _Company Subsidiary
Securities_ ") free and clear of all Liens and transfer restrictions, other
than transfer restrictions in their organizational documents and such transfer
restrictions of general applicability as may be provided under the Securities

outstanding obligations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any of the Company Subsidiary
Securities. There are no outstanding bonds, debentures, notes or other

interest in the Company.

 **Section 4.2** **_Capitalization_**. The authorized capital stock of the
Company consists of 17,000,000 shares, of which 16,000,000 shares are
designated Company Common Stock and 1,000,000 shares are designated preferred

being referred to collectively as " _Company Securities_ ") and (v) no other
obligations by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to make any payments
based on the price or value of the Company Securities. Since the
Capitalization Date, the Company has not issued any Company Securities other
than shares of Company Common Stock upon the exercise of Options or in
settlement of other equity-based compensation awards. There are no outstanding
Contracts of any kind which obligate the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to

 **Section 4.3** **_Authority; Noncontravention_**.

 



 

(a) The Company has all necessary corporate power and authority to execute and
deliver this Agreement and to consummate the Transactions. No vote of the
holders of outstanding shares of Company Common Stock is required to approve
and adopt this Agreement or the Merger. The execution and delivery of and
performance by the Company under this Agreement, and the consummation of the
Transactions, have been duly authorized and unanimously approved by the
Company Board and no other corporate action on the part of the Company is
necessary to authorize the execution and delivery of and performance by the
Company under this Agreement and the consummation by it of the Transactions.
This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company and,
assuming due authorization, execution and delivery hereof by the other parties
hereto, constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company,
enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, except that such
enforceability (i) may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent
transfer, reorganization, moratorium and other similar Laws of general
application affecting or relating to the enforcement of creditors rights
generally and (ii) is subject to general principles of equity, whether
considered in a proceeding at law or in equity (the " _Bankruptcy and Equity
Exception_ ").

 



 

(b) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company, nor
the consummation by the Company of the Transactions, nor compliance by the
Company with any of the terms or provisions hereof, will (i) conflict with or
violate any provision of the Company Charter Documents, (ii) assuming that
each of the consents, authorizations, waiting periods or terminations, and
approvals referred to in _Section 4.4_ are obtained if required by applicable
Laws (and any condition precedent to any such consent, authorization, waiting
period or termination, or approval has been satisfied) and each of the filings
referred to in _Section 4.4_ are made and any applicable waiting periods
referred to therein have expired, violate any Law or Order applicable to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (iii) result in any breach of, or
constitute a default (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) under,
or give rise to any right of termination, amendment, acceleration or
cancellation of, any Contract to which the Company or any Subsidiary is a
party, or result in the creation of a Lien, other than any Permitted Lien,
upon any of the properties or assets of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries,

 



      
 

 



 

other than, in the case of clauses _(ii)_ and _(iii)_ , as would not
reasonably be expected to be, individually or in the aggregate, material to
the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

 



 

(c) The Company Board, by resolutions duly adopted by unanimous vote at a
meeting of all directors of the Company duly called and held and, as of the
date hereof, not subsequently rescinded or modified in any way, has, (i)
determined that this Agreement and the Transactions are fair to, and in the
best interests of, the Companys stockholders, (ii) approved and declared
advisable this Agreement and the Transactions in accordance with the DGCL,
(iii) resolved to recommend that Company stockholders accept the Offer and
tender their shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer
(collectively, the " _Company Board Recommendation_ "), (iv) assuming the
accuracy of the representations and warranties set forth in Sections 5.10 and
5.11, taken all actions necessary so that the restrictions on business
combinations and stockholder vote requirements contained in Section 203 of the
DGCL will not apply with respect to or as a result of the Offer, the Merger,
this Agreement, the Support Agreements and the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby and (v) properly elected that this Agreement and the
Transactions be expressly governed by Section 251(h) of the DGCL. No
provision of the Companys certificate of incorporation or bylaws (A) requires
a vote of the stockholders of the Company to approve the Offer, this Agreement
or the consummation of the Merger pursuant to Section 251(h) of the DGCL and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (B) prohibits the
Company and Parent from completing the Merger pursuant to Section 251(h) of
the DGCL. Absent Section 251(h) of the DGCL, the affirmative vote of the
holders of a majority of the voting power of the shares of Company Common
Stock outstanding would be the only vote of the holders of Company Common
Stock necessary to adopt this Agreement and approve the other Transactions
under the DGCL, the Companys certificate of incorporation and bylaws, and the
affirmative vote of the holders of a number of shares of Company Common Stock
equal to the number of shares required to be tendered in the aggregate to
satisfy the Minimum Condition would satisfy such requirement. Immediately
prior to the Companys execution of this Agreement, the shares of Company
Common Stock are listed on a national securities exchange or are held of
record by more than 2,000 holders.

 



 

 **Section 4.4** **_Governmental Approvals_**. No consents or approvals of,

for (a) the filing with the SEC in accordance with the Exchange Act of (i) the
Schedule 14D-9 and (ii) such other filings as may be required in connection
with this Agreement and the Transactions under the applicable requirements of

Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware pursuant to the
DGCL and (c) such other consents, approvals, filings, declarations or
registrations the failure of which to obtain or make would not be, or
reasonably be expected to be, individually or in the aggregate, material to
the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

 



 

 **Section 4.5** **_Company SEC Documents; Undisclosed Liabilities_**.

 



 

(a) The Company has filed with or furnished to the SEC, on a timely basis, all

and schedules thereto and documents

 



       
 

 



 

incorporated by reference therein, as such reports and proxy statements may
have been amended since the date of their filing, the " _Company SEC

amendments, as of the most recent such amendment, the Company SEC Documents
complied in all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act
and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the " _Sarbanes-Oxley Act_ "), as the case
may be, and the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder, applicable to
such Company SEC Documents, and none of the Company SEC Documents as of such
respective dates (or, if amended, the date of the filing of such amendment,
with respect to the disclosures that are amended) contained any untrue
statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries has received from the SEC any written comments or
questions with respect to any of the Company SEC Documents or any written
notice from the SEC that such Company SEC Documents are being reviewed or
investigated.

subsequent Company SEC Document, as of their respective dates of filing with
the SEC, the consolidated financial statements of the Company included in the

regulations of the SEC with respect thereto (except, in the case of unaudited
statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC), (ii) have been prepared in
accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved

January 1, 2014, subject to any applicable grace periods, the Company has been

disclosure controls and procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that all
material information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports
that it files or furnishes under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and
forms of the SEC, and that all such material information is accumulated and
communicated to the Companys management as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications
required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The
Companys management has completed an assessment of the effectiveness of the
Companys internal control over financial reporting in compliance with the
requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the fiscal year
ended December 31, 2016, and such assessment concluded that such controls were
effective. The Company has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation of

 



      
 

 



 

such disclosure controls and procedures prior to the date of this Agreement,
to the Companys auditors and the audit committee of the Company Board (i) any
significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of
internal controls over financial reporting that could adversely affect in any
material respect the Companys ability to record, process, summarize and
report financial information, and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material,
that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the
Companys internal controls over financial reporting. The Company has made
available to Parent all such disclosures made by management to the Companys

6.1(a)_.

(d) Each Company Plan that is a "nonqualified deferred compensation plan" (as
defined for purposes of Section 409A of the Code) complies in all material
respects with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code and applicable IRS
guidance promulgated thereunder. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has any obligation to provide any indemnity or gross-up payment
to any individual with respect to any income Tax, additional Tax, excise Tax
or interest charge imposed pursuant to Section 409A or 4999 of the Code.

 



 

(e) Except as otherwise contemplated by this Agreement or as set forth in
_Section 4.10(e)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, neither the execution of
this Agreement nor the consummation of the Transactions will, either alone or

under any Company Plan), (ii) accelerate the time of payment, funding or
vesting of any payment, distribution, benefits or equity award to or under any
Company Plan, (iii) increase the amount of any compensation or benefit payable

to administer, amend or terminate any Company Plan, or (v) entitle any

 



      
 

 



 

employee, director or other service provider to any payment from the Company
or a Subsidiary that would be nondeductible by reason of Section 280G of the
Code.

 



 

Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, this _Section 4.10_,
together with _Section 4.16_, constitutes the sole and exclusive
representation and warranty of the Company relating to any Company Plans and
any other employee fringe or employee benefit liabilities or obligations,

comprising any Permitted Liens and Permitted Encumbrances with respect to any
Leased Real Property, and (b) the Permitted Liens and Permitted Encumbrances

Offer Price and Merger Consideration, (b) any repayment or refinancing of
Indebtedness contemplated in this Agreement, (c) the accuracy in all material
respects of the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in

the purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Solvent_ " when used with respect
to any Person, means that, as of any date of determination (A) the amount of
the "fair saleable value" of the assets of such Person will, as of such date,
exceed (i) the value of all "liabilities of such Person, including contingent
and other liabilities," as of such date, as such quoted terms are generally

of capital" for the operation of the businesses in which it is engaged or
proposed to be engaged following such date, and (C) such Person will be able

mature. For purposes of the foregoing, "not have an unreasonably small amount
of capital for the operation of the businesses in which it is engaged or
proposed to be engaged" and "able to pay its liabilities, including contingent
and other liabilities, as they mature" means that such Person will be able to
generate enough cash from

meet its obligations as they become due.

 



 

 **Section 5.10** **_Share Ownership_**. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub has

each case, except pursuant to this Agreement.

Agreements, there are no agreements, arrangements or understandings (whether
oral or written), or commitments to enter into agreements, arrangements or
understandings (whether oral or written), (a) between Parent, Merger Sub, or
any of their respective Affiliates, on the one hand, and any member of the
Companys management or directors, on the other hand, as of the date hereof
that relate in any way to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the
Transactions (including as to continuing employment) or (b) pursuant to which
any stockholder of the Company would be entitled to receive consideration of a
different amount or nature than the Offer Price or Merger Consideration or
pursuant to which any stockholder of the Company agrees to vote to approve
this Agreement or the Merger or agrees to vote against any Superior Proposal.

(a) Neither Parent nor Merger Sub is relying, and neither Parent nor Merger
Sub has relied on, any representations or warranties whatsoever regarding the
subject matter of this Agreement, express or implied, except for the

in the case of fraud, Parent and Merger Sub will have no claim against any of
the Company and its Subsidiaries, or any of their respective Representatives,
Affiliates or stockholders, or any other Person with respect thereto.
Accordingly, Parent and Merger Sub hereby acknowledge and agree that, except
for the

 



      
 

 



 

representations and warranties contained in _Article IV_, none of the Company

or stockholders, nor any other Person, has made or is making any express or
implied representation or warranty with respect to such estimates,
projections, forecasts, forward-looking statements or business plans.

change in the price or any material terms or scope thereof) and (ii) at least
three (3) Business Days prior to taking any of the actions described in the
preceding sentence and at least three (3) Business Days prior to the convening
of any meeting of the Company Board (or any committee thereof) to consider any
Takeover Proposal or taking any such action. The Company shall promptly
provide to Parent any non-public information concerning the Company or its
Subsidiaries that is provided to such Person (to the extent such information
was not previously provided to Parent or its Representatives).

 



 

(c) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, the Company and the
Company Board shall not (i) (A) fail to make, withdraw, amend or modify, or
publicly propose to withhold, withdraw, amend or modify, in a manner adverse
to Parent or Merger Sub, the Company Board Recommendation, (B) approve,
endorse, adopt or recommend, or publicly propose to approve, endorse, adopt or
recommend, to the stockholders of the Company a Takeover Proposal or Superior
Proposal, (C) fail to include the Company Board Recommendation in the Schedule
14D-9 or any amendment thereof when disseminated to the Companys
stockholders, (D) fail to reject and recommend against any Takeover Proposal
or any tender offer or exchange offer for Company Common Stock (including, for
these purposes, by taking no position with respect to the acceptance by the
stockholders of the Company of a tender offer or exchange offer, which shall
constitute a failure to reject such Takeover Proposal) within ten (10)
Business Days after the making public thereof, or failing to publicly
reconfirm the Company Board Recommendation within two (2) Business Days after
any request from Parent to do so, (E) make any public statement inconsistent
with the Board Recommendation or (F) resolve or agree to take any of the
foregoing actions (any of the foregoing actions being referred to as a "
_Company Adverse Recommendation Change_ "), (ii) authorize the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries to enter into any letter of intent, merger, acquisition or
similar agreement with respect to any Takeover Proposal (other than an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement) or (iii) resolve or agree to change or
modify the election that this Agreement and the Merger be governed pursuant to
Section 251(h) of the DGCL.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 6.3_, the
Company Board (or a duly authorized committee thereof) may make a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change in response to either (x) a Superior Proposal or
(y) an Intervening

 



      
 

 



 

Event (and, solely with respect to a Superior Proposal, terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)(ii)_), if:

 



 

(i) the Company Board (or a duly authorized committee thereof) determines in
good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the
failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
under applicable Law (after taking into account all adjustments to the terms
of this Agreement that may be offered by Parent pursuant to this _Section
6.3(d)_); and

 



 

(ii) solely with respect to a Superior Proposal: (A) the Company provides
Parent prior written notice of its intent to make any Company Adverse
Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section
8.1(d)(ii)_, together with a copy of the acquisition agreement (and any other
relevant transaction documents) with respect to such Superior Proposal, if
any, at least five (5) Business Days prior to taking such action, to the
effect that the Company Board has received a Superior Proposal and, absent any
revision to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Company Board has
resolved to effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)(ii)_, which notice shall include
the identity of the Person making such inquiry, proposal or request and
specify in reasonable detail the basis for such Company Adverse Recommendation
Change or termination, including the material terms and conditions of the
Superior Proposal (a " _Notice of Superior Proposal_ ") (it being understood
that such Notice of Superior Proposal shall not in itself be deemed a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change and that any material revision or amendment to
the terms of such Superior Proposal shall require a new written notice and, in
such case, a new five (5) Business Day notice period), (B) during such five
(5) Business Day period, if requested by Parent, the Company shall have made
its Representatives reasonably available to discuss with Parents
Representatives, and shall have negotiated in good faith with Parent and its
Representatives (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate), any proposed
modifications to the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such
Takeover Proposal would cease to constitute a Superior Proposal, (C) Parent
has not, within such five (5) Business Day period, made a written, binding and
irrevocable offer capable of being accepted by the Company to alter the terms
or conditions of this Agreement such that such Takeover Proposal, after
consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel and outside financial
advisors (and taking into account any adjustment or modification of the terms
of this Agreement proposed in writing by Parent), would cease to constitute a
Superior Proposal and (D) the Company Board, after taking into account any
modifications to the terms of this Agreement and the Transactions agreed to by
Parent and Merger Sub after receipt of such notice, continues to believe that
such Takeover Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal; and

 



 

(iii) solely with respect to any Intervening Event: (A) at least five (5)
Business Days before making a Company Adverse Recommendation Change with
respect to such Intervening Event, the Company notifies Parent in writing of
its intention to do so, specifies the reasons therefor and provides a
reasonably detailed description of such Intervening Event; and (B) if Parent
makes a written, binding and irrevocable offer capable of being accepted by
the Company during such five (5) Business Day period to alter the terms or
conditions of this Agreement, the Company Board, after taking into

 



      
 

 



 

consideration the adjusted terms and conditions of this Agreement as proposed
by Parent, continues to determine in good faith (after consultation with the
Companys outside legal counsel and outside financial advisors (and taking
into account any adjustment or modification of the terms of this Agreement
proposed in writing by Parent)) that the failure to make such Company Adverse
Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law.

 



 

(e) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the
Company Board (or a duly authorized committee thereof) from (i) taking and
disclosing to the stockholders of the Company a position contemplated by Rule
14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act or making a statement contemplated by Item
1012(a) of Regulation M-A or Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act, (ii) making
any disclosure to the stockholders of the Company if the Company Board (or a
duly authorized committee thereof) determines in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to make such
disclosure would be inconsistent with applicable Law, (iii) informing any
Person of the existence of the provisions contained in this _Section 6.3_ or
(iv) making any "stop, look and listen" communication to the stockholders of
the Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act (or any similar
communication to the stockholders of the Company). No disclosures under this
_Section 6.3(e)_ shall be, in themselves, a breach of this _Section 6.3_ or
a basis for Parent to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Article VIII_;
_provided_ , that any such disclosure pursuant to clauses (i) or (ii) above
shall be deemed to be a Company Adverse Recommendation Change unless the
Company Board expressly publicly reaffirms the Company Board Recommendation
(x) in such communication or (y) within two (2) Business Days after requested
to do so by Parent.

 



 

(f) As used in this Agreement, " _Takeover Proposal_ " shall mean any _bona
fide_ inquiry, proposal or offer from any Person (other than Parent, Merger
Sub and any of its Affiliates thereof) or "group" (as such term is defined in
the Exchange Act) to purchase or otherwise acquire, in a single transaction or
series of related transactions, (i) assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries
(including securities of Subsidiaries, but excluding sales of assets in the
ordinary course of business) that account for 20% or more of the Companys
consolidated assets (based on the fair market value thereof) or from which 20%
or more of the Companys revenues or earnings on a consolidated basis are
derived, (ii) 20% or more of the outstanding Company Common Stock pursuant to
a merger, consolidation, amalgamation or other business combination, sale of
shares of capital stock, tender offer, exchange offer, share exchange, share
repurchase reorganization, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution,
extraordinary dividend, or similar transaction involving the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or (iii) any direct or indirect acquisition or transaction,
including any tender offer or exchange offer which, if consummated would
result in the stockholders of the Company immediately preceding such
transaction holding less than 80% of the equity in the Company or the
surviving or resulting entity of such transaction immediately following such
transaction, or any combination of the foregoing.

 



 

(g) As used in this Agreement, " _Superior Proposal_ " shall mean any _bona
fide_ written Takeover Proposal that did not arise from a breach of this
_Section 6.3_, made by a third party, which Takeover Proposal on terms which
the Company Board (or a duly authorized committee thereof) determines in good
faith, after consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel and outside
financial advisors, to be more favorable to the holders of Company Common
Stock (including from a financial point of view) than the Transactions (after
taking into account

 



      
 

 



 

any revisions to this Agreement set forth in any written, binding and
irrevocable offer by Parent capable of being accepted by the Company), taking
into account, to the extent applicable, the legal, financial, regulatory and
other aspects of such proposal and this Agreement that the Company Board
considers relevant including taking into account at the time of such
determination (i) any changes to the terms of this Agreement that as of that
time had been proposed by Parent in writing and (ii) the ability and timing of
the Person making such proposal to consummate the transactions contemplated by
such proposal (based upon, among other things, the availability of financing
and the expectation and timing of obtaining required approvals); _provided_ ,
for purposes of the definition of Superior Proposal, clause (ii) of the
definition of Takeover Proposal shall be disregarded unless any such action
described in such clause (ii) would result in the consequences described in
clause (iii) of the definition of Takeover Proposal; _provided_ that for
purposes of the definition of Superior Proposal, the references to "20% or
more" in the definition of Takeover Proposal shall be deemed to be references
to "50% or more", and references to "less than 80%" shall be deemed to be
references to "50% or less".

 



 

(h) As used in this Agreement, " _Intervening Event_ " shall mean a material
event, development or change in circumstance that was not actually known, or
reasonable foreseeable, to the Company Board prior to the execution of this
Agreement, which material event, development or change in circumstance becomes
known to the Company Board prior to the Offer Closing; _provided_ , that in no
event shall any of the following constitute an Intervening Event: (A) the
receipt, existence or terms of a Takeover Proposal; (B) any matter relating
thereto or consequence thereof or (C) any fact, event, change, development or
set of circumstances that resulted from or arose out of the announcement,
pendency or consummation of the Offer or the Merger.

 



 

 **Section 6.4** **_Reasonable Best Efforts_**.

 



 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the
Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall use its respective reasonable best
efforts to (i) cause the Transactions to be consummated as soon as
practicable, (ii) make promptly any required submissions and filings, if any,
under applicable Antitrust Laws with respect to the Transactions, (iii)
promptly furnish information required in connection with such submissions and
filing, if any, under such Antitrust Laws, (iv) keep the other parties

receipt of any non-action, action, clearance, consent, approval or waiver, (B)
the expiration or termination of any waiting period, (C) the commencement or

confirmations from any Governmental Authority or third party necessary, proper
or advisable to consummate the Transactions as soon as reasonably practicable
(but in any event on or prior to the End Date). For purposes hereof, "
_Antitrust Laws_ " shall mean the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890, as amended,
the Clayton Act of 1914, as amended, the HSR Act, the Federal Trade Commission
Act, as amended, and all other applicable Laws issued by a Governmental
Authority that are designed or intended to prohibit,

 



       
 

 



 

restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or effect of monopolization or
restraint of trade or lessening of competition through merger or acquisition.

 



 

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each party agrees
to (A) supply as soon as reasonably practical any additional information and
documentary material that may be required or requested by any Governmental
Authority and (B) use its reasonable best efforts to take or cause to be taken
all other actions consistent with this _Section 6.4_ as necessary to obtain
any necessary approvals, consents, waivers, permits, authorizations or other
actions or non-actions from each Governmental Authority as soon as
practicable.

 



 

(c) The Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall, (i) reasonably promptly notify
the other parties hereto of, and if in writing, furnish the others with copies
of (or, in the case of oral communications, advise the others of the contents
of) any communication to such Person from a Governmental Authority and permit
the others to review and discuss in advance (and to consider in good faith any
comments made by the others in relation to) any proposed written communication
to a Governmental Authority, (ii) keep the others reasonably informed on a
timely basis of any developments, meetings or discussions with any
Governmental Authority in respect of any filings, investigation or inquiry
concerning the Transactions and (iii) not independently participate in any
meeting or discussions with a Governmental Authority in respect of any
filings, investigation or inquiry concerning the Transactions without giving
the other party prior notice of such meeting or discussions and, unless
prohibited by such Governmental Authority, the opportunity to attend or
participate. However, each of Parent and the Company may designate any non-
public information provided to any Governmental Authority as restricted to
"Outside Antitrust Counsel" only and any such information shall not be shared
with employees, officers or directors or their equivalents of the other party
without approval of the party providing the non-public information.

 



 

(d) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, Parent and Merger
Sub shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to take steps necessary
to avoid, eliminate or resolve each and every impediment and obtain all
clearances, consents, approvals and waivers under Antitrust Laws that may be
required by any Governmental Authority, so as to enable the parties hereto to
close the Transactions as soon as practicable (and in any event no later than
one (1) Business Day prior to the End Date).

 



 

(e) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, in the event that
any litigation or other administrative or judicial action or proceeding is
commenced, threatened or is foreseeable challenging any of the Transactions
and such litigation, action or proceeding seeks, or would reasonably be
expected to seek, to prevent, materially impede or materially delay the
consummation of the Transactions, the parties hereto shall use their
respective reasonable best efforts to avoid or resolve any such litigation,
action or proceeding and each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall
cooperate with each other in good faith and use its respective reasonable best
efforts to contest and resist any such litigation, action or proceeding and to
have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction
or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect
and that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the Transactions as
promptly as practicable and in any event no later than one (1) Business Day
prior to the End Date.

 



      
 

 



 

 **Section 6.5** **_Public Announcements_**. The initial press release with
respect to the execution of this Agreement shall be a joint press release to
be reasonably agreed upon by Parent and the Company. Following such initial
press release, Parent and the Company shall consult with each other before
issuing, and give each other the opportunity to review, comment upon and
approve, any press release or other public statements with respect to the
Transactions and shall not issue any such press release or make any such
public statement prior to such consultation and written approval of the other
parties hereto (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld), except as
such party may reasonably conclude in good faith, after consultation with
outside counsel, that is required by applicable Law, court process or by
obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities
exchange or national securities quotation system (and then only after as much
advance notice and consultation as is feasible); _provided_ , _however_ , that
the right of the other parties hereto to approve any such press release or
public statements as set forth in this _Section 6.5_ shall not apply to any
release or public statement made or proposed to be made by the Company in
connection with a Company Adverse Recommendation Change made in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement (or by Parent in response thereto); and
_provided_ , _further_ , that the foregoing shall not limit the ability of any
party hereto to, without such consultation or consent, make any public
statement regarding the Transactions in response to questions from the press,
analysts, investors or those attending industry conferences, make internal
announcements to employees and make disclosures in Company SEC Reports, so
long as in each case such statements are consistent with, and do not contain
any information not contained in, previous press releases, public disclosures
or public statements made jointly by the parties hereto (or individually, if
approved by the other party) in compliance with the terms hereof.

 



 

 **Section 6.6** **_Access to Information; Confidentiality_**. Subject to
applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information, from the date hereof
until the earlier of the Effective Time or the date on which this Agreement is
terminated in accordance with its terms, the Company shall afford Parent and
its Representatives reasonable access during normal business hours to the
Companys properties, books, Contracts, records, consultants, officers and
employees and the Company shall furnish promptly to Parent such information
concerning its business and properties as Parent may reasonably request;
_provided_ that Parent and its Representatives shall conduct any such
activities in such a manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the business
or operations of the Company; and _provided_ , _further_ , that the Company
shall not be obligated to provide such access or information to Parent if the
Company determines, in its reasonable judgment following consultation with
outside counsel, that doing so would violate applicable Law or would
jeopardize the protection of the attorney-client privilege, or expose the
Company to risk of liability for disclosure of sensitive personal information.
In the event that the Company does not provide access or information in
reliance on the preceding sentence, it shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to communicate the applicable information to Parent in a way that
would not violate the applicable Law, including by providing such information
in redacted form as necessary to comply with such Law or otherwise make
appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements to the extent possible. Until
the Effective Time, the information provided will be subject to the terms of
the Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of August 13, 2016, between Parent (or
one of its Affiliates) and the Company (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "),
and, to the extent provided in the Confidentiality Agreement, Parent shall
not, and Parent shall cause its Representatives not to, use such information
for any purpose unrelated to the consummation of the Transactions.

other communication in writing from any Person alleging that the consent or
approval of such third party is or may be required in connection with the
Transactions; (ii) receipt of any notice or other material communication in
writing from any Governmental Authority or NASDAQ in connection with the
Transactions; or (iii) such party becoming aware of the occurrence or non-
occurrence of an event that would reasonably be expected to materially prevent
or delay the consummation of the Transactions or that would reasonably be
expected to result in any of the conditions to (A) the Offer set forth on
_Exhibit A_ or (B) the Merger set forth in _Article VII_ not being
satisfied; _provided_ , _however_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant
to this _Section 6.7_ shall not limit, expand or otherwise affect any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of the parties hereto or the
remedies available to the party hereunder receiving such notice or the
conditions to such partys obligations to consummate the Transactions, and no
information delivered pursuant to this _Section 6.7_ shall update any section
of the Company Disclosure Letter.

 



 

 **Section 6.8** **_Indemnification and Insurance_**.

 



 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, (i) indemnify, defend and hold harmless each current
and former director, and officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(each, an " _Indemnitee_ " and, collectively, the " _Indemnitees_ ") against
all claims, liabilities, losses, damages, judgments, fines, penalties, costs
(including amounts paid in settlement or compromise) and expenses (including
reasonable and documented fees and expenses of legal counsel) in connection
with any actual or threatened claim, suit, action, proceeding or investigation
(whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative) (each, a " _Claim_
"), whenever asserted, arising out of, relating to or in connection with any
action or omission relating to their position with the Company or its
Subsidiaries occurring or alleged to have occurred before or at the Effective
Time (including any Claim relating in whole or in part to the Agreement or the
Transactions), to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law and (ii)
assume, honor and fulfill in all respects all obligations of the Company and
its Subsidiaries to the Indemnitees in respect of limitation of liability,
exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses as provided in the
Company Charter Documents and the respective organizational documents of each
of the Companys Subsidiaries as currently in effect as of the date hereof.
Without limiting the foregoing, at the Effective Time for a period of not less
than six (6) years immediately following the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall, or Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, cause
the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving Corporation, and
the organizational documents of each Subsidiary of the Surviving Corporation,
to include comparable provisions for limitation of liabilities of directors
and officers, indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of the
Indemnitees no less favorable in the aggregate to the Indemnitees than as set
forth in the Company Charter Documents or such Subsidiarys organizational
documents in effect on the date of this Agreement, which provisions shall not
be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in a manner that would materially
adversely affect the rights thereunder in the aggregate of the Indemnitees
except as required by applicable Law.

 



 

(b) For a period of not less than six (6) years immediately following the
Effective Time, to the extent required by the Company Charter Documents,
applicable

 



      
 

 



 

organizational documents of Subsidiaries of the Company or applicable
indemnification agreements, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, pay and advance to an Indemnitee any expenses (including
reasonable and documented fees and expenses of legal counsel) in connection
with any Claim relating to any acts or omissions covered under this _Section
6.8_ as and when incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable
Law, such payment or advance to be made within thirty (30) days after receipt
by Parent of a written request therefor; _provided_ that the person to whom
expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such expenses (but only
to the extent required by applicable Law, the Company Charter Documents,
applicable organizational documents of Subsidiaries of the Company or
applicable indemnification agreements and which advances and undertaking shall
be unsecured and interest free). Any determination required to be made with
respect to whether an Indemnitees conduct complies with an applicable
standard under applicable Law, the Company Charter Documents, applicable
organizational documents of Subsidiaries of the Company, or applicable
indemnification agreements, as the case may be, shall be made by independent
legal counsel selected by Parent.

 



 

(c) For a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
maintain in effect the coverage provided by the policies of directors and
officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance in effect as
of the date hereof maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect
to matters arising on or before the Effective Time either through the
Companys existing insurance provider or another provider reasonably selected
by Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that, after the Effective Time, Parent
shall not be required to pay annual premiums in excess of 300% of the last
annual premium paid by the Company prior to the date hereof in respect of the
coverages required to be obtained pursuant hereto (which amounts are set
forth, and identified by policy name, policy number and the amount of coverage
and annual premium, on _Section 6.8(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter),
but in such case shall purchase as much coverage as reasonably practicable for
such amount; and _provided_ , _further_ , that in lieu of the foregoing
insurance coverage, the Company may purchase "tail" insurance coverage, at a
cost no greater than the aggregate amount which the Surviving Corporation
would be required to spend during the sixyear period provided for in this
_Section 6.8(c)_, that provides coverage no materially less favorable in the
aggregate than the coverage described above.

 



 

(d) The provisions of this _Section 6.8_ are (i) intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnitee, his or her heirs and
his or her representatives and (ii) in addition to, and not in substitution
for or limitation of, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that
any such Person may have by Contract or otherwise. The obligations of Parent
and the Surviving Corporation under this _Section 6.8_ shall not be
terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect the rights of
any Indemnitee to whom this _Section 6.8_ applies unless (A) such termination
or modification is required by applicable Law or (B) the affected Indemnitee
shall have consented in writing to such termination or modification (it being
expressly agreed that the Indemnitees to whom this _Section 6.8_ applies
shall be third party beneficiaries of this _Section 6.8_).

 



 

(e) In the event that Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers

 



      
 

 



 

or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that
the successors and assigns of Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall
assume all of the obligations thereof set forth in this _Section 6.8_.

 



 

 **Section 6.9** **_Transaction Litigation_**. Each party hereto shall keep
the other parties hereto reasonably informed, in writing on a reasonably
current basis, of, and cooperate with the other parties hereto in connection
with, any litigation or claim (each a " _Transaction Litigation_ ") against
any party hereto and/or its directors, officers or employees relating to the
Transactions; _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing shall not require
any party hereto to take any action if it may result in a waiver of any
attorney/client or any other similar privilege. The Company shall cooperate
with Parent in connection with, and shall give Parent the opportunity to
participate in the defense or settlement of, any such litigation and shall
consult with counsel of the Company regarding the defense or settlement of any
Transaction Litigation, and no settlement in connection with any such
litigation shall be agreed to prior to the Effective Time without Parents
prior written consent.

 



 

 **Section 6.10** **_Section 16_**. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall take all such steps as may be required to cause to be exempt under Rule
16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act any dispositions of shares of Company
Common Stock (including derivative securities with respect to such shares)
that are treated as dispositions under such rule and result from the
Transactions by each director or officer of the Company who is subject to the
reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to
the Company.

 



 

 **Section 6.11** **_Employee Matters_**.

 



 

(a) For a period of at least one (1) year following the Effective Time, Parent
and the Surviving Corporation shall provide, or shall cause to be provided, to
each Company Employee who is an employee of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time and not subject to a
collective bargaining agreement, (A) cash compensation (including base salary,
base wages, commissions, and cash incentive compensation opportunities) that
is at least equal to the cash compensation provided to such Company Employee
as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time; and (B) employee
benefits (excluding equity compensation, defined benefit pension benefits and
any change of control or transaction related payments or benefits) that, in
each case, are substantially no less favorable in the aggregate than what is
provided or made available to, or otherwise in effect with respect to, such
Company Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time. In addition, (i)
Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall provide or shall cause to be
provided to each Company Employee whose employment terminates during the one
(1) year period following the Effective Time with severance benefits at levels
and on terms substantially no less favorable than such Company Employee would
have been entitled to receive pursuant to the terms of the Companys severance
policies as set forth on _Section 6.11(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter,
and (ii) such severance benefits shall be determined taking into account the
service crediting provisions set forth in _Section 6.11(b)_.

 



 

(b) For all purposes (including vesting, eligibility to participate and level
of severance and other benefits based upon credited service, but not for
purposes of defined benefit pension plan accrual) under the employee benefit
plans of Parent and its Subsidiaries providing

 



      
 

 



 

welfare, retirement, severance and vacation or paid-time off benefits to any
Company Employee after the Effective Time (the " _New Plans_ "), each Company
Employee shall be credited with his or her period of service with the Company
and its Subsidiaries and their respective predecessors before the Effective
Time. In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, with
respect to any New Plans that are "employee welfare benefit plans" within the
meaning of Section 3(1) of ERISA, (i) each Company Employee shall be
immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all
New Plans if and to the extent coverage under such New Plan is replacing
comparable coverage under a Company Plan in which such Company Employee
participated immediately before the Effective Time (such plans, collectively,
the " _Old Plans_ "), (ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing any group
coverage, all pre-existing condition and other limitations, exclusions and
requirements of such New Plan shall be waived for, or deemed satisfied by such
Company Employee and his or her covered spouse and dependents, to the extent
permitted under such New Plan and such limitations, exclusions or requirements
were satisfied, no longer applicable or waived under the comparable Old Plans
prior to the Effective Time, and (iii) any eligible expenses paid or incurred
by any Company Employee and his or her covered spouse and dependents during
the portion of the plan year of an Old Plan ending on the date such Company
Employees participation in a corresponding New Plan begins shall be taken
into account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible,
coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such Company
Employee and his or her covered spouse and dependents for the applicable plan
year as if such amounts had been paid or incurred under the New Plan.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, from and after

(d) by the Company:

 



 

(i) if, prior to the Offer Closing, Parent or Merger Sub shall have breached

of written notice thereof from the Company and (ii) would reasonably be
expected to prevent, materially impede or materially delay the consummation
when required by Parent or Merger Sub of the Offer, the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated hereby; provided that the Company shall not have the
right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(d)(i)_ if it
is then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other
agreement hereunder which would give the Company the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)(i)_; or

 



 

(ii) prior to the Offer Closing, in order to enter into a definitive agreement
providing for a Superior Proposal in accordance with _Section 6.3_;
_provided_ that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
_Section 8.1(d)(ii)_ shall not be available to the Company unless the Company
pays or has paid the Termination Fee to Parent or caused the Termination Fee
to be paid to Parent concurrently with such termination and otherwise in
accordance with _Section 8.3_; _provided_ further that the Company enters
into such definitive agreement for such transaction that is a Superior

which shall survive termination of this Agreement), and there shall be no
liability on the part of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company or their respective
directors, officers and Affiliates hereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , that,

termination, a Takeover Proposal shall have been publicly disclosed and (B)
within twelve (12) months of the date this Agreement is terminated, the
Company enters into a definitive agreement that provides for a Takeover
Proposal or a Takeover Proposal is consummated ( _provided_ that for purposes
of _clause (B)_ of this _Section 8.3(c)_, the references to "20%" and "80%"
in the definition of Takeover Proposal shall be deemed to be references to

entering into such definitive agreement or consummating such Takeover
Proposal.

Termination Fee may be payable under more than one provision of this Agreement
at the same or at different times and the occurrence of different events.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the parties hereto
agree that the payment of the Termination Fee is not a penalty and shall be
deemed to be liquidated damages but not the sole or exclusive remedy for any
losses or damages suffered or incurred by Parent, Merger Sub, any of their
respective Affiliates or any other Person in connection with this Agreement
(and the termination thereof), the Transactions (and the abandonment thereof),
except for any losses or damages suffered or incurred with respect to the
matter forming the basis for such termination. For the avoidance of doubt,
payment of the Termination Fee by or on behalf of the Company shall not be

paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account designated

would not have entered into this Agreement. If the Company shall fail to pay
in a timely manner the amounts due pursuant to this _Section 8.3_, and, in
order to obtain such payment, Parent makes a claim against the Company that
results in a judgment against the Company, the Company shall pay to Parent the
reasonable costs and expenses of Parent (including its reasonable attorneys
fees and expenses) incurred or accrued in connection with such suit.

reason Parent, Merger Sub or the Company shall have failed to perform its
obligations under this Agreement or otherwise breached this Agreement, then
