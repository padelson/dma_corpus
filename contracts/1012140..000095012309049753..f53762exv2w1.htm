Milestone Payment that is owed to the Participating Preferred Securityholders
by the issuance to the Participating Preferred Securityholders of shares of

 (f) _No Fractional Shares_. No fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued pursuant to this Agreement, and no certificates or scrip for any such fractional shares shall be issued.

The Company shall give Parent: (i) prompt notice of any demands for appraisal of shares of Company Capital Stock received by the Company, withdrawals of any demands, and any other instruments or notices served or otherwise delivered pursuant to the DGCL or the CGCL and received by the Company; and (ii) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such demands for appraisal.

 1.10 Exchange of Certificates.

On or prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall select a reputable bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as payment agent in the Merger (the " _Payment Agent_ "). On or promptly following the Closing Date, Parent shall deposit with the Payment Agent cash sufficient to pay the cash consideration payable pursuant to Sections 1.5(a)(ii)(A), 1.5(a)(iii)(A), 1.5(a)(v)(A) and 1.5(a)(vi)(A). The cash amount so deposited with the Payment Agent is referred to as the " _Payment Fund_." The Payment Agent will invest the funds included in the Payment Fund in the manner directed by Parent. Any interest or other income resulting from the investment of such funds shall be the property of, and will be paid to, Parent. 

   

 (b) _Letter of Transmittal_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall mail to each Person who is a record holder of Company Capital Stock or Company Options immediately prior to the Effective Time: (i) a letter of transmittal (or similar document to be delivered to the holders of Company Options) containing such provisions as Parent or the Payment Agent may reasonably specify (including a provision confirming that delivery of Company Stock Certificates (as defined in 1.10(d)) shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to Company Stock Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of such Company Stock Certificates to the Payment Agent, and a provision whereby such holder agrees to be bound by the provisions of Sections 1.10, 9 and 10.1) (a " _Letter of Transmittal_ "); and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the exchange of Company Stock Certificates for the Merger Consideration, if any, payable with respect to such Company Capital Stock. Upon the surrender to the Payment Agent of a Company Stock Certificate (or an affidavit of lost stock certificate as described in Section 1.10(e)), together with a duly executed Letter of Transmittal and such other customary documents as Parent or the Payment Agent may reasonably request, the holder of such Company Stock Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration, if any, which such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 1.5(a) at the time of such surrender, and the Company Stock Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. From and after the Effective Time, each Company Stock Certificate which prior to the Effective Time represented shares of Company Capital Stock shall be deemed to represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration payable with respect to such shares, and the holder of each such Company Stock Certificate shall cease to have any rights with respect to the shares of Company Capital Stock formerly represented thereby. Upon the delivery to the Payment Agent of a duly executed letter of transmittal and such other customary documents as Parent or the Payment Agent may reasonably request, a holder of Company Options that were outstanding immediately prior to the Closing shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof, which amount Parent shall cause to be paid through the Surviving Corporations payroll agent. The Company shall deliver a copy of the Letter of Transmittal to the Stockholders Agent. 

   

 (c) _Payments to Others_. If payment of Merger Consideration in respect of shares of Company Capital Stock converted pursuant to Section 1.5 is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name a surrendered Company Stock Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment that the Company Stock Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other Taxes required by reason of such payment in a name other than that of the registered holder of the Company Stock Certificate surrendered or shall have established to the satisfaction of Parent that such Tax either has been paid or is not payable.

 (d) _Stock Transfer Books_. As of the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and there shall not be any further registration of transfers of shares of Company Capital Stock thereafter on the records of the Company. If, after the Effective Time, certificates for shares of Company Capital Stock (" _Company Stock Certificates_ ") are presented to the Surviving Corporation, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration, if any, payable with respect to such shares as provided for in Section 1.5. No interest shall accrue or be paid on any Merger Consideration payable upon the surrender of a Company Stock Certificate which immediately before the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock. 

   

 (e) _Lost Certificates_. In the event any Company Stock Certificate representing shares of Company Capital Stock converted in connection with the Merger pursuant to Section 1.5 shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment of any Merger Consideration with respect to the shares of Company Capital Stock previously represented by such Company Stock Certificate, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Stock Certificate to provide an appropriate affidavit and an indemnity agreement in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent as indemnity against any claim that may be made against the Payment Agent, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any affiliated party with respect to such Company Stock Certificate. 

   

 (f) _Undistributed Payment Funds_.

 (g) _Escheat_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, neither Parent nor any other Person shall be liable to any holder of shares of Company Capital Stock or Company Warrants or to any other Person for any amount paid to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property law, escheat law or similar Legal Requirement. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of shares of Company Capital Stock or Company Options immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Body shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, become the property of Parent free and clear of any Encumbrance. 

   

 (h) _Withholding_. Each of the Payment Agent, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration payable pursuant to this Agreement to any security holder or former security holder of the Company such amounts as Parent reasonably determines in good faith are required to be deducted or withheld therefrom or in connection therewith under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law or under any other applicable Legal Requirement. To the extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid. 

   

 1.11 Further Action. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further action is reasonably determined by Parent to be necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation or Parent with full right, title and possession of and to all rights and property of

shall be the Effective Time Holders aggregate maximum liability, for Damages
resulting from any inaccuracies in or breaches of the IP Representations (or
resulting from the matters referred to in Section 9.2(a)(vi), to the extent
related to any such inaccuracies or breaches); and (B) recourse by the
Indemnitees to (1) the Indemnification Escrow Amount and (2) an offset
against up to 100% of any unpaid Milestone Payments (other than the First
Milestone Payment) in accordance with Section 9.6 shall be the Indemnitees
sole and exclusive remedies against any Effective Time Holder, and shall be
the Effective Time Holders aggregate maximum liability, for Damages
resulting from: (x) any inaccuracies in or breaches of the Specified
Representations or from any willful breaches of any covenants or obligation
of the Company contained in this Agreement; (y) the matters referred to

Section 9.2(a)(vi), to the extent related to any of the matters referred to
in clauses "(x)" or "(y)" of this sentence). 

   

 (e) _Limit on Direct Recovery from Effective Time Holders_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, except in the event of fraud, in no event will any Indemnitee have any recourse to recover directly from any Effective Time Holder any Damages resulting from the matters referred to in Section 9.2 or from any breach of this Agreement by the Company from any Merger Consideration that has been paid to such Effective Time Holder. In the event of fraud, there shall be no limits on the obligation of the Effective Time Holders pursuant to Section 9.2, and each Indemnitee shall have the right to proceed directly against, and recover Damages directly from, the Effective Time Holders; _provided, however_ , that, unless a particular Effective Time Holder committed (or was actively involved in the commission of) such fraud, the Indemnitees right to recover Damages directly from such Effective Time Holder in connection with such fraud shall be limited to the aggregate amount of the Merger Consideration actually received by such Effective Time Holder. 

   

 9.4 No Contribution. Each Effective Time Holder waives, and acknowledges and agrees that such Effective Time Holder shall not have and shall not exercise or assert (or attempt to exercise or assert), any right of contribution, right of indemnity or other right or remedy against Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation in connection with any indemnification obligation or any other liability to which such Effective Time Holder may become subject under or in connection with this Agreement or any other agreement or document delivered to Parent in connection with this Agreement. 

  

 9.5 Defense of Third Party Claims. In the event of the assertion or commencement by any Person of any claim or Legal Proceeding (whether against the Surviving Corporation, Parent or any other Person) with respect to which any Effective Time Holder may become obligated to hold harmless, indemnify, compensate or reimburse any Indemnitee pursuant to Section 9, Parent shall have the right, at its election, to proceed with the defense of such claim or Legal Proceeding on its own with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Stockholders Agent. If Parent so proceeds with the defense of any such claim or Legal Proceeding: 

  

 (a) subject to the other provisions of Section 9, all reasonable expenses relating to the defense of such claim or Legal Proceeding shall be Damages for purposes of this Section 9; 

   

 (b) each Effective Time Holder shall make available to Parent any documents and materials in such Effective Time Holders possession or control that may be reasonably necessary to the defense of such claim or Legal Proceeding; 

   

 (c) Parent shall keep the Stockholders Agent reasonably apprised of the material developments in such claim or Legal Proceeding as they occur;

 (d) Parent shall have the right to settle, adjust or compromise a claim or Legal Proceeding related to Company IP; _provided, however,_ that if Parent settles, adjusts or compromises any such claim or Legal Proceeding without the consent of the Stockholders Agent, such settlement, adjustment or compromise shall not be evidence of, or be relevant to the determination of: (A) whether any Damages suffered or incurred by an Indemnitee in connection with such claim or Legal Proceeding are the valid subject of a claim for recovery under Section 9.2; or (B) the amount of any Damages that would have been suffered or incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with such claim or Legal Proceeding in the absence of such settlement, adjustment or compromise of such claim or Legal Proceeding; and 

   

 (e) Parent shall have the right to settle, adjust or compromise any claim or Legal Proceeding that is not subject to clause "(d)" of this sentence (including, for greater clarity, any claim or Legal Proceeding related to the Companys infringement, misappropriation or other violation or unlawful use of any Intellectual Property of any other Person, unless such claim or Legal Proceeding also involves claims that are related to Company IP); _provided, however,_ that Parent shall not settle, adjust or compromise any such claim or Legal Proceeding without the consent of the Stockholders Agent (which consent may not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned). 

  

Parent shall give the Stockholders Agent prompt notice of the commencement of
any such Legal Proceeding against Parent or the Surviving Corporation;
_provided, however_ , that any failure on the part of Parent to so notify the
Stockholders Agent shall not limit any of the obligations of the Effective
Time Holders under Section 9 (except to the extent such failure materially
prejudices the Stockholders Agents rights hereunder). If Parent does not
elect to proceed with the defense, settlement, adjustment or compromise of
any such claim or Legal Proceeding, the Stockholders Agent may proceed with
the defense of such claim or Legal Proceeding with counsel reasonably
satisfactory to Parent; _provided, however,_ that the Stockholders Agent may
not settle, adjust or compromise any such claim or Legal Proceeding without
the prior written consent of Parent (which consent may not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed). 

   

 9.6 Setoff. To the extent not fully satisfied out of the Indemnification Escrow Amount, and subject to any applicable limitations contained in Section 9.3, Parent shall have the right to withhold and deduct any sum that is owed to any Indemnitee under this Section 9 from any unpaid Milestone Payment (other than the First Milestone Payment). In addition, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if: (a) prior to the Milestone End Date, any Indemnitee has delivered to the Stockholders Agent a Claim Notice (as defined in _Exhibit D_ ) asserting a claim for recovery under Section 9.2, and (b) the claim for recovery by such Indemnitee referred to in such Claim Notice has not been resolved prior to the date of payment of a particular Milestone Payment (other than the First Milestone Payment), then, Parent shall have the right to withhold and deduct the Contested Amount (as defined in _Exhibit D_) with respect to such unresolved claim (or the Claimed Amount (as defined in _Exhibit D_) if the Stockholders Agent has not delivered a Response Notice (as defined in _Exhibit D_) with respect to such claim for recovery by such Indemnitee) from such Milestone Payment until such claim has been finally resolved in accordance with _Exhibit D_ (an amount withheld from any Milestone Payment in accordance with this sentence, a " _Milestone Holdback Amount_ "). 

  

 9.7 Exercise of Remedies Other Than by Parent. No Indemnitee (other than Parent or any successor thereto or assign thereof) shall be permitted to assert any indemnification claim or exercise any other remedy under this Agreement unless Parent (or any successor thereto or assign thereof) shall have consented to the assertion of such indemnification claim or the exercise of such other remedy.

delegated by the Stockholders Agent; and (iii) shall survive the death,
incapacity, dissolution, liquidation or winding up of each of the Effective

any Effective Time Holder. 

   

 (d) _Indemnification; Reimbursement_. The Effective Time Holders shall, jointly and severally, indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Stockholders Agent and its successors and assigns from and against any and all claims, demands, suits, actions, causes of action, losses, damages, obligations, liabilities, costs and expenses (including attorneys fees and court costs) arising as a result of or incurred in connection with any actions taken or omitted to be taken by the Stockholders Agent pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, except to the extent it is demonstrated that the Stockholders Agent was grossly negligent or engaged in willful misconduct,  _provided_ , that no Effective Time Holders shall be liable to the Stockholders Agent pursuant to this 10.1(d) for any amount in excess of the portion of the Merger Consideration to which such Effective Time Holder is entitled pursuant to Section 1.5 or 1.6 hereof. In addition, by virtue of the adoption of this Agreement and/or the cancellation by an Effective Time Holder of Company Options in exchange for Merger Consideration pursuant to this Agreement, each Effective Time Holder forever voluntarily releases and discharges the Stockholders Agent and its successors and assigns from any and all claims, demands, suits, actions, causes of action, losses, damages, obligations, liabilities, costs and expenses (including attorneys fees and court costs), whether known or unknown, anticipated or unanticipated, arising as a result of or incurred in connection with any actions taken or omitted to be taken by the Stockholders Agent pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, except to the extent it can be demonstrated that the Stockholders Agent was grossly negligent or engaged in willful misconduct. Expenses (including attorneys fees and court costs) incurred by the Stockholders Agent in defending any claim, demand, suit, action or cause of action or otherwise performing their respective obligations under this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement may be paid, at the election of the Stockholders Agent, at any time (i) from the Expenses Escrow Amount to the extent any funds remain with the Escrow Agent; (ii) from any Milestone Payment actually paid; or (iii) otherwise from the Effective Time Holders in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares.

Any such successor shall succeed the former Stockholders Agent as the Stockholders Agent hereunder. If for any reason there is no Stockholders Agent at any time, all references herein to the Stockholders Agent shall be deemed to refer to the Effective Time Holders.

any state or federal court located in the State of Delaware. Each party to

jurisdiction of each state and federal court located in the State of Delaware
(and each appellate court located in the State of Delaware) in connection
with any such action, suit or other legal proceeding; (ii) agrees that each

 (c) _Indemnification Claims; Disputes Related to Milestones_. Any claim for indemnification, compensation or reimbursement pursuant to Section 9 (and, at the option of any Indemnitee, any other claim for a monetary remedy, such as in the case of a claim based upon fraud, relating to this Agreement or the Merger after the Closing) shall be brought and resolved exclusively in accordance with Exhibit _D_ (it being understood that, for the avoidance of doubt and without limiting any portion of Section 10.8(b): (i) at the option of any Indemnitee, any claim based upon fraud may be brought and resolved in accordance with Section 10.8(b) rather than in accordance with Exhibit _D_ ; and (ii) nothing in this Section 10.8(c) shall prevent any party from seeking preliminary injunctive relief from any court of competent jurisdiction). Any disputes related to the performance or non-performance of Parents obligations under, or the satisfaction of any Milestone Event in accordance with, Sections 1.7 and/or 1.8 shall be brought by the Stockholders Agent and resolved exclusively in accordance with the procedures set forth in paragraphs "(f)" and "(g)" of _Exhibit D_

Subject to the preceding sentence, (a) this Agreement, including the obligations set forth in Section 1.7, shall be binding upon: (i) the Company and its successors and assigns (if any); (ii) Parent and its successors and assigns (if any); and (iii) Merger Sub and its successors and assigns (if any) and (b) this Agreement shall inure to the benefit of: (i) the Company; (ii) Parent; (iii) Merger Sub; (iv) the other Indemnitees; (v) the Company Indemnified Parties; and (vi) the respective successors and assigns (if any) of the foregoing.

 10.11 Waiver. No failure on the part of any Person to exercise any power, right, privilege or remedy under this Agreement, and no delay on the part of any Person in exercising any power, right, privilege or remedy under this Agreement, shall operate as a waiver of such power, right, privilege or remedy; and no single or partial exercise of any such power, right, privilege or remedy shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or of any other power, right, privilege or remedy. No Person shall be deemed to have waived any claim arising out of this Agreement, or any power, right, privilege or remedy under this Agreement, unless the waiver of such claim, power, right, privilege or remedy is expressly set forth in a written instrument duly executed and delivered on behalf of such Person; and any such waiver shall not be applicable or have any effect except in the specific instance in which it is given. 

  

 10.12 Waiver of Jury Trial. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives any and all right to trial by jury in any action, suit or other legal proceeding arising out of or related to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

 10.15 Parties in Interest. Except for (a) the provisions of Section 9, and (b) the right of the Company Indemnified Parties to enforce Parents obligations solely with respect to Section 5.9, none of the provisions of this Agreement is intended to provide any rights or remedies to any Person other than the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns (if any).

 10.16 Entire Agreement. This Agreement and the other agreements referred to herein set forth the entire understanding of the parties hereto relating to the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersede all prior agreements and understandings among or between any of the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and thereof; _provided, however_ , that the Confidentiality Agreement shall not be superseded by this Agreement and shall remain in effect in accordance with its terms until the earlier of: (a) the Effective Time; or (b) the date on which such Confidentiality Agreement is terminated or expires in accordance with its terms.

Recitals 

   

 A. Parent, Profiterole Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"), Proteolix, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company") and the Stockholders Agent have entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of October 10, 2009 and attached as Exhibit A hereto (the "Merger Agreement"), pursuant to which: (i) Merger Sub is merging with and into the Company (the "Merger"); and (ii) the securities of the Company held by the Escrow Holders are being exchanged for the consideration set forth in the Merger Agreement. 

  

 B. The Merger Agreement contemplates the establishment of (i) an escrow arrangement to secure rights to indemnification, compensation and reimbursement of Parent and the other Indemnitees under the Merger Agreement; and (ii) an escrow arrangement to provide funds for the Stockholders Agent to perform its duties under the Merger Agreement, this Escrow Agreement and otherwise. The Escrow Agent is not a party to the Merger Agreement and has no duty to review the Merger Agreement or to interpret in any manner the terms of the Merger Agreement. 

  

 C. Pursuant to Section 10.1(a) of the Merger Agreement and Section 9 of this Agreement, the Stockholders Agent has been irrevocably appointed to serve as the Stockholders Agent for, among other things, administration of the provisions of Section 9 of the Merger Agreement. 

  

Agreement 

   

 The parties, intending to be legally bound, agree as follows:

 1.1 "Escrow Holders" shall initially refer to the Persons named on Exhibit B who constitute all Escrow Holders as of the date of this Agreement.

Parent shall cause Exhibit B to be revised from time to time to reflect any such additional Escrow Holders. Unless and until the Escrow Agent receives a revised version of Exhibit B, it may assume without inquiry that the most recent version it has received remains the current one.

assignable or transferable, other than by operation of law. No assignment or
transfer of any of such interests by operation of law shall be recognized or
given effect until Parent and the Escrow Agent shall have received written
notice of such assignment or transfer. 

   

 2.5 Trust Fund. The Indemnification Escrow Property shall be held as a trust fund and shall not be subject to any lien, attachment, trustee process or any other judicial process of any creditor of any Escrow Holder or of any party hereto. The Escrow Agent shall hold and safeguard the Escrow Property until the Termination Date (as defined in Section 7). 

   

 3. Administration of Indemnification Escrow Account and Expenses Escrow Account. Except as otherwise provided herein, the Escrow Agent shall administer the Indemnification Escrow Account and Expenses Escrow Account as follows: 

  

 3.1 Claim Notice. If any Indemnitee has or claims in good faith to have incurred or suffered, or believes in good faith that it may incur or suffer, Damages for which it is or may be entitled to indemnification, compensation or reimbursement under Section 9 of the Merger Agreement or for which it is or may otherwise be entitled to a monetary remedy relating to the Merger Agreement or the Merger, such Indemnitee may deliver a claim notice (a "Claim Notice") to the Stockholders Agent and to the Escrow Agent on or prior to the Release Date. Each Claim Notice shall: (a) state that the Indemnitee believes in good faith that the Indemnitee is or may be entitled to indemnification, compensation or reimbursement under Section 9 of the Merger Agreement or is or may otherwise be entitled to a monetary remedy relating to the Merger Agreement or the Merger; (b) contain a brief description of the facts and circumstances supporting the Indemnitees claim; (c) if practicable, contain a non-binding, preliminary, good faith estimate of the amount to which the Indemnitee might be entitled (the aggregate amount of such estimate, as it may be modified by the Indemnitee in good faith from time to time, being referred to as the "Claimed Amount"); and (d) state that it is a Claim Notice under this Agreement. 

   

 3.2 Response Notice. During the 20-business day period commencing upon receipt by the Stockholders Agent of a Claim Notice from an Indemnitee (the "Dispute Period"), the Stockholders Agent may deliver to the Indemnitee and to the Escrow Agent a written response (the "Response Notice") in which the Stockholders Agent states that it is a Response Notice under this Agreement, and: (a) agree that the full Claimed Amount is owed to the Indemnitee; (b) agree that part, but not all, of the Claimed Amount is owed to the Indemnitee (the "Agreed Amount"); or (c) indicate that no part of the Claimed Amount is owed to the Indemnitee. If the Response Notice is delivered in accordance with clause "(b)" or "(c)" of the preceding sentence, the Response Notice shall also contain a brief description of the facts and circumstances supporting the Stockholders Agents claim that only a portion or no part of the Claimed Amount is owed to the Indemnitee, as the case may be (any part of the Claimed Amount that is not agreed to be owed to the Indemnitee pursuant to the Indemnitees Claim Notice being referred to as the "Contested Amount"). If a Response Notice is not received by the Escrow Agent from the Stockholders Agent prior to the expiration of the Dispute Period, then the Stockholders Agent shall be conclusively deemed to have agreed that an amount equal to the full Claimed Amount (or if the full Claimed Amount exceeds the value of the Indemnification Escrow Property, then all of the Indemnification Escrow Property) may be released to the Indemnitee from the Indemnification Escrow Account.

CONFIDENTIAL 

  

Certain confidential information contained in this document, marked by
brackets, has been omitted and filed separately with the Securities and
Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 24b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended. 

   

 3.3 Full Agreement. If the Stockholders Agent in the Response Notice agrees that the full Claimed Amount (or all of the Indemnification Escrow Property) is owed to the Indemnitee, or if no Response Notice is received by the Escrow Agent from the Stockholders Agent prior to the expiration of the Dispute Period, the Escrow Agent shall, within 10 business days following the earlier of the receipt of such Response Notice or the expiration of the Dispute Period, deliver to such Indemnitee, Indemnification Escrow Property having a value equal to the full Claimed Amount (or if the full Claimed Amount exceeds the value of the Indemnification Escrow Property, then all of the Indemnification Escrow Property). 

   

 3.4 Partial Agreement. If the Stockholders Agent in the Response Notice agrees that part, but not all, of the Claimed Amount is owed to the Indemnitee, the Escrow Agent shall, within 10 business days following the receipt of such Response Notice, deliver to such Indemnitee, Indemnification Escrow Property having a value equal to the Agreed Amount. Such payment shall not be deemed to be made in full satisfaction of the claim described in such Claim Notice, but shall count toward the satisfaction of the claim described in such Claim Notice. 

   

 3.5 Dispute Resolution. If any Response Notice expressly indicates that there is a Contested Amount, the Stockholders Agent and the Indemnitee shall attempt in good faith to resolve the dispute related to the Contested Amount. If the Stockholders Agent and the Indemnitee resolve such dispute, such resolution shall be binding on the Stockholders Agent, all of the Escrow Holders and such Indemnitee and a settlement agreement stipulating the amount owed to such Indemnitee (the "Stipulated Amount") shall be signed by such Indemnitee and the Stockholders Agent and sent to the Escrow Agent, which shall, promptly after receipt thereof, if applicable, deliver to such Indemnitee Indemnification Escrow Property having a value equal to the Stipulated Amount. Unless and until the Escrow Agent shall receive written notice signed by the Stockholders Agent and the Indemnitee that any such dispute has been resolved by the Indemnitee and the Stockholders Agent, the Escrow Agent may assume without inquiry that such dispute has not been resolved. 

   

 (a) In the event that there is a dispute relating to any Claim Notice or Contested Amount (whether it is a matter between the Indemnitee, on the one hand, and the Stockholders Agent, on the other hand, or it is a matter that is subject to a claim or Legal Proceeding asserted or commenced by a third party brought against the Indemnitee or the Company in a litigation or arbitration) that the Indemnitee and the Stockholders Agent have not resolved after attempting to do so in good faith during the 60-day period following the delivery of a Response Notice to the Indemnitee, either the Indemnitee or the Stockholders Agent may submit such dispute (an "Arbitrable Dispute") to be settled by binding arbitration. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, nothing in this Agreement shall prevent the Indemnitee from seeking preliminary injunctive relief from a court of competent jurisdiction pending settlement of any Arbitrable Dispute. Except as herein specifically stated, any Arbitrable Dispute shall be resolved by arbitration in San Francisco, California in accordance with JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures (the "JAMS Rules") then in effect. However, in all events, the provisions contained herein shall govern over any conflicting rules which may now or hereafter be contained in the JAMS Rules. Any judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator shall be entered in any court having jurisdiction over the subject matter thereof. The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant any equitable and legal remedies that would be available if any judicial proceeding was instituted to resolve an Arbitrable Dispute. The final decision of the arbitrator, as entered by a court of competent jurisdiction, will be furnished by the arbitrator to the Stockholders Agent, Indemnitee and the Escrow Agent in writing and will constitute a final, conclusive and non-appealable determination of the issue in

question, binding upon the Escrow Holders, the Stockholders Agent, the Escrow
Agent and the Indemnitee, and an order with respect thereto may be entered in
any court of competent jurisdiction. 

   

 (b) Any such arbitration will be conducted before a single arbitrator who will be compensated for his or her services at a rate to be determined by the Indemnitee and the Stockholders Agent or by JAMS, but based upon reasonable hourly or daily consulting rates for the arbitrator in the event the parties are not able to agree upon his or her rate of compensation. 

  

 (c) The arbitrator shall be mutually agreed upon by the Indemnitee and the Stockholders Agent. In the event Parent and the Stockholders Agent are unable to agree within 20 days following submission of the dispute to JAMS by one of the parties, JAMS will have the authority to select an arbitrator from a list of arbitrators who satisfy the criteria set forth in Section 3.5(d) below. 

  

 (d) No arbitrator shall have any past or present family, business or other relationship with Parent, the Company, the Stockholders Agent, any Indemnitee, any of the Escrow Holders or any "affiliate" (as such term is defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended), director or officer thereof, unless following full disclosure of all such relationships, the Indemnitee and the Stockholders Agent agree in writing to waive such requirement with respect to an individual in connection with any dispute. 

  

 (e) The arbitrator shall be instructed to hold an up to a three-day hearing (or 30 days in the event of a dispute relating to any Company IP) regarding the disputed matter within 60 days of his designation and to render an award (without written opinion) no later than 10 days after the conclusion of such hearing (or such longer time as is permitted under JAMS Rules), in each case unless otherwise mutually agreed in writing by the Indemnitee and the Stockholders Agent. 

  

 (f) No discovery other than an exchange of relevant documents may occur in any arbitration commenced under the provisions of this Agreement, except for any arbitration relating to Company IP. The Indemnitee and the Stockholders Agent agree to act in good faith to promptly exchange relevant documents. 

  

 (g) The Indemnitee and the Stockholders Agent (on behalf of the Escrow Holders as a group and solely in its capacity as Stockholders Agent) will each pay 50% of the initial compensation to be paid to the arbitrator in any such arbitration and 50% of the costs of transcripts and other normal and regular expenses of the arbitration proceedings; _provided, however,_ that: (a) the prevailing party in any arbitration will be entitled to an award of attorneys fees and costs; and (b) all costs of arbitration, other than those provided for above, will be paid by the losing party, and the arbitrator will be authorized to determine the identity of the prevailing party and the losing party. 

  

 (h) The arbitrator chosen in accordance with these provisions will not have the power to alter, amend or otherwise affect the terms of these arbitration provisions or any other provisions contained in this Agreement or the Merger Agreement. 

  

 (i) Except as specifically otherwise provided in this Agreement or the Merger Agreement, arbitration will be the sole and exclusive remedy of the parties for any Arbitrable Dispute or any other dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Merger Agreement.

 3.6 Timing of Release of Contested Amounts. Upon resolution of an Arbitrable Dispute, if the arbitrators award is payable to the Indemnitee, the Escrow Agent shall, within 10 business days following the entry of the arbitrators decision by a court of competent jurisdiction, or such shorter period of time as may be set forth in the arbitrators decision, deliver to such Indemnitee Indemnification Escrow Property equal to the amount of the award specified in the arbitrators decision, if any, to the Indemnitee. 

   

 3.7 Distributions to Parent. Distributions of Indemnification Escrow Property shall be made to Parent (on behalf of the applicable Indemnitee(s)) at the address set forth in Section 10.2 of this Agreement or such other address as Parent shall have provided in writing to the Escrow Agent. 

   

 3.8 Releases from Expenses Escrow Account. From time to time prior to the date that the amount held in the Expenses Escrow Account hereunder is reduced to zero in accordance with this Escrow Agreement, the Stockholders Agent may deliver written instruction letters to the Escrow Agent (which letters need not be countersigned by Parent), instructing the Escrow Agent to release and deliver to the Stockholders Agent, out of the then remaining amounts held in the Expenses Escrow Account, the cash amounts (and in accordance with the payment instructions) set forth in such instruction letters. Each such instruction letter will contain a statement by the Stockholders Agent that it is entitled to the amounts specified therein pursuant to Section 10.1 of the Merger Agreement, upon which the Escrow Agent may conclusively rely. The Escrow Agent shall release and deliver such amounts to the Stockholders Agent within five business days of receiving such instruction letter from the Stockholders Agent. 

   

 4. Distribution of Escrow Property. 

  

 4.1 Subject to Section 4.3, within five business days after the Release Date, the Escrow Agent shall distribute or cause to be distributed to the Payment Agent for distribution to each of the Escrow Holders at such Escrow Holders address set forth on Exhibit B Indemnification Escrow Property in an amount equal to such Escrow Holders Escrow Percentage of the Indemnification Distribution Amount; _provided, however_ , that if prior to the Release Date, any Indemnitee has given a Claim Notice (including an amended Claim Notice) pursuant to Section 3.1 containing a claim which has not been resolved prior to the Release Date in accordance with Section 3 (a "Holdover Claim"), then, rather than distributing all Indemnification Escrow Property to the Escrow Holders, the Escrow Agent shall retain in the Indemnification Escrow Account after the Release Date, Indemnification Escrow Property (out of the Indemnification Distribution Amount) having a value equal to the Contested Amount (or the Claimed Amount if the Stockholders Agent has not delivered a Response Notice with respect to such claim) with respect to such Holdover Claim (the amount retained in the Indemnification Escrow Account with respect to such Holdover Claim being referred to as the "Retained Amount"). Following final resolution of any Holdover Claim in accordance with Section 3, the Escrow Agent shall distribute to the Payment Agent for distribution to each Escrow Holder Indemnification Escrow Property in an amount equal to such Escrow Holders Escrow Percentage of that portion of the applicable Retained Amount that is not released to an Indemnitee in accordance with Section 3, if any. Distributions of Indemnification Escrow Property shall be made to the Payment Agent at its address set forth in Section 10.2 of this Agreement or such other address as the Payment Agent shall have provided in writing to the Escrow Agent.

Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 24b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended. 

   

 4.2 No earlier than the date that the amount held in the Indemnification Escrow Account hereunder is reduced to zero in accordance with this Escrow Agreement, the Stockholders Agent will deliver a written instruction letter to the Escrow Agent (which letter need not be countersigned by Parent), instructing the Escrow Agent to distribute or cause to be distributed to the Payment Agent for distribution to each of the Escrow Holders at such Escrow Holders address set forth on Exhibit B, Expenses Escrow Property in an amount equal to such Escrow Holders Escrow Percentage of the Expenses Escrow Property then being held in the Expenses Escrow Account. The Escrow Agent will distribute or cause to be distributed such amount to the Payment Agent within five business days of receiving such instruction letter from the Stockholders Agent. Distributions of Expenses Escrow Property shall be made to the Payment Agent at its address set forth in Section 10.2 of this Agreement or such other address as the Payment Agent shall have provided in writing to the Escrow Agent. 

   

 4.3 At least five (5) business days prior to the disbursement of any portion of the Escrow Property to any Escrow Holder identified on Exhibit B as being subject to withholding taxes and Parent or the Company is required to withhold a portion of such amounts, Parent or the Company shall provide to the Escrow Agent a written instruction directing the Escrow Agent to withhold from such disbursement an amount equal to such amount as Parent or the Company is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment (under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law with respect to such payment) from the amount that would otherwise be paid to such Escrow Holder pursuant to Section 4.1. Such amount, if any, shall be disbursed by the Escrow Agent to Parent out of the Escrow Property simultaneously therewith, and Parent shall remit such amount to the proper authorities. Notwithstanding the withholding designations on Exhibit B, the Escrow Agent may conclusively assume that no withholding is to occur unless it receives timely notice from Parent or the Company. The Escrow Agent shall have no obligation or liability with respect to the Parents or the Companys determination of whether withholding is necessary, the calculation of any amount of withholding or the disposition of any amounts paid to Parent or Company by the Escrow Agent under this Section 4.3. 

   

 5. Fees and Expenses. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to receive from time to time fees in accordance with Exhibit D. In accordance with Exhibit D, the Escrow Agent will also be entitled to reimbursement for reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Escrow Agent in the performance of its duties hereunder and the execution and delivery of this Agreement. The Escrow Holders, on the one hand, and Parent, on the other hand, shall each pay 50% of such fees and expenses, and the Escrow Agent shall deduct 50% of such fees and expenses from the Indemnification Escrow Property in satisfaction of the Escrow Holders portion of such fees and expenses. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any fees or expenses incurred as a result of the investment of the Indemnification Escrow Property or the Expenses Escrow Property pursuant to Section 2.3 of this Agreement (or the liquidation of such investments) shall be deducted from such Escrow Property. 

  

 6. Limitation of Escrow Agents Liability. 

  

 6.1 Duties of Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent undertakes to perform such duties as are specifically set forth in this Agreement only and shall have no duty under any other agreement or document, and no implied covenants or obligations shall be read into this Agreement against the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent shall incur no liability with respect to any action taken by it or for any inaction on its part in reliance upon any notice, direction, instruction, consent, statement or other document believed by it in good faith to be genuine and duly authorized, nor for any other action or inaction except for its own negligence or willful misconduct. In all questions arising under this Agreement, the Escrow

Agent may rely on the advice of counsel, and for anything done, omitted or
suffered in good faith by the Escrow Agent based upon such advice, the Escrow
Agent shall not be liable to anyone. In no event shall the Escrow Agent be
liable for incidental, punitive or consequential damages. 

   

 6.2 Indemnification. Subject to Section 5 hereof, Parent and the Stockholders Agent (acting on behalf of the Escrow Holders and solely in its capacity as Stockholders Agent) hereby agree to indemnify the Escrow Agent and its officers, directors, employees and agents for, and hold it and them harmless against, any loss, liability or expense incurred (including its costs, expenses, and reasonable attorneys fees) without negligence or willful misconduct on the part of Escrow Agent, arising out of or in connection with the Escrow Agents carrying out its duties hereunder with respect to the Indemnification Escrow Property or the Indemnification Escrow Account. The Stockholders Agent (acting on behalf of the Escrow Holders and solely in its capacity as Stockholders Agent) hereby agree to indemnify the Escrow Agent and its officers, directors, employees and agents for, and hold it and them harmless against, any loss, liability or expense incurred (including its costs, expenses, and reasonable attorneys fees) without negligence or willful misconduct on the part of Escrow Agent, arising out of or in connection with the Escrow Agents carrying out its duties hereunder with respect to the Expenses Escrow Property or the Expenses Escrow Account. This right of indemnification, compensation and reimbursement shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the resignation of the Escrow Agent. 

   

 7. Termination. This Agreement (other than the provisions of Sections 5 and 6.2) shall terminate upon the release by the Escrow Agent of all of the Escrow Property in accordance with this Agreement (the date of such release, the "Termination Date"). 

  

 8. Successor Escrow Agent. In the event the Escrow Agent becomes unavailable or unwilling to continue as Escrow Agent under this Agreement, the Escrow Agent may resign and be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder by giving its written resignation to the parties to this Agreement. Such resignation shall take effect not less than 30 days after it is given to all parties hereto. In such event, Parent and the Stockholders Agent may mutually appoint a successor Escrow Agent. If Parent and the Stockholders Agent fail to appoint a successor Escrow Agent within 15 days after receiving the Escrow Agents written resignation, the Escrow Agent shall have the right to apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Escrow Agent. The successor Escrow Agent shall execute and deliver to the Escrow Agent an instrument accepting such appointment, and the successor Escrow Agent shall, without further acts, be vested with all the estates, property rights, powers and duties of the predecessor Escrow Agent as if originally named as Escrow Agent herein. The Escrow Agent shall act in accordance with written instructions from Parent as to the transfer of the Escrow Property to a successor Escrow Agent. 

  

 9. Stockholders Agent. Unless and until Parent and the Escrow Agent shall have received written notice of the appointment of a successor Stockholders Agent in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, Parent and the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely on, and shall be fully protected relying on, the power and authority of the Stockholders Agent to act on behalf of the Escrow Holders.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, notices to the Escrow Agent shall be effective
only upon receipt. The Escrow Agent may assume that any Claim Notice,
Response Notice or other notice of any kind required to be delivered to the
Escrow Agent and any other Person has been received by such other Person on
the date it has been received by the Escrow Agent, but the Escrow Agent need
not inquire into or verify such receipt.

This Agreement may be executed in several counterparts, each of which shall constitute an original and all of which, when taken together, shall constitute one agreement. The exchange of a fully executed Agreement (in counterpart or otherwise) by facsimile or other electronic means shall be sufficient to bind the parties to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. 

   

 10.5 Applicable Law; Waiver of Jury Trial. This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with, and governed in all respects by, the internal laws of the State of Delaware (without giving effect to principles of conflicts of laws). Any Legal Proceeding relating to this Agreement or the enforcement of any provision of this Agreement may be brought or otherwise commenced in any state or federal court located in the State of Delaware. Each party to this Agreement: (i) expressly and irrevocably consents and submits to the jurisdiction of each state and federal court located in the State of Delaware (and each appellate court located in the State of Delaware) in connection with any such Legal Proceeding; (ii) agrees that each state and federal court located in the State of Delaware shall be deemed to be a convenient forum; and (iii) agrees not to assert (by way of motion, as a defense or otherwise), in any such Legal Proceeding commenced in any state or federal court located in the State of Delaware, any claim that such party is not subject personally to the jurisdiction of such court, that such Legal Proceeding has been brought in an inconvenient forum, that the venue of such proceeding is improper or that this Agreement or the subject matter of this Agreement may not be enforced in or by such court. Each of the parties hereby irrevocably waives any and all right to trial by jury in any action arising out of or related to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. 

   

 10.6 Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of each of the parties hereto and each of their respective permitted successors and assigns, if any. Parent may freely assign any or all of its rights under this Agreement, in whole or in part, to any affiliate of Parent or any post-Closing purchaser of all of the issued and outstanding equity securities or all or substantially all of the assets of Parent or the Company (as the surviving corporation in the Merger) (provided, that, such affiliate or post-Closing purchaser shall agree, in writing, to assume all the obligations of Parent under this Agreement), but no such assignment shall relieve Parent of its obligations hereunder. Subject to Section 2.4 of this Agreement, no Escrow Holder may assign such Escrow Holders rights under this Agreement without the express prior written consent of Parent, and any attempted assignment of this Agreement or any of such rights by an Escrow Holder without such consent shall be void and of no effect; _provided, however,_ that upon the death of an Escrow Holder, such Escrow Holders rights under this Agreement may be transferred in accordance with the laws of descent and distribution.

 10.7 Waiver. No failure on the part of any Person to exercise any power, right, privilege or remedy under this Agreement, and no delay on the part of any Person in exercising any power, right, privilege or remedy under this Agreement, shall operate as a waiver of such power, right, privilege or remedy; and no single or partial exercise of any such power, right, privilege or remedy shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or of any other power, right, privilege or remedy. No Person shall be deemed to have waived any claim arising out of this Agreement, or any power, right, privilege or remedy under this Agreement, unless the waiver of such claim, power, right, privilege or remedy is expressly set forth in a written instrument duly executed and delivered on behalf of such Person; and any such waiver shall not be applicable or have any effect except in the specific instance in which it is given. 

   

 10.8 Amendment. This Agreement may not be amended, modified, altered or supplemented other than by means of a written instrument duly executed and delivered on behalf of all of the parties hereto (it being understood that any amendment executed and delivered by the Stockholders Agent shall be binding upon all Escrow Holders). 

   

 10.9 Severability. If any provision or part of any provision of this Agreement, or the application of any such provision or part thereof to any Person or set of circumstances, shall be determined to be invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction to any extent, then: (a) such provision or part thereof shall, with respect to such circumstances and in such jurisdiction, be deemed amended to conform to applicable laws so as to be valid and enforceable to the fullest possible extent; (b) the invalidity or unenforceability of such provision or part thereof under such circumstances or in such jurisdiction shall not affect the validity or enforceability of such provision or part thereof under any other circumstances or in any other jurisdiction; and (c) the invalidity or unenforceability of such provision or part thereof shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of such provision or the validity or enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement. Each provision of this Agreement is separable from every other provision of this Agreement, and each part of each provision of this Agreement is separable from every other part of such provision.

Expenses Escrow Property in an amount equal to 39% of the sum of the interest
on, and all other taxable income earned from, the investment of the
Indemnification Escrow Property and the Expenses Escrow Property,
respectively, pursuant to this Agreement. 

   

 (c) Parent agrees to provide the Escrow Agent with a certified tax identification number for Parent within 30 days after the date hereof. Each party understands that if the tax identification number is not so certified to the Escrow Agent, the Escrow Agent may be required by the Code to withhold a portion of any payments made pursuant to this Agreement. The Escrow Agent shall comply with all withholding and reporting requirements under the Code. 

  

 (d) Parent and the Escrow Holders (through the Stockholders Agent) acknowledge and agree that, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in this Agreement, the portion of the Indemnification Escrow Property allocable to Escrow Holders in respect of their Company Options that were cancelled in exchange for consideration as provided in Section 1.6 of the Merger Agreement is subject to the claims of the creditors of Parent and therefore constitutes an unfunded, unsecured promise to pay such amounts under the terms provided herein. Accordingly, the Escrow Holders will be treated as receiving income in respect of such amounts only as and when distributed to them in accordance with this Agreement. Parent and the Escrow Holders will file their tax returns and reports consistent with, and will take no action inconsistent with, such treatment. The Escrow Agent need not determine whether or what amount of any payment should be treated by the Escrow Holders as being imputed interest or otherwise and shall allocate all income earned on investments of monies in the Escrow Property to Parent in accordance with Section 10.12(a), without regard as to how the Escrow Holders may treat payments by the Escrow Agent to them. 

  

 10.13 Cooperation. Parent and the Stockholders Agent agree to cooperate fully with each other and the Escrow Agent and to execute and deliver such further documents, certificates, agreements and instruments and to take such other actions as may be reasonably requested by the other or the Escrow Agent to evidence or reflect the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to carry out the intent and purposes of this Agreement. 

   

 10.14 Reliance on Own Counsel. Each party to this Agreement represents and warrants to the other parties that such party: (a) has carefully reviewed this Agreement and, to the extent he or it believed necessary or appropriate, has discussed this Agreement with his or its own separate counsel; (b) fully understands this Agreement; and (c) has not relied on the advice of any Person other than (to the extent applicable) his or its own separate counsel in determining whether to execute this Agreement. 

   

 10.15 Construction. 

   

 (a) For purposes of this Agreement, whenever the context requires: the singular number shall include the plural, and vice versa; the masculine gender shall include the feminine and neuter genders; the feminine gender shall include the masculine and neuter genders; and the neuter gender shall include the masculine and feminine genders. 

  

 (b) The parties hereto agree that any rule of construction to the effect that ambiguities are to be resolved against the drafting party shall not be applied in the construction or interpretation of this Agreement.

 (d) Except as otherwise indicated, all references in this Agreement to "Sections" and "Exhibits" are intended to refer to Sections of this Agreement and Exhibits to this Agreement. 

  

 10.16 U.S.A. Patriot Act Information. To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, federal law requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify and record information that identifies each person who opens an account. For a non-individual person such as a business entity, a charity, a trust or other legal entity the Escrow Agent will ask for documentation to verify its formation and existence as a legal entity. The Escrow Agent may also ask to see financial statements, licenses, identification and authorization documents from individuals claiming authority to represent the entity or other relevant documentation. Parent and Stockholders Agent each agree to provide all such information and documentation as to themselves as requested by Escrow Agent to ensure compliance with United States federal law.

EXHIBIT D 

   

DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEDURES  

  

 Subject to the provisions of Sections 9.3 and 10.8(c) of the Agreement: (i) until the earlier of the termination of the Escrow Agreement or the time at which the aggregate amount of the claims made by the Indemnitees pursuant to Section 9 of the Agreement exceed the Indemnification Escrow Amount (such time being referred to as the " _Offset Claim Time_ "), any claim for indemnification, compensation or reimbursement pursuant to Section 9 of the Agreement (and, at the option of any Indemnitee, any other claim for a monetary remedy, such as in the case of a claim based upon fraud, relating to the Agreement or the Merger after the Closing) shall be brought and resolved exclusively in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Escrow Agreement; and (ii) from and after the Offset Claim Time, any claim for indemnification, compensation or reimbursement pursuant to Section 9 of the Agreement (and, at the option of any Indemnitee, any other claim for a monetary remedy, such as in the case of a claim based upon fraud, relating to the Agreement or the Merger after the Closing) shall be brought and resolved exclusively as follows: 

  

 (a) If any Indemnitee has or claims in good faith to have incurred or suffered, or believes in good faith that it may incur or suffer, Damages for which it is or may be entitled to indemnification, compensation or reimbursement under Section 9 of the Agreement or for which it is or may otherwise be entitled to a monetary remedy relating to the Agreement or the Merger, such Indemnitee may deliver a claim notice (a " _Claim Notice_ ") to the Stockholders Agent. Each Claim Notice shall: (i) state that the Indemnitee believes in good faith that the Indemnitee is or may be entitled to indemnification, compensation or reimbursement under Section 9 of the Agreement or is or may otherwise be entitled to a monetary remedy relating to the Agreement or the Merger; (ii) contain a brief description of the facts and circumstances supporting the Indemnitees claim; (iii) if practicable, contain a non-binding, preliminary, good faith estimate of the amount to which the Indemnitee might be entitled (the aggregate amount of such estimate, as it may be modified by the Indemnitee in good faith from time to time, being referred to as the " _Claimed Amount_ "); and (d) state that it is a Claim Notice under the Agreement. 

   

 (b) During the 20-business day period commencing upon receipt by the Stockholders Agent of a Claim Notice from an Indemnitee (the " _Dispute Period_ "), the Stockholders Agent may deliver to the Indemnitee a written response (the " _Response Notice_ ") in which the Stockholders Agent states that it is a Response Notice under the Agreement, and: (i) agrees that the full Claimed Amount is owed to the Indemnitee; (ii) agrees that part, but not all, of the Claimed Amount is owed to the Indemnitee; or (iii) indicates that no part of the Claimed Amount is owed to the Indemnitee. If the Response Notice is delivered in accordance with clause "(ii)" or "(iii)" of the preceding sentence, the Response Notice shall also contain a brief description of the facts and circumstances supporting the Stockholders Agents claim that only a portion or no part of the Claimed Amount is owed to the Indemnitee, as the case may be (any part of the Claimed Amount that is not agreed to be owed to the Indemnitee pursuant to the Indemnitees Claim Notice being referred to as the " _Contested Amount_ "). If a Response Notice is not received by the Indemnitee from the Stockholders Agent prior to the expiration of the Dispute Period, then the Stockholders Agent shall be conclusively deemed to have agreed that an amount equal to the full Claimed Amount is owed to the Indemnitee. 

   

 (c) If the Stockholders Agent in the Response Notice agrees that the full Claimed Amount is owed to the Indemnitee, or if no Response Notice is received by the Indemnitee from the

Stockholders Agent prior to the expiration of the Dispute Period, Parent
shall be entitled, subject to Section 9.6 of the Agreement, to set off the
Claimed Amount against any unpaid Milestone Payment (or any Milestone
Holdback Amount); _provided, however_ , Parent shall only be entitled to such
set off right to the extent that the Claimed Amount exceeds the Available
Escrow Amount (as defined below) as of the date of such Milestone Payment.
The " _Available Escrow Amount_ " as of any particular date shall mean the
amount by which (i) the amount remaining in the Indemnification Escrow Fund
as of such date; _exceeds_ (ii) the sum of (A) the aggregate of all amounts
that are owed to the Indemnitees out of the Indemnification Escrow Fund, but
not paid as of such date, _plus_ (B) the aggregate of all Contested Amounts
(or Claimed Amounts if the Stockholders Agent have not delivered a Response
Notice with respect to any claim) with respect to all claims that have not
been resolved prior to such date. 

   

 (d) If the Stockholders Agent in the Response Notice agrees that part, but not all, of the Claimed Amount is owed to the Indemnitee (the " _Agreed Amount_ "), Parent shall be entitled, subject to Section 9.6 of the Agreement, to set off the Agreed Amount against any unpaid Milestone Payment (or any Milestone Holdback Amount); _provided, however_ , Parent shall only be entitled to such set off right to the extent that the Agreed Amount exceeds the Available Escrow Amount as of the date of such Milestone Payment. Such payment shall not be deemed to be made in full satisfaction of the claim described in such Claim Notice, but shall count toward the satisfaction of the claim described in such Claim Notice. 

   

 (e) If any Response Notice expressly indicates that there is a Contested Amount, the Stockholders Agent and the Indemnitee shall attempt in good faith to resolve the dispute related to the Contested Amount. If the Stockholders Agent and the Indemnitee resolve such dispute, such resolution shall be binding on the Stockholders Agent, all of the Effective Time Holders and such Indemnitee and a settlement agreement stipulating the amount owed to such Indemnitee (the " _Stipulated Amount_ ") shall be signed by such Indemnitee and the Stockholders Agent. Parent shall be entitled, subject to Section 9.6 of the Agreement, to set off the Stipulated Amount against any unpaid Milestone Payment (or any Milestone Holdback Amount); _provided, however_ , Parent shall only be entitled to such set off right to the extent that the Stipulated Amount exceeds the Available Escrow Amount as of the date of such Milestone Payment. 

   

 (f) In the event that there is a dispute relating to the performance or non-performance of Parents obligations under or satisfaction of any Milestone Event, as provided under Section 10.8(c) of the Agreement, or a dispute relating to any Claim Notice or Contested Amount (whether it is a matter between the Indemnitee, on the one hand, and the Stockholders Agent, on the other hand, or it is a matter that is subject to a claim or Legal Proceeding asserted or commenced by a third party brought against the Indemnitee or the Company in a litigation or arbitration) that the Indemnitee and the Stockholders Agent have not resolved after attempting to do so in good faith during the 60-day period following the delivery of a Response Notice to the Indemnitee, either the Indemnitee or the Stockholders Agent may submit such dispute (an " _Arbitrable Dispute_ ") to be settled by binding arbitration. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, nothing in this  _Exhibit D_ shall prevent the Indemnitee or the Stockholders Agent from seeking preliminary injunctive relief from a court of competent jurisdiction pending settlement of any Arbitrable Dispute. 

   

 (i) Except as herein specifically stated, any Arbitrable Dispute shall be resolved by arbitration in San Francisco, California in accordance with JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures (the " _JAMS Rules_ ") then in effect. However, in all events, the provisions contained herein shall govern over any conflicting rules which may now or hereafter be contained in the JAMS Rules. Any judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator shall be entered

in any court having jurisdiction over the subject matter thereof. The
arbitrator shall have the authority to grant any equitable and legal
remedies that would be available if any judicial proceeding was instituted to
resolve an Arbitrable Dispute. The final decision of the arbitrator, as
entered by a court of competent jurisdiction, will be furnished by the
arbitrator to the Stockholders Agent and the Indemnitee in writing and will
constitute a final, conclusive and non-appealable determination of the issue
in question, binding upon the Stockholders Agent, the Effective Time Holders
and the Indemnitee, and an order with respect thereto may be entered in any
court of competent jurisdiction. 

   

 (ii) Any such arbitration will be conducted before a single arbitrator who will be compensated for his or her services at a rate to be determined by the Indemnitee and the Stockholders Agent or by JAMS, but based upon reasonable hourly or daily consulting rates for the arbitrator in the event the parties are not able to agree upon his or her rate of compensation. 

  

 (iii) The arbitrator shall be mutually agreed upon by the Indemnitee and the Stockholders Agent. In the event the Indemnitee and the Stockholders Agent are unable to agree within 20 days following submission of the dispute to JAMS by one of the parties, JAMS will have the authority to select an arbitrator from a list of arbitrators who satisfy the criteria set forth in clause "(iv)" hereof. 

  

 (iv) No arbitrator shall have any past or present family, business or other relationship with the Indemnitee, the Company, the Stockholders Agent, any of the Effective Time Holders or any "affiliate" (as such term is defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the " _Securities Act_ ")), director or officer thereof, unless following full disclosure of all such relationships, the Indemnitee and the Stockholders Agent agree in writing to waive such requirement with respect to an individual in connection with any dispute. In addition, unless otherwise agreed to between the Indemnitee and the Stockholders Agent, (A) the arbitrator in any dispute related to the performance or non-performance of the parties obligations under, or the satisfaction of any Milestone Event in accordance with, Sections 1.7 and/or 1.8 shall have at least 10 years of experience in the development of cancer pharmaceuticals and interactions with Regulatory Authorities (including experience with the FDAs accelerated approval process); and (B) the arbitrator in any dispute involving a claim relating to Company IP shall be a current or former patent attorney with at least 15 years of experience; _provided, however_ , that if JAMS is not able to provide an arbitrator for such arbitration with the requisite experience set forth in each of clause "(A)" an "(B)", such arbitrator will in such event be a retired Article III Federal District Court judge. 

  

 (v) The arbitrator shall be instructed to hold an up to a three day hearing (or 30 days in the event of a dispute relating to any Company IP) regarding the disputed matter within 60 days of his designation and to render an award (without written opinion) no later than 10 days after the conclusion of such hearing (or such longer time as is permitted under JAMS Rules), in each case unless otherwise mutually agreed in writing by the Indemnitee and the Stockholders Agent. 

  

 (vi) No discovery other than an exchange of relevant documents may occur in any arbitration commenced under the provisions of this _Exhibit D_, except for any arbitration relating to Company IP. The Indemnitee and the Stockholders Agent agree to act in good faith to promptly exchange relevant documents. 

  

 (vii) The Indemnitee and the Stockholders Agent (on behalf of the Effective Time Holders as a group) will each pay 50% of the initial compensation to be paid to the arbitrator in any such arbitration and 50% of the costs of transcripts and other normal and regular expenses of the

arbitration proceedings; _provided, however,_ that: (A) the prevailing party
in any arbitration will be entitled to an award of attorneys fees and costs;
and (B) all costs of arbitration, other than those provided for above, will
be paid by the losing party, and the arbitrator will be authorized to
determine the identity of the prevailing party and the losing party. 

   

 (viii) The arbitrator chosen in accordance with these provisions will not have the power to alter, amend or otherwise affect the terms of these arbitration provisions or any other provisions contained in this _Exhibit D_ or the Agreement.

 (g) Upon resolution of the arbitration described in clause "(f)" of this _Exhibit D_, (i) Parent shall be entitled to set off the amount of the award specified in the arbitrators decision against any unpaid Milestone Payment (or any Milestone Holdback Amount) or (ii) if applicable, Parent shall, within 10 business days following the entry of the arbitrators decision by a court of competent jurisdiction, or such shorter period of time as may be set forth in the arbitrators decision, pay to the Participating Securityholders the amount of the award set forth in the arbitrators decision; _provided, however_ , Parent shall only be entitled to such set off right to the extent that the amount of the award specified in the arbitrators decision exceeds the Available Escrow Amount as of the date of such Milestone Payment.
