<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>3.2 Response Notice</B>. During the 20-business day period commencing upon receipt by the
Stockholders&#146; Agent of a Claim Notice from an Indemnitee (the &#147;<B>Dispute Period</B>&#148;), the Stockholders&#146;
Agent may deliver to the Indemnitee and to the Escrow Agent a written response (the &#147;<B>Response
Notice</B>&#148;) in which the Stockholders&#146; Agent states that it is a Response Notice under this Agreement,
and: (a)&nbsp;agree that the full Claimed Amount is owed to the Indemnitee; (b)&nbsp;agree that part, but not
all, of the Claimed Amount is owed to the Indemnitee (the &#147;<B>Agreed Amount</B>&#148;); or (c)&nbsp;indicate that no
part of the Claimed Amount is owed to the Indemnitee. If the Response Notice is delivered in
accordance with clause &#147;(b)&#148; or &#147;(c)&#148; of the preceding sentence, the Response Notice shall also
contain a brief description of the facts and circumstances supporting the Stockholders&#146; Agent&#146;s
claim that only a portion or no part of the Claimed Amount is owed to the Indemnitee, as the case
may be (any part of the Claimed Amount that is not agreed to be owed to the Indemnitee pursuant to
the Indemnitee&#146;s Claim Notice being referred to as the &#147;<B>Contested Amount</B>&#148;). If a Response Notice
is not received by the Escrow Agent from the Stockholder&#146;s Agent prior to the expiration of the
Dispute Period, then the Stockholders&#146; Agent shall be conclusively deemed to have agreed that an
amount equal to the full Claimed Amount (or if the full Claimed Amount exceeds the value of the
Indemnification Escrow Property, then all of the Indemnification Escrow Property) may be released
to the Indemnitee from the Indemnification Escrow Account.

arbitration) that the Indemnitee and the Stockholders&#146; Agent have not resolved after attempting to
do so in good faith during the 60-day period following the delivery of a Response Notice to the
Indemnitee, either the Indemnitee or the Stockholders&#146; Agent may submit such dispute (an

sentence, nothing in this Agreement shall prevent the Indemnitee from seeking preliminary
injunctive relief from a court of competent jurisdiction pending settlement of any Arbitrable

arbitration in San Francisco, California in accordance with JAMS&#146; Comprehensive Arbitration Rules

herein shall govern over any conflicting rules which may now or hereafter be contained in the JAMS
Rules. Any judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator shall be entered in any court having
jurisdiction over the subject matter thereof. The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant any
equitable and legal remedies that would be available if any judicial proceeding was instituted to
resolve an Arbitrable Dispute. The final decision of the arbitrator, as entered by a court of
competent jurisdiction, will be furnished by the arbitrator to the Stockholders&#146; Agent, Indemnitee

of the termination of the Escrow Agreement or the time at which the aggregate amount of the claims
made by the Indemnitees pursuant to Section&nbsp;9 of the Agreement exceed the Indemnification Escrow
Amount (such time being referred to as the &#147;<U>Offset Claim Time</U>&#148;), any claim for
indemnification, compensation or reimbursement pursuant to Section&nbsp;9 of the Agreement (and, at the
option of any Indemnitee, any other claim for a monetary remedy, such as in the case of a claim
based upon fraud, relating to the Agreement or the Merger after the Closing) shall be brought and
resolved exclusively in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Escrow Agreement; and (ii)
from and after the Offset Claim Time, any claim for indemnification, compensation or reimbursement
pursuant to Section&nbsp;9 of the Agreement (and, at the option of any Indemnitee, any other claim for a
monetary remedy, such as in the case of a claim based upon fraud, relating to the Agreement or the
Merger after the Closing) shall be brought and resolved exclusively as follows:

good faith that it may incur or suffer, Damages for which it is or may be entitled to
indemnification, compensation or reimbursement under Section&nbsp;9 of the Agreement or for which it is
or may otherwise be entitled to a monetary remedy relating to the Agreement or the Merger, such
Indemnitee may deliver a claim notice (a &#147;<U>Claim Notice</U>&#148;) to the Stockholders&#146; Agent. Each
Claim Notice shall: (i)&nbsp;state that the Indemnitee believes in good faith that the Indemnitee is or
may be entitled to indemnification, compensation or reimbursement under Section&nbsp;9 of the Agreement
or is or may otherwise be entitled to a monetary remedy relating to the Agreement or the Merger;
(ii)&nbsp;contain a brief description of the facts and circumstances supporting the Indemnitee&#146;s claim;
(iii)&nbsp;if practicable, contain a non-binding, preliminary, good faith estimate of the amount to
which the Indemnitee might be entitled (the aggregate amount of such estimate, as it may be
modified by the Indemnitee in good faith from time to time, being referred to as the &#147;<U>Claimed
Amount</U>&#148;); and (d)&nbsp;state that it is a Claim Notice under the Agreement.

to the Indemnitee a written response (the &#147;<U>Response Notice</U>&#148;) in which the Stockholders&#146;
Agent states that it is a Response Notice under the Agreement, and: (i)&nbsp;agrees that the full
Claimed Amount is owed to the Indemnitee; (ii)&nbsp;agrees that part, but not all, of the Claimed Amount
is owed to the Indemnitee; or (iii)&nbsp;indicates that no part of the Claimed Amount is owed to the
Indemnitee. If the Response Notice is delivered in accordance with clause &#147;(ii)&#148; or &#147;(iii)&#148; of the
preceding sentence, the Response Notice shall also contain a brief description of the facts and
circumstances supporting the Stockholders&#146; Agent&#146;s claim that only a portion or no part of the
Claimed Amount is owed to the Indemnitee, as the case may be (any part of the Claimed Amount that
is not agreed to be owed to the Indemnitee pursuant to the Indemnitee&#146;s Claim Notice being referred
to as the &#147;<U>Contested Amount</U>&#148;). If a Response Notice is not received by the Indemnitee from
the Stockholders&#146; Agent prior to the expiration of the Dispute Period, then the Stockholders&#146; Agent
shall be conclusively deemed to have agreed that an amount equal to the full Claimed Amount is owed
to the Indemnitee.
