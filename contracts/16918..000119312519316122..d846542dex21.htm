 _STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL_

E. and J. Gallo Winery 

600 Yosemite Blvd.

Modesto, CA 95354

 

Attention: Doug Vilas

Dear Doug:

 

As you know, Constellation Brands, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("CBI"), and
E. and J. Gallo Winery, a California corporation ("Gallo"), are parties to that
certain Asset Purchase Agreement (the "Original Agreement"), made and entered
into as of April 3, 2019 (the "Signing Date"), pursuant to which Gallo agreed
to purchase, and CBI agreed to sell, the Purchased Assets (the "Proposed
Transaction"). CBI and Gallo are also parties to that certain letter agreement
with the staff of the Bureau of Competition of the Federal Trade Commission
(the "FTC Staff"), dated July 29, 2019 (as amended or supplemented from time
to time, the "Timing Agreement"), pursuant to which, among other things, CBI
and Gallo agreed not to consummate the Proposed Transaction until such time
as certain conditions set forth in the Timing Agreement have been met. Gallo
and CBI have determined that it is in their mutual best interests, as
specified in the Timing Agreement, to: (a) provide a copy of the proposed
Amended and Restated Asset Purchase Agreement, attached hereto as _Exhibit_ __
_ A_ (the "Purchase Agreement"), and the forms of ancillary agreements
attached as exhibits thereto (collectively, the "Ancillary Documents") to the
FTC Staff for review and comment; and (b) subject to the terms and conditions
of this letter agreement (this "Agreement"), duly execute, make effective and
deliver the Purchase Agreement following the receipt and consideration of
comments (if any) from the FTC Staff. All capitalized terms used but not
otherwise defined herein shall have the meaning set forth in the Purchase
Agreement.

 

1. _Conditions to Execution of the Purchase Agreement_. Gallo and CBI acknowledge and agree that (a) prior to the execution of this Agreement, the FTC Staff has advised the Parties of its recommendation as to resolution of the Revised Proposed Transaction Open Issues (as defined in the Timing Agreement) (the "FTC Staffs Recommendation") and (b) the Purchase Agreement reflects the Parties good faith attempt to amend and restate the Original Agreement to, among other things, account for the FTC Staffs Recommendation. Gallo and CBI agree to provide the Purchase Agreement and the Ancillary Documents to the FTC Staff on the first Business Day after execution of this Agreement for its review and comment and to consider in good faith any comments of the FTC Staff on the Purchase Agreement and the Ancillary Documents including, without limitation, comments regarding (a) any amendments, changes, supplements, qualifications or any other modifications to the Purchase Agreement or any of the 

   

 Ancillary Documents, or (b) the entry into any new contract, agreement,
instrument or other arrangement or understanding between or by and among,
Gallo or one or more of its Affiliates, on the one hand, and CBI or one or
more of its Affiliates, on the other hand, in each case not expressly
contemplated by this Agreement, the Purchase Agreement or any of the Ancillary
Documents. Promptly, but in no event later than the fifth (5th) Business Day
following Gallos and CBIs receipt of (i) any comments from the FTC Staff on
the Purchase Agreement or the Ancillary Documents, together with oral or
written notice from the FTC Staff to both of the Parties that the FTC Staff
does not intend to provide any further comments on the Purchase Agreement or
the Ancillary Documents, or (ii) oral or written notice from the FTC Staff to
both of the Parties that the FTC Staff does not intend to provide any
comments on the Purchase Agreement or the Ancillary Documents (such date, the
"Purchase Agreement Execution Date"), Gallo and CBI irrevocably agree that
they shall execute, make effective and deliver the Purchase Agreement in the
form attached hereto as _Exhibit A_ (with the Seller Disclosure Schedules,
Other Schedules and Ancillary Documents attached thereto) with only such
additions, deletions and modifications to the Purchase Agreement and
Ancillary Documents as may be necessary to (A) complete any missing terms
contemplated thereby to be completed by Gallo and CBI, (B) correct any
scriveners errors therein and (C) account for any comments from the FTC
Staff regarding changes to the Transactions which are contemplated by or
provided for in Section 7.6 or 7.21 of the Purchase Agreement.

 

2. _Effect of Purchase Agreement_. Notwithstanding the fact that the Parties have not executed the Purchase Agreement on the date hereof, from and after the date hereof until the first to occur of (a) the Purchase Agreement Execution Date (at which time the Parties will be bound by the terms and conditions set forth in the Purchase Agreement effective as of the date of this Agreement with such additions, deletions and modifications reflected therein as contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 1_ of this Agreement effective as of the Purchase Agreement Execution Date) and (b) the Termination Date, the Parties acknowledge and agree that they shall act in all respects as if they have signed the Purchase Agreement and shall be bound by all of the terms and conditions set forth in the Purchase Agreement. 

3. _Termination of Original Agreement_. Each of the Parties hereby irrevocably terminates the Original Agreement pursuant to Section 10.1(a) thereof. For the avoidance of doubt, the Parties agree that the Original Agreement is terminated in all respects, is null and void and of no further force or effect, and the Parties have no further rights or remedies thereunder as of the date hereof. 

 

4. _Expenses_. Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement shall be paid by the Party incurring such costs and expenses. 

 

5. _Severability_. In the event that any provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of such provision to other persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as reasonably to effect the intent of the Parties. The Parties further agree to replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable provision. 

 



-2- 

    

6. _Modification and Waiver_. This Agreement may not be amended or modified in any manner, except by an instrument in writing signed by each of the Parties. No waiver by any Party of any of the provisions hereof shall be effective unless explicitly set forth in writing and signed by the Party so waiving. No waiver by any Party shall operate or be construed as a waiver in respect of any failure, breach or default not expressly identified by such written waiver, whether of a similar or different character, and whether occurring before or after that waiver. The failure of any Party to enforce at any time any of the provisions of this Agreement shall in no way be construed to be a waiver of any such provision, or in any way affect the right of such Party thereafter to enforce each and every such provision. No waiver of any breach of this Agreement shall be deemed to be a waiver of any other or subsequent breach. 

 

7. _Notices_. All notices and other communications hereunder shall be made in accordance with Section 12.5 of the Purchase Agreement. 

 

8. _Assignment_. Neither Gallo nor CBI may assign (whether by operation of law, a change of control or otherwise) any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of the other Party. No assignment shall relieve the assigning Party of any of its obligations hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective permitted successors and assigns. 

 

9. _Captions_. The captions and headings used in this Agreement have been inserted for convenience of reference only and shall not be considered part of this Agreement or be used in the interpretation thereof. 

 

10. _No Third-Party Rights_. Nothing in this Agreement is intended, nor shall be construed, to confer upon any person or entity other than Gallo and CBI (and only to the extent expressly provided herein, their respective Affiliates) any right or remedy under or by reason of this Agreement. 

 

11. _Governing Law_. 

 

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance
with, the laws of the State of California without giving effect to its
conflicts of laws provisions.

 

(b) Each of the Parties (i) irrevocably consents to the service of
the summons and complaint and any other process in any action or proceeding
relating to this Agreement in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 7_, provided
that nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 11_ shall affect the right of any Party
to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by applicable Law; (ii)
irrevocably submits itself and its properties and assets to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the trial courts of San Francisco, California or the United
States District Court for the Eastern District of California for the purpose
of any action, proceeding or counterclaim (whether based on contract, tort or
otherwise) arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the actions of the
Parties in the negotiation, administration, performance and enforcement
hereof; (iii) consents to submit itself to the personal jurisdiction of the
trial courts of San Francisco, California or the United States District Court
for the Eastern District of California for the purpose of any such action,
proceeding or counterclaim; (iv) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or
defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from
any such court; (v) waives any objection that it may now or hereafter have to
the venue of any such action, proceeding or counterclaim in any such court or
that such action, proceeding or counterclaim was brought in an inconvenient

 



-3- 

    

 court and agrees not to plead or claim the same; and (vi) agrees that it
will not bring any action, proceeding or counterclaim relating to this
Agreement in any court other than the aforesaid courts. Each Party agrees
that a final judgment in any action or proceeding in such courts as provided
above shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit
on the judgment or in any other manner provided by applicable Law. The
Parties hereby consent to and grant any such court jurisdiction over the
person of such Parties and, to the extent permitted by Law, over the subject
matter of such dispute and agree that mailing of process or other papers
in connection with any such action or proceeding in the manner provided in
_Section_ __ _ 7_ or in such other manner as may be permitted by Law shall be
valid and sufficient service thereof.

 

(c) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY
ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT
ISSUES AND, THEREFORE, EACH SUCH PARTY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES
ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LEGAL ACTION
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT SEEK TO ENFORCE THE
FOREGOING WAIVER IN THE EVENT OF A LEGAL ACTION, (II) SUCH PARTY HAS
CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (III) SUCH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER
VOLUNTARILY, AND (IV) SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT
BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS
_SECTION 11(c)_.

12. _Equitable Relief_. Each Party acknowledges and hereby agrees that any breach of this Agreement would give rise to irreparable harm for which monetary damages would not be an adequate remedy. Accordingly, the Parties acknowledge and hereby agree that in the event of any breach or threatened breach by a Party of any of its respective covenants, obligations or agreements set forth in this Agreement, the other Party shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement by the breaching Party and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement against the breaching Party, this being in addition to any other remedy to which the non-breaching Party is entitled at law or in equity, and each Party hereby waives any requirement for the posting of any bond or similar collateral in connection therewith. Each Party hereby agrees not to raise any objections to the availability of the equitable remedy of specific performance to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement by the other Party and to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants, obligations and agreements of the Parties under this Agreement. 

 

13. _Counterparts; Electronic Delivery_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all of which shall constitute one agreement. This Agreement and any signed agreement or instrument entered into in connection with this Agreement, and any amendments hereto or thereto, to the extent delivered by means of a facsimile, electronic mail or other means of electronic transmission shall be treated in all manner and respects as an original agreement or instrument and shall be considered to have the same binding legal effect as if it were the original signed version thereof delivered in person. 

 



-4- 

    

14. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement and the Purchase Agreement together constitute the entire agreement and understanding between the Parties with respect to the subject matter contained herein and therein and supersedes all prior agreements, understandings, negotiations, representations and statements, whether oral, written, implied or expressed, relating to such subject matter. In the event of a conflict between the terms of this Agreement and the Purchase Agreement, the terms of the Purchase Agreement shall control.

2.6 _Consents_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, this
Agreement shall not constitute an agreement to sell, assign, transfer, convey
or deliver any Purchased Asset or any benefit arising under or resulting from
such Purchased Asset if the sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or delivery
thereof, without the Consent of a third party, (i) would constitute a breach
or other contravention of the rights of such third party, (ii) would be
ineffective with respect to any party to a Contract concerning such Purchased
Asset, or (iii) would, upon transfer, in any way adversely affect the rights
of Buyer under such Purchased Asset. If the sale, assignment, transfer,
conveyance or delivery by any Seller Party to, or any assumption by Buyer of,
any interest in, or Liability under, any Purchased Asset requires the Consent
of a third party, then such sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance, delivery
or assumption shall be subject to such Consent being obtained. Without
limiting _Section_ __ _ 2.6(b)_, to the extent any Assumed Contract may not
be assigned to Buyer

 



24

    

 by reason of the absence of any such Consent (each, a "Restricted
Contract"), Buyer shall not be required to assume any Assumed Liabilities
arising under such Restricted Contract. Notwithstanding the failure to obtain
prior to the Closing any Consent with respect to any Restricted Contract or
any other Purchased Asset, subject to _Article IX_ , the Closing shall occur
without any adjustment to the Purchase Price on account thereof.

(b) To the extent that any Consent in respect of a Restricted Contract
or any other Purchased Asset shall not have been obtained on or before the
Closing Date, following the Closing, Seller and Buyer shall use commercially
reasonable efforts, and shall cooperate with each other, to obtain any
such required Consent or any release, substitution or amendment required to
novate all Liabilities under any and all Assumed Contracts or other
Liabilities that constitute Assumed Liabilities or to obtain in writing the
unconditional release of all parties to such arrangements, so that Buyer
shall be solely responsible for such Liabilities after the Closing Date. As
soon as a Consent for the sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance, delivery or
assumption of a Restricted Contract or other Purchased Asset is obtained,
Seller shall promptly assign, transfer, convey and deliver such Restricted
Contract or Purchased Asset to Buyer for no additional consideration.

 

(c) To the extent that any Restricted Contract or other Purchased Asset
and/or Assumed Liability cannot be transferred to Buyer following the Closing
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.6_, Buyer and Seller shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to enter into such arrangements (such as
subleasing, sublicensing or subcontracting) to provide to Buyer the economic
and, to the extent permitted under applicable Law, operational equivalent of
the transfer of such Restricted Contract or other Purchased Asset and/or
Assumed Liability to Buyer as of the Closing Date and the performance by
Buyer of its obligations with respect thereto. Buyer shall, as agent or
subcontractor for Seller or the applicable Seller Subsidiary, pay, perform and
discharge fully the Liabilities of the applicable Seller Party thereunder
from and after the Closing Date. To the extent permitted under applicable Law,
the Seller Parties shall hold in trust for and pay to Buyer promptly upon
receipt thereof such Purchased Asset and all income, proceeds and other
monies received by the Seller Parties to the extent related to such Purchased
Asset in connection with the arrangements under this _Section_ __ _ 2.6_;
_provided_ that the Seller Parties shall be permitted to set off against
such amounts all Liabilities that the Buyer is required to pay, perform or
discharge in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence and any direct
costs associated with the retention and maintenance of such Purchased Assets.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the provisions of
this  _Section_ __ _ 2.6_ shall not apply to any consent or approval
required under any Competition Law, which consent or approval shall be
governed by _Section_ __ _ 7.6_. Nothing in this  _Section_ __ _ 2.6_,
including any arrangement for Buyer to be provided with any of the benefits of
any Purchased Asset, shall constitute a waiver of Buyers rights under
_Article IX_ unless and until Buyer either provides written waivers thereof
or elects to proceed to consummate the Transactions at the Closing.

Hundred Forty-Seven Thousand Six Hundred Eighty-One Dollars ($842,947,681)
(the "Base Purchase Price"), _plus_ (b) the amount, if any, by which the
Closing Book Value of the Product Inventory or the Final Book Value of the
Product Inventory, as the case may be, exceeds the Target Closing Book Value
of the Product Inventory, _minus_ (c) the amount, if any, by which the
Closing Book Value of the Product Inventory or the Final Book Value of the
Product Inventory, as the case may be, is less than the Target Closing Book
Value of the Product Inventory, _minus_ (d) the amount of the
Accrued Depletion Allowances, _plus_ (e) the Earn-Out Payments, if any,
_plus_ (f) the US Dollar equivalent of the amount, if any, by which the Chile

Estimated CapEx Shortfall Amount or the Final CapEx Shortfall Amount, as the

3.2 _Determination of Estimated Purchase Price_.

 

(a) No later than the tenth (10th) Business Day prior to the
anticipated Closing Date (i) Seller shall prepare and deliver to Buyer written
statements setting forth Sellers best estimate of (x) the amount of the
Accrued Depletion Allowances (including reasonable supporting documentation
and calculations), as determined as of the most recent available date in
accordance with the illustrative calculation thereof set forth on _Schedule
3.2(a)(i)_ (the "Closing Accrued Depletion Allowances Statement"), and (y)
the CapEx Shortfall Amount (such amount, the "Estimated CapEx Shortfall
Amount") (the "Estimated CapEx Statement"), and (ii) representatives of
Seller and Buyer shall take a physical count and inspection of the Inventory,
other than the Bailment Inventory of Seller, in accordance with the Inventory
inspection and testing procedures attached hereto as _Schedule 3.2(a)(ii)_
(the "Testing Procedures"). Seller and Buyer shall cooperate reasonably in
connection with such physical count and inspection.

 

(b) Following such count and inspection, the Parties shall agree in
accordance with the Testing Procedures on the results thereof in a written
report (the "Agreed Inventory Report"). At the Closing, the Base Purchase
Price shall be adjusted in respect of the Accrued Depletion Allowances and the
Closing Book Value of the Product Inventory as follows:

(i) the Base Purchase Price shall be reduced by the amount of the
Accrued Depletion Allowances, as set forth in the Closing Accrued Depletion
Allowances Statement;

 

(ii) if the Closing Book Value of the Product Inventory as set forth in
the Agreed Inventory Report is less than the Target Closing Book Value of the
Product Inventory, then the Base Purchase Price shall be reduced by the amount
by which the Closing Book Value of the Product Inventory is less than the
Target Closing Book Value of the Product Inventory;

(iii) if the Closing Book Value of the Product Inventory as set forth in
the Agreed Inventory Report is greater than the Target Closing Book Value of
the Product Inventory,

 



26

    

 then the Base Purchase Price shall be increased by the amount by which the
Closing Book Value of the Product Inventory is greater than the Target Closing
Book Value of the Product Inventory; and 

(iv) if the Closing Book Value of the Product Inventory as set forth in
the Agreed Inventory Report is equal to the Target Closing Book Value of the
Product Inventory, then there shall be no adjustment to the Base Purchase
Price pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 3.2(b)_.

 

(c) If the Parties are unable to agree on the results of the physical
count and inspection prior to the Closing, then Seller shall deliver its
determination of the physical count and inspection to Buyer as soon as
reasonably possible following completion of the physical count and inspection,
but no later than at the Closing (the "Estimated Inventory Report"). For
purposes hereof, the "Estimated Closing Book Value of the Product Inventory"
means (a) the aggregate value of the Product Inventory (other than the
Bailment Inventory), (i) based on the Estimated Inventory Report, and (ii)
valued at the applicable Seller Partys costs of such Inventories by reference
to the unit cost set forth on _Schedule 1(b)_ , except as the Parties may
otherwise mutually agree, _plus_ (y) the aggregate value of the Bailment
Inventory as set forth on the Bailment Reports. At the Closing, the Base
Purchase Price shall be adjusted in respect of the Accrued Depletion
Allowances and the Closing Book Value of the Product Inventory as follows:

(i) the Base Purchase Price shall be reduced by the amount of the
Accrued Depletion Allowances, as set forth in the Closing Accrued Depletion
Allowances Statement;

 

(ii) if the Estimated Closing Book Value of the Product Inventory as set
forth in the Estimated Inventory Report is less than the Target Closing Book
Value of the Product Inventory, then the Base Purchase Price shall be reduced
by the amount by which the Estimated Closing Book Value of the Product
Inventory is less than the Target Closing Book Value of the Product
Inventory;

(iii) if the Estimated Closing Book Value of the Product Inventory as set
forth in the Estimated Inventory Report is greater than the Target Closing
Book Value of the Product Inventory, then the Base Purchase Price shall be
increased by the amount by which the Estimated Closing Book Value of the
Product Inventory is greater than the Target Closing Book Value of the Product
Inventory; and

 

(iv) if the Estimated Closing Book Value of the Product Inventory as set
forth in the Estimated Inventory Report is equal to the Target Closing Book
Value of the Product Inventory, then there shall be no adjustment to the Base
Purchase Price pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 3.2(c)_.

 

(d) The Estimated CapEx Statement shall be prepared in accordance with
the definition of "CapEx Shortfall Amount" set forth in this Agreement. Prior
to the Closing, Buyer shall be entitled to comment on and request reasonable
changes to the Estimated CapEx Statement, and Seller shall provide access to
all records and work papers, answer any questions and discuss and resolve any
issues reasonably requested and/or raised by Buyer and its Representatives, in
each case, in connection with their review of the Estimated CapEx Statement
and consider in good faith any changes Buyer proposes to the Estimated CapEx
Statement and the computation of the Estimated

 



27

    

 CapEx Shortfall Amount set forth therein. At the Closing, the Base Purchase
Price shall be reduced by the Estimated CapEx Shortfall Amount, if any. If the
Parties mutually agree on the Estimated CapEx Statement (as may be revised to
incorporate changes proposed by Buyer) and the Estimated CapEx Shortfall
Amount set forth therein, if any, then such Estimated CapEx Statement and
Estimated CapEx Shortfall Amount shall be deemed final and binding and there
shall be no further adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to _Section_ __
_ 3.3(b)_.

The Base Purchase Price, as adjusted pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.1_,
_Section_ __ _ 3.2(b)_, _Section_ __ _ 3.2(c)_ and/or _Section_ __ _
3.2(d)_, as the case may be, is referred to herein as the "Estimated Purchase
Price".

3.3 _Post-Closing Adjustment_ _s_.

(a) In the event that the Parties do not agree on the results of the
physical count and inspection and, therefore, determine the Estimated Purchase
Price based on the Estimated Inventory Report, then during the five Business
Days immediately following the Closing Date, Seller and Buyer shall seek in
good faith to resolve in writing any differences which they may have with
respect to the physical count set forth in the Estimated Inventory Report and
if such agreement has not been reached at the end of such five Business Day
period, Seller and Buyer shall identify in writing the amount in dispute and
shall immediately engage an Independent Accountant to conduct only a physical
count of the Inventory, which physical count of the Inventory shall be set
forth in a written report delivered to the Parties and shall be conclusive
and binding on the Parties and shall be enforceable in a court of law (such
report as agreed to by the Parties after the Closing or as completed by the
Independent Accountant, is referred to herein as the "Final Physical
Inventory Report"). In the event that determination of usability and
salability of the Inventory extends past the Closing Date, at such time as the
usability and salability of the Inventory is conclusively determined pursuant
to the Testing Procedures, such Inventory at the value determined shall be set
forth in a written report delivered to both Parties and shall be used, along
with the Final Physical Inventory Report, to determine the final
Inventory ("Final Inventory Report"). For purposes hereof the "Final Book
Value of the Product Inventory" means (i) the value of the Product Inventory
(other than the Bailment Inventory) (A) based upon the Final Inventory
Report, and (B) valued at the applicable Seller Partys costs of such
Inventories by reference to the unit cost set forth on _Schedule 1(b)_ ,
except as the Parties may otherwise mutually agree, plus (ii) the
aggregate value of the Bailment Inventory as set forth on the Bailment
Reports. Within two (2) Business Days of the Independent Accountants delivery
of the Final Inventory Report, the Purchase Price shall be further adjusted
and payments made, if and as applicable, as follows:

(i) if the Final Book Value of the Product Inventory as set forth in
the Final Inventory Report is greater than the Estimated Closing Book Value of
the Product Inventory as set forth in the Estimated Inventory Report, then
Buyer shall pay, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the
account or accounts of Seller designated to Buyer in writing at least one (1)
Business Day in advance of such payment, the amount by which the Final Book
Value of the Product Inventory is greater than the Estimated Closing Book
Value of the Product Inventory;

(ii) if the Final Book Value of the Product Inventory as set forth in
the Final Inventory Report is less than the Estimated Closing Book Value of
the Product Inventory as set forth in the Estimated Inventory Report, then
Seller shall pay, by wire transfer of immediately 

 



28

    

 available funds to the account or accounts of Buyer designated to Seller in
writing at least one (1) Business Day in advance of such payment, the amount
by which the Final Book Value of the Product Inventory is less than the
Estimated Closing Book Value of the Product Inventory; and

 

(iii) if the Final Book Value of the Product Inventory as set forth in
the Final Inventory Report is equal to the Estimated Closing Book Value of
the Product Inventory as set forth in the Estimated Inventory Report, then
there shall be no further adjustment to the Purchase Price and no payment
shall be made by either Party pursuant this _Section_ __ _ 3.3(a)_.

(b) In the event that the Parties do not mutually agree on the
Estimated CapEx Statement and the Estimated CapEx Shortfall Amount pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 3.2(d)_, then during the ten (10) Business Days immediately
following the Closing Date, Seller and Buyer shall seek in good faith to
resolve in writing any differences which they may have with respect to the
Estimated CapEx Shortfall Amount or the Estimated CapEx Statement and if such
agreement has not been reached at the end of such ten (10) Business Day
period, Seller and Buyer shall identify in writing the amount in dispute and
shall immediately engage an Independent Accountant to determine the CapEx
Shortfall Amount, which determination shall be set forth in a written report
delivered to the Parties and shall be conclusive and binding on the Parties
and shall be enforceable in a court of law (such report as agreed to by the
Parties after the Closing or as completed by the Independent Accountant,
is referred to herein as the "Final CapEx Statement"). For purposes hereof
the "Final CapEx Shortfall Amount" means the CapEx Shortfall Amount based upon
the Final CapEx Statement. Within two (2) Business Days of the Independent
Accountants delivery of the Final CapEx Statement, the Purchase Price shall
be further adjusted and payments made, if and as applicable, as follows:

 

(i) if the Final CapEx Shortfall Amount as set forth in the Final
CapEx Statement is less than the Estimated CapEx Shortfall Amount as set
forth in the Estimated CapEx Statement, then Buyer shall pay, by wire transfer
of immediately available funds to the account or accounts of Seller designated
to Buyer in writing at least one (1) Business Day in advance of such payment,
the amount by which the Final CapEx Shortfall Amount is less than Estimated
CapEx Shortfall Amount;

 

(ii) if the Final CapEx Shortfall Amount as set forth in the Final

transfer of immediately available funds to the account or accounts of Buyer
designated to Seller in writing at least one (1) Business Day in advance of

(iii) if the Final CapEx Shortfall Amount as set forth in the
Final CapEx Statement is equal to the Estimated CapEx Shortfall Amount as set

adjustment to the Purchase Price and no payment shall be made by either Party

29

    

(c) The fees and expenses of the Independent Accountant engaged
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 3.3_, if any, shall be allocated between
Seller, on one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand, based on the percentage
which the portion of the amount contested by a Party that is not awarded to
that Party bears to the total amount actually contested by such Party.

 

(d) Any payments made pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 3.3_ shall be
treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price by the Parties for Tax
purposes, unless otherwise required by Law.

 

3.4 _Earn-Out Payments_.

 

(a) _General_. On the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth herein, Seller shall be eligible to receive from Buyer, as contingent
consideration for the Purchased Assets, (i) a first payment (the "First Earn-
Out Payment") based on the Depletion Volume during the twelve (12) month
period beginning on the first day of the next calendar month following the
Closing Date (the "First Earn-Out Period"), and (ii) a second payment (the
"Second Earn-Out Payment" and, together with the First Earn-Out Payment, the
"Earn-Out Payments") based on the Depletion Volume during the twelve (12)
month period beginning on the first day of the next calendar month following
the First Earn-Out Period (the "Second Earn-Out Period" and, together with the
First Earn-Out Period, the "Earn-Out Periods"), in each case, subject to the
terms and conditions set forth in _Schedule 3.4(a)_ , including Sections 3 and
4 thereof. The Earn-Out Payments shall be calculated as set forth on _Schedule
3.4(a)_ (such resulting amounts, the "Earn-Out Amounts"). The aggregate
amount of the Earn-Out Amounts (if any) paid by Buyer to Seller shall not
exceed Two Hundred Fifty Million Dollars ($250,000,000).

 

(b) _Earn-Out Statement_. As promptly as reasonably practicable, but
in no event later than sixty (60) days, following the end of each Earn-Out
Period, Buyer shall prepare and deliver to Seller a statement setting forth
the Depletion Volume for such Earn-Out Period and Buyers calculation of the
Earn-Out Amount for such Earn-Out Period, if any, due and payable to Seller,
together with reasonable supporting documentation (the "Earn-Out Statement").
Seller shall have thirty (30) days following the delivery of the Earn-Out
Statement (the "Earn-Out Review Period") to review the Earn-Out Statement. If
Seller disagrees with any item on the Earn-Out Statement, then Seller shall
deliver to Buyer, prior to the expiration of the Earn-Out Review Period, a
written statement setting forth Sellers specific objections, if any, to the
Earn-Out Statement and Sellers calculation of the Earn-Out Amount for such
Earn-Out Period, together with a summary of the reasons therefor and
calculations which, in the view of Seller, are necessary to eliminate such
objections (a "Notice of Earn-Out Dispute"). Seller shall be deemed to have
irrevocably agreed with each item and amount set forth on the Earn-Out
Statement that is not disputed in the Notice of Earn-Out Dispute. If
Seller fails to deliver a Notice of Earn-Out Dispute prior to the expiration
of the Earn-Out Review Period, then the Earn-Out Statement as delivered by
Buyer (and all items and amounts therein) shall be final and binding on the
Parties. If Seller delivers to Buyer a Notice of Earn-Out Dispute prior to the
expiration of the Earn-Out Review Period, Seller and Buyer shall seek in good
faith to resolve in writing any differences they may have with respect to the
disputed matters as promptly as reasonably practicable. If Buyer and
Seller are unable to resolve all disputed matters set forth in the Notice of
Earn-Out Dispute within thirty (30) days after delivery thereof to Buyer then,
within seven (7) Business Days after the end of such thirty (30) day period,
Seller and Buyer shall engage an Independent Accountant and shall submit to
the Independent Accountant the disputed

 



30

    

 matters that remain unresolved (the "Disputed Items"), together with any
supporting documentation and calculations as either Buyer or Seller may choose
to submit, for final binding written resolution. The Independent Accountant
shall act as an accounting expert and not as an arbitrator, and shall issue a
final and binding resolution with respect to all Disputed Items in a manner
consistent with this Agreement. Buyer and Seller shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the Independent Accountant to issue its written
determination as to such Disputed Items within twenty (20) Business Days after
such Disputed Items have been so submitted to the Independent Accountant. Any
determination by the Independent Accountant within the scope of the
Independent Accountants authority hereunder as to the resolution of all such
Disputed Items shall be conclusive and binding among the Parties and shall be
enforceable in a court of law. The Independent Accountant shall consider only
those items and amounts in Buyers and Sellers respective calculations of the
Earn-Out Amount for such Earn-Out Period which are identified as Disputed
Items. The scope of the disputes to be resolved by the Independent Accountant
shall be limited to correcting mathematical errors and determining whether the
Disputed Items were determined in a manner consistent with this Agreement,
_Section_ __ _ 3.4(a)_ and _Schedule 3.4(a)_ , and the Independent Accountant
shall not make any other determination. The Independent
Accountants determination of the Disputed Items shall be based solely on
written materials submitted by the Parties ( _i.e._ , not on an independent
review). The fees and expenses of the Independent Accountant engaged pursuant
to this  _Section_ __ _ 3.4(b)_, if any, shall be allocated between Seller,
on one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand, based on the percentage which the
portion of the amount contested by a Party that is not awarded to that Party
bears to the total amount actually contested by such Party.

(c) _Payment_. Within five (5) Business Days after the date on which
agreement in respect of each Earn-Out Payment is reached or a determination is
made by the Independent Accountant, in each case, in accordance with 
_Section_ __ _ 3.4(b)_, Buyer shall make the applicable Earn-Out Payment, if
any, for the applicable Earn-Out Period by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the account or accounts of Seller designated
to Buyer in writing by Seller at least one (1) Business Day in advance of such
payment.

 

(d) _Cooperation_. The Parties agree that they shall, and shall
cause their respective Affiliates and Representatives to, (i) cooperate in
good faith with and assist in the other Partys review of the Earn-Out
Statement, (ii) make available to the other Party, its Representatives and
the Independent Accountant, upon reasonable advance notice and during normal
business hours, all books, records and work papers related to the preparation
of the Earn-Out Statement that are reasonably requested by the other Party,
its Representatives or the Independent Accountant in connection with their
review of the Earn-Out Statement and (iii) make reasonably available to the
other Party, its Representatives or the Independent Accountant, upon
reasonable advance notice and during normal business hours, all of its
Representatives responsible for the preparation of the Earn-Out Statement in
order to fully respond to any questions of the other Party, its
Representatives and the Independent Accountant.

 

(e) _Post-Closing Operation of the Business_. Buyer hereby covenants
and agrees that, for the duration of the Earn-Out Periods, Buyer will act in
good faith towards Seller with respect to Sellers interests under this
_Section_ __ _ 3.4_ and shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to,
take any action, or omit to take any action, with the intent of avoiding or
reducing payment of the Earn-Out Amounts hereunder (it being understood that
any action taken, or omitted to be taken, by Buyer or

 



31

    

 any of its Affiliates for any commercially reasonable business purpose that
has such effect shall not violate this _Section_ __ _ 3.4(e)_); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that nothing contained in this _Section_ __ _ 3.4_ shall
restrict Buyers right to manage and control its and its Subsidiaries
business, assets, operations or activities (including, after the Closing Date,
the Business, the Purchased Assets and the Assumed Liabilities) in any
respect and in its sole discretion. Seller acknowledges that (i) neither Buyer
nor any of its Subsidiaries has any obligation to operate its business,
assets, operations or activities (including, after the Closing Date, the
Business, the Purchased Assets and the Assumed Liabilities) in order to
maximize the Earn-Out Payments during the Earn-Out Periods, (ii) there is no
assurance that Seller will receive any Earn-Out Payments and Buyer has not
promised or projected any Earn-Out Payments will be made and (iii) the
Parties solely intend the express provisions of this Agreement to govern their
contractual relationship.

 

3.5 _Allocation of Purchase Price_.

 

During the Pre-Closing Period and after the Closing, as necessary, the Parties
will work cooperatively to select and to jointly engage the Qualified
Appraiser and will work together cooperatively to direct the Qualified
Appraiser in obtaining valuations of the Brands, the Business and the other
Purchased Assets, together with the assets purchased in any related
transactions for purposes of Section 1060 of the Code, if any. Upon completion
of such valuation, the Qualified Appraiser shall deliver to each of the
Parties (a) a copy of their appraisal report (the "Appraisal Report"), and
(b) a schedule allocating the Purchase Price (including any Assumed
Liabilities treated as consideration for the Purchased Assets for Tax
purposes) based on the valuations of the Brands, the Business, the other
Purchased Assets and any assets purchased in any related transactions (as set
forth in the Appraisal Report) and prepared in accordance with Section 1060 of
the Code (the "Allocation Schedule"). The Parties shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the Qualified Appraiser to deliver the Appraisal
Report and the Allocation Schedule to the Parties within ninety (90) days
after the Closing Date. The Allocation Schedule shall be deemed final
unless either Party notifies the other Party in writing that such Party
objects to one or more items reflected in the Allocation Schedule within
thirty (30) days after delivery of the Allocation Schedule to the Parties (the
"Objection Period"). In the event of any such objection, Seller and Buyer
shall negotiate in good faith to resolve such dispute; _provided_ , _however_
, that if Seller and Buyer are unable to resolve any dispute with respect to
the Allocation Schedule within thirty (30) days of the end of the Objection
Period (the "Allocation Negotiation Period"), such dispute shall be finally
resolved by the Independent Accountant. The fees and expenses of the Qualified
Appraiser and the Independent Accountant shall be borne equally by Seller and
Buyer. Seller shall deliver to Buyer an IRS Form 8594 prepared in accordance
with the Allocation Schedule within thirty (30) days of the end of the
Objection Period or the Allocation Negotiation Period, as the case may be,
which IRS Form 8594 shall be subject to Buyers approval, not to be
unreasonably withheld (and provided that Buyer shall have been deemed to have
approved such IRS Form 8594 as prepared by Seller if Buyer fails to deliver a
written objection thereto to Seller within thirty (30) days of receipt
thereof). Seller and Buyer agree to file such IRS Form 8594, as prepared by
Seller and approved (or deemed to have been approved) by Buyer, and to file
all federal, state and local Tax Returns in accordance with the Allocation
Schedule, _provided_ that nothing contained herein shall prevent Buyer or
Seller from settling any proposed deficiency or adjustment by any
Tax authority based upon or arising out of the Allocation Schedule, and
neither Buyer nor Seller shall be required to litigate before any court any
proposed deficiency or adjustment by any Tax authority challenging such
Allocation Schedule. If 

 



32

    

 any payment is treated as an adjustment of the Purchase Price, the
Allocation Schedule shall be adjusted in a manner consistent with the
foregoing provisions of this  _Section_ __ _ 3.5_. If Seller or Buyer is
required to file a Tax Return concerning the Allocation Schedule before the
Independent Accountant has resolved any disputed items (taking into account
valid extensions of time within which to file, which shall be sought to the
extent necessary to permit the resolution of disputed items), such disputed
items shall be reflected on such Tax Return based on the Allocation Schedule
prepared by the Qualified Appraiser, and shall be amended if necessary to
reflect the determination of the Independent Accountant with respect to the
disputed items.

ARTICLE V

 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SELLER.

 

Except (a) as set forth in Sellers disclosure schedules attached hereto
(collectively, the "Seller Disclosure Schedules"), or (b) to the extent
relating solely to the Excluded Assets or the Excluded Liabilities, Seller
hereby represents and warrants to Buyer, as of the date hereof and as of the
Closing Date (or, as to those representations and warranties that address
matters as of particular dates, as of such dates), as follows:

 

5.1 _Organization and Qualification_.

 

(a) Seller is a corporation duly organized and validly existing under
the laws of the State of Delaware. Seller has all requisite corporate power
and authority to own, operate and

 



38

    

 lease its properties and assets constituting Purchased Assets, its
properties related to the operation of the Business and to carry on its
portion of the Business as currently conducted. Seller is duly qualified to
do business and is in good standing in the states required due to the
operation of its portion of the Business, except where the failure to be so
qualified or in good standing has not had, or would not be reasonably be
expected to have, a Business Material Adverse Effect.

(b) _Schedule 5.1(b)_  lists each Seller Subsidiary (other than
Constellation Brands Chile), the state or other jurisdiction of its formation
or organization and whether it is a corporation, limited liability company or
other business entity. Each Seller Subsidiary is, directly or indirectly,
wholly-owned by Seller. Each of the Seller Subsidiaries has all requisite
corporate, limited liability company or other business entity power, as
applicable, and authority to own, operate and lease its properties and
assets constituting Purchased Assets, its properties related to the operation
of the Business and to carry on its portion of the Business as currently
conducted. Each Seller Subsidiary is duly qualified to do business, and, to
the extent such concept is applicable, is in good standing in the states
required due to the operation of its portion of the Business, except where the
failure to be so qualified or in good standing has not had, or would not be
reasonably be expected to have, a Business Material Adverse Effect.

(c) Constellation Brands Chile is a company duly organized and validly
existing under the laws of Chile and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of
Constellation International Holdings Limited. Constellation Brands Chile has
all requisite corporate power and authority to own, operate and lease
its properties and assets and to carry on its business as currently
conducted. Constellation Brands Chile is duly qualified to do business and, to
the extent such concept is applicable, is in good standing in the
jurisdictions required due to the operation of its business, except where the
failure to be so qualified or in good standing has not had, or would not be
reasonably be expected to have, a Business Material Adverse Effect. The Seller
Parties have provided to Buyer true, complete and correct copies of the
organizational documents of Constellation Brands Chile.

 

5.2 _Corporate Authority; Binding Effect_.

 

(a) Seller has full corporate power and authority to execute and
deliver this Agreement and each of the Transaction Documents to which it is a
party, and to perform its obligations hereunder and thereunder. The execution,
delivery and performance by Seller of this Agreement and each of the
Transaction Documents to which it is a party has been duly and validly
authorized by all necessary corporate action and no additional corporate or
shareholder authorization or consent is required in connection with the
execution, delivery and performance by Seller of this Agreement or any of the
Transaction Documents to which it is a party. This Agreement has been duly
executed and delivered by Seller, and (assuming due authorization, execution
and delivery by Buyer) this Agreement constitutes a legal, valid and
binding obligation of Buyer, enforceable against Buyer in accordance with its
terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar Laws affecting
creditors rights generally and general principles of equity (regardless of
whether considered in a proceeding at law or in equity) ("Enforceability
Limitations"). When each other Transaction Document to which Seller is or will
be a party has been duly executed and delivered by Buyer (assuming due
authorization, execution and delivery by each other party thereto), such
Transaction Document will

 



39

    

 constitute a legal and binding obligation of Seller enforceable against it
in accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by
Enforceability Limitations.

 

(b) Each Seller Subsidiary has, or prior to the Closing will have,
full corporate, limited liability company or other business entity power and
authority, as applicable, to execute and deliver each of the Transaction
Documents to which it is a party and to perform its obligations thereunder.
The execution, delivery and performance by each Seller Subsidiary of each of
the Transaction Documents to which it is a party has been, or prior to the

provided in this Agreement, (ii) set forth on _Schedule 7.1(a)-1_ or (iii)
required by any Law or Order applicable to Seller, the Purchased Assets or
operation of the Business, Seller shall, and shall cause the
Seller Subsidiaries to (A) perform in all material respects those activities
set forth on (and in accordance with the timeframes described in) _Schedule

Business in the Ordinary Course in all material respects, including with
respect to maintaining and preserving the Purchased Assets (including
distribution and promotion of the Brands consistent in all material respects
with the Ordinary Course, maintaining inventory levels for the Brands that
are normal for the time of year (taking into account product sales during the
twelve (12) month period preceding the Original Agreement Date), maintaining
consistent pricing for the products sold under the Brands and foregoing any
exceptional promotional or clearance activities) and relationships with
customers, suppliers and others having material business dealings with the
Business. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parties agree that, at or prior
to the Closing, Seller may cause Constellation Brands Chile to distribute to
Seller or its Affiliates any cash in excess of Chile 30 Day Operating Amount,
and Seller shall (x) terminate, effective as of and conditioned upon the

take such actions as are necessary to pay off, forgive or otherwise cancel
all intercompany accounts payable or accounts receivable between Constellation
Brands Chile, on the one hand, and Seller or any of its Affiliates, on the
other hand. During the Pre-Closing Period, Seller and the Seller Subsidiaries
shall use commercially reasonable efforts consistent with past practice to
protect, enforce, maintain and avoid abandonment of or damage to the Business
Intellectual Property. For the avoidance of doubt, in the event that Buyers
contact with any Distributor, vendor, supplier or customer of the Business
affects the Seller Parties ability to operate

 



58

    

 the Business in compliance with this _Section_ __ _ 7.1(a)_, such deviation
shall not be deemed to be a breach of the obligations set forth in this 
_Section_ __ _ 7.1(a)_.

(b) During the Pre-Closing Period, neither Seller nor any of the Seller
Subsidiaries (nor any third party acting at Sellers or any Seller
Subsidiarys direction or with their consent) shall: (i) transfer, assign
or grant any license or sublicense (other than non-exclusive licenses or
sublicenses granted in the ordinary course of business) of any rights under or
with respect to, or any encumbrance upon, any of the Business Intellectual
Property or allow the abandonment or lapse of any right relating to the
Business Intellectual Property; (ii) create, assume or permit to exist any new

Purchased Assets, sell, lease, license or otherwise transfer any of the
Purchased Assets, or cancel any of their rights or claims, other than in the
ordinary course of business for fair and adequate consideration; or (iv) grant
to any third party, or otherwise allow any third party to acquire, any license
(other than non-exclusive licenses or sublicenses granted in the ordinary
course of business), right, title or interest in or to any of the Business
Intellectual Property.

 

(c) The Parties acknowledge that Buyer intends to establish new
trade names/fictitious business names referencing the Brands and the

the Closing. Seller covenants and agrees that, promptly upon Buyers request
at any time following the Closing Date, the Seller Parties will amend their
respective organizational documents and all public records as necessary to
change their entity names to new names unrelated to the Brands, the trademarks
included in the Business Intellectual Property and all other trade names,
service marks, brand names and other designations of origin included in the
Business Intellectual Property.

 

(d) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Buyer, directly
or indirectly, the right to control or direct the Business prior to the
Closing. Prior to the Closing, Seller shall exercise, consistent with the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over
the Business.

 

7.2 _Access to Purchased Assets_.

 

(a) During the Pre-Closing Period, Seller shall, and shall cause the
Seller Subsidiaries to, (i) continue to provide Buyer and its Representatives
with all documents, materials and information reasonably requested by Buyer
and reasonable access to the Purchased Assets in order for Buyer to confirm
the satisfaction of the Closing conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _
9.2(a)_ and (ii) provide any potential third party buyer of Divested Assets
and Liabilities with all documents, materials and information reasonably
requested by such third party buyer and reasonable access to the applicable
Divested Assets and Liabilities in connection with such third party buyers
due diligence review of the applicable Divested Assets and Liabilities;
_provided_ , that such potential third party buyer has entered into a
confidentiality agreement with Seller, in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to Seller. To the extent not already provided to Buyer within
ten (10) Business Days prior to the date hereof, Seller will during the Pre-
Closing Period, at Buyers option, either (i) deliver three (3) 750ml samples
of each item of bulk or bottled Product Inventory to Buyer or (ii) provide an
opportunity for Buyer to obtain samples of any items of bulk Product Inventory
directly

 



59

    

 from the applicable tanks. All access pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
7.2(a)_ shall be (A) conducted during normal business hours upon reasonable
advance notice to the Seller Parties, (B) conducted in such a manner as not
to interfere unreasonably with the normal operations of the Business or any

or the potential third party buyer of Divested Assets and Liabilities, as
applicable, and the Seller Parties shall have the right to have one or more of
their Representatives present at all times during any access contemplated by
this _Section_ __ _ 7.2(a)_. Such access for Buyer and its Representatives
during the Pre-Closing Period shall include granting Buyer and
Buyers Representatives a right of entry on the Real Property to perform such
non-destructive and non-intrusive soil, engineering and geological tests and
other physical inspections and to make such other examinations, reviews or
reports as Buyer shall reasonably deem appropriate. Notwithstanding anything
in this Agreement to the contrary, during the Pre-Closing Period, the Seller
Parties shall not be required to provide access to or disclose information
where such access or disclosure would, in the Seller Parties reasonable
judgment, (1) jeopardize the attorney-client privilege or other immunity
or protection from disclosure of any Seller Party, (2) conflict with any (x)
Law (including any Law relating to data protection or privacy) or Order
applicable to any Seller Party, the Purchased Assets or operation of the
Business, (y) Contract to which any Seller Party is party or by which any of
the Purchased Assets or other assets or properties of any Seller Party are
bound or (z) other obligation of confidentiality, or (3) result in the
disclosure of competitively sensitive information; _provided_ , that if any
information is withheld pursuant to this sentence, the applicable Seller Party
will (x) inform Buyer or the potential third party buyer of Divested Assets
and Liabilities, as applicable, as to the general nature of what is being
withheld and (y) use its commercially reasonable efforts (1) to accommodate
any request from Buyer or the potential third party buyer of Divested Assets
and Liabilities, as applicable, for information pursuant to this _Section_ __
_ 7.2_ in a manner that does not result in such a violation or waiver or
disclosure of competitively sensitive information or (2) to the extent
applicable, to obtain the required consent of the relevant third Person to
permit such access or disclosure. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, during the Pre-Closing Period, Buyer and its Affiliates and
Representatives shall be permitted to (I) contact any Distributor solely
regarding the distribution of Products following the Closing; _provided_ ,
that (A) Buyer is only permitted to discuss the distribution of Products
following the Closing, and (B) Buyer shall not discuss with any such
Distributor any anti-competitive information, any details of the Transaction
that would be deemed material and that are not otherwise publicly disclosed,
including the status of any regulatory approvals, or any confidential
information concerning any existing contractual relationship between any of
the Seller Parties and any such Distributor, and (II) with the prior written
consent of Seller (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), contact any other vendor, supplier or customer of the Business
regarding the business or operation of the Business by Buyer following the
Closing, in order to, and the Parties shall work collaboratively in good faith
to, ensure the smooth transition of the production and distribution of the
Products in connection with the consummation of the Transactions; _provided_
that any such contact by Buyer or its Affiliates or Representatives with any
such vendor, supplier, Distributor or customer of the Business shall be
conducted in a manner that shall not cause any material disruption to the
Seller Parties operation of the Business during the Pre-Closing Period or
the operation of the Seller Parties or their Affiliates respective businesses
other than the Business prior to the Closing.

(b) Any information obtained by Buyer or its Representatives pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 7.2(a)_ shall be deemed to be "Confidential Information"
for the purposes of the Transaction Non-Disclosure Agreement and shall be
subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Transaction Non-
Disclosure Agreement, including limitations on disclosure and use.

 

(c) With respect to the Owned Real Property, during the Pre-Closing
Period, Buyer shall have the right to approve any exceptions to title that are
not Permitted Encumbrances and which could materially adversely affect the
ownership or value of the Owned Real Property of the use of the Owned Real
Property as used as of the date of this Agreement, which approval by Buyer
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; _provided_
_however_ , that Buyer shall have no right to approve any exception to title
that is not a Permitted Encumbrance if the Title Company has agreed to remove
or insure over such exception as part of the Owned Real Property Title
Policies. However, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
Seller shall remove and the Owned Real Property Title Policies issued at the
Closing shall not include as an exception, any mortgages, deeds of trust or
other such readily ascertainable monetary liens against any parcel of Owned
Real Property resulting from the voluntary acts or omissions of a Seller
Party.

(d) Seller agrees, at no cost to Buyer, to promptly resolve the
matters set forth in exception number 39 (the "Clos du Bois Subdivision Map
Act Exception") in the Title Report for the Owned Real Property commonly known
as Clos du Bois ("Clos du Bois Property"), Title No. FSNX-TO1900207S-CC,
dated July 29, 2019 ("Clos du Bois Title Report"). The Clos du Bois
Subdivision Map Act Exception concerns the Boundary Line and Mutual Easement
Agreement dated September 10, 1990 and referenced in exception number 25 in
the Clos du Bois Title Report (the "Boundary Line Agreement"), and such
resolution shall include causing the Title Company to remove the Clos du Bois
Subdivision Map Act Exception either by (i) recording a lot line adjustment in
Sonoma County matching the Boundary Line Agreement, (ii) obtaining a
certificate of compliance or other evidence from Sonoma County
indicating that the Boundary Line Agreement is in compliance with the
California Subdivision Map Act or (iii) causing the Title Company to issue
affirmative coverage (in Buyers Owned Real Property Title Policy for the Clos
du Bois Property or through an endorsement to Buyers Owned Real Property
Title Policy for the Clos du Bois Property) that the Clos du Bois Property as
described in the Boundary Line Agreement is in compliance with the California
Subdivision Map Act. Seller agrees to pay all surveyor fees, attorneys fees,
costs of endorsements and any and all other costs to effectuate a lot line
adjustment, in each case to the extent required to comply with this _Section_
__ _ 7.2(d)_. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary set
forth herein, Sellers obligation to resolve the Clos du Bois Subdivision Map
Act Exception shall survive the Closing Date and shall not be a condition to
the Closing for the benefit of Buyer or Seller, and failure to resolve the
Clos du Bois Subdivision Map Act Exception prior to the Closing or otherwise
shall not allow Buyer or Seller to terminate this Agreement; _provided_ that,
in the event the Title Company has not removed or affirmatively insured over
the Clos du Bois Subdivision Map Act Exception by the Closing Date, then
Seller shall, or shall cause it Affiliates to, lease the Clos du Bois Property
to Buyer for an aggregate lease payment of One Dollar ($1) (and Seller will
pay for any transfer taxes required to be paid by Sonoma County with respect
to entering into such lease) for the term of such lease, pursuant to a
mutually agreeable form of lease agreement (the "Clos du Bois Lease") to be
entered into and delivered at the Closing, and which shall include customary
terms for a lease of this nature, including, without limitation, an indemnity
from Buyer with respect to any Release of Hazardous Material at the Clos du
Bois Property during the term of

 



61

    

 the Clos du Bois Lease or any mechanics liens filed against the Clos du Bois
Property during the term of the Clos du Bois Lease and the right of Buyer to
assign and/or sublease the Clos du Bois Lease, in each case, in whole or in
part and in Buyers sole discretion. The term of the Clos du Bois Lease shall
commence at Closing and expire on the earlier of (a) the date which is 99
years following the Closing; and (b) the date a Grant Deed is recorded in
Sonoma County transferring title to the Clos du Bois Property (as such legal
description of the Clos du Bois Property may be altered by a lot line
adjustment to match the Boundary Line Agreement or as otherwise approved by
Buyer in its sole discretion) to Buyer following Sellers resolution of the
Clos du Bois Subdivision Map Act Exception as described in this _Section_ __ _
7.2(d)_. During the term of the Clos du Bois Lease, Seller shall use its best
efforts to resolve the Clos du Bois Subdivision Map Act Exception as described
in this _Section_ __ _ 7.2(d)_ as soon as reasonably possible and promptly
thereafter transfer title to the Clos du Bois Property to
Buyer. Additionally, during the term of the Clos du Bois Lease Buyer will pay
for all property taxes, utilities, and other operating costs associated with
the Clos du Bois Property, and Buyer will have full use and enjoyment of the
Clos du Bois Property, subject to reasonable access by Seller and its
consultants to the Clos du Bois Property as may be necessary to resolve the
Clos du Bois Subdivision Map Act Exception.

 

(e) If, by the fifth (5th) anniversary of the Closing Date, subject to
extension during the period of any ongoing Force Majeure Event which affects
the ability of Seller to resolve the Clos du Bois Subdivision Map
Act Exception as described in _Section_ __ _ 7.2(d)_, Seller has not
resolved the Clos du Bois Subdivision Map Act Exception as described in
_Section_ __ _ 7.2(d)_ and transferred title to the Clos du Bois Property
to Buyer, then Buyer shall have the right, at its option and in its sole
discretion, to terminate the Clos du Bois Lease by written notice delivered to
Seller within five (5) years after the fifth (5th) anniversary of the Closing
Date (the "Clos du Bois Lease Termination Right"); _provided_ , that in the
event that Seller resolves the Clos du Bois Subdivision Map Act Exception as
described in _Section_ __ _ 7.2(d)_ at any time after the fifth (5th)
anniversary of the Closing Date but prior to Buyers exercise of the Clos du
Bois Termination Right, the Clos du Bois Termination Right shall immediately
expire and be of no further effect upon the effectiveness of such resolution
and Seller shall transfer title to the Clos du Bois Property (as such legal
description of the Clos du Bois Property may be altered by a lot line
adjustment to match the Boundary Line Agreement or as otherwise approved by
Buyer in its sole discretion) to Buyer as promptly as reasonably practicable.
Upon Buyers exercise of the Clos du Bois Lease Termination Right, Seller and
Buyer shall promptly engage an Independent Accountant to conduct an appraisal
of the then-current fair market value of the Clos du Bois Property (the "Clos
du Bois FMV"), which appraisal shall not take into account any impact on
value from the propertys non-compliance with the California Subdivision Map
Act. Such appraisal by the Independent Accountant (the "Clos du
Bois Appraisal") shall be set forth in a written report delivered to the
Parties within ninety (90) days of the termination of the Clos du Bois Lease
and shall be conclusive and binding on the Parties. Within thirty (30) days
after the Independent Accountants delivery of the Clos du Bois Appraisal,
Seller shall pay to Buyer by wire transfer of immediately available funds the
amount of the Clos du Bois FMV as established by the Clos du Bois Appraisal.

 

7.3 _Notification of Certain Matters_.

 

(a) During the Pre-Closing Period, each Party shall give prompt notice
to the other Party of (i) any fact, event or circumstance known to such Party
that individually or taken together

 



62

    

 with all other facts, events and circumstances known to such Party, has had,
or would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Business Material Adverse Effect (with respect to Seller) or a Buyer Material
Adverse Effect (with respect to Buyer), as the case may be, or would cause or
constitute a breach of any of such Partys representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements contained herein, (ii) the failure of any condition
precedent to such other Partys obligations hereunder or any occurrence which,
to the Knowledge of Seller or the Knowledge of Buyer, as applicable, is
reasonably likely to result in any of the conditions set forth in  _Article
IX_ becoming incapable of being satisfied, (iii) any written notice or other
written communication received by such Party from any third party alleging
that the consent of such third party is or may be required in connection
with the consummation of the Transactions, (iv) any written notice or other
written communication from any Governmental Body received by such Party
regarding the consummation of the Transactions, or (v) the commencement of any
Legal Proceeding against such Party that, if pending on the date of this
Agreement, would have been required to have been disclosed pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 5.14_ (with respect to Seller) or _Section_ __ _ 6.6_ (with
respect to Buyer), as the case may be; _provided_ , _however_ , that (A) the
delivery of any notice pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 7.3(a)_ shall not
limit or otherwise affect any remedies available to the other Party, and (B)
disclosure by Seller shall not be deemed to amend or supplement the Seller
Disclosure Schedule or prevent or cure any misrepresentation, breach of
warranty or breach of covenant.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, neither
Partys failure to give notice of any occurrence as required pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 7.3(a)_ shall be (i) deemed to be a breach of the covenant
contained in _Section_ __ _ 7.3(a)_, but instead shall (if applicable)
constitute only a breach of the applicable underlying representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement, or (ii) taken into account in determining
whether the conditions to Closing set forth in _Article IX_ have been
satisfied. 

7.4 _Efforts to Consummate_.

 

(a) Subject to _Section_ __ _ 7.5_ and  _Section_ __ _ 7.6_, during
the Pre-Closing Period, each of Buyer and Seller shall, and Seller shall cause
the Seller Subsidiaries to, use commercially reasonable efforts (unless,
with respect to any action, another standard of performance is expressly
provided for herein) to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or
cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and
make effective the Transactions as promptly as practicable, including
satisfaction (but not waiver) of the conditions to the Closing set forth in
_Article IX_.

 

(b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Buyer and Seller
shall cooperate and use reasonable efforts to obtain the release of the
guarantees pertaining to the Purchased Assets set forth on _Schedule 7.4(b)_
(collectively, the "Seller Party Guarantees"), including the provision by
Buyer of a replacement guarantee (in form and substance reasonably acceptable
to Buyer) in favor of the beneficiary of any such Seller Party Guarantee in
order to obtain the release of the applicable Seller Party from such Seller
Party Guarantee.

 

7.5 _Consents_.

 

During the Pre-Closing Period, except as otherwise provided in  _Section_ __
_ 2.6_, each of Buyer and Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
give all notices to, and obtain all Consents (which may be conditioned on the
consummation of the Transactions) from, all Persons required 

 



63

    

 pursuant to any Assumed Contract; _provided_ , _however_ , that Seller and
its Affiliates shall not have any obligation to (a) amend or modify any
Contract, (b) pay any consideration to any Person for the purpose of
obtaining any such Consent, (c) relinquish or forbear any rights, or agree to
any restriction on the conduct of any business or operations or the ownership
or exercise of any assets, properties or rights, or (d) pay any costs or
expenses of any Person resulting from the process of obtaining such Consent.

 

7.6 _Governmental Approvals; Regulatory Filings_.

 

(a) Each of the Parties will use reasonable best efforts (unless, with
respect to any action, another standard of performance is expressly provided
for herein) to, and the Parties shall work collaboratively to, take, or cause
to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law to consummate and make
effective in the most expeditious manner possible the Transactions, including,
to the extent not completed as of the date hereof, (i) the preparation and
filing of all forms, registrations and notices required to be filed to
consummate the Transactions, (ii) taking all actions reasonably necessary to
obtain (and cooperating with each other in obtaining) any consent,
authorization, order or approval of, or any exemption by, any third
party, including any Governmental Body (which actions will include furnishing
all information required under the HSR Act and any other Law relating to
antitrust, competition, trade regulation, foreign investment or the protection
of national security (collectively, "Competition Laws", provided that in no
event shall "Competition Laws" be deemed to include any Law exclusively
regarding the regulation of alcoholic beverages) required to be obtained or
made by any Party or their Affiliates in connection with the Transactions),
and (iii) the execution and delivery of any additional instruments reasonably
necessary to consummate the Transactions and to fully carry out the purposes
of this Agreement. Additionally, the Parties will each use reasonable best
efforts (unless, with respect to any action, another standard of performance
is expressly provided for herein) to, and will work collaboratively to,
fulfill all conditions precedent to this Agreement and will not take any
action that would reasonably be expected to materially delay the obtaining of,
or to result in not obtaining, any permission, approval or consent from any
such Governmental Body or third party required to be obtained prior to the
Closing.

(b) Prior to the Closing, the Parties will keep each other apprised of
the status of matters relating to the completion of the Transactions and work
cooperatively in connection with obtaining all required consents,
authorizations, orders or approvals of, or any exemptions by, any third
party, including any Governmental Body, including by working cooperatively in
connection with any sales, divestitures or dispositions of assets or
businesses if and to the extent undertaken pursuant to the provisions of
this  _Section_ __ _ 7.6_. In this regard, prior to the Closing, each Party
will promptly consult with the other Party to provide any necessary
information with respect to (and, in the case of correspondence, provide to
the other Party (or their counsel) copies of) all filings made by such Party
with any Governmental Body or any other information supplied by such Party to,
or correspondence with, a Governmental Body in connection with this Agreement,
excluding any confidential financial data of such Party. Each Party will
promptly inform the other Party of, and if in writing, furnish the other Party
with copies of (or, in the case of material oral communications, advise the
other Party orally of) any communication from any Governmental Body regarding
any of the Transactions, and permit the other Party to review and discuss in
advance, and consider in good faith the views of the other Party in connection
with, any proposed written (or any material proposed 

 



64

    

 oral) communication with any such Governmental Body. If any Party or any
representative of such Party receives a request for additional information or
documentary material from any Governmental Body with respect to the
Transactions, then such Party will make, or cause to be made, promptly and
after consultation with the other Party, an appropriate response in compliance
with such request. Buyer will not participate in any meeting with
any Governmental Body in connection with this Agreement (or make oral
submissions at meetings or in telephone or other conversations) unless it
consults with Seller in advance and, to the extent not prohibited by such
Governmental Body, gives Representatives of Seller the opportunity to attend
and participate in such meeting. Each Party will furnish the other Party with
copies of all correspondence, filings and communications (and memoranda
setting forth the substance thereof, but excluding any confidential financial
data of such Party) between it and any such Governmental Body with respect to
this Agreement, and furnish the other Party with such necessary information
and reasonable assistance as the other Party may reasonably request in
connection with its preparation of necessary filings or submissions of
information to any such Governmental Body. The Parties may, as each deems
advisable and necessary, reasonably designate any competitively sensitive
material provided to the other Party under this _Section_ __ _ 7.6_ as
material for "Clean Team Members only." Such materials and the information
contained therein will be given only to (i) designated employees of the
Parties and their affiliates and (ii) outside counsel and experts hired by
the Parties and their Affiliates (collectively, "Clean Team Members") and will
not be disclosed by such Clean Team Members to any other directors, officers
or employees of the recipient unless express permission is obtained in
advance from the source of the materials or its legal counsel; _provided_ that
materials provided pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 7.6_ may be redacted to
remove references concerning the valuation of Seller or Buyer, discussion of
the terms or potential terms of the transactions described in this Agreement
and the terms of other potential competitive transactions (if any), and
otherwise, as necessary to comply with contractual arrangements and as
necessary to address reasonable privilege and confidentiality considerations.
The terms of the Clean Team Agreement shall be deemed incorporated herein by
reference as if set forth herein and, notwithstanding the Closing, the Clean
Team Agreement shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with
their respective terms. To the extent that transfers of any Permits issued by
any Governmental Body are required as a result of the execution of this
Agreement or the consummation of the Transactions, the Parties will use
reasonable best efforts to effect such transfers.

 

(c) The Parties will use all efforts to, and will work collaboratively
to, file, as promptly as practicable after the date hereof, all filings or
notifications under all applicable Competition Laws, to the extent such
filings or notifications have not been made as of the date hereof, and to make
any necessary amendments to any filings or notifications made under
applicable Competition Laws prior to the date hereof. To the extent the
Parties have not done so prior to the date hereof, and except as provided in
_Section_ __ _ 7.6(f)_, the Parties will each use reasonable best efforts
to, and will work collaboratively to, respond to any formal request for
additional information or documentary materials after an initial notification
pursuant to the HSR Act or any other Competition Law (a "Second Request"), as
promptly as practicable and counsel for the Parties will closely cooperate
during the entirety of any such Second Request review process. As soon as
practicable, the Parties shall provide thirty (30) days advance written
notice to the FTC Staff of the Parties intent to consummate the Proposed
Transaction or Revised Proposed Transaction (as each such term is defined in
that certain letter agreement with the staff of the Bureau of Competition of
the Federal

 



65

    

 Trade Commission (the "FTC Staff") dated July 29, 2019, as amended (the
"Timing Agreement")), which notice shall be in the form set forth in
Attachment B to the Timing Agreement.

(d) The Parties will use reasonable best efforts to, and will work
collaboratively to, resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted by any
Governmental Body with respect to the Transactions under the HSR Act or any
other applicable Competition Law, and will take the actions set forth in 
_Section_ __ _ 7.6(e)_. The Parties will use reasonable best efforts to
obtain the positions of the Mergers IV Division of the FTC and any applicable
state attorneys general offices prior to the date through which they have
agreed not to close the Transactions in the Timing Agreement, which set a
date of ninety (90) days following the Parties certification of substantial
compliance with the Second Request. In connection therewith, and despite
compliance with the obligations specified in _Section_ __ _ 7.6(e)_ intended
to resolve all objections of Governmental Bodies and avoid a legal challenge,
if any Legal Proceeding is instituted (or threatened to be instituted)
challenging the Transactions as violating the HSR Act or any other applicable
Competition Law, the Parties will cooperate and use reasonable best efforts to
contest and resist any such Legal Proceeding, and to have vacated, lifted,
reversed or overturned any Order, whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts the
consummation of the Transactions. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other
provision of this Agreement, nothing in this  _Section_ __ _ 7.6(d)_ will
limit the right of any Party to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 10.1_ so long as such Party has, up to the time of termination, complied
in all material respects with its obligations under this _Section_ __ _
7.6_. Each of the Parties will use reasonable best efforts to take such action
as may be required to cause the expiration of the notice periods under the HSR
Act or other applicable Competition Laws with respect to the Transactions as
promptly as practicable after the execution of this Agreement.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Buyer
shall use reasonable best efforts to, as promptly as practicable, find third
party buyers acceptable to the FTC or applicable state attorney generals
office, as the case may be, for (i) each Brand set forth on _Schedule
7.6(e)-1_ (collectively, the "Divested Brands"), or (ii) in Buyers sole
discretion, any brand or brands of Buyers which the FTC or applicable state
attorney generals office, as the case may be, agrees may be divested by
Buyer instead of any Divested Brand (each such brand, a "Buyers Competitive
Brand"), and to enter into definitive agreements with such buyers for the sale
by Buyer to such buyers, immediately following the Closing or as promptly as
practicable thereafter (but in no event later than thirty (30) days following
the Closing or as otherwise required by the FTC), of each such Divested Brand
or Buyers Competitive Brand, as the case may be, and (1) the portion of the
Business or Buyers business associated with such Divested Brand or Buyers
Competitive Brand, as the case may be, (2) the Purchased Assets associated
with such Divested Brand (other than the Owned Real Property, the Assumed
Real Property Leases, the Licensed IP, the Assumed CBA, if any, and, subject
to _Section_ __ _ 7.6(i)(iii)_, the Personal Property and Assumed Personal
Property Leases, in each case, associated with such Divested Brand) or
Buyers assets associated with such Buyers Competitive Brand (other than real
property, real property leases, personal property, personal property leases
and in-bound licensed Intellectual Property), as the case may be, and (3) the
Assumed Liabilities associated with such Divested Brand (other than Assumed
Liabilities arising under or in connection with any Owned Real Property,
Assumed Real Property Leases, Personal Property, Assumed Personal Property
Leases, the Licensed IP and/or the Assumed CBA associated with such Divested
Brand, if any) or Buyers liabilities associated with such
Buyers Competitive Brand (other

 



66

    

 than liabilities arising under or in connection with any real property
leases, personal property, personal property leases and in-bound
licensed Intellectual Property), as the case may be (collectively, the
"Divested Assets and Liabilities"), in each case, in order to comply with the
terms of any Order entered into by the Parties or to avoid or eliminate any
impediments under the HSR Act or any other Competition Law. For the avoidance
of doubt, the refusal of the FTC or applicable state attorney generals
office, as the case may be, to accept a third party buyer of Divested Assets
and Liabilities proposed by Buyer shall not relieve Buyer of its obligations
under this _Section_ __ _ 7.6(e)_ and, in such event, Buyer shall remain
responsible for using reasonable best efforts to find, as promptly as
practicable, another third party buyer which is acceptable to the FTC or
applicable state attorney generals office, as the case may be. For the
purposes of this Agreement, "Non-Divested Brand" means any Brand that is not
a Divested Brand. Additional provisions regarding certain changes to the
Transactions are set forth on _Schedule 7.6(e)-2_.

 

(f) In connection with proposing, negotiating, committing to and
effecting a consent order, hold separate order or similar arrangement, Buyer
and Seller hereby agree that they will agree to such modifications of this
Agreement or any Ancillary Documents, as are requested by the Mergers IV
Division of the FTC, the Compliance Division of FTC or the applicable state
attorney generals office, as the case may be; _provided_ , that each of the
proposed modifications: (i) (x) does not require the removal of any Non-
Divested Brand (and the associated assets and liabilities of the types
described in clauses (1), (2) and (3) of _Section_ __ _ 7.6(e)_) from the
Transactions, and (y) would not be reasonably expected to cause either Party
to incur any costs, expenses or losses other than attorneys fees or expenses,
costs and expenses of other professional advisors or Representatives, or
administrative costs and expenses; or (ii) is otherwise mutually agreed to by
the Parties. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, clause (i)(y) of this _Section_ __ _
7.6(f)_), Buyer agrees to accommodate interim production requirements related
to the Divested Assets and Liabilities in accordance with any Order entered
into by the Parties (A) at cost pricing and at production levels of such
Brands or Buyers Competitive Brands, as the case may be, that constitute
Divested Assets and Liabilities during the twelve (12) month period ending on
the date of this Agreement or (B) at such other pricing or production levels
or for such duration as may be required by the FTC with respect to such
Brands or Buyers Competitive Brands, as the case may be, that constitute
Divested Assets and Liabilities, in either case, by entering into one or more
supply agreements with the buyer of such Divested Assets and Liabilities
for all Brands or Buyers Competitive Brand, as the case may be, that
constitute Divested Assets and Liabilities in a form mutually agreed by such
parties acting reasonably and approved by the FTC; _provided_ that the Parties
agree that, for the avoidance of doubt, no such duration required by the FTC
or production level accommodation required by the FTC which is different than
the production level of the applicable Brand or Buyers Competitive Brand, as
the case may be, during the twelve (12) month period ending on the date of
this Agreement shall be deemed to be a modification of this Agreement or any
Ancillary Document which is subject to the proviso of the first sentence of
this  _Section_ __ _ 7.6(f)_.

(g) Buyer shall have the sole and exclusive authority to negotiate and
reach resolution with the FTC or other applicable Governmental Body with
respect to the ownership and operation of the Divested Assets and Liabilities;
_provided_ that, to the extent not prohibited by a confidentiality agreement
in place on or before the Original Agreement Date or except as mutually agreed
by the Parties outside antitrust counsel based on Competition Law concern,
Buyer shall: (1) 

 



67

    

 update Seller periodically on the status of such negotiations; (2) promptly
furnish Seller with all relevant information about such negotiations and
copies of any communications about such negotiations to or from the FTC; and
(3) allow Seller to participate in any meetings or teleconferences (aa)
relating to any commercial agreement that Seller may be required to enter into
with the buyer of such Divested Assets and Liabilities and/or (bb) with the
FTC relating to such negotiations, to the extent not prohibited by the FTC.

 

(h) Prior to the Closing, the Parties shall enter into an Order with
respect to the sale by Buyer following the Closing of the Divested Assets and
Liabilities as may be necessary, and shall take any other administrative or
procedural actions or any other actions as may be necessary, to avoid or
eliminate all impediments under the HSR Act or any other Competition Law so
as to enable the consummation of the Transactions to occur as soon as
practicable. Buyer shall satisfy, or cause to be satisfied, all conditions to
closing set forth in each definitive agreement regarding the sale of Divested
Assets and Liabilities by Buyer to a third party in order to enable such sale
to be consummated immediately following the Closing or as promptly as
practicable thereafter (but in no event later than thirty (30) days following
the Closing or as otherwise required by the FTC).

 

(i) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Buyer will not
be obligated to take any action that is not conditioned on the occurrence of
the Closing, nor will Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates be
obligated to sell, divest or dispose of (i) any of Buyers, its Subsidiaries
or its Affiliates own pre-Closing assets, brands or businesses, (ii) any
Owned Real Property or any interest in the Assumed Real Property Leases, or
(iii) without Buyers consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, any Personal Property or interest in any Assumed Personal Property
Lease, other than _de minimis_ items of Personal Property or Assumed Personal
Property Leases relating to _de minimis_ items of tangible personal property.

(j) Buyer and Seller agree to provide such security and assurances as
to financial capability, resources and creditworthiness as may be reasonably
requested by any Governmental Body or other third party whose consent or
approval is sought in connection with the Transactions. Whether or not
the Closing occurs, Buyer and Seller agree to share equally the
responsibility for all fees and payments (including filing fees and legal and
professional fees) to any third party or any Governmental Body in order to
obtain any consents, approvals or waivers pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
7.6_, other than the fees of and payments to the legal and professional
advisors of the individual Parties.

 

(k) Buyer and Seller shall not, and shall not permit any of their
Affiliates to, acquire or agree to acquire by merging or consolidating with,
or by purchasing a substantial portion of the assets of or equity in, or by
any other manner, any Person or portion thereof, or otherwise acquire or agree
to acquire any assets, at any time prior to the Termination Date if the
entering into of a definitive agreement relating to or the consummation of
such acquisition, merger or consolidation could reasonably be expected to (i)
impose any delay in the obtaining of, or increase the risk of not obtaining,
any authorizations, consents, orders, declarations or approvals of any
Governmental Body necessary to consummate the Transactions or the expiration
or termination of any applicable waiting period; (ii) increase the risk of
any Governmental Body entering an order prohibiting the consummation of the
Transactions; or (iii) delay the consummation of the Transactions.

 



68

    

7.7 _Books and Records_.

 

Following the Closing, for a period consistent with such Partys commercially
reasonable record retention policies but not less than seven (7) years, each
of Buyer and Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) give
Buyer or Seller, as the case may be, and its Representatives reasonable access
to (A) its Representatives, including employees, and (B) to the extent
relating to the Business and/or the Purchased Assets and capable of being
separated from the Books and Records relating to any other businesses of the
Seller Parties without imposing an unreasonable burden or cost on the Seller
Parties (unless Buyer agrees to assume any such unreasonable cost), Books and
Records and other information with respect to the Business and/or the
Purchased Assets relating to periods prior to the Closing, in each case for
any reasonable purpose, including as may be necessary for (1) the preparation
of Tax Returns and financial statements and (2) complying with any audit
request, subpoena or other investigative demand by any Governmental Body or
for any Legal Proceeding, subject in all cases to reasonable restrictions
imposed from time to time upon advice of counsel in respect of applicable Laws
relating to the confidentiality of information (including any Competition
Laws), and (ii) maintain all such Books and Records in accordance with such
Partys commercially reasonable record retention policies. All access provided
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 7.7_ shall be conducted (x) during normal
business hours upon reasonable advance notice to the Party providing access,
(y) in such a manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the normal
operations of the businesses of the Party providing access, and (z) at the
accessing Partys sole cost and expense (including any costs and expenses for
making copies of Books and Records), and the Party providing access shall have
the right to have one or more of its Representatives present at all times
during any visits, examinations, discussions or contacts contemplated by this
_Section_ __ _ 7.7_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, neither Buyer nor Seller shall be required to provide any access or
disclose any information where such access or disclosure would, in the
reasonable judgment of the Party otherwise required to provide such access or
disclosure, (I) jeopardize the attorney-client privilege or other immunity or
protection from disclosure of the Party otherwise required to provide such
access or disclosure, (II) conflict with any (x) Law (including any Law
relating to data protection or privacy) or Order applicable to the Party
otherwise required to provide such access or disclosure or the
assets, information or operation of the businesses of the Party otherwise
required to provide such access or disclosure, (y) Contract to which the Party
otherwise required to provide such access or disclosure is party or by which
any of the assets or properties of the Party otherwise required to provide
such access or disclosure is bound or (z) other obligation of confidentiality,
or (III) result in the disclosure of competitively sensitive information;
_provided_ , that if any information is withheld pursuant to this sentence,
the applicable Party will (x) inform the accessing Party as to the general
nature of what is being withheld and (y) use its commercially reasonable
efforts (1) to accommodate any request from the accessing Party for
information pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 7.7_ in a manner that does not
result in such a violation or waiver or disclosure of competitively sensitive
information or (2) to obtain the required consent of the applicable third
Person to permit such access or disclosure. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (x)
if the Parties are in an adversarial relationship in any Legal Proceeding, the
furnishing of information, documents or records in accordance with this
_Section_ __ _ 7.7_ shall be subject to any applicable rules relating to
discovery and (y) any and all such Books and Records may be destroyed by a
Party if such destroying Party sends to the other Party written notice of its
intent to destroy such Books and Records, specifying in reasonable detail the
contents of the Books and

 



69

    

 Records to be destroyed; such records may then be destroyed after the
sixtieth (60th) day following such notice unless the other Party notifies the
destroying Party that such other Party desires to obtain possession of such
Books and Records, in which event the destroying Party shall transfer such
Books and Records to such requesting party and such requesting Party shall pay
all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of the destroying Party in connection
therewith.

 

7.8 _Post-Closing Cooperation_.

 

After the Closing Date, each Party shall provide the other Party, at such
other Partys cost and expense, with such reasonable assistance as may be

inquiry, filing, disclosure or the like (including any Tax Return or form)
relating to the Purchased Assets, the Assumed Liabilities or the Business.

 

7.9 _Confidentiality_.

 

The terms of the Transaction Non-Disclosure Agreement shall be deemed
incorporated herein by reference as if set forth herein and, notwithstanding
the Closing, the Transaction Non-Disclosure Agreement shall continue in full
force and effect in accordance with its terms except that (a) upon the
Closing, Buyers obligations thereunder with respect to "Confidential
Information" (as such term is defined in the Transaction Non-Disclosure
Agreement), to the extent relating to the Business, shall terminate, and (b)
Buyers obligations thereunder with respect to "Non-Solicitation" shall not
apply to any Included Employees. With respect to Confidential Information
that does not relate to the Business, such Confidential Information shall
remain subject to the terms and conditions of the Transaction Non-Disclosure
Agreement. With respect to Representatives of Buyer that, prior to the
Closing, were Representatives of Seller, nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 7.9_
shall vitiate such Representatives confidentiality obligations owed to Seller
as a consequence of such Representatives former employment with Seller.

7.10 _Employees_ _and Employee Benefits_.

Matters regarding certain employees are set forth in _Schedule 7.10_.

 

7.11 _Damage or Casualty Loss_.

 

Damage by fire or other casualty to any of the Purchased Assets during the
Pre-Closing Period (a "Casualty Loss") shall not result in any reduction or
adjustment to the Purchase Price or relieve Buyer or Seller from its
obligations in respect of the Closing, so long as Seller, at its option,
either (a) repairs such damage prior to the Closing at Sellers sole cost and
expense, retaining all insurance proceeds (and the rights thereto) related to
such damage, (b) collects (and when collected pays over to Buyer) any
insurance proceeds related to such damage, or (c) assigns to Buyer such
insurance proceeds ( _it_ _being_ _understood_ that any repairs made pursuant
to clause (a) of this _Section_ __ _ 7.11_ and any insurance proceeds paid
over or assigned to Buyer pursuant to clauses (b) and (c), respectively, of
this _Section_ __ _ 7.11_ shall restore or enable Buyer to restore (as the
case may be) the affected properties or assets to a condition that enables
the continued operation of the Business or the Purchased Assets, in all
material respects, as conducted prior to such damage, in each case as

 



70

    

 determined by a qualified engineering firm mutually agreeable to the
Parties). At all times during the Pre-Closing Period, Seller shall, and shall
cause the Seller Subsidiaries to, maintain in full force and effect insurance
policies providing adequate insurance coverage for the Business and the
Purchased Assets and which are sufficient for compliance with all Laws and
Contracts to which the Seller Parties are a party or by which they are bound
in connection with the Business.

 

7.12 _Further Assurances_.

 

From time to time after the Closing Date, each Party shall, and shall cause
its controlled Affiliates to, promptly execute, acknowledge and deliver any
other assurances or documents or instruments of transfer or assumption and
take such further actions reasonably requested to carry out the provisions of
this Agreement and give effect to the Transactions. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, in the event that (a) Buyer or Seller discovers
following the Closing that any asset that was intended to be transferred
pursuant to this Agreement was not transferred at the Closing, Seller shall or
shall cause its Affiliates promptly to assign and transfer to Buyer all
right, title and interest in such asset for no additional consideration, (b)
Buyer or Seller discovers following the Closing that any asset that was not
intended to be transferred pursuant to this Agreement was transferred at the
Closing, Buyer shall promptly assign and transfer to Seller or Sellers
designated Seller Subsidiary all right, title and interest in such asset for
no additional consideration, (c) Seller or any of its Affiliates receives any
funds following the Closing that relate to a Purchased Asset, Seller shall or
shall cause its Affiliates promptly to remit such funds to Buyer and (d) Buyer
or any of its Affiliates receives any funds following the closing that relate
to an Excluded Asset, Buyer shall or shall cause its Affiliates promptly to
remit such funds to Seller or Sellers designated Seller Subsidiary.

 

7.13 _Bulk Sales Laws_.

 

The Parties hereby waive compliance with the provisions of any bulk sales,
bulk transfer or similar laws of any jurisdiction that may otherwise be
applicable with respect to the sale of any or all of the Purchased Assets to
Buyer.

 

7.14 _Distributors; Distributor Indemnifications_.

 

(a) The Parties hereby acknowledge and agree that none of the
distribution agreements currently in effect between the Seller Parties and
their respective Distributors are included in the Assumed Contracts and no
such distributor agreements shall be assigned or transferred to Buyer, in
whole or in part, hereunder. During the Pre-Closing Period, neither Seller
nor any of the Seller Subsidiaries (nor any third party acting at Sellers or
any Seller Subsidiarys direction or with their consent) shall deliver any
notices to their respective Distributors withdrawing any products sold under
the Brands from distribution under the relevant distribution agreements or
otherwise terminating such Distributors rights to distribute such products
under such agreements. Promptly following Closing, Seller and the Seller
Subsidiaries shall notify their respective Distributors of the closing of the
Transactions and shall cooperate with Buyer and provide instructions to their
Distributors as reasonably requested by Buyer to facilitate the transfer of
the products sold under the Brands into Buyers distribution network. The
Parties hereby acknowledge and agree that Buyer will be permitted to and will
be solely responsible for entering into its own 

 



71

    

 distribution agreements or other arrangements with distributors of Buyers
choosing with respect to the distribution of the products sold under the
Brands following the Closing.

 

(b) In the event that Buyer elects to appoint a new distributor to
distribute products sold under any Brand in any territory post-Closing that
is different than the Distributor appointed by Seller to distribute such
product in such territory prior to the Closing, and Buyer seeks an indemnity
from such new distributor for itself against any liability to Sellers former
Distributor of such products in such territory, then Buyer shall either (i)
ensure that any such indemnity extends equally to Seller and its Affiliates
and that Seller and its Affiliates are made express third party beneficiaries
of such indemnity, or (ii) to the extent such indemnity does not so extend
equally, itself indemnify, defend and hold harmless Seller and its Affiliates
from and against any and all Losses resulting or arising from any liability
to Sellers former Distributor of such products in such territory, _provided_
, that in no event shall Buyer be required to indemnify, defend or hold
harmless Seller or any of its Affiliates from and against any Losses
resulting or arising from Sellers or any of its Affiliates actions,
including, without limitation, arising in connection with any Products
manufactured, sold, distributed, shipped or licensed by the Business prior to
the Closing, or any services rendered by any Seller Party in connection with
the Business.

7.15 _Other Regulatory Matters_.

(a) Each Seller Party shall cooperate with and provide reasonable
assistance to Buyer in connection with the transfer or re-issuance of any
Permit, including signing transfer applications, "use up" letters for labels
and permit termination forms. Effective as of the Closing, each Seller Party
grants to Buyer the limited right to sell all finished goods Inventory that is
labeled with any name or trademark of such Seller Party as of the Closing Date
and to use up all labels and other packaging materials included in the
Inventory bearing any name or trademark of such Seller Party.

 

(b) Each Seller Party shall provide such "use up" authorizations
as may be required to enable Buyer to register and sell the Brands using
labels bearing such Seller Partys name and address. To the extent required
for Buyer to conduct the Business, each Seller Party shall maintain its
existing label and Brands registrations and price postings with respect to
the Brands and shall cooperate with Buyer in connection with Buyers
commercially reasonable efforts to make and obtain Buyers label approval,
brand registrations and price postings with respect to the Brands, in each
case, until the earlier to occur of (i) the date on which Buyers label
approval, Brands registration and price postings are completed with respect to
the Brands, or (ii) the six-month anniversary of the Closing Date.

7.16 _Intellectual Property_.

The Seller Parties shall not, themselves or through any third party: (a) at
any time after the Closing Date, for so long as any item of Business
Intellectual Property remains valid and enforceable, challenge the validity,
enforceability, ownership, scope, or effectiveness of such item of Business
Intellectual Property or Buyers rights with respect to such item of Business
Intellectual Property; (b)(i) at any time after the Closing Date, use, apply
for or register any trademark, service mark, trade name, trade dress, label
design or package design that is identical to any item of Business
Intellectual

 



72

    

 Property, or (ii) for a period of seven (7) years after the Closing Date,
use, apply for or register any trademark, service mark, trade name, trade
dress, label design or package design that is confusingly similar to any item
of Business Intellectual Property, in the case of clauses (i) and (ii), for so
long as any such item of Business Intellectual Property that is a trademark,
service mark, trade name, trade dress, label design or package design remains
valid and enforceable, _provided_ , that the Parties agree that with respect
to any Legal Proceeding arising out of or relating to this clause (b)(ii), the
standard to be applied in determining whether such trademark, service mark,
trade name, trade dress, label design or package design is confusingly similar
to any such item of Business Intellectual Property shall be the same as that
applied under the federal laws of the United States with respect to such
matters, and such standard shall not be affected in any manner by the
inclusion of this clause (b)(ii) in this Agreement; or (c) at any time after
the Closing Date, use any image, design and/or other artwork, name or
reference on any trade dress, packaging materials, media, advertising and/or
marketing or other material(s) that would be reasonably viewed as portraying,
depicting, referencing or implying a relationship with the Brands, the
Business or the Purchased Assets, and Seller and the other Seller Parties
will remove, no later than the Closing Date, any such image, design and/or
other artwork, name or reference from any of their trade dress, packaging
materials, media, advertising and/or marketing and other materials, including
without limitation websites, digital and social media. Buyer and the Seller
Parties agree that the trademark "Cuvee Sauvage" is not confusingly similar to
the trademark "Cheval Sauvage" and Buyer shall not, itself or through any
third party, at any time after the Closing Date, for so long as "Cuvee
Sauvage" remains a valid and enforceable trademark, challenge the validity,
enforceability, ownership, scope, or effectiveness of "Cuvee Sauvage" or any
Seller Partys or any of its current or future Affiliates rights with respect
to "Cuvee Sauvage". The Seller Parties hereby irrevocably waive any moral
rights each may claim or have appurtenant to the Business Intellectual
Property. The Seller Parties further covenant and agree that they will not at
any time prior to, or for a period of twenty-four (24) months following the
Closing Date, disparage or defame the Brands, the Business or any
Purchased Assets through any public announcements, press releases, investors
calls or similar corporate communications directed or approved by an executive
officer of Seller; _provided_ , that for the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing
covenant shall not apply to any communication that is not a corporate
communication directed or approved by an executive officer of Seller,
including any statements made by any Seller Partys salespersons or
other non-executive employees to any Person that compares the products of any
Seller Party or Affiliate thereof favorably to any Product or is otherwise in
the nature of a statement any salesperson or other non-executive employee
might make regarding a competitor or its products.

 

7.17 _Escrow Matters_.

 

The Parties shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to negotiate in
good faith and prior to or concurrently with the Closing enter into an escrow
agreement with the Escrow Holder, in a form mutually agreed upon by the
parties thereto (the "Escrow Agreement"), for the establishment of an escrow
account and the provision of escrow and title services in accordance with the
terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement.

7.18 _No Solicitation_.

During the Pre-Closing Period, except in connection with the Transactions,
Seller shall not, and shall cause the other Seller Parties and its and their
respective Affiliates and Representatives not

 



73

    

 to, directly or indirectly, (a) solicit or initiate or induce or encourage,
or take any other action to facilitate, any Alternative Transaction or any
inquiry or proposal that would reasonably be expected to lead to an
Alternative Transaction, (b) enter into, continue or otherwise participate in
any discussions or negotiations regarding, furnish to any person any
information in furtherance of, or otherwise cooperate in any way in
furtherance of, any Alternative Transaction or any inquiry or proposal that
would reasonably be expected to lead to an Alternative Transaction, or (c)
approve, endorse, recommend, execute or enter into any Contract, letter of
intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, joint venture
agreement, partnership agreement or merger, acquisition or similar agreement
constituting, contemplating or otherwise relating to any Alternative
Transaction or any inquiry or proposal that could reasonably be expected to
lead to an Alternative Transaction. For the avoidance of doubt, it is
understood and agreed that the foregoing shall not prohibit any of the Seller
Parties or their respective Affiliates or Representatives from responding to
inquiries by any Person about a possible Alternative Transaction in order to
inform such Person of the existence of the obligations contained in this
_Section_ __ _ 7.18_; _provided_ , that Seller shall promptly notify Buyer
of the receipt by any of the Seller Parties or, to Sellers Knowledge, their
respective Affiliates or Representatives, of any inquiry or proposal relating
to (i) an Alternative Transaction in respect of Purchased Assets or one or
more Brands representing at least Two Hundred Million Dollars ($200,000,000)
of Net Sales during the Seller Parties fiscal year ended February 28, 2019
based upon the amounts set forth on _Schedule 1(e)_ , which notice shall
identify the Purchased Assets or the Brands that are the subject of such
inquiry or proposal or (ii) a Permitted Alternative Transaction, and, to the
extent not prohibited by a confidentiality agreement in place on or
before the date hereof, Seller shall (v) promptly notify Buyer of the
material terms thereof and the identity of the person or group involved in any
such Alternative Transaction, (w) promptly furnish Buyer with a copy of any
written inquiry, proposal or other information relating to such Alternative
Transaction, (x) keep Buyer informed on a current basis of any modifications
to such inquiry, proposal or other information regarding an Alternative
Transaction, (y) promptly furnish Buyer with a copy of any communication
about such Alternative Transaction to or from the FTC and (z) allow Buyer to
participate in any meetings or teleconferences with the FTC relating to such
Alternative Transaction, to the extent not prohibited by the FTC.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, nothing in this _Section_ __
_ 7.18_ shall prohibit any of the Seller Parties or their respective
Affiliates or Representatives from taking any action, on or after the date of
this Agreement, solely with respect to one or more Permitted Alternative
Transactions; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall any such
Permitted Alternative Transaction include Owned Real Property (including,
for the avoidance of doubt, the Seller Parties Mission Bell and/or
Canandaigua facilities), any Assumed Real Property Lease, any items of
Personal Property (other than _de minimis_ items of Personal Property or
Assumed Personal Property Leases relating to _de minimis_ items of tangible
personal property) used in connection with the operation of the Retained
Business or any other assets, properties or rights exclusively related to the
Business or the Brands (other than the Retained Business); _provided_ ,
_further_ , that any Permitted Alternative Transaction, including any
Permitted Alternative Transaction with respect to the Cooks Business, must
not reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay the Parties from
consummating the Transactions in accordance with the terms of this Agreement
and by no later than the Initial Termination Date; and _provided_ , _further_
, that, to the extent not prohibited by a confidentiality agreement in place
on or before the Original Agreement Date or except as mutually agreed by the
Parties outside antitrust counsel based on Competition Law concern, Seller
shall: (1) update Buyer periodically on the status of negotiations
regarding any Permitted Alternative

 



74

    

 Transaction; (2) promptly furnish Buyer with all relevant information about
negotiations regarding any Permitted Alternative Transaction and copies of any
communications about such negotiations to or from the FTC; and (3) allow
Buyer to participate in any meetings or teleconferences (aa) relating to any
commercial agreement that Buyer may be required to enter into with the buyer
in any Permitted Alternative Transaction and/or (bb) with the FTC relating to
negotiations regarding any Permitted Alternative Transaction, to the extent
not prohibited by the FTC.

 

7.19 _Shared Contracts and Assigned Portions of the Shared Contracts_.

 

(a) In order to complete the transfer of the Assigned Portions of the
Shared Contracts to Buyer or its designated Affiliates, Seller shall notify,
or cause the applicable Seller Subsidiaries to notify, the counterparties of
the Shared Contracts of the transfer of the Assigned Portions of the Shared
Contracts by Seller or a Seller Subsidiary to Buyer or its designated
Affiliate, and Seller and Buyer shall each use their respective commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain the cooperation of each counterparty to a Shared
Contract so that, as of the Closing Date or the earliest practicable time
thereafter, with the concurrence and consent of such counterparty, each Shared
Contract shall be divided into two (2) contracts so that Buyer or its
designated Affiliate receives the benefit of the portion of the Shared
Contract pertaining to the Business (the "Assigned Portion of the Shared
Contract") and assumes the obligations of the respective Seller Party
associated with the Assigned Portion of the Shared Contract, and the
respective Seller Party remains entitled to receive the benefit of the
balance of the Shared Contract and remains liable to perform its obligations
under the balance of the Shared Contract, and the respective Seller Party is
released from its obligations attributable to the Assigned Portion of such
Shared Contract; _provided_ that in no event shall any Seller Party or Buyer
be obligated to pay any fee or provide any confidential financial statements
to any such counterparty in order to obtain any such concurrence and consent;
_provided_ , _further_ , that Seller and Buyer shall each use their
commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the Assigned Portions of the
Shared Contracts (i) reflect the portions of the Shared Contracts used by the
Business in the ordinary course of business consistent with the Seller
Parties past practices, (ii) are in quantities appropriate for the Business
as conducted as of the date of this Agreement and (iii) in the case of any
Shared Contracts that are grape contracts, are based upon vineyard blocks used
by the Business in the ordinary course of business consistent with the Seller
Parties past practices. Buyer and Seller shall act in good faith
and reasonably cooperate in connection with such process of dividing each
Shared Contract (including the joint determination of the portion of the
Shared Contract pertaining to the Business and the allocation of Sellers and
Buyers respective rights and obligations under the Shared Contract). If a
Shared Contract includes schedules or statements of work that pertain
exclusively to the Business or are otherwise easily separable into a portion
of such Shared Contract that exclusively pertains to the Business, such
schedules or statements of work or other easily separable portions exclusively
related to the Business shall be the Assigned Portion of the Shared Contract
and, if a Shared Contract is not easily separable in such manner, the
Assigned Portion of the Shared Contract shall be determined based on the
historical allocation of the goods or services provided to or received by the
Business under such Shared Contract.

 

(b) With respect to any Shared Contract for which such concurrence and
consent of the counterparty is not obtained prior to the Closing Date or
which cannot be separated in the manner described in _Section_ __ _ 7.19(a)_
(a "Joint Contract"), then, until such time as such Joint Contract may be
divided into two contracts as provided in _Section_ __ _ 7.19(a)_, the
respective Seller Party

 



75

    

 will, for the purposes of the relationship with the counterparty to such
Joint Contract, remain the party to the Joint Contract, and the Parties will,
for the purposes of the relationship between themselves, behave and treat
each other as if the Assigned Portion of the Shared Contract of such Joint
Contract had effectively been assigned to and assumed by Buyer or its
designated Affiliate on and as of the Closing Date, so that Buyer or
its designated Affiliate shall receive from the Seller Party the benefits of
the Assigned Portion of the Shared Contract, and Buyer or its designated
Affiliate shall perform the obligations of the respective Seller Party related
to the Assigned Portion of the Shared Contract.

(c) In addition to their other obligations under this _Section_ __ _
7.19_ and under _Section_ __ _ 2.6_, during the Pre-Closing Period, when
seeking to obtain any Consent required to assign any Assumed Contract set
forth on _Schedule 7.19(c)_ and when dividing any Shared Contract set forth
on _Schedule 7.19(c)_ , Buyer and Seller shall use commercially reasonable
efforts, and shall cooperate with each other in good faith, to negotiate a
reduction in the duration of the term of such Assumed Contract or Shared
Contract (including the Assigned Portion of such Shared Contract), as the case
may be.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, during the Pre-
Closing Period, the Seller Parties will not execute any new Contracts with the
counterparties to the Contracts and expired contracts set forth on _Schedule
7.19(d)_ for the goods or services to which such Contracts or expired
contracts relate, without the prior written consent of Buyer, and no Seller
Party shall be obligated to execute any such new Contract unless Buyer agrees
in writing that such new Contract shall be treated as an Assumed Contract for
all purposes under this Agreement.

(e) During the Pre-Closing Period, the Seller Parties shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to renew, prior to the expiration thereof,
each of the Contracts set forth on _Schedule 7.19(e)_ on substantially the
same terms set forth in such Contract as of the date of this Agreement.

7.20 _Termination of Certain Contracts_ _; Chile 30 Day Operating
Amount_.

(a) Seller shall, and Seller shall cause the Seller Subsidiaries to,
take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary to effect the termination of
all Contracts between any Seller Party or Affiliate thereof, on the one hand,
and Constellation Brands Chile, on the other hand, if any, effective on or
prior to the Closing Date, without liability to Constellation Brands Chile or
Buyer or any of its Affiliates.

 

(b) Seller shall cause the bank account(s) of Constellation Brands
Chile to have, as of the Closing, an amount in Chilean Pesos necessary to
operate the business of Constellation Brands Chile in the ordinary course of
business, consistent with past practice, for a period of thirty (30) days, as
determined in good faith by Seller (the amount of such cash actually in the
bank account(s) of Constellation Brands Chile as of the Closing, the "Chile 30
Day Operating Amount").

 

7.21 _Retained Business Supply Agreements_.

 

Buyer agrees to accommodate interim production requirements related to each
portion of the Retained Business in accordance with any Order entered into by
the Parties (a) at cost pricing and at

 



76

    

 production levels of such portion of the Retained Business during the twelve
(12) month period ending on the date of this Agreement or (b) at such other
pricing or production levels or for such duration as may be required by the
FTC with respect to such portion of the Retained Business, in either case, by
entering into one or more supply agreements with the buyer of such portion of
the Retained Business or Seller, as applicable, for all portions of the
Retained Business in a form mutually agreed by Buyer and the buyer of such
portion of the Retained Business or Seller, should it continue to operate the
Retained Business, acting reasonably and approved by the FTC (each
a "Retained Business Supply Agreement").

 

7.22 _Pre-Deployment of Inventory_.

 

The Parties shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to
achieve pre-deployment of case goods of the Brands in accordance with the
pre-deployment plan attached hereto as _Schedule 7.22_.

ARTICLE VIII

TAXES AND COSTS; APPORTIONMENTS.

8.1 _Transfer Taxes_ _and Fees_.

 

Buyer shall be responsible for the full and timely payment of all sales and
use, withholding, value-added, excise and ad-valorem Taxes (with the exception
of any Chilean withholding Taxes), filing and recordation fees (including for
Grant Deeds), customs duties and similar charges relating to the sale or
transfer of the Purchased Assets hereunder, and for the filing of all Tax
Returns related thereto, excluding any income or business and occupation Taxes
imposed on Seller. Seller shall provide such cooperation in connection with
the preparation and filing of such Tax Returns as may be reasonably requested
by Buyer. Buyer shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Seller from and
against any and all Taxes and any Losses arising from or related to Buyers
failure to: (a) pay any such Taxes, fees or charges, or (b) file any such Tax
Return. Buyer and Seller agree to share equally the responsibility for all
transfer Taxes on the sale or transfer of the Real Property hereunder. Buyer
and Seller shall cooperate in connection with the signing and filing of all
Tax Returns related to the sale or transfer of the Real Property hereunder,
including without limitation, signing and filing any preliminary change of
ownership reports, transfer tax affidavits, or other similar forms.

 

8.2 _Transaction Costs_.

 

(a) Seller shall pay the cost of standard coverage under the Owned
Real Property Title Policies, consisting of the CLTA (or equivalent) portion
thereof. Buyer shall pay for the cost of any endorsements and the additional
cost above the cost of a CLTA (or equivalent) policy for any extended coverage
consisting of the ALTA (or equivalent) portion of the Owned Real Property
Title Policies.

 



77

    

(b) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, each Party shall
be responsible for its own costs and expenses incurred in connection with the
preparation, negotiation and delivery of this Agreement and the Transaction
Documents, including attorneys and accountants fees and expenses, whether
or not the Closing shall have occurred.

 

8.3 _Apportionments_.

 

(a) Except for transfer Taxes (which are addressed in  _Section_ __ _
8.1_), all Taxes with respect to the Business or the Purchased Assets for a
taxable period that includes the Closing Date ("Straddle Period Taxes") that
are real property Taxes, personal property Taxes and similar ad valorem
obligations shall be apportioned between Seller and Buyer as of the Closing
Date by the Escrow Holder, using the latest Tax bills, based on the number of
days of such taxable period ending on but not including the Closing Date (the
"Pre-Closing Straddle Period") and the number of days of such taxable period
beginning on and including the Closing Date through the end of such taxable
period (the "Post-Closing Straddle Period").

(b) Straddle Period Taxes other than Taxes described in _Section_ __ _
8.3(a)_, including but not limited to any Taxes payable as a result of the
application of Section 951 or 951A of the Code, shall be apportioned between
the Pre-Closing Straddle Period and the Post-Closing Straddle Period based on
an interim closing of the books as of the Effective Time. For purposes of
allocating Straddle Period Taxes attributable to any equity interests in
partnerships or specified foreign corporations (within the meaning of Section
965(e) of the Code), the taxable year of any such partnerships or specified
foreign corporations shall be treated as ending as of the Effective Time.
For the avoidance of doubt, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, Seller shall be liable for any Taxes of the Seller Parties
arising in connection with the consummation of the Transactions (including any
Taxes attributable to an election under Section 338 of the Code with respect
to the purchase of the Shares pursuant to this Agreement), except as provided
in _Section_ __ _ 8.1_.

 

(c) Seller shall be liable for Pre-Closing Straddle Period Taxes and
Buyer shall be liable for Post-Closing Straddle Period Taxes. Except as
otherwise set forth in _Section_ __ _ 8.5_, the party required by law to pay
any such Tax (the "Paying Party") shall file the Tax Return related to such
Tax within the time period prescribed by law and shall timely pay such Tax. To
the extent any such payment exceeds the obligation of the Paying Party
hereunder, the Paying Party shall provide the other party (the "Non-Paying
Party") with notice of payment, and within ten (10) days of receipt of such
notice of payment, the Non-Paying Party shall reimburse the Paying Party for
the Non-Paying Partys share of such Taxes.

 

8.4 _Prorations and Other Adjustments_.

 

To the extent not otherwise prorated or adjusted pursuant to this Agreement,
(a) Escrow Holder shall prorate between Seller and Buyer, as of the Closing
on the basis of a 365 day year and the actual number of days elapsed to (but
not including) the Closing Date, those items set forth on _Schedule 8.4(a)_ ,
and (b) Buyer shall reimburse all documented customary farming costs incurred
by the Seller Parties with respect to the Real Property between March 31, 2019
and the Closing Date for the 2019 harvest. Any Taxes, charges and expenses
payable on an estimated basis shall be reconciled against actual Taxes,
charges and expenses as of the Effective Time, to the extent then

 



78

    

 possible, and Seller shall provide a proposed reconciliation for Buyers
approval. Seller shall have a period of ninety (90) days following the Closing
to provide Buyer with a final reconciliation. If the final reconciliation
shows that Buyer or Seller owes the other additional sums, the Party owning
such sums shall pay such amount to the other Party within ten (10) days after
Buyers receipt of the final reconciliation. If the amount of any proration
cannot be determined at the Closing, the adjustments will be made at the
Closing based on the best available information and then re-prorated between
the Parties in accordance with the final reconciliation provided above.

8.5 _Certain Tax Returns; Cooperation_.

(a) Seller, at its own expense, shall prepare, or cause to be
prepared, and timely file, or cause to be timely filed, all Tax Returns of

Seller or any of Buyers or Sellers former, current or future Affiliates,
Representatives, officers, directors, direct or indirect general or limited

members; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that termination pursuant to _Section_ __
_ 10.1_ shall not relieve either Party from such Liability (i) pursuant to
the Sections specified in _Section_ __ _ 10.2(a)_ that survive
termination or (ii) for any willful (in the sense that such action was both
intentional and known to be a violation of this Agreement) and material breach
of this Agreement prior to such termination.

contained in (a) _Sections 5.1_ , _5.2_ , _5.4_ , _5.7(a)_ , _5.8_ , _5.22_ ,
_5.23_ and  _5.24(a)_  _(d)_ (collectively, the "Seller Fundamental

matter of such Seller Fundamental Representations, Buyer Fundamental
Representations, or the representations and warranties set forth in _Section_
__ _ 5.15(a)_ and the first sentence of _Section_ __ _ 5.15(g)_, as the case
may be, shall have expired. All covenants of the Parties that by their terms
contemplate performance after the Closing Date shall survive the Closing Date
for the periods set forth therein or, if no time period for performance is

11.2 _Indemnification by Seller_.

 

(a) From and after the Closing Date and subject to the provisions of
this  _Article XI_ , Buyer and its Affiliates and their respective its
directors, officers, managers, employees, equity holders, agents, attorneys,
representatives, successors and permitted assigns, as applicable 

 



83

    

 (collectively, the "Buyer Indemnified Parties") shall be entitled to be
indemnified and held harmless by Seller from and against any and all Losses
incurred by any Buyer Indemnified Party resulting or arising from (i) any
failure by Seller to perform or comply with any covenant or agreement in this
Agreement or any Closing Document, (ii) any inaccuracy in or breach of any
representation or warranty made by Seller in this Agreement or any Closing
Document, whether or not known by Buyer at Closing, (iii) with the exception
of the Assumed Liabilities, any Third Party Claim based upon, resulting from
or arising out of the conduct of the Business, the ownership or operation of
the Purchased Assets, or the sale of products and services relating to the
Business by the Seller Parties prior to the Closing Date, or (iv) any Excluded
Asset or Excluded Liability, including any Pre-Closing Environmental
Liability, regardless of whether or not the Seller Disclosure Schedule
discloses any such Excluded Asset or Excluded Liability; _provided_ that for
purposes of this  _Section_ __ _ 11.2_, the representations and warranties
of Seller in this Agreement and the Closing Documents shall be deemed to have
been made without any qualifications as to knowledge or materiality and,
accordingly, all references herein and therein to "Knowledge," "Business
Material Adverse Effect," "material," "in all material respects" and similar
qualifications as to Knowledge and materiality shall be deemed to be
deleted therefrom (except (x) where any such provision requires disclosure of
lists of items of a material nature or above a specified threshold, (y) with
respect to any Knowledge qualifier, where it relates to any "threatened" act
or circumstance or to the compliance by any third party with any obligation
owed to a Seller Party under any Contract or otherwise or (z) with respect to
the Knowledge qualifiers set forth in _Section_ __ _ 5.15(g)_ relating
to the Licensed IP only), _provided_ _further_ , that to the extent that any
materiality or Knowledge qualified representation or warranty is deemed to be
breached by Seller solely as the result of the application of the proviso
immediately preceding this proviso, such breach will not constitute or give
rise to a claim of Fraud, for purposes of this _Article XI_ or otherwise.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Seller
shall not be liable for any Loss or Losses resulting from any inaccuracy in
or breach of any representation or warranty made by Seller in this Agreement
other than the Seller Fundamental Representations pursuant to  _Section_ __ _
11.2(a)(ii)_ ("Buyer Warranty Losses"):

 

(i) unless and until the aggregate amount of all Buyer Warranty
Losses incurred by the Buyer Indemnified Parties exceeds an amount equal to
sixty-five hundredths of one percent (0.65%) of the Base Purchase Price (the
"Deductible"), and then only to the extent that such Buyer Warranty Losses
exceed the Deductible; _provided_ that the limitation in this _Section_ __ _
11.2(b)(i)_ shall not apply to any claims resulting from any inaccuracy in or
breach of any representation or warranty made by Seller in  _Section_ __ _
5.15(a)_ and the first sentence of _Section_ __ _ 5.15(g)_;

 

(ii) with respect to any individual claim or series of claims having
the same nature or origin where the Buyer Warranty Losses relating thereto
are less than One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000), and any such Buyer
Warranty Losses shall not be counted or aggregated for purposes of determining
whether the Buyer Indemnified Parties have incurred Losses in excess of the
Deductible; _provided_ that the limitation in this _Section_ __ _
11.2(b)(ii)_ shall not apply to any claims resulting from any inaccuracy in or
breach of any representation or warranty made by Seller in in _Section_ __ _
5.15(a)_ and the first sentence of _Section_ __ _ 5.15(g)_; and

 



84

    

(iii) to the extent that Buyer Warranty Losses, in the aggregate,
exceed (A) an amount equal to five and eighty-eight hundredths percent (5.88%)
of the Base Purchase Price with respect to any representations or warranties
other the representations and warranties set forth _Section_ __ _ 5.15(a)_
and the first sentence of _Section_ __ _ 5.15(g)_ (the "Cap"), or (B) an
amount equal to the Purchase Price minus the aggregate value of the Inventory,
the Personal Property and the Real Property, each as set forth in the
Appraisal Report, with respect to any representations or warranties of Seller
set forth in _Section_ __ _ 5.15(a)_ and the first sentence of  _Section_ __
_ 5.15(g)_.

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
nothing contained in _Section_ __ _ 11.2(b)_ or _Section_ __ _ 11.4(d)_
shall be deemed to limit or restrict in any manner any rights or remedies
which Buyer has, or might have, at Law, in equity or otherwise, based on
claims arising out of Fraud.

 

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing limitations in  _Section_ __ _
11.1_ and this _Section_ __ _ 11.2_, Seller will indemnify Buyer for the full
amount of any claims relating to any Seller Parties failure to timely file
any required reports and excise tax documents with the Alcohol and Tobacco
Tax and Trade Bureau (the "TTB"), the California Department of Alcoholic
Beverage Control or Board of Equalization (the "BOE") or to timely pay any
federal excise taxes to the TTB and state taxes to the BOE with respect to
operations of the Business prior to the Closing Date.

 

11.3 _Indemnification by Buyer_.

 

(a) From and after the Closing Date and subject to the provisions of
this  _Article XI_ , the Seller Parties and their Affiliates and each of
their respective directors, officers, managers, employees, equity holders,
agents, attorneys, representatives, successors and permitted assigns, as
applicable (collectively, the "Seller Indemnified Parties" and together with
Buyer Indemnified Parties, the "Indemnified Parties") shall be entitled to be
indemnified and held harmless by Buyer from and against any and all Losses
incurred by any Seller Indemnified Party resulting or arising from (i) any
failure by Buyer to perform or comply with any covenant or agreement in this
Agreement or any Closing Document, (ii) any inaccuracy in or breach of any
representation or warranty made by Buyer in this Agreement or any Closing

Closing Date; _provided_ that for purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 11.3_, the
representations and warranties of Buyer in this Agreement and the Closing
Documents shall be deemed to have been made without any qualifications as to
knowledge or materiality and, accordingly, all references herein and therein
to "Knowledge," "Buyer Material Adverse Effect," "material," "in all material
respects" and similar qualifications as to Knowledge and materiality shall be
deemed to be deleted therefrom (except (x) where any such provision requires
disclosure of lists of items of a material nature or above a specified
threshold, or (y) with respect to any Knowledge qualifier, where it relates to
any "threatened" act or circumstance); _provided_ _further_ , that to the
extent that any materiality or Knowledge qualified representation or warranty
is deemed to be breached by Buyer solely as the result of the application of
the proviso immediately preceding this proviso, such breach will not
constitute or give rise to a claim of Fraud, for purposes of this _Article
XI_ or otherwise.

 



85

    

(b) Buyer shall not be liable for any Loss or Losses pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 11.3(a)(ii)_ ("Seller Warranty Losses") (i) unless and until
the aggregate amount of all Seller Warranty Losses incurred by the Seller
Indemnified Parties exceeds the Deductible, and then only to the extent that
such Seller Warranty Losses exceed the Deductible, and (ii) to the extent that
Seller Warranty Losses exceed the Cap; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) the
Deductible and the Cap shall not apply to any Loss based on a breach of any
Buyer Fundamental Representation and (ii) nothing contained in this _Section_
__ _ 11.3(b)_ shall be deemed to limit or restrict in any manner any rights
or remedies which Seller has, or might have, at Law, in equity or otherwise,
based on claims arising out of Fraud.

 

11.4 _Limitations on Indemnification_.

 

(a) Any Indemnification Claim required to be made on or prior to
the expiration of the applicable survival period set forth in _Section_ __ _
11.1_, and not made in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 11.6_, shall be
irrevocably and unconditionally released and waived by the Party seeking
indemnification with respect thereto. It is the express intent of the Parties
that, if the applicable period for an item as contemplated by _Section_ __ _
11.1_ is shorter than the statute of limitations that would otherwise have
been applicable to such item, then, by contract, the applicable statute of
limitations with respect to such item shall be reduced to the shortened
survival period contemplated hereby. The Parties further acknowledge that the
time periods set forth in _Section_ __ _ 11.1_ for the assertion of claims
under this Agreement are the result of arms length negotiation between the
Parties and that they intend for the time periods to be enforced as agreed
by the Parties.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no
Party shall, in any event, be liable to any other Person for any
consequential, incidental, indirect, special or punitive damages, except, in
each case, in the case of Fraud or to the extent payable in respect of a Third
Party Claim. 

(c) In the event of any breach giving rise to an
indemnification obligation under this _Article XI_ , the Indemnified Party
shall take and cause its Affiliates to take, or cooperate with the
Indemnifying Party if so requested by the Indemnifying Party in order to take
all commercially reasonable measures to mitigate the consequences of the
related breach.

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any
amounts payable pursuant to the indemnification obligations under this
_Article XI_ shall be paid without duplication and in no event shall any Party
hereto be indemnified under different provisions of this Agreement for Losses
that have already been paid or otherwise taken into account under this
Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, no Buyer
Indemnified Party shall make any claim for indemnification under this
_Article XI_ in respect of any matter that is taken into account in the
calculation of any adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to _Section_ __ _
3.2_ or _Section_ __ _ 3.3_. Further, notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, no Buyer Indemnified Party shall make any claim
for indemnification under this _Article XI_ in respect of any matter set forth
on _Schedule 11.4(d)_ , which matters were taken into account by the Parties
in their negotiation regarding the reduction of the Base Purchase Price from
the amount thereof as set forth in the Original Agreement.

 



86

    

(e) In calculating any Losses there shall be deducted any insurance
proceeds (net of applicable policy deductibles, costs, and expenses actually
incurred in connection with making any claim or obtaining such insurance
proceeds) and other indemnification, contribution or other similar payments
actually recovered by the Indemnified Party or any Affiliate thereof from any
third party with respect thereto. If any such proceeds or payments are
received by an Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates with respect to
any Losses after payment has been made by an Indemnifying Party to the
Indemnified Party with respect thereto, the Indemnified Party shall promptly
pay back, or cause its appropriate Affiliates to pay back, the amount of such
proceeds (up to the amount received by the Indemnified Party with respect to
such Losses, subject to the limitations herein) to the Indemnifying Party.

 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in no event shall
any Buyer Indemnified Party be entitled to make any claim for indemnification
hereunder based on or in connection with, and Seller shall have no liability
to any Buyer Indemnified Party based on or in connection with, any Loss or
Losses resulting or arising from any change in the Brand Performance (except
to the extent resulting from the Seller Parties failure to comply with their
respective obligations during the Pre-Closing Period under  _Section_ __ _
7.1_).

11.5 _Tax Treatment of Indemnification Payments_.

 

All indemnification payments made under this _Article XI_ shall be deemed
adjustments to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes, unless otherwise required
by applicable Law.

11.6 _Notice of Indemnification Claim._  

If the Indemnified Party shall become aware of any Indemnification Claim, the
Indemnified Party shall reasonably promptly give notice thereof to the
Indemnifying Party. Such notice shall specify whether the Indemnification
Claim arises as a result of a claim by a third party against the Indemnified
Party (a "Third Party Claim") or whether the Indemnification Claim does not
so arise, and shall also specify with reasonable particularity (to the extent
that the information is available) the factual basis for the Indemnification
Claim and the amount of the Indemnification Claim, if known or estimable. If
the Indemnified Party does not reasonably promptly give notice of any
Indemnification Claim as specified above, such failure shall not affect the
Indemnified Partys right to indemnification (subject to the limitations set
forth in this _Article XI_ ) for Losses in connection with such
Indemnification Claim, except to the extent the Indemnifying Party forfeits
rights or defenses by reason of such failure.

 

11.7 _Third Party Claims._

 

(a) With respect to any Third Party Claims or any audit or
administrative or judicial proceeding for which an Indemnified Party may have
a claim for indemnification, the Indemnifying Party shall have the right, at
its expense and at its election, to assume control of the negotiation,
settlement and defense of the Third Party Claim through counsel of its
choice, which counsel shall be reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party,
so long as (i) the Indemnifying Party conducts the defense of the Third Party
Claim actively and diligently, and (ii) the Indemnifying Party provides the
Indemnified Party with reasonable evidence that the Indemnifying Party will
have the

 



87

    

 financial resources to defend against the Third Party Claim and fulfill its
indemnification obligations hereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the
Indemnifying Party is Seller, the Indemnifying Party shall not have the right
to assume such control in respect of Third Party Claims (x) asserted directly
by or on behalf of a Person that is a supplier or customer of the Business
that is not then a supplier or customer of Seller or any of its Affiliates as
of such date, (y) that seek an injunction or other equitable relief against
the Indemnified Party or (z) after such time as Seller has indemnified Buyer
Indemnified Parties for Buyer Warranty Losses in an aggregate amount equal to
the applicable limitation set forth in _Section_ __ _ 11.2(b)(iii)_. The
election of the Indemnifying Party to assume such control shall be made within
thirty (30) days of receipt of notice of the Third Party Claim, failing which
the Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to have elected not to assume such
control. If the Indemnifying Party elects to assume such control, the
Indemnified Party shall have the right to be informed and consulted
with respect to the negotiation, settlement or defenses of such Third Party
Claim and to retain counsel to act on its behalf, but the fees and
disbursements of such counsel shall be paid by the Indemnified Party unless
the named parties to any Legal Proceeding include both the Indemnifying Party
and the Indemnified Party and a representation of both the Indemnifying Party
and the Indemnified Party by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to an
actual or potential conflict of interest between them (such as the
availability of different defenses), in which case the Indemnifying Party
shall bear the reasonable costs and expenses of a single counsel to the
Indemnified Party. If the Indemnifying Party, having elected to assume
such control, thereafter fails to defend the Third Party Claim diligently or
within a reasonable period of time, subject to _Section_ __ _ 11.7(b)_, the
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to assume such control, and the
Indemnifying Party shall have the right to be informed and consulted with
respect to the negotiation, settlement or defenses of such Third Party Claim.
If the Indemnifying Party does not assume or retain control of the
negotiation, settlement and defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified
Party shall control the negotiation, settlement and defense of such Third
Party Claim, but in such case, the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to
be informed and consulted with respect to the negotiation, settlement or
defenses of such Third Party Claim and to retain counsel to act on its behalf
at its sole cost and expense.

 

(b) Whether or not the Indemnifying Party assumes control of the
negotiation, settlement or defense of any Third Party Claim, unless such
settlement provides for no fault on the part of the Indemnified Party and
provides for a full release, in customary form, of the Indemnified Party, and
there are no obligations of the Indemnified Party under such settlement other
than monetary damages or other monetary payments to be paid for by the
Indemnifying Party, the Indemnifying Party shall not settle any Third Party
Claim without the written consent of the Indemnified Party, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, if (i) the Indemnifying Party does not assume
or retain control of the negotiation, settlement and defense of a Third Party
Claim and (ii) either of clauses (x) or (y) of the proviso set forth in the
first sentence of _Section_ __ _ 11.7(a)_ applies, the Indemnified Party
shall not settle any Third Party Claim without the written consent of the
Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed.

 

(c) The Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall cooperate
fully with each other with respect to Third Party Claims and, regardless of
which party has control thereof as provided for herein, shall keep each other
reasonably advised with respect thereto.

11.8 _Direct Claims._

 

The Indemnifying Party shall have sixty (60) days after its receipt of notice
with respect to any Indemnification Claim that does not result from a Third
Party Claim (a "Direct Claim") to respond in writing to such Direct Claim. If
the Indemnifying Party does not timely notify the Indemnified Party that the
Indemnifying Party disputes its liability to the Indemnified Party with
respect to such Direct Claim, such Direct Claim shall be conclusively deemed a
liability of the Indemnifying Party pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 11.2_ or
_Section_ __ _ 11.3_, as applicable. If the Indemnifying Party has timely
disputed its liability with respect to such Direct Claim, the Indemnifying
Party and the Indemnified Party shall proceed in good faith to negotiate a
resolution of such dispute and, if not resolved through negotiations, such
dispute shall be resolved in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 12.9_.

 

11.9 _Manner of Payment._

 

Within ten (10) Business Days after the amount of any Losses for which an
Indemnified Party is indemnified pursuant to this _Article XI_ is finally
determined, the Indemnifying Party shall pay to such Indemnified Party such
amount in cash by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated in writing by such Indemnified Party at least three (3) Business
Days prior to the payment date.

11.10 _Exclusive Remedies_.

 

Following the Closing Date, except as otherwise expressly provided herein or
with respect to claims for Fraud, the sole and exclusive remedy for any claim
under this Agreement, including any inaccuracy or breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant, obligation or other agreement contained in
this Agreement shall be indemnification in accordance with this _Article XI_
, and no Person will have any other entitlement, remedy or recourse, whether
in contract, tort or otherwise. In furtherance of the foregoing, each Party
hereby waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, any and all rights,
claims and causes of action for any breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant, obligation or other agreement set forth herein it may have against
the other Party hereto and its Affiliates arising under or based upon any Law,
except pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in this _Article
XI_ and except as otherwise expressly provided herein or with respect to
claims for Fraud. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this _Section_ __ _ 11.10_
shall not (a) interfere with or impede the operation of the provisions of
_Section_ __ _ 3.3_ providing for the resolution of certain disputes relating
to the adjustment of the Purchase Price between the Parties and/or by
the Independent Accountant or (b) limit the rights of the Parties to seek
specific performance in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 12.10_.

 

ARTICLE XII

 

MISCELLANEOUS.

 

12.1 _Public Announcements_.

 

Neither Party shall (nor shall it permit any of its Affiliates to) issue any
press release or public announcement concerning this Agreement or the
Transactions or make any other public disclosure containing or pertaining to
the terms of this Agreement without obtaining the other Partys prior written
approval, which approval will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed,
unless, in the

 



89

    

 judgment of the Party seeking to disclose, disclosure is otherwise required
by Law or by the rules of any stock exchange on which such disclosing Party or
its parent company lists securities, provided that, to the extent any
disclosure is required by Law or stock exchange rule, the Party intending to
make such disclosure shall use its commercially reasonable efforts consistent
with such Law or stock exchange rule to consult with the other Party with
respect to the timing and text thereof prior to making such disclosure.

 

12.2 _Severability_.

 

In the event that any provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof,
becomes or is declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal,
void or unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement will continue in full
force and effect and the application of such provision to other persons or
circumstances will be interpreted so as reasonably to effect the intent of
the Parties. The Parties further agree to replace such void or unenforceable
provision of this Agreement with a valid and enforceable provision that will
achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of
such void or unenforceable provision.

12.3 _Modification and Waiver_.

 

This Agreement may not be amended or modified in any manner, except by an
instrument in writing signed by each of the Parties. No waiver by any Party
of any of the provisions hereof shall be effective unless explicitly set forth
in writing and signed by the Party so waiving. No waiver by any Party shall
operate or be construed as a waiver in respect of any failure, breach or
default not expressly identified by such written waiver, whether of a similar
or different character, and whether occurring before or after that waiver. The
failure of any Party to enforce at any time any of the provisions of this
Agreement shall in no way be construed to be a waiver of any such provision,
or in any way affect the right of such Party thereafter to enforce each and
every such provision. No waiver of any breach of this Agreement shall be
deemed to be a waiver of any other or subsequent breach.

12.4 _Interpretation_.

 

For purposes of this Agreement: (a) the words "include," "includes" and
"including" shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation";
(b) the word "or" is not exclusive; and (c) the words "herein," "hereof,"
"hereby," "hereto" and "hereunder" refer to this Agreement as a whole. Unless

terms "provided," "made available" and words of similar import, when used with
respect to any item provided or made available by Seller, shall include any
and all information that has been posted not later than three (3) Business
Days prior to execution and delivery of this Agreement in the electronic data
room established by Seller in connection with the Transactions and not
removed on or prior to the date of this Agreement. This Agreement shall be
construed without regard to any presumption or rule

 



90

    

 requiring construction or interpretation against the party drafting an
instrument or causing any instrument to be drafted. The Schedules (including
the Seller Disclosure Schedules) and Exhibits referred to herein shall be
construed with, and as an integral part of, this Agreement to the same extent
as if they were set forth verbatim herein.

the summons and complaint and any other process in any action or proceeding
relating to the Transactions, for and on behalf of itself or any of its
properties or assets, in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 12.5_, provided that

irrevocably submits itself and its properties and assets to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the trial courts of San Francisco, California or the United
States District Court for the Eastern District of California for the purpose

to the personal jurisdiction of the trial courts of San Francisco, California

or counterclaim was brought in an inconvenient court and agrees not to plead

proceeding or counterclaim relating to this Agreement or the Transaction
Documents or the Transactions in any court other than the aforesaid courts.
Each Party agrees that a final judgment in any action or proceeding in such
courts as provided above shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by
applicable Law. The Parties hereby consent to and grant any such court
jurisdiction over the person of such Parties and, to the extent permitted by
Law, over the subject matter of such dispute and agree that mailing of
process or other papers in connection with any such action or proceeding in
the manner provided in _Section_ __ _ 12.5_ or in such other manner as may be
permitted by Law shall be valid and sufficient service thereof.

 

(c) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY
ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR THE OTHER TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS IS LIKELY TO
INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT

 



92

    

 ISSUES AND, THEREFORE, EACH SUCH PARTY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY
WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LEGAL ACTION
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE OTHER TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS
OR THE TRANSACTIONS. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO
REPRESENTATIVE OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE,
THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER IN THE
EVENT OF A LEGAL ACTION, (II) SUCH PARTY HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF
THIS WAIVER, (III) SUCH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (IV) SUCH
PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS,

12.10 _Specific Performance_ _and Injunctive Relief_.

Each Party acknowledges and hereby agrees that any breach of this Agreement,
including a breach of a Partys obligations under _Section_ __ _ 7.6_, would
give rise to irreparable harm for which monetary damages would not be an
adequate remedy. Accordingly, the Parties acknowledge and hereby agree that
in the event of any breach or threatened breach by a Party of any of its
respective covenants, obligations or agreements set forth in this Agreement,
the other Party shall be entitled to an injunction, including temporary
restraining orders and preliminary injunctions in the nature of mandatory
injunctions, to prevent breaches of this Agreement by the breaching Party and
to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement against the
breaching Party. The availability of injunctive relief under this _Section_
__ _ 12.10_ is in addition to any other remedy to which the non-breaching
Party is entitled at law or in equity. Each Party hereby waives any
requirement for the posting of any bond or similar collateral in connection
therewith. Each Party hereby agrees not to raise any objections to the
availability of the equitable remedy of specific performance to prevent or
restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement by the other Party
and to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement to
prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the
covenants, obligations and agreements of the Parties under this Agreement.

12.11 _Waiver of Conflicts_.

 

Seller has engaged Nixon Peabody LLP ("NP") as its legal counsel in connection
with the Transactions. In the event that NP now or in the future represents
Buyer in connection with matters unrelated to the Transactions, Buyer hereby
(a) consents to the continued representation of Seller or any other Seller
Party by NP in connection with the Transactions, and (b) waives any actual,
potential or alleged conflict of interest that exists or may arise from NPs
representation of any Seller Party in connection with the Transactions,
including with respect to the determination of the Closing Book Value of the
Product Inventory or any other adjustment to the Purchase Price hereunder, or
claims for indemnification pursuant to _Article XI_ and any Legal Proceeding
or other dispute resolution proceedings of any kind in respect of the
foregoing. Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to be a waiver of any
privilege or consent to the disclosure of any privileged information. Buyer
hereby acknowledges that Buyer has obtained independent legal advice in
connection with the foregoing consent and waiver.

 



93

    

12.12 _Counterparts; Electronic Delivery_.

 

This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which
shall be deemed to be an original, but all of which shall constitute one
agreement. This Agreement and any signed agreement or instrument entered into
in connection with this Agreement, and any amendments hereto or thereto, to
the extent delivered by means of a facsimile, electronic mail or other means
of electronic transmission shall be treated in all manner and respects as an
original agreement or instrument and shall be considered to have the same
binding legal effect as if it were the original signed version thereof
delivered in person. 

12.13 _Entire Agreement_.

 

This Agreement, the other Transaction Documents and that certain binding
letter agreement, dated as of December 11, 2019, by and between Buyer and
Seller constitute the entire agreement and understanding between the Parties
with respect to the subject matter contained herein and therein and supersedes
all prior agreements, understandings, negotiations, representations and
statements, whether oral, written, implied or expressed, relating to such
subject matter, including the Original Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt,
the Parties agree that the Original Agreement is terminated in all respects,
is null and void and of no further force or effect, and the Parties have no
further rights or remedies thereunder as of the date hereof. In the event of
any inconsistency between the statements in the body of this Agreement and
those in the other Transaction Documents, the Exhibits and Schedules (other
than an exception expressly set forth as such in the Schedules), the
statements in the body of this Agreement will control.

_SCHEDULE 3.4(a)_

 

CALCULATION OF EARN-OUT AMOUNTS

 



   1. |

_First Earn-Out Payment_. The First Earn-Out Payment, if any, shall be, (a) if
the Depletion Volume during the First Earn-Out Period is equal to or greater
than the amount in the "Max" row under the heading "Depletion Volume" in the
table below (the "Earn Out Schedule") (such amount, the "Max Depletion
Volume"), Two Hundred Fifty Million Dollars ($250,000,000), (b) if the
Depletion Volume during the First Earn-Out Period is equal to or less than
the amount in the "Min" row under the heading "Depletion Volume" in the Earn
Out Schedule (the "Min Depletion Volume"), Zero Dollars ($0), and (c) if the
Depletion Volume during the First Earn-Out Period is between the Max Depletion
Volume and Min Depletion Volume, an amount calculated using linear
interpolation based on the amount by which the Depletion Volume exceeds the
Min Depletion Volume. The difference between the Max Depletion Volume and the
Min Depletion Volume is referred to as the "Case Range." 

---|--- 
 



   2. |

_Second Earn-Out Payment_. The Second Earn-Out Payment, if any, shall be: (a)
(i) if the Depletion Volume during the Second Earn-Out Period is equal to or
greater than the Max Depletion Volume, Two Hundred Fifty Million Dollars
($250,000,000), (ii) if the Depletion Volume during the Second Earn-Out Period
is equal to or less than the Min Depletion Volume, Zero Dollars ($0) and (c)
if the Depletion Volume during the Second Earn-Out Period is between the Max
Depletion Volume and the Min Depletion Volume, an amount calculated using
linear interpolation based on the amount by which the Depletion Volume exceeds
the Min Depletion Volume; _minus_ (b) the amount of the First Earn-Out
Payment, if any, paid by Buyer to Seller; _provided_ that, in the event that
such subtraction results in a negative number, the Second Earn-Out Payment
shall be Zero Dollars ($0) and, for the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall
any refund, clawback or other payment be owed to Buyer by Seller as a result
of such negative number; and  _provided_ , _further_ , that the amount of the
Second Earn-Out Payment shall be equal to Zero Dollars ($0) in the event that
the Depletion Volume during the Second Earn-Out Period is less than the
Depletion Volume during the First Earn-Out Period.

_Sale or Discontinuance of Brands; Divested Assets and Liabilities_.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Schedule 3.4(a)_ or the
Agreement, in the event that: 

---|--- 



     | a. |

any Brand becomes Divested Assets and Liabilities pursuant to Section 7.6(f)
of the Agreement or Buyer Discontinues or sells any Brand to a third party
during the First Earn-Out Period, then the amount of the First Earn-Out
Payment shall be calculated as set forth in Section 1 of this _Schedule
3.4(a)_ , based on the Earn-Out Schedule, as adjusted pursuant to Section 4 of
this _Schedule 3.4(a)_ ; or 

---|---|--- 
 



     | b. |

Buyer Discontinues or sells any Brand to a third party during the
Second Earn-Out Period, then the amount of the Second Earn-Out Payment shall
be calculated as set forth in Section 2 of this _Schedule 3.4(a)_ , based on
the Earn-Out Schedule, as adjusted pursuant to Section 4 of this _Schedule
3.4(a)_ ; _provided_ that, in determining whether the Depletion Volume during
the Second Earn-Out Period is less than or equal to the Depletion Volume
during the First Earn-Out Period for the purpose of Section 4 of this
_Schedule 3.4(a)_ only, all depletions of products sold under such
Discontinued or sold Brand shall be disregarded with respect to both the First
Earn-Out Period and the Second Earn-Out Period.  

---|---|--- 

For the purposes of this _Schedule 3.4(a)_ , a Brand shall be deemed to
be "Discontinued" if (i) Buyer has notified all of its distributors that
Buyer will cease production and sale of all products sold under such Brand,
and (ii) Buyer has not sold any products under such Brand to any of
its distributors for a period of ninety (90) days.



   4. |

_Adjustment to Earn-Out Schedule._ In the event any Brand becomes Divested
Assets and Liabilities pursuant to Section 7.6(f) of the Agreement or Buyer
Discontinues or sells any Brand to a third party during the First Earn-Out
Period or the Second Earn-Out Period, then for the purposes of calculating the
First Earn-Out Payment or Second Earn-Out Payment, as the case may be,
in accordance with Section 3 of this _Schedule 3.4(a)_ , the Earn-Out
Schedule shall be adjusted as follows: 

---|--- 



     | a. |

First, the "Aggregate Baseline Depletion Volume" equal to 23,097,212 shall
be reduced by the number set forth opposite the applicable Brand in the
"Brand Baseline Depletion Volume" column of the table below. The number
resulting from such reduction is referred to herein as the "Adjusted
Aggregate Baseline Depletion Volume."

     |

b. Second, each of the Max Depletion Volume and Min Depletion Volume shall
be adjusted by multiplying the Adjusted Aggregate Baseline Depletion Volume
by the "Adjustment Percentage" applicable to the Max Depletion Volume or the
Min Depletion Volume, as the case may be, and the product of such
multiplication shall replace the number in the "Depletion Volume" applicable
thereto (as adjusted, the "Adjusted Max Depletion Volume" and the "Adjusted
Min Depletion Volume"). 

---|--- 
 



     |

The following is an illustrative example for the purpose of demonstrating the
calculation of Earn-Out Amounts impacted by a hypothetical adjustment made
pursuant to this Section 4 of this _Schedule 3.4(a)_ : 

---|---

[****] designates the confidential portion of information omitted because it
is both (i) not material and (ii) would be competitively harmful if publicly
disclosed.

         |

If Depletion Volume during the First Earn-Out Period were equal
to 19,731,734, the Depletion Volume would exceed the Min Depletion Volume by
1,022,992 cases (the amount of any such excess, the "Depletion Volume Excess")
out of a Case Range of 3,473,820 and, by linear interpolation, the First Earn-
Out Payment would be equal to $73,621,546 ((1,022,992/3,473,820) _multiplied
by_ $250,000,000). 

---|--- 



     |

If during the Second Earn-Out Period, Buyer Discontinued or sold the [****]
Brand to a third party, then the Aggregate Baseline Depletion Volume would be
reduced by 2,817,647, resulting in an Adjusted Aggregate Baseline Depletion
Volume of 20,279,565. 

---|--- 
 



     |

The Adjusted Max Depletion Volume and Adjusted Min Depletion Volume would be
determined by multiplying the Adjusted Aggregate Baseline Depletion Volume of
20,279,565 by the "Adjustment Percentage" applicable to the Max Depletion
Volume or the Min Depletion Volume, as the case may be, and the product of
such multiplication would replace the number in the "Depletion Volume" column
applicable thereto. 

---|--- 



     |

As a result, the Adjusted Max Depletion Volume would be 19,476,494 and the
Adjusted Min Depletion Volume would be 16,426,521. 

---|--- 



     |

If Depletion Volume during the Second Earn-Out Period were equal
to 17,940,771, the Depletion Volume Excess would be 1,514,250 cases out of a
Case Range of 3,049,973 and, by linear interpolation, the Second Earn-Out
Payment would be equal to $50,498,405, which is determined by calculating:
(a) the amount of $124,119,951 by linear interpolation between the Adjusted
Max Depletion Volume and the Adjusted Min Depletion Volume
((1,514,250/3,049,973) _multiplied by_ $250,000,000); _minus_ (b) the amount
of the First Earn-Out Payment ($73,621,546). 

---|--- 



     |

Finally, the Depletion Volume for both the First Earn-Out Period and the
Second Earn-Out Period would be recalculated, in each case, excluding all
depletions of products sold under the [****] Brand. If such recalculated
Depletion Volume for the Second Earn-Out Period were greater than such
recalculated Depletion Volume for the First Earn-Out Period, then the Second
Earn-Out Payment of $50,498,405 would be payable to Seller. If, however, such
recalculated Depletion Volume for the Second Earn-Out Period were less than or
equal to such recalculated Depletion Volume for the First Earn-Out Period,
then the Second Earn-Out Payment would be equal to Zero Dollars ($0).
