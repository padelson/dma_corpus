                                                                               4

          (b) Cancelation of Treasury Stock and Parent- Owned Stock. Each share
     of Company Common Stock that is owned by the Company or by any wholly owned
     subsidiary of the Company and each share of Company Common Stock that is
     owned by Parent or Sub shall automatically be canceled and retired and
     shall cease to exist, and no Parent Common Stock or other consideration
     shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

          (c) Conversion of Company Common Stock. Subject to Section 2.02(e),
     each issued and outstanding share of Company Common Stock (other than
     shares to be canceled in accordance with Section 2.01(b)) shall be changed
     and converted into the right to receive the Conversion Number of validly
     issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of Parent Common Stock. As of
     the Effective Time of the Merger, all such shares of Company Common Stock
     shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and
     retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate
     representing any such shares of Company Common Stock shall cease to have
     any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive, upon the
     surrender of such certificates, certificates representing the shares of
     Parent Common Stock, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common
     Stock and any dividends to the extent provided in Section 2.02(c) to be
     issued or paid in consideration therefor upon surrender of such certificate
     in accordance with Section 2.02, without interest.

          (d) Issuance of Surviving Corporation Common Stock to Parent. The
     Surviving Corporation shall issue shares of its common stock (the
     "Surviving Corporation Common Stock") to Parent in consideration for Parent
     issuing Parent Common Stock to former stockholders of the Company pursuant
     to Section 2.01(c). The number of shares of Surviving Corporation Common
     Stock issued to Parent shall be equal to the number of shares of Company
     Common Stock (other than shares to be canceled in accordance with Section
     2.01(b)) outstanding immediately before the Effective Time of the Merger.

          (e) Conversion of Company Special Voting Stock. As of the Effective
     Time of the Merger, the single outstanding share of special voting stock,
     par value $1.00 per share, of the Company ("Company Special Voting Stock")
     shall be converted into the right to receive one First Preferred Share,
     Series C Special Voting Share of Parent (the "Parent Special Voting
     Share"), which shall have the terms set forth in


<PAGE>


                                                                               5

     Exhibit C (the "Special Voting Stock Merger Consideration"). As of the
     Effective Time of the Merger, the share of Company Special Voting Stock
     shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and
     retired and shall cease to exist, and the holder of the certificate which,
     prior to the Effective Time of the Merger, represented such share of
     Company Special Voting Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect
     thereto, except the right to receive the Special Voting Stock Merger
     Consideration.

          (f) Adjustment of Conversion Number. Notwithstanding the foregoing
     (and in addition to any adjustment to the Conversion Number under Section
     5.06), if between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time of the
     Merger the outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock are changed into a
     different number of shares or a different class, by reason of the
     occurrence or record date of any stock dividend, subdivision,
     reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination, consolidation,
     exchange of shares or similar transaction, the Conversion Number shall be
     appropriately adjusted to reflect such stock dividend, subdivision,
     reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination, consolidation,
     exchange or similar transaction.

          SECTION 2.02. Exchange of Certificates. (a) Exchange Agent.
Immediately following the Effective Time of the Merger, Parent shall deposit
with Equiserve Trust Company N.A. or such other bank or trust company as may be
designated by Parent and the Company (the "Exchange Agent"), for the benefit of
the holders of shares of Company Common Stock ("Company Stock"), for exchange in
accordance with this Article II, through the Exchange Agent, certificates
representing the shares of Parent Common Stock ("Parent Stock") (such shares of
Parent Stock, together with any dividends or distributions with respect thereto
with a record date after the Effective Time of the Merger, being hereinafter
referred to as the "Exchange Fund") issuable pursuant to Section 2.01 in
exchange for outstanding shares of Company Stock.

          (b) Exchange Procedures. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time of the Merger, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of
record of a certificate or certificates (the "Certificates") which immediately
prior to the Effective Time of the Merger represented outstanding shares of
Company Stock, other than shares to be canceled or retired in accordance with
Section 2.01(b), (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall


<PAGE>


                                                                               6

specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange
Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent may
reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
the Certificates in exchange for certificates representing shares of Parent
Stock. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancelation to the Exchange Agent or
to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with such
letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably
be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor a certificate representing that number
of whole shares of Parent Stock which such holder has the right to receive
pursuant to the provisions of this Article II, and the Certificate so
surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership
of Company Stock which is not registered in the transfer records of the Company,
a certificate representing the proper number of shares of Parent Stock may be
issued to a person other than the person in whose name the Certificate so
surrendered is registered, if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or
otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the person requesting such issuance
shall pay any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the issuance of
shares of Parent Stock to a person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of Parent that such tax has been
paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section
2.02, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time of
the Merger to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the
certificate representing the appropriate number of whole shares of Parent Stock,
cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Stock and any dividends to the
extent provided in Section 2.02(c) as contemplated by this Section 2.02. No
interest will be paid or will accrue on any cash payable in lieu of any
fractional shares of Parent Stock.

          (c) Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares. No dividends or
other distributions with respect to Parent Stock with a record date after the
Effective Time of the Merger shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
Certificate with respect to the shares of Parent Stock issuable in respect
thereof, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares shall be paid to any
such holder pursuant to Section 2.02(e) until the surrender of such Certificate
in accordance with this Article II. Subject to the effect of applicable laws,
following surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be paid to the holder
of the


<PAGE>


                                                                               7

certificate representing whole shares of Parent Stock issued in exchange
therefor, without interest, (i) at the time of such surrender, the amount of any
cash payable in lieu of a fractional share of Parent Stock to which such holder
is entitled pursuant to Section 2.02(e) and the amount of dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time of the Merger
theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of Parent Stock, and (ii) at
the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions
with a record date after the Effective Time of the Merger but prior to such
surrender and a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with respect
to such whole shares of Parent Stock.

          (d) No Further Ownership Rights in Company Stock. All shares of Parent
Stock issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates in accordance with
the terms of this Article II (including any cash paid pursuant to Section
2.02(c) or 2.02(e)) shall be deemed to have been issued (and paid) in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Stock theretofore
represented by such Certificates, subject, however, to the Surviving
Corporation's obligation to pay any dividends or make any other distributions
with a record date prior to the Effective Time of the Merger which may have been
declared or made by the Company on such shares of Company Stock in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement or prior to the date of this Agreement and
which remain unpaid at the Effective Time of the Merger, and there shall be no
further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation of the shares of Company Stock which were outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time of the Merger. If, after the Effective Time of the
Merger, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange
Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this
Article II, except as otherwise provided by law.

          (e) No Fractional Shares. (i) No certificates or scrip representing
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for
exchange of Certificates, and such fractional share interests shall not entitle
the owner thereof to vote or to any rights of a stockholder of Parent.

          (ii) In lieu of such fractional share interests, Parent shall pay to
each former holder of shares of Company Common Stock an amount in cash equal to
the product obtained by multiplying (A) the fractional share interest of Parent
Common Stock to which such former holder (after taking into account all shares
of Company Common Stock held at the


<PAGE>


                                                                               8

Effective Time by such holder) would otherwise be entitled by (B) the per share
closing price of Parent Common Stock on the Closing Date, as such price is
reported on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (the "NYSE") Composite
Transactions Tape (as reported by The Wall Street Journal (Northeast edition),
or, if not reported thereby, as reported by any other authoritative source).

          (f) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
which remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates for six months after
the Effective Time of the Merger shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and
any holders of Certificates who have not theretofore complied with this Article
II shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of their claim for Parent
Stock, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Stock and any dividends
or distributions with respect to Parent Stock.

          (g) No Liability. None of Parent, Sub, the Company or the Exchange
Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of any shares of Parent Stock (or
dividends or distributions with respect thereto) or cash from the Exchange Fund
delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar law. If any Certificates shall not have been surrendered
prior to seven years after the Effective Time of the Merger (or immediately
prior to such earlier date on which any shares of Parent Stock, any cash in lieu
of fractional shares of Parent Stock or any dividends or distributions with
respect to Parent Stock in respect of such Certificate would otherwise escheat
to or become the property of any Governmental Entity (as defined in Section
3.01(d)), any such shares, cash, dividends or distributions in respect of such
Certificate shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, become the
property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest
of any person previously entitled thereto.

          (h) Investment of Exchange Fund. The Exchange Agent shall invest any
cash included in the Exchange Fund, as directed by Parent, on a daily basis. Any
interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to
Parent.

          (i) Withholding Rights. Each of the Surviving Corporation and Parent
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise
payable by such person pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it is required
to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the
Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign law relating to Taxes. To the
extent that

                                                                               9

amounts are so withheld by the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may
be, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the person who would otherwise have been entitled to such
withheld amounts.

          SECTION 2.03. Treatment of Exchangeable Shares. (a) Prior to the
Effective Time of the Merger, the Board of Directors of the Company, the Board
of Directors of Parent and the Board of Directors of Homestake Canada, or any
appropriate committee of them, respectively, shall adopt appropriate resolutions
and, along with the Company, Parent and Homestake Canada, shall take all other
actions required under the Trust Agreement and under the provisions attaching to
the Exchangeable Shares (the "Exchangeable Share Provisions") to provide that at
and after the Effective Time of the Merger each outstanding Exchangeable Share
shall thereafter be exchangeable for that number of shares of Parent Common
Stock equal to the Conversion Number.

          (b) Without limiting the generality of Section 2.03(a), at or before
the Effective Time of the Merger:

          (i) the Company and Homestake Canada (including its Board of
     Directors) shall comply with their respective obligations under the
     Exchangeable Share Provisions and the Trust Agreement;

          (ii) Parent, the Company, Homestake Canada and the Exchangeables
     Trustee shall execute and deliver a supplement to the Trust Agreement
     providing for, among other things, the assumption by Parent of the
     covenants and obligations of the Company under the Trust Agreement (the
     "Trust Agreement Supplement");

          (iii) Parent shall authorize, create and issue the Parent Special
     Voting Share and at the Effective Time Parent shall deliver to the
     Exchangeables Trustee a certificate evidencing the Parent Special Voting
     Share, as required by the Trust Agreement Supplement;

          (iv) Parent, Company and Homestake Canada shall take all such actions
     as may reasonably be required to permit the continued unrestricted
     tradeability in Canada of the Exchangeable Shares and the issuance and
     first resale in Canada and the United States of America of the shares of
     Parent Common Stock issued upon exchange of the Exchangeable Shares from
     time to time, in each case without requiring the holder of the relevant
     share, in connection with any such trade or

                                                                              10

     resale, to qualify with, file any document or take any proceeding with, or
     obtain any further order, ruling or consent from, any Governmental Entity
     under any Canadian or United States federal, provincial, state or
     territorial securities or other laws or pursuant to the rules and
     regulations of any Governmental Entity administering such laws, or the
     fulfillment of any other legal requirement in any such jurisdiction (other
     than, with respect to such first resales, any restrictions on transfer by
     reason of, among other things, a holder being a "control person" of Parent
     for purposes of Canadian or United States federal, provincial or
     territorial securities laws). Without limiting the generality of the
     foregoing, such actions shall include the filing with the SEC (as defined
     in Section 3.01(a)) of a registration statement on Form F- 3 under the
     Securities Act (as defined in 3.01(a)) for the exchange and resale of the
     Exchangeable Shares, the confirmation of the continued effectiveness,
     following the Merger, of all existing Canadian securities regulatory orders
     and rulings, or the granting of new such orders and rulings, respecting
     such unrestricted tradeability of the Exchangeable Shares and such
     unrestricted issuance and first resale of the shares of Parent Common Stock
     issuable upon exchange of the Exchangeable Shares from time to time, and
     respecting the satisfaction of Homestake Canada's continuous and timely
     disclosure obligations under Canadian Securities Laws through the filing
     and provision of information relating to Parent;

          (v) Parent shall take all action necessary to authorize and reserve
     that number of shares of Parent Common Stock sufficient for issuance upon
     all exchanges of the outstanding Exchangeable Shares (other than
     Exchangeable Shares held by Parent, its subsidiaries and affiliates,
     including the Company and Homestake Canada Holdings Company) from time to
     time after the Effective Time of the Merger; and

          (vi) Parent presently intends to take all action necessary to exercise
     the Liquidation Call Right (as defined in the Trust Agreement) pursuant to
     Section 5.2 of the Trust Agreement; the Retraction Call Right (as defined
     in the Trust Agreement) pursuant to Section 6.2 of the Trust Agreement; and
     the Redemption Call Right (as defined in the Trust Agreement) pursuant to
     Section 7.2 of the Trust Agreement.

                                   ARTICLE III

                         Representations and Warranties
                         ------------------------------

          SECTION 3.01. Representations and Warranties of the Company. Except as
disclosed in the Filed Company SEC Documents (as defined in Section 3.01(g)) or
as set forth in the Company Disclosure Letter (as defined in Section 3.01(b)),
the Company represents and warrants to Parent and Sub as follows:

          (a) Organization, Standing and Corporate Power. Each of the Company
     and each Company Significant Subsidiary (as hereinafter defined) is a
     corporation, partnership or other legal entity duly organized, validly
     existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction in which
     it is organized and has the requisite power and authority to carry on its
     business as now being conducted. Each of the Company and each of its direct
     and indirect subsidiaries (each a "Company Subsidiary") is duly qualified
     or licensed to do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in
     which the nature of its business or the ownership or leasing of its
     properties makes such qualification or licensing necessary, other than in
     such jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or licensed,
     individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be
     expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. For purposes of this
     Agreement, a "Company Material Adverse Effect" means (i) a material adverse
     effect on the business, properties, financial condition or results of
     operations of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole
     (other than effects relating to (A) the gold mining industry in general
     that does not have a materially disproportionate impact on the Company and
     the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (B) general economic, financial
     or securities market conditions in the United States or elsewhere, (C) the
     announcement of this Agreement, (D) the refusal of Parent to consent,
     following a good faith request by the Company, to the taking of any action
     by the Company otherwise prohibited by Section 4.01(a)(iv), 4.01(a)(vi),
     4.01(a)(vii) or 4.01(a)(viii), (E) the relative values of the United States
     dollar, the Canadian dollar or the Australian dollar or any two of them,
     (F) civil or political unrest in Argentina or Chile that does not have a

     Company to perform its obligations under this Agreement in a timely manner.
     The Company has made available to Parent complete and correct copies of its
     Restated Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws, in each case as amended
     to the date of this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, a "Company
     Significant Subsidiary" means any Company Subsidiary that constitutes a
     significant subsidiary of the Company within the meaning of Rule 1-02 of
     Regulation S-X of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC").

          (b) Company Subsidiaries. Section 3.01(b) of the letter from the
     Company, dated the date of this Agreement, addressed to Parent (the
     "Company Disclosure Letter") lists each Company Significant Subsidiary and
     the ownership or interest therein of the Company. All the outstanding
     shares of capital stock of each Company Significant Subsidiary have been
     validly issued and are fully paid and nonassessable and are owned by the
     Company, by another subsidiary of the Company or by the Company and another
     Company Subsidiary, free and clear of all pledges, claims, liens, charges,
     encumbrances and security interests of any kind or nature whatsoever
     (collectively, "Liens").

          (c) Capital Structure. The authorized capital stock of the Company
     (the "Company Capital Stock") consists of (i) 450,000,000 shares of Company
     Common Stock, (ii) 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $1.00
     per share, of which 4,500,000 shares have been designated as "Series A
     Participating Cumulative Preferred Stock", par value $1.00 per share (the
     "Company Series A Preferred Stock"), and (iii) one share of Company Special
     Voting Stock, which entitles the holder thereof to vote, together with the
     holders of Company Common Stock, on all matters submitted for the vote of
     the holders of Company Common Stock with the number of votes represented by
     the Special Voting Stock being equal to the number of outstanding
     Exchangeable Shares (other than Exchangeable Shares held by the Company,
     the Company Subsidiaries and its affiliates). The shares of Company Series
     A Preferred Stock are issuable in connection with the rights to purchase
     shares of Company Series A Preferred Stock (the "Company Rights") that were
     issued pursuant to the Rights Agreement dated October 16, 1987, as amended
     on October 15, 1997, and December 3, 1998 (as amended from time to time,

     director and consultant stock options (the "Company Stock Options") and
     65,400 shares of Homestake Canada common stock were reserved for issuance

     having the right to vote) on any matters on which stockholders of the
     Company or any Company Subsidiary must vote. Except as set forth above, as

     Company Subsidiary to issue, grant, extend or enter into any such Options
     (other than obligations with respect to immaterial joint venture
     arrangements to which the Company or the Company Subsidiaries are party or

     Company Common Stock that are subject to issuance as aforesaid, upon
     issuance on the terms and conditions specified in the instrument pursuant
     to which they are issuable, will be duly authorized, validly issued, fully
     paid and nonassessable. As of the date of this Agreement, and other than in

     modification or nonrenewal of which, individually or in the aggregate, has
     not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material

     probable violation, notice of revocation, or other communication from or on
     behalf of any Governmental Entity, alleging (A) any violation of any such

     requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Securities Act"), or the

     necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
     circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except to the
     extent that such statements have been modified or superseded by a later
     filed Company SEC Document. The consolidated financial statements of the
     Company included in the Company SEC Documents comply as to form in all
     material respects with applicable accounting requirements and the published
     rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, have been prepared
     in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (except, in the

     of the Company as of the dates thereof and the consolidated results of its
     operations and cash flows for the periods then ended (subject, in the case
     of unaudited statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments). Neither the

     any nature (whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise) which,

     Exchange Act.

     time it is amended or supplemented or at the time it becomes effective
     under the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a material fact
     or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
     necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
     under which they are made, not misleading, or (ii) the Proxy Statement
     will, at the date the Proxy Statement is first mailed to the Company's
     stockholders or at the time of the Company Stockholders Meeting (as defined

     under which they are made, not misleading. The Proxy Statement will comply
     as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange
     Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, except that no
     representation or warranty is made by the Company with respect to
     statements made or incorporated by reference therein based on information
     supplied by Parent or Sub for inclusion or incorporation by reference in
     the Proxy Statement.

          (g) Absence of Certain Changes or Events. Except as disclosed in the

     statutorily-mandated plans or arrangements (collectively, "Company Benefit
     Plans") or any employment agreement between any employee of the Company or
     any Company Subsidiary and the Company or any Company Subsidiary. The
     Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a true and complete list as of the
     date of this Agreement of each material Company Benefit Plan and each
     employment agreement. With respect to each Company Benefit Plan that is an
     equity-based plan, the Company has delivered to Parent a true and complete
     copy of such Company Benefit Plan, unless such Company Benefit Plan is
     disclosed in the Filed Company SEC Documents. With respect to each other
     Company Benefit Plan, the Company will make available to Parent, promptly
     after the date of this Agreement, a true and complete copy of such written
     Company Benefit Plan (or a summary of such unwritten Company Benefit Plan)
     and, as applicable, (A) a copy of

                                                                              22

     each trust agreement relating to each Company Benefit Plan, (B) the most
     recent annual report (Form 5500) filed with the United States Internal
     Revenue Service ("IRS"), (C) the most recent actuarial report or valuation
     (if any) relating to any Company Benefit Plan subject to Title IV of the
     Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 ("ERISA") and (D) the most
     recent determination letter, if any, issued by the IRS with respect to any
     Company Benefit Plan qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code.

          (ii) With respect to each Company Benefit Plan that is subject to
     Title IV of ERISA, (A) the present value of accrued benefits under such
     Company Benefit Plan, based upon the actuarial assumptions used for funding
     purposes in the most recent actuarial report prepared by such Company
     Benefit Plan's actuary with respect to such Company Benefit Plan, did not,
     as of its latest valuation date, exceed the then current value of the
     assets of such Company Benefit Plan allocable to such accrued benefits, (B)
     no "reportable event" (within the meaning of Section 4043 of ERISA) has
     occurred with respect to any Company Benefit Plan for which the 30-day
     notice requirement has not been waived, except where such reportable event,
     individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be
     expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, and (C) no conditions
     exist that would subject the Company or any Company Subsidiary to any fine
     under Section 4071 of ERISA, except where such reportable event or
     condition, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not
     reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. No
     Company Benefit Plan which is subject to Title IV of ERISA is a
     "multiemployer pension plan" as such term is defined in Section 3(37) of
     ERISA.

          (iii) Each of the Company Benefit Plans intended to be "qualified"
     within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code has received a favorable
     determination letter as to such qualification from the IRS, and no event
     has occurred, either by reason of any action or failure to act, that would
     reasonably be expected to cause the loss of any such qualification, except
     where such loss of qualification, individually or in the aggregate, has not
     had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse
     Effect.

          (iv) All contributions or other amounts payable by the Company or any
     Company Subsidiary with respect to each Company Benefit Plan have been paid
     or accrued in

                                                                              23

     accordance with GAAP and Section 412 of the Code, except as has not had or
     would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate,
     a Company Material Adverse Effect.

          (j) Benefit Plan Compliance. Except as has not had and would not
     reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
     Material Adverse Effect, (A) all employee benefit plans or programs
     maintained for the benefit of the current or former employees or directors
     of the Company or any Company Subsidiary that are sponsored, maintained or
     contributed to by the Company or any Company Subsidiary, or with respect to
     which the Company or any Company Subsidiary has or may have any liability,
     including any such plan that is an "employee benefit plan" as defined in
     Section 3(3) of ERISA, are in substantial compliance with all applicable
     requirements of law, including ERISA and the Code and all applicable
     Canadian and other non U.S. laws and (B) there exists no event or set of
     circumstances in connection with which the Company or any Company
     Subsidiary could be subject to liability under the terms of such plans or
     programs, ERISA, the Code or any other applicable Canadian or other non
     U.S. laws, other than liabilities to pay benefits under such plans or
     programs. The execution of, and performance of the transactions
     contemplated by, this Agreement will not (either alone or upon the
     occurrence of any additional or subsequent events) constitute an event
     under any benefit plan, policy, arrangement or agreement or any trust or
     loan that will or may result in any payment (including severance, golden
     parachute payments or otherwise), acceleration, forgiveness of
     indebtedness, vesting, distribution, increase in benefits or obligation to
     fund benefits with respect to any employee, officer or director of the
     Company or any Company Subsidiary. As of the date of this Agreement, the
     employment, termination, material consulting and severance agreements or
     arrangements or severance policies applicable to the Company or the Company
     Subsidiaries are the agreements and policies specifically set forth in
     Section 3.01(j) of the Company Disclosure Letter.

          (k) Labor Matters. No collective bargaining agreement or other labor
     union contract is being negotiated by the Company or any Company Subsidiary
     that is material to the Company or the Company Subsidiaries taken as a
     whole. As of the date of this Agreement, there is no material labor
     dispute, strike, slowdown or work stoppage against the Company or any


<PAGE>


                                                                              24

     Company Subsidiary pending, or to the knowledge of the Company, threatened
     that may interfere with the respective business activities of the Company
     or any Company Subsidiary, except where such dispute, strike, slowdown or
     work stoppage, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not
     reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. As of the
     date of this Agreement, to the knowledge of the Company, none of the
     Company, any Company Subsidiary or their respective representatives or
     employees has committed any unfair labor practices in connection with the
     operation of the respective businesses of the Company or any Company
     Subsidiary, and there is no charge or complaint against the Company or any
     Company Subsidiary by the National Labor Relations Board or any comparable
     state or foreign agency pending or, to the knowledge of the Company,
     threatened, except where such unfair labor practice, charge or complaint,
     individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be
     expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

          (l) Foreign Benefit Plans. With respect to each Company Benefit Plan
     that is not subject to United States law (a "Foreign Benefit Plan") and
     except for such items as, individually or in the aggregate, have not had
     and would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse
     Effect:

               (i) all material employer and employee contributions to each
          Foreign Benefit Plan required by any applicable law or by the terms of
          such Foreign Benefit Plan have been made or, if applicable, accrued in
          accordance with normal accounting practices;

               (ii) the fair market value of the assets of each funded Foreign
          Benefit Plan, the liability of each insurer for any Foreign Benefit
          Plan funded through insurance or the book reserve established for any
          Foreign Benefit Plan, together with any accrued contributions, is
          sufficient to procure or provide for the accrued benefit obligations,
          as of the date of this Agreement, with respect to all current and
          former participants in such Foreign Benefit Plan according to
          actuarial assumptions and valuations most recently used to determine
          employer contributions to such Foreign Benefit Plan; and


<PAGE>


                                                                              25

               (iii) each Foreign Benefit Plan required to be registered has
          been registered and has been maintained in good standing with
          applicable regulatory authorities.

          (m) Voting Requirements. The adoption of this Agreement by the holders
     of a majority in voting power of the outstanding shares of Company Common
     Stock and the outstanding Company Special Voting Stock, voting together as
     a single class (the "Company Stockholder Approval"), is the only vote of
     the holders of any class or series of Company Capital Stock necessary to
     approve this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

          (n) Brokers; Schedule of Fees and Expenses. No broker, investment
     banker, financial advisor or other person, other than UBS Warburg LLC, is
     entitled to any broker's, finder's, financial advisor's or other similar
     fee or commission in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
     Agreement based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of the Company. A
     complete and correct copy of the Company's engagement letter with UBS
     Warburg LLC has previously been furnished to Parent.

          (o) Opinion of Financial Advisor. The Company has received the opinion
     of UBS Warburg LLC, dated the date of this Agreement, to the effect that,
     as of such date, the consideration to be received in the Merger by the
     Company's stockholders is fair to the Company's stockholders from a
     financial point of view.

          (p) Taxes. (i) The Company and each Company Subsidiary have timely
     filed (or have had timely filed on their behalf) or will file or cause to
     be timely filed, all material Tax Returns required by applicable law to be
     filed by any of them prior to or as of the Effective Time of the Merger.
     All such material Tax Returns are, or will be at the time of filing, true,
     complete and correct in all material respects.

          (ii) The Company and each Company Subsidiary have paid (or have had
     paid on their behalf) or, where payment is not yet due, have established
     (or have had established on their behalf and for their sole benefit and
     recourse) or will establish or cause to be established on or before the
     Effective Time of the Merger an adequate accrual for the payment of all
     Taxes due with respect to any period ending prior to or as of the Effective
     Time of the Merger, except where the


<PAGE>


                                                                              26

     failure to pay or establish adequate reserves, individually or in the
     aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a
     Company Material Adverse Effect.

          (iii) No deficiencies for any material Taxes have been proposed,
     asserted or assessed against the Company or any Company Subsidiary, and no
     requests for waivers of the time to assess any such material Taxes are
     pending. The Federal income Tax Returns of the Company and each Company
     Subsidiary consolidated in such Tax Returns have been examined by and
     settled with the IRS for all years through 1995.

          (iv) The Company has no reason to believe that any conditions exist
     that could reasonably be expected to prevent the Merger from qualifying as
     a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

          (v) For purposes of this Agreement, the following terms shall have the
     following meanings:

               (A) "Taxes" shall mean all Federal, state, local and foreign
          taxes, and other assessments of a similar nature (whether imposed
          directly or through withholding), including any interest, additions to
          tax, or penalties applicable thereto.

               (B) "Tax Returns" shall mean all Federal, state, local and
          foreign tax returns, declarations, statements, reports, schedules,
          forms and information returns and any amended tax return relating to
          Taxes.

          (q) Compliance with Laws. Neither the Company nor any Company
     Subsidiary has violated or failed to comply with any statute, law,
     ordinance, regulation, rule, judgment, decree or order of any Governmental
     Entity applicable to its business or operations, except for violations and
     failures to comply that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and
     would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

          (r) Excess Parachute Payments. Other than payments that may be made to
     the persons listed in Section 3.01(r) of the Company Disclosure Letter (the
     "Primary Company Executives"), any amount that could be received (whether
     in cash or property or the vesting of property) as a result of any of the
     transactions contemplated by this Agreement by any employee, officer


<PAGE>


                                                                              27

     or director of the Company or any of its affiliates who is a "disqualified
     individual" (as such term is defined in proposed Treasury Regulation
     Section 1.280G-1) under any employment, severance or termination agreement,
     other compensation arrangement or Company Benefit Plan currently in effect
     would not be characterized as an "excess parachute payment" (as such term
     is defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code). Section 3.01(r) of the
     Company Disclosure Letter sets forth, as of the date of this Agreement, for
     each Primary Company Executive, the Company's calculations, based on the
     qualifications and assumptions specified therein, of the severance and
     change of control benefits, potentially payable by the Company to such
     Primary Company Executive.

          (s) Accounting Matters. As of the date of this Agreement, the Company,
     after consultation with its independent public accountants, believes that
     no conditions exist with respect to the Company or the Company Subsidiaries
     that would preclude the Company from being a party to a transaction
     accounted for as a pooling-of-interests for accounting purposes in
     accordance with GAAP and applicable SEC regulations, including the
     transactions contemplated hereby.

          (t) Environmental Matters. Except for items that, individually or in
     the aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a
     Company Material Adverse Effect:

          (i) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has (x) placed,
     held, located, released, discharged, transported or disposed of any
     Hazardous Substances (as defined below) on, under, from or at any of the
     Company's or any Company Subsidiary's current or former properties or any
     other properties including third-party disposal sites or (y) any knowledge
     or reason to know of the presence of any Hazardous Substances on, under, at
     or emanating from any of the Company's or any Company Subsidiary's current
     or former properties or any other property but arising from the Company's
     or any Company Subsidiary's current or former properties. For purposes of
     this Agreement, the term "Hazardous Substance" shall mean any materials or
     substances (including asbestos, buried contaminants, chemicals, flammable
     explosives, radioactive materials, petroleum and petroleum products)
     defined as, or included in the definition of, "hazardous substances",
     "hazardous wastes", "hazardous materials" or "toxic substances" or
     otherwise regulated under any


<PAGE>


                                                                              28

     Environmental Law. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Environmental
     Law" shall mean any federal, state, provincial, regional, territorial,
     municipal, local or foreign statute, code, ordinance, rule, regulation,
     policy, permit, consent, approval, license, judgment, order, writ, decree,
     injunction or other authorization, relating to: (A) emissions, discharges,
     releases or threatened releases of Hazardous Substances into the natural or
     workplace environment, including ambient air, soil, sediments, land
     surface, subsurface, surface water, groundwater, tailings ponds or settling
     lagoons; (B) the generation, treatment, storage, disposal, use, handling,
     manufacturing, transportation or shipment of Hazardous Substances; or (C)
     protection of health or safety or the environment, handling, treatment or
     disposal of solid waste, or operation or reclamation of mines.

          (ii) The Company and the Company Subsidiaries are in compliance with
     all, and are not subject to any liability pursuant to, applicable
     Environmental Laws, including the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation
     Act, 30 U.S.C. ss. 1201 et seq. (the "SMCRA") and any state law comparable
     to SMCRA under 30 U.S.C. ss. 1253 or any other Environmental Law, and
     neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is subject to any
     reclamation obligation or other site restoration obligation under any
     Environmental Law.

          (iii) During the past three years, neither the Company nor any Company
     Subsidiary has received any written notice, demand, letter, claim, request
     for information or other written communication alleging that the Company or
     any Company Subsidiary may be in violation of, or liable under, any
     Environmental Law.

          (iv) During the past three years neither the Company nor any Company
     Subsidiary (A) has entered into or agreed to any consent decree or order or
     is subject to any judgment, decree or judicial order relating to compliance
     with Environmental Laws or the investigation, sampling, monitoring,
     treatment, remediation, removal or cleanup of Hazardous Substances and, to
     the knowledge of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, no
     investigation, litigation or other proceeding is pending or threatened in
     writing with respect thereto, or (B) is an indemnitor in connection with
     any claim asserted in writing to the Company or any Company Subsidiary by
     any third-party indemnitee for any liability under any Environmental Law or
     relating to any Hazardous Substances.

                                                                              29

          (v) None of the real property owned or leased by the Company or any
     Company Subsidiary is listed or, to the knowledge of the Company and the
     Company Subsidiaries, proposed for listing on the "National Priorities
     List" or the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and
     Liability Information System under Comprehensive Environmental Response,
     Compensation, and Liability Act, as amended, or any similar state or
     foreign list of sites requiring investigation or cleanup.

          (vi) No Environmental Law imposes any obligation upon the Company or
     any Company Subsidiary arising out of or as a condition to any transaction
     contemplated by this Agreement, including any requirement to modify or to
     transfer any permit or license, any requirement to file any notice or other
     submission with any Governmental Entity, the filing of any notice,
     acknowledgment or covenant in any land records, or the modification of or
     provision of notice under any agreement, consent order or consent decree.

          (u) State Takeover Statutes. The Board of Directors of the Company has
     approved the Merger and this Agreement, and such approval is sufficient to
     render inapplicable to the Merger, this Agreement, the Stockholders
     Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
     Stockholders Agreement, the restrictions contained in Section 203(a) of the
     DGCL.

          (v) Rights Agreements. The Company has taken, and has caused Homestake
     Canada to have taken, all necessary action to (i) render the Company Rights
     and the Homestake Canada Rights inapplicable to the Merger and the other
     transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) ensure that (x)
     neither Parent nor any of its affiliates is an Acquiring Person (as defined
     in the Company Rights Agreement and the Homestake Canada Rights Agreement,
     as applicable), (y) a Distribution Date (as defined in the Company Rights
     Agreement and the Homestake Canada Rights Agreement, as applicable) shall
     not occur by reason of the approval, execution or delivery of this
     Agreement or the Merger and (z) the Company Rights and the Homestake Canada
     Rights shall expire immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger.

     has been no reduction in the aggregate amount of reserves or in the
     aggregate


<PAGE>


                                                                              30

     amount of mineralized material of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries,
     taken as a whole, from the amounts set forth in the Company's 2000 annual
     report to shareholders except for (i) such reductions in reserves that have
     resulted from production in the ordinary course of business, (ii) such
     reductions in mineralized material that have resulted from
     reclassifications of mineralized material as reserves or (iii) such
     reductions that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would
     not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

          (x) Contracts. (i) As of the date of this Agreement, neither the
     Company nor any Company Subsidiary is in breach of, or in default under, or
     has received written notice from another party thereto that it is in
     default under, any material contract to which it is a party, except for
     such breaches and defaults which, individually or in the aggregate, have
     not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
     Adverse Effect.

          (ii) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is a party to or
     is bound by any contract, arrangement, commitment or understanding which
     contains a geographic limitation on the conduct of the gold mining business
     by the Company or the Company Subsidiaries or by affiliates of the Company
     or the Company Subsidiaries, other than limitations associated with
     existing joint ventures in which the Company or a Company Subsidiary is a
     party.

          (y) Right to Use Properties. The Company and the Company Subsidiaries
     have now and, immediately following the Effective Time of the Merger, will
     have the right to occupy and use each Company Designated Property
     substantially in the manner currently occupied and used by the Company and
     the Company Subsidiaries to conduct the business of the Company and the
     Company Subsidiaries as it is presently conducted. For purposes of this
     Agreement, a "Company Designated Property" is an interest in real property
     that is material to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a
     whole.

          SECTION 3.02. Representations and Warranties of Parent and Sub. Except
as disclosed in the Filed Parent Reporting Documents (as defined in Section
3.02(g)) or as


<PAGE>


                                                                              31

set forth in the Parent Disclosure Letter (as defined in Section 3.02(b)),
Parent and Sub represent and warrant to the Company as follows:

          (a) Organization, Standing and Corporate Power. Each of Parent, Sub
     and each Parent Significant Subsidiary (as hereinafter defined) is a
     corporation, partnership or other legal entity duly organized, validly
     existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction in which
     it is organized and has the requisite power and authority to carry on its
     business as now being conducted. Each of Parent, Sub and each of Parent's
     direct and indirect subsidiaries (each a "Parent Subsidiary") is duly
     qualified or licensed to do business and is in good standing in each
     jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the ownership or
     leasing of its properties makes such qualification or licensing necessary,
     other than in such jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or
     licensed (individually or in the aggregate) has not had and would not
     reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. For
     purposes of this Agreement, a "Parent Material Adverse Effect" means (i) a
     material adverse effect on the business, properties, financial condition or
     results of operations of Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries, taken as a
     whole (other than effects relating to (A) the gold mining industry in
     general that does not have a materially disproportionate impact on Parent
     and the Parent Subsidiaries, taken as a whole), (B) general economic,
     financial or securities market conditions in the United States or
     elsewhere, (C) the announcement of this Agreement, (D) the relative values
     of the United States dollar, the Canadian dollar or the Australian dollar
     or any two of them, (E) civil or political unrest in Argentina or Chile
     that does not have a materially disproportionate impact on Parent and the
     Parent Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (F) decreases in the price of
     gold or silver, or (ii) a material adverse effect on the ability of Parent
     to perform its obligations under this Agreement in a timely manner. Parent
     has made available to the Company complete and correct copies of its
     Articles of Amalgamation and By-laws, and the Certificate of Incorporation
     and By-Laws of Sub, in each case as amended to the date of this Agreement.
     For purposes of this Agreement, a "Parent Significant Subsidiary" means any
     Parent Subsidiary that constitutes a significant subsidiary of Parent

          (b) Parent Subsidiaries. Section 3.02(b) of the letter from Parent,
     dated the date of this Agreement, addressed to the Company (the "Parent
     Disclosure Letter") lists each Parent Significant Subsidiary and the
     ownership or interest therein of Parent. All the outstanding shares of
     capital stock of each Parent Significant Subsidiary have been validly
     issued and are fully paid and nonassessable and are owned by Parent, by
     another subsidiary of Parent or by Parent and another Parent Subsidiary,
     free and clear of all Liens.

          (c) Capital Structure. Except as otherwise contemplated by this
     Agreement, the authorized capital stock of Parent (the "Parent Capital
     Stock") consists of an unlimited number of shares of Parent Common Stock,
     an unlimited number of first preferred shares, issuable in series, and an
     unlimited number of second preferred shares issuable in series. At the
     close of business on June 22, 2001: (i) 396,412,236 shares of Parent Common
     Stock were outstanding, all of which were validly issued, fully paid and
     nonassessable, and no shares of any class or series of preferred stock of
     Parent, were outstanding; (ii) no shares of Parent Common Stock were held
     by Parent in its treasury; (iii) 21,447,412 shares of Parent Common Stock
     were issuable upon the exercise of outstanding employee, consultant or
     director stock options (the "Parent Stock Options") that were granted
     pursuant to the Parent's employee, consultant and director stock plan set
     forth in Section 3.02(c) of the Parent Disclosure Letter (the "Parent Stock
     Plans"); and (iv) 680,092 shares of Parent Common Stock were issuable upon
     the exercise of certain options granted to former and current directors,
     officers and employees of Sutton Resources Ltd. (the "Sutton Options").
     Except as set forth above, at the close of business on June 22, 2001, no
     shares of capital stock or other voting securities of Parent were issued,
     reserved for issuance or outstanding. There are not any bonds, debentures,
     notes or other instruments evidencing indebtedness of Parent conferring on
     the holder or any party thereto (other than Parent or the Parent
     Subsidiaries) the right to vote (or convertible into, or exchangeable for,
     securities having the right to vote) on any matters on which stockholders
     of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary must vote. Except as set forth above, as
     of the date of this Agreement, there are not any Options to which Parent or
     any Parent Subsidiary is a party or by which any of them is bound relating
     to the issued or unissued capital stock of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary,
     or obligating Parent or any Parent

                                                                              33

     Subsidiary to issue, transfer, grant or sell any shares of capital stock or
     other equity interests in, or securities convertible or exchangeable for
     any capital stock or other equity interests in, Parent or any Parent
     Subsidiary or obligating Parent or any Parent Subsidiary to issue, grant,
     extend or enter into any such Options (other than obligations with respect
     to immaterial joint venture arrangements to which Parent or the Parent
     Subsidiaries are party or obligations owed to Parent or Parent
     Subsidiaries). All shares of Parent Common Stock that are subject to
     issuance as aforesaid, upon issuance on the terms and conditions specified
     in the instrument pursuant to which they are issuable, will be duly
     authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. All shares of
     Parent Common Stock that are subject to issuance pursuant to the Merger,
     upon issuance pursuant to this Agreement, will be duly authorized, validly
     issued, fully paid and nonassessable and not subject to preemptive rights.
     As of the date of this Agreement, there are not any outstanding contractual
     obligations of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary to repurchase, redeem or
     otherwise acquire any shares of capital stock of Parent or any Parent
     Subsidiary, or make any material investment (in the form of a loan, capital
     contribution or otherwise) in any person other than a Parent Subsidiary
     (other than obligations with respect to immaterial joint venture
     arrangements to which Parent or the Parent Subsidiaries are party). As of
     the date of this Agreement, the authorized capital stock of Sub consists of
     1,000 shares of common stock, par value $1.00 per share, all of which have
     been validly issued, are fully paid and nonassessable and are owned
     directly or indirectly by Parent free and clear of any Lien. All of the
     outstanding capital stock of Sub shall be directly owned by Parent or,
     subject to the consent of the Company, by a direct, wholly owned subsidiary
     of Parent incorporated under the laws of the United States or any political
     subdivision thereof.

          (d) Authority; Noncontravention. Parent and Sub have all requisite
     corporate power and authority to enter into this Agreement and to
     consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Board of
     Directors of each of Parent and Sub has approved and declared advisable
     this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The
     execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the
     transactions contemplated by this Agreement, in each case by Parent or by
     Parent and Sub, as the case may be, have been duly authorized by all
     necessary

     corporate action on the part of Parent and Sub. This Agreement has been
     duly executed and delivered by Parent and Sub, respectively, and
     constitutes a valid and binding obligation of Parent and Sub, respectively,
     and constitutes a valid and binding obligation of Parent, enforceable
     against each such party in accordance with its terms. The execution and
     delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
     contemplated by this Agreement and compliance with the provisions of this
     Agreement will not, conflict with, or result in any violation of, or
     default (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or give
     rise to a right of termination or acceleration of any obligation or to loss
     of any material rights under or result in the creation of any Lien upon any
     of the properties or assets of Parent, Sub or any other Parent Subsidiary
     under, (i) the Certificate and Articles of Amalgamation or By-laws of
     Parent, the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of Sub, or the
     comparable organizational documents of any Parent Subsidiary, (ii) any
     Contract applicable to Parent, Sub or any other Parent Subsidiary or their
     respective properties or assets or (iii) subject to the governmental
     filings and other matters referred to in the following sentence, any
     judgment, order, decree, statute, law, ordinance, rule or regulation
     applicable to Parent, Sub or any other Parent Subsidiary or their
     respective properties or assets, other than, in the case of clauses (ii)
     and (iii), any such conflicts, violations, defaults, rights or Liens that
     individually or in the aggregate have not had and would not reasonably be
     expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. No consent, approval,
     order or authorization of, or registration or filing with, any Governmental
     Entity is required by or with respect to Parent, Sub or any other Parent
     Subsidiary in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement
     by Parent or Sub, as the case may be, or the consummation by Parent or Sub,
     as the case may be, of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
     except for (i) the filing of a premerger notification and report form by
     Parent under and the expiration or earlier termination of the waiting
     period under the HSR Act and compliance with the premerger notification
     requirements under Part IX of the Competition Act, (ii) the filing with the
     SEC of (A) the Form F-4, and (B) such reports under Section 13(a) of the

     Certificate of Merger with the Delaware Secretary of State and


<PAGE>


                                                                              35

     appropriate documents with the relevant authorities of other states in
     which Parent is qualified to do business, (iv) the notification of the
     Merger to the AFIRB, (v) notification to the NYSE and notification to, and
     approval by, the TSE of the issuance of the Parent Common Stock and the
     Parent Special Voting Share (the "TSE Approval"), (vi) as may be required
     in connection with the actions contemplated by Sections 2.03(b)(iv) and
     5.01 and to obtain an exemption for the issuance of the Parent Special
     Voting Share from the application of Ontario Securities Commission Rule
     56-501 (the "OSC Exemption") and any analogous requirement of the
     securities laws of any other Canadian jurisdiction, (vii) those that may be
     required solely by reason of the Company's (as opposed to any other third
     party's) participation in the Merger and the other transactions
     contemplated by this Agreement and (viii) such other consents, approvals,
     orders, authorizations, registrations, declarations and filings, including
     under applicable Environmental Laws, (x) as may be required under the laws
     of Argentina or Chile or (y) that, if not obtained or made, would not
     reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent
     Material Adverse Effect. Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries possess all
     Permits, including pursuant to any Environmental Law, necessary to conduct
     their business as such business is currently conducted or is expected to be
     conducted, except for such Permits the lack of possession of which,
     individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be
     expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. All such Permits are
     validly held by Parent or the Parent Subsidiaries, and Parent and the
     Parent Subsidiaries have complied in all respects with all terms and
     conditions thereof, except for such instances where the failure to validly
     hold such Permits or the failure to have complied with such Permits,
     individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be
     expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect; none of such Permits
     will be subject to suspension, modification, revocation or nonrenewal as a
     result of the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the consummation
     of the Merger, other than such Permits the suspension, modification or
     nonrenewal of which, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and
     would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect;
     and since December 31, 2000, neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary has
     received any written warning, notice, notice of violation or probable
     violation, notice of revocation, or other written communication from or on


<PAGE>


                                                                              36

     behalf of any Governmental Entity, alleging (A) any violation of such
     Permit or (B) that Parent or any Parent Subsidiary requires any Permit
     required for its business, as such business is currently conducted that is
     not currently held by it, that in the case of clause (A) or (B),
     individually or in the aggregate, have not had or would not reasonably be
     expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

          (e) Reporting Documents; Undisclosed Liabilities. Parent has filed all
     required reports, schedules, forms, statements and other documents with the
     SEC and the Canadian provincial securities commissions (the "Canadian
     Securities Authorities") since January 1, 2001 (the "Parent Reporting
     Documents"). As of its date, each Parent Reporting Document complied in all
     material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange
     Act or the Canadian provincial securities laws, policy statements
     ("Canadian Securities Laws"), as the case may be, and the rules and
     regulations of the SEC or the Canadian Securities Authorities or
     promulgated thereunder applicable to such Parent Reporting Documents. None
     of the Parent Reporting Documents contains any untrue statement of a
     material fact or omits to state a material fact required to be stated
     therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of
     the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except to the
     extent that such statements have been modified or superseded by a later
     filed Parent Reporting Document. The consolidated financial statements of
     Parent included in the Parent Reporting Documents comply as to form in all
     material respects with applicable accounting requirements and the published
     rules and regulations of the SEC and the Canadian Securities Authorities
     with respect thereto, have been prepared in accordance with generally
     accepted accounting principles in Canada applied on a consistent basis
     during the periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes
     thereto) and fairly present in all material respects the consolidated
     financial position of Parent as of the dates thereof and the consolidated
     results of its operations and cash flows for the periods then ended
     (subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to normal year-end audit
     adjustments). Neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary has any liabilities
     or obligations of any nature (whether accrued, absolute, contingent or
     otherwise) which, individually or in the aggregate, have had or would
     reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. None of
     the Parent Subsidiaries is

                                                                              37

     subject to the informational reporting requirements of Section 13 of the
     Exchange Act or analogous Canadian Securities Laws. Parent has not filed
     any confidential material change report with the Ontario Securities
     Commission or any other Canadian Securities Authority or the TSE which as
     of the date hereof remains confidential.

          (f) Information Supplied. None of the information supplied or to be
     supplied by Parent or Sub for inclusion or incorporation by reference in
     (i) the Form F-4 will, at the time the Form F-4 is filed with the SEC, at
     any time it is amended or supplemented or at the time it becomes effective
     under the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a material fact
     or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
     necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
     under which they are made, not misleading, or (ii) the Proxy Statement
     will, at the date the Proxy Statement is first mailed to the Company's
     stockholders or at the time of the Company Stockholders Meeting, contain
     any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
     required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
     therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not
     misleading. The Form F-4 will comply as to form in all material respects
     with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
     promulgated thereunder, except that no representation or warranty is made
     by Parent or Sub with respect to statements made or incorporated by
     reference therein based on information supplied by the Company for
     inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Form F-4.

          (g) Absence of Certain Changes or Events. Except as disclosed in the
     Parent Reporting Documents filed and publicly available prior to the date
     of this Agreement (the "Filed Parent Reporting Documents"), from December
     31, 2000, to the date of this Agreement, Parent has conducted its business
     only in the ordinary course, and:

               (i) there has not been any change by the Parent or any Parent
          Significant Subsidiary in its accounting principles or practices;

               (ii) there has not been any revaluation by the Parent or any
          Parent Subsidiary of any material asset (including any writing down of

                                                                              38

          notes or accounts receivable but excluding marketable securities,
          intercompany debt and hedging contracts) other than in the ordinary
          course of business consistent with past practice;

          by the Parent or any Parent Subsidiary, excluding intercompany
          indebtedness;

               (iv) there has not been any entry by the Parent or any Parent
          Subsidiary into any commitment or transaction (including, without
          limitation, the sale of assets or stock of the Parent or any Parent
          Subsidiary) material to the Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries taken
          as a whole, except in the ordinary course of business consistent with
          past practice;

               (v) there has not been any termination or material amendment of
          any contract that is material to the Parent and the Parent
          Subsidiaries taken as whole to which the Parent or any Parent
          Subsidiary is a party, and neither the Parent nor any Parent
          Subsidiary has entered into any new contract that is material to the
          Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries taken as a whole with any person,
          except in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
          practice;

               (vi) there has not been any event, change, effect or development
          which, individually or in the aggregate, has had or would reasonably
          be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect;

               (vii) except for regular semi-annual dividends not in excess of
          $0.22 per share per annum paid on Parent Common Stock, with customary
          record and payment dates, there has not been any declaration, setting
          aside or payment of any dividend or other distribution (whether in
          cash, stock or property) with respect to any shares of Parent Capital
          Stock;

               (viii) there has not been any split, combination or
          reclassification of any Parent Capital Stock or any issuance or the
          authorization of any issuance of any other securities in exchange or
          in substitution for shares of Parent Capital Stock; and


<PAGE>


                                                                              39

               (ix) neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary has agreed,
          committed or resolved to do any of the foregoing.

          (h) Litigation. As of the date of this Agreement, there is no suit,
     action or proceeding pending or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened
     against Parent or any Parent Subsidiary that, individually or in the
     aggregate, has had or would reasonably be expected to have a Parent
     Material Adverse Effect, and there is not any judgment, decree, injunction,
     rule or order of any Governmental Entity outstanding against Parent or any
     Parent Subsidiary, individually or in the aggregate, having or which would
     reasonably be expected to have any Parent Material Adverse Effect.

          (i) Benefit Plan Compliance. Except as has not had and would not
     reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect, all
     employee benefit plans or programs maintained for the benefit of the
     current or former employees or directors of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary
     that are sponsored, maintained or contributed to by Parent or any Parent
     Subsidiary, or with respect to which Parent or any Parent Subsidiary has or
     may have any liability, including any such plan that is an "employee
     benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, are in substantial
     compliance with all applicable requirements of law, including ERISA and the
     Code and all applicable Canadian and other non U.S. laws. The execution of,
     and performance of the transactions contemplated by, this Agreement will
     not (either alone or upon the occurrence of any additional or subsequent
     events) constitute an event under any benefit plan, policy, arrangement or
     agreement or any trust or loan that will or may result in any payment
     (including severance, golden parachute payments or otherwise),
     acceleration, forgiveness of indebtedness, vesting, distribution, increase
     in benefits or obligation to fund benefits with respect to any employee,
     officer or director of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary.

     contemplated hereby, including the issuance of shares of Parent Common
     Stock and the Parent Special Voting Share pursuant to the Merger, do not

          (k) Taxes. (i) Parent and each Parent Subsidiary have timely filed (or
     have had timely filed on their behalf) or will file or cause to be timely
     filed, all material Tax Returns required by applicable law to be filed by
     any of them prior to or as of the Effective Time of the Merger. All such
     material Tax Returns are, or will be at the time of filing, true, complete
     and correct in all material respects.

          (ii) Parent and each Parent Subsidiary have paid (or have had paid on
     their behalf) or, where payment is not yet due, have established (or have

     will establish or cause to be established on or before the Effective Time
     of the Merger an adequate accrual for the payment of all Taxes due with
     respect to any period ending prior to or as of the Effective Time of the
     Merger, except where the failure to pay or establish adequate reserves,

     consolidated in such Tax Returns have been examined by and settled with the
     IRS or the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency for all years through 1994.

          (iv) Parent has no reason to believe that any conditions exist that
     could reasonably be expected to prevent the Merger from qualifying as a
     reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

          (l) Compliance with Laws. Neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary has
     violated or failed to comply with any statute, law, ordinance, regulation,
     rule, judgment, decree or order of any Governmental Entity applicable to
     its business or operations, except for violations and failures to comply
     that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would not
     reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

          (m) Environmental Matters. Except for items that, individually or in
     the aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a

     transported or disposed of any Hazardous Substances on, under, from or at
     any of Parent's or any Parent Subsidiary's current or former properties or

     under, at or emanating from any of Parent's or any Parent Subsidiary's
     current or former properties or any other property but arising from
     Parent's or any Parent Subsidiary's current or former properties.

          (ii) Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries are in compliance with all,
     and are not subject to any liability pursuant to, applicable Environmental
     Laws, including the SMCRA and any state law comparable to SMCRA under 30
     U.S.C. ss. 1253 or any other Environmental Law, and neither Parent nor any
     Parent Subsidiary is subject to any reclamation obligation or other site

          (iii) During the past three years, neither Parent nor any Parent
     Subsidiary has received any written notice, demand, letter, claim, request
     for information or other written communication alleging that Parent or any
     Parent Subsidiary may be in violation of, or liable under, any
     Environmental Law.

          (iv) During the past three years neither Parent nor any Parent
     Subsidiary (A) has entered into or agreed to any consent decree or order or
     is subject to any judgment, decree or judicial order relating to compliance
     with Environmental Laws or the investigation, sampling, monitoring,
     treatment, remediation, removal or cleanup of Hazardous Substances and, to
     the knowledge of Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries, no investigation,
     litigation or other proceeding is pending or threatened in writing with
     respect thereto, or (B) is an indemnitor in connection with any claim
     asserted in writing to Parent or any Parent Subsidiary by any third-party
     indemnitee for any liability under any Environmental Law or relating to any
     Hazardous Substances.

          (v) None of the real property owned or leased by Parent or any Parent
     Subsidiary is listed or, to the knowledge of Parent and the Parent
     Subsidiaries, proposed for listing on the "National Priorities List" or the

     foreign list of sites requiring investigation or cleanup.

          (vi) No Environmental Law imposes any obligation upon Parent or any
     Parent Subsidiary arising out of or as a condition to any transaction
     contemplated by this Agreement, including any requirement to modify or to
     transfer any permit or license, any requirement to file any notice or other
     submission with any Governmental Entity, the filing of any notice,
     acknowledgment or covenant in any land records, or the modification of or
     provision of notice under any agreement, consent order or consent decree.

          (n) Absence of Reduction in Reserves and Mineralized Material. There
     has been no reduction in the aggregate amount of reserves or in the
     aggregate amount of mineralized material of Parent and the Parent
     Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, from the amounts set forth in Parent's 2000
     annual report to shareholders except for (i) such reductions in reserves
     that have resulted from production in the ordinary course of business, (ii)
     such reductions in mineralized material that have resulted from
     reclassifications of mineralized material as reserves or (iii) such
     reductions that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would
     not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

          (o) Accounting Matters. As of the date of this Agreement, Parent,
     after consultation with its independent public accountants, believes that
     no conditions exist with respect to Parent or the Parent Subsidiaries that
     would preclude Parent from being a party to a transaction accounted for as
     a pooling-of-interests for accounting purposes in accordance with GAAP and
     applicable SEC regulations, including the transactions contemplated hereby.

          (p) Contracts. As of the date of this Agreement, neither Parent nor
     any Parent Subsidiary is in breach of or in default under, or has received
     written notice from another party thereto that it is in default under, any
     material contract to which it is a party, except for such breaches and
     defaults which, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would
     not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

          (q) Right to Use Properties. Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries have
     now and, immediately following the Effective Time of the Merger, will have
     the right

                                                                              43

     to occupy and use each Parent Designated Property substantially in the
     manner currently occupied and used by Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries to
     conduct the business of Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries as it is
     presently conducted. For purposes of this Agreement, a "Parent Designated
     Property" is an interest in real property that is material to Parent and
     the Parent Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

          (r) Interim Operations of Sub. Sub was formed solely for the purpose
     of engaging in the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and has not
     engaged in any business activities or conducted any operations other than
     in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

          (s) Ownership of Company Securities. None of Parent, Sub or their
     respective affiliates beneficially owns or exercises control or direction
     over, nor do they have any rights to acquire, any shares of Company Common
     Stock, any Exchangeable Shares or any other securities of the Company or
     Homestake Canada.

and, to the extent consistent therewith, use reasonable efforts to preserve

          (ii) amend the Articles of Amalgamation or By-laws of Parent or the

<PAGE>


                                                                              48

representations and warranties of such party set forth in this Agreement that
are qualified as to materiality becoming untrue, (ii) any of such
representations and warranties that are not so qualified becoming untrue in any
material respect or (iii) any of the conditions to the Merger set forth in
Article VI not being satisfied.

          (d) Advice of Changes. The Company and Parent shall promptly advise
the other party orally and in writing of any change or event having, or which,
insofar as can reasonably be foreseen, would reasonably be expected to have, a
Company Material Adverse Effect or a Parent Material Adverse Effect, as
applicable.

          (e) Material Acquisitions. In the event Parent or any Parent
Subsidiary, directly or indirectly, acquires or enters into any agreement to
acquire all or substantially all of the capital stock, equity or assets of any
other person or business, in any such case without the prior written consent of
the Company, and as a result thereof the Merger has not been consummated by
March 23, 2002, then, (i) notwithstanding Section 4.01(a), after March 31, 2002,
Parent shall not unreasonably withhold or delay its consent to any action
proposed to be taken by the Company that is otherwise prohibited by clauses (iv)
and (v) thereof, and (ii) the Company may extend the Outside Date on one
occasion, by written notice to Parent delivered not later than March 24, 2002,
to a date not later than September 30, 2002; provided that the Company may only
extend the Outside Date pursuant to this clause (ii) if Mr. August von Finck or
his attorney(s) in fact has irrevocably waived his right to terminate the
Stockholders Agreement pursuant to Section 4.01(c) thereof for the period of
such extension by a written instrument in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Parent.

          SECTION 4.02. No Solicitation by the Company. (a) The Company shall
not, nor shall it permit any Company Subsidiary to, nor shall it authorize or
permit any officer, director or employee of or any investment banker, attorney,
accountant or other advisor or representative of, the Company or any Company
Subsidiary to, (i) solicit, initiate or encourage the submission of any Company
Takeover Proposal (as defined below), (ii) enter into any agreement with respect
to any Company Takeover Proposal or (iii) provide any non-public information
regarding the Company or any Company Subsidiary to any third party or engage in
any negotiations or substantive discussions in connection with any Company
Takeover Proposal; provided, however, that (A) prior to receipt of the Company
Stockholder Approval, the Company may, in response to a Company Takeover
Proposal that


<PAGE>


                                                                              49

was not solicited by the Company and that did not otherwise result from a breach
of this Section 4.02(a), provide any non-public information regarding itself to
any third party or engage in any negotiations or substantive discussions with
such person regarding any Company Takeover Proposal, in each case only if (x)
the Company's Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation
with counsel and its financial advisors, that such actions are reasonably likely
to result in a Company Superior Proposal, (y) the Company then has in effect
with such third party a confidentiality agreement in reasonably customary form
and, in any event, not materially less favorable to the Company than the
Confidentiality Agreement and (z) the Company promptly delivers to Parent a copy
of any information provided to such third party in accordance with this Section
4.02 and (B) nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Company or
its Board of Directors from complying with Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the
Exchange Act with regard to a Company Takeover Proposal or prevent the Company's
Board of Directors from taking any action permitted by Section 5.01(c). For
purposes of this Agreement, "Company Takeover Proposal" means (i) any proposal
or offer for a merger, consolidation or other business combination involving the
Company, (ii) any proposal or offer to acquire in any manner, directly or
indirectly, more than 15% of the Company Common Stock or (iii) any proposal or
offer to acquire in any manner, directly or indirectly, assets of the Company or
the Company Subsidiaries representing more than 25% of the consolidated assets
of the Company, other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The
Company shall, and shall cause each Company Subsidiary to, immediately cease and
cause to be terminated any existing activities, discussions or negotiations by
the Company, any Company Subsidiary or any officer, director or employee of or
investment banker, attorney, accountant or other advisor or representative of,
the Company or any Company Subsidiary, with any parties conducted heretofore
with respect to any of the foregoing.

          (b) Neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee
thereof shall (i) withdraw or modify, or propose publicly to withdraw or modify,
in a manner adverse to Parent or Sub, the adoption and approval by such Board of
Directors or any such committee of this Agreement or the Merger or (ii) approve
or recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend, any Company Takeover
Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time after the date hereof and
prior to receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, in response to a Company
Superior Proposal which was not solicited by the Company and which did not
otherwise


<PAGE>


                                                                              50

result from a breach of Section 4.02(a), the Board of Directors of the Company
may terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.01(d) and cause the Company
to enter into an agreement with respect to any Company Superior Proposal,
provided such termination only may occur at a time that is after the third
complete business day following the Company's delivery to Parent of written
notice advising Parent that the Board of Directors of the Company is prepared to
accept a Company Superior Proposal, specifying the material terms and conditions
of such Company Superior Proposal and identifying the person making such Company
Superior Proposal. The term "Company Superior Proposal" means a Company Takeover
Proposal that the Company's Board of Directors determines in good faith, after
consultation with counsel and its financial advisors and taking into account all
relevant material terms of such Company Takeover Proposal and this Agreement
(including any changes to this Agreement proposed by Parent in response to a
Company Takeover Proposal), is financially more favorable to the stockholders of
the Company than the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

          (c) The Company promptly shall advise Parent orally and in writing of
the receipt of any Company Takeover Proposal and of the receipt of any inquiry
with respect to or which the Company reasonably believes could lead to any
Company Takeover Proposal. The Company promptly shall advise Parent orally and
in writing of the identity of the person making any such Company Takeover
Proposal or inquiry and of the material terms of any such Company Takeover
Proposal and of any changes thereto.

in which it is not now so qualified) required to be taken under any applicable
state securities or "blue sky" laws or Canadian Securities Laws in connection
with the issuance of Parent Common Stock pursuant to the Merger, and the Company
shall furnish all information concerning the Company and the holders of the
Company Common Stock and rights to acquire Company Common Stock pursuant to the
Company Stock Plans as may be reasonably requested in connection with any such
action.

          (c) Subject to Section 4.02(b), the Board of Directors of the Company
shall be permitted to (i) not recommend to the Company's stockholders that they
give the Company Stockholder Approval or (ii) withdraw or modify in a manner
adverse to Parent its recommendation to the Company's stockholders that they
give the Company Stockholder Approval, but only if and to the extent that the
Company's Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with
counsel and its financial advisors, that failing to take any such action would
breach the fiduciary duties of the Company's Board of Directors.

          (d) If Parent elects to include financial statements in the Form F-4
prepared in accordance with GAAP and if as a result thereof the Form F-4 has not
been declared effective by the 25th business day prior to the then Outside Date,
then the Company may extend the then Outside Date by not less than 30 days and
in no event to a date later than September 30, 2002, by written notice to Parent
delivered not later than the 20th business day prior to the then Outside Date;
provided that the Company may only extend the then Outside Date pursuant to this
Section 5.01(d) if Mr. August von Finck or his attorney(s) in fact has
irrevocably waived his right to terminate the Stockholders Agreement pursuant to
Section 4.01(c) thereof for the period of such extension by a written instrument
in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent.

use reasonable efforts to cause to be delivered to Parent a letter of
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the Company's independent public accountants, dated
a date within two business days before the date on which the Form F-4 shall
become effective and addressed to Parent, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Parent and customary in scope and substance for letters
delivered by independent public accountants in connection with registration
statements similar to the Form F-4.

          SECTION 5.03. Letter of Parent's Accountants. Parent shall use
reasonable efforts to cause to be delivered to the Company a letter of

thereunder, shall (i) be suspended for so long as this Agreement is in effect

and (ii) shall terminate at the Effective Time of the Merger or if, earlier, in
accordance with its terms.

          SECTION 5.05. Reasonable Efforts; Notification. (a) Upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of the parties shall
use reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or
cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing,
all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, in
the most expeditious manner practicable, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including (i) the obtaining of all necessary
actions or nonactions, waivers, consents and approvals from Governmental
Entities and the making of all necessary registrations and filings (including
filings with Governmental Entities, if any) and the taking of all reasonable
steps as may be necessary to obtain an approval or waiver from, or to avoid an
action or proceeding by, any Governmental Entity, (ii) the obtaining of all
necessary consents, approvals or waivers from third parties, (iii) the defending
of any lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative,
challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement including seeking to have any stay or temporary restraining
order entered by any court or other Governmental Entity vacated or reversed, and
(iv) the execution and delivery of any additional instruments necessary to
consummate the transactions contemplated by, and to fully carry out the purposes
of, this Agreement; provided, however, that a party shall not be obligated to
(A) take any action pursuant to the foregoing if the taking of such action or
the obtaining of any waiver, consent, approval or exemption is reasonably likely
to result in the imposition of a condition or restriction of the type referred
to in clause (ii), (iii) or (iv) of Section 6.01(f) or (B) sell, license or
otherwise dispose of, hold separate or otherwise divest itself of any material
portion of the business or assets of the Company, any Company Subsidiary, Parent
or any Parent Subsidiary in order to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. In connection with and without limiting the foregoing, Parent,
the Company and their respective Boards of Directors shall (i) take all action
necessary so that no takeover statute or similar statute or regulation is or
becomes applicable to the Merger, this Agreement or any other transaction
contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) if any takeover statute or similar
statute or regulation becomes applicable to the Merger, this Agreement or any
other transaction contemplated by this Agreement, take all action necessary so
that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be
consummated as promptly as practicable on

the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of
such statute or regulation on the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.

          (b) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent or Sub
shall give prompt notice to the Company, of (i) any representation or warranty
made by it or contained in this Agreement that is qualified as to materiality
becoming untrue or inaccurate in any respect or any such representation or
warranty that is not so qualified becoming untrue or inaccurate in any material
respect or (ii) the failure by it to comply with or satisfy in any material
respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by
it under this Agreement; provided, however, that no such notification shall
affect the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties
or the conditions to the obligations of the parties under this Agreement.

          SECTION 5.06. Rights Agreements; Consequences if Rights Triggered. The
Board of Directors of the Company shall take all further action (in addition to
that referred to in Section 3.01(v)) requested in writing by Parent in order to
render the Company Rights and the Homestake Canada Rights inapplicable to the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Except as
provided in Section 3.01(v) or as requested in writing by Parent, prior to the
Company's Stockholders' Meeting, the Board of Directors of the Company shall not
(i) amend the Company Rights Agreement, (ii) permit Homestake Canada to amend
the Homestake Canada Rights Agreement, (iii) take any action with respect to, or
make any determination under, the Company Rights Agreement or (iv) permit
Homestake Canada to take any action with respect to, or make any determination
under, the Homestake Canada Rights Agreement. In the event that notwithstanding
Section 3.01(v) and this Section 5.06, a Distribution Date occurs under the
Company Rights Agreement or the Homestake Canada Rights Agreement at any time
during the period from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time of the
Merger when the Company Rights or the Homestake Canada Rights are outstanding,
the Company and Parent shall make such adjustment to the Conversion Number as
the Company and Parent shall mutually agree so as to preserve the economic
benefits that the Company and Parent each reasonably expected on the date of
this Agreement to receive as a result of the consummation of the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

          SECTION 5.07. Company Stock Options. (a) As soon as practicable
following the date of this Agreement, the Board of Directors of the Company or
the Board of Directors of a Company Subsidiary, as applicable, (or, if
appropriate, any committee administering the Company Stock Plans) shall adopt
such resolutions or take such other actions as may be required to effect the
following:

          (i) adjust the terms of all outstanding Company Stock Options granted
     under the Company Stock Plans and the terms of the Company Stock Plans, to
     provide that, at the Effective Time of the Merger, each Company Stock
     Option outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger
     shall be deemed to constitute an option to acquire, on substantially
     identical terms and conditions as were applicable under such Company Stock
     Option, the same number of shares of Parent Common Stock as the holder of
     such Company Stock Option would have been entitled to receive pursuant to
     the Merger had such holder exercised such Company Stock Option in full
     immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger, at a price per share
     equal to (y) the aggregate exercise price for the shares of Company Common
     Stock otherwise purchasable pursuant to such Company Stock Option divided
     by (z) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock deemed purchasable
     pursuant to such Company Stock Option; provided, however, that in the case
     of any option to which Section 421 of the Code applies by reason of its
     qualification under either Section 422 or 423 of the Code ("qualified stock
     options"), the option price, the number of shares purchasable pursuant to
     such option and the terms and conditions of exercise of such option shall
     be determined in order to comply with Section 424(a) of the Code;

          (ii) adjust the terms of (y) all outstanding Company Share Rights
     granted under the Company Stock Plans to provide that, at the Effective
     Time of the Merger, each Company Share Right outstanding immediately prior
     to the Effective Time shall be deemed to constitute a share right to
     acquire, on the same terms and conditions as were applicable under such
     Company Share Right, the same number of shares of Parent Common Stock as
     the holder of such Company Share Right would have been entitled to receive
     pursuant to the Merger had such holder received all shares of Company
     Common Stock covered by the Company Share Right immediately prior to the
     Effective Time and (z) the Company's performance-based share rights
     agreements granted under the Company's Stock Option and Share

                                                                              56

     Rights Plan--1996 by substituting in lieu of the closing price of the
     "Company's Common Stock" (as referred to in such agreements) on the dates
     specified in such agreements, when such price is used as the base from
     which performance is to be measured, the price obtained by dividing the
     closing price of the "Company's Common Stock" (as referred to in such
     agreements) on such dates by the Conversion Number, by substituting in lieu
     of the closing price of the "Company's Common Stock" (as referred to in
     such agreements) on the dates specified in such agreements, when such price
     is used to measure the performance that has been achieved, the closing
     price of Parent Common Stock and by adjusting, for all purposes of such
     agreements, the Peer Company Index (as referred to in such agreements) and
     the Adjusted Standard and Poor's Gold and Precious Metals Index (as
     referred to in such agreements) to not include stock of Parent;

          (iii) adjust the terms of all outstanding Company Delayed Delivery
     Rights granted under the Company Stock Plans and the terms of the Company
     Stock Plans, to provide that, at the Effective Time of the Merger, (A) each
     Company Delayed Delivery Right outstanding immediately prior to the
     Effective Time of the Merger shall be deemed to constitute a right to
     acquire, on the same terms and conditions as were applicable under such
     Company Delayed Delivery Right, the same number of shares of Parent Common
     Stock as the holder of such Company Delayed Delivery Right would have been
     entitled to receive pursuant to the Merger had such holder received all
     shares of Company Common Stock covered by such Company Delayed Delivery
     Right immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger, (B) the per
     share exercise price of the options underlying the Company Delayed Delivery
     Right shall be adjusted to equal (y) the aggregate adjusted exercise price
     for the shares of Company Common Stock covered by such Company Delayed
     Delivery Right divided by (z) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock
     deemed issuable pursuant to such Company Delayed Delivery Right and (C) the
     per share exercise price of the options underlying the Company Delayed
     Delivery Right payable in Parent Common Stock (as adjusted in clause (B)
     hereof) shall be compared to the price of a share of Parent Common Stock in
     determining whether the Company Delayed Delivery Right becomes due and
     payable in Parent Common Stock;

          (iv) to the extent within the power of the Company, adopt resolutions
     and take other reasonable actions (not including the amendment of any
     Company Benefit

                                                                              57

     Plan or the renegotiation of any agreement that the Company or any Company
     Subsidiary has entered into) to ensure that the execution of, and
     performance of the transactions contemplated by, this Agreement will not
     (either alone or upon the occurrence of any additional or subsequent
     events) constitute a "corporate transaction" or "change of control" for
     purposes of the Company Stock Plans and take all necessary actions to carry
     out the terms of this Section 5.07(a); and

          (v) make such other changes to the Company Stock Plans, Company Stock
     Options, Company Delayed Delivery Rights and Company Share Rights as it
     deems appropriate to give effect to the Merger.

          (b) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time of the Merger,
Parent shall deliver to the holders of Company Stock Options, Company Share
Rights, Company Delayed Delivery Rights and HCI Employee Stock Options
appropriate notices setting forth such holders' rights pursuant to the
respective Company Stock Plans and the agreements evidencing the grants of such
Company Stock Options, Company Share Rights, Company Delayed Delivery Rights and
HCI Employee Stock Options shall continue in effect on the same terms and
conditions (subject to the adjustments required by this Section 5.07 after
giving effect to the Merger). Parent shall comply with the terms of the Company
Stock Plans and shall take appropriate action to provide, to the extent required
by, and subject to the provisions of, such Company Stock Plans, that the Company
Stock Options and HCI Employee Stock Options which qualified as qualified stock
options prior to the Effective Time of the Merger continue to qualify, where
applicable, as qualified stock options after the Effective Time of the Merger.

          (c) Parent shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for
issuance a sufficient number of shares of Parent Common Stock for delivery upon
exercise of the Company Stock Options and upon vesting of Company Share Rights
and upon payment of Company Delayed Delivery Rights assumed in accordance with
this Section 5.07. On or prior to the Effective Time of the Merger, Parent shall
file a registration statement on an appropriate form with respect to the shares
of Parent Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Options, Company Share
Rights and Company Delayed Delivery Rights and shall use reasonable efforts to
maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement or registration
statements (and maintain the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses
contained therein) for so long as such Company Stock Options, Company Share
Rights and Company Delayed Delivery Rights remain outstanding. With

respect to those individuals who subsequent to the Merger are subject to the
reporting requirements under Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act, where
applicable, Parent shall administer the Company Stock Plans assumed pursuant to
this Section 5.07 in a manner that complies with Rule 16b-3 promulgated under
the Exchange Act.

          SECTION 5.08. Benefit Plans. (a) Maintenance of Benefits. For a period
of one year after the Effective Time of the Merger, Parent shall (i) either (A)
maintain or cause the Surviving Corporation (or in the case of a transfer of all
or substantially all the assets and business of the Surviving Corporation, its
successors and assigns) to maintain the Company Benefit Plans (other than plans
providing for the issuance of Company Capital Stock or based on the value of
Company Capital Stock) at the benefit levels in effect on the date hereof or (B)
provide or cause the Surviving Corporation (or, in such case, its successors or
assigns) to provide benefits to employees of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries that are no less favorable in the aggregate to such employees than
those provided to such employees under the Company Benefit Plans (other than
plans providing for the issuance of Company Capital Stock or based on the value
of Company Capital Stock) at the benefit levels in effect on the date of this
Agreement and (ii) make available plans providing for the issuance of Parent
Capital Stock or based on the value of Parent Capital Stock to employees of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries that are no less favorable than those
provided to similarly situated employees of Parent. Parent shall continue the
administration of the annual bonus programs and arrangements of the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries (in the same manner as administered by the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries, as applicable, prior to the Effective Time of the
Merger) from the Effective Time of the Merger through the end of the calendar
year in which the Effective Time of the Merger occurs; provided, however, that
each person who is an employee of the Company or any Company Subsidiary at the
Effective Time of the Merger and who is terminated by Parent or any of its
affiliates other than for "Good and Sufficient Cause" (as defined in the
Company's 1999 Change of Control Severance Plan, as may be amended from time to
time) after the Effective Time of the Merger and prior to the determination date
of the bonus amounts for the calendar year in which the Effective Time of the
Merger occurs (with such determination date being selected in accordance with
the Company's prior practice) shall be entitled to receive from Parent or its
affiliates a bonus payment in an amount equal to the pro-rata portion (based on
the number of days in the calendar year prior to the date of termination in
relation to the number of days in the full calendar year) of


<PAGE>


                                                                              59

the bonus amount the employee otherwise would have been eligible to receive in
such calendar year, based on the prior practice in the administration of the
bonus programs and arrangements by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, had
such employee remained employed by Parent or its affiliates through such
determination date; provided further, however, that such payment shall not
duplicate any benefit provided to such employee under any agreement, bonus, or
contract of the Company or any Company Subsidiaries. From and after the
Effective Time of the Merger, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving
Corporation and its successors and assigns to, (i) honor in accordance with
their respective terms (as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time of
the Merger), all the Company's and the Company Subsidiaries' employment,
severance and termination agreements and (ii) assume and adopt the 1999 Change
of Control Severance Plan and the Executive Supplemental Retirement Plan in the
same manner and to the same extent the Company would be required to perform
under such plans and shall become the employer for all purposes under such
plans.

          (b) Service. With respect to any benefit plan maintained by Parent or
any Parent Subsidiary (including any severance plan or policy), for all
purposes, including determining eligibility to participate, level of benefits
and vesting, service with the Company or any Company Subsidiary (or any
predecessor employer of an employee of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, to
the extent service with such predecessor employer is recognized by the Company
or the applicable Company Subsidiary) immediately prior to the Effective Time of
the Merger shall be treated as service with Parent or the Parent Subsidiaries;
provided, however, that such service need not be recognized to the extent that
such recognition would result in any duplication of benefits.

          (c) Pre-Existing Conditions, Co-Payments and Deductibles. For purposes
of each benefit plan of Parent or the Parent Subsidiaries, Parent and the Parent
Subsidiaries shall use all reasonable efforts to cause all pre-existing
condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such plans to be
waived for employees of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and their
covered dependents (other than limitations, including pre-existing conditions
exclusions, or waiting periods that are already in effect with respect to such
employees and dependents under the benefit plans of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries and that have not been satisfied as of the date such employees and
dependents commence participation in such benefit plans of Parent and the Parent
Subsidiaries).


<PAGE>


                                                                              60

Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries shall give full credit for all co-payments
and deductibles to the extent satisfied in the plan year in which the Effective
Time occurs (or the year in which employees of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries and their dependents commence participation in the benefit plans of
Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries, if later) as if there had been a single
continuous employer; provided that such co-payments and deductibles are
submitted to the administrator of the benefit plans of the Parent and the Parent
Subsidiaries within 90 days following the Effective Time of the Merger.

          SECTION 5.09. Indemnification. (a) Parent shall, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, cause the Surviving Corporation to honor all the Company's
obligations to indemnify (including any obligations to advance funds for
expenses) the current or former directors or officers of the Company for acts or
omissions by such directors and officers occurring prior to the Effective Time
of the Merger to the extent that such obligations of the Company exist on the
date of this Agreement, whether pursuant to the Company's Restated Certificate
of Incorporation, By-laws, individual indemnity agreements or otherwise, and
such obligations shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and
effect in accordance with the terms of such Restated Certificate of
Incorporation, By-laws and individual indemnity agreements from the Effective
Time of the Merger until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations
with respect to any claims against such directors or officers arising out of
such acts or omissions.

          (b) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall
cause to be maintained in effect the current or substantially similar policies
of directors' and officers' liability insurance maintained by the Company with
respect to claims arising from or related to facts or events which occurred at
or before the Effective Time; provided, however, that Parent shall not be
obligated to make annual premium payments for such insurance to the extent such
premiums exceed 200% of the annual premiums paid as of the date hereof by the
Company for such insurance (such 200% amount, the "Maximum Premium"). The
Company represents to Parent that the annual premium under such insurance is
approximately $512,000 for the current policy year. If such insurance coverage
cannot be obtained at all, or can only be obtained at an annual premium in
excess of the Maximum Premium, Parent shall maintain the most advantageous
policies of directors' and officers' insurance obtainable for an annual premium
equal to the Maximum Premium.

          SECTION 5.10. Fees and Expenses. Except as provided in Section 7.02,
all fees and expenses, including any fees payable to any broker, investment
banker or financial advisor, incurred in connection with the Merger, this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by
the party incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not the Merger is
consummated, except that expenses incurred in connection with printing and
mailing the Proxy Statement and the Form F-4 shall be shared equally by Parent
and the Company.

          SECTION 5.11. Public Announcements. Parent and Sub, on the one hand,
and the Company, on the other hand, shall consult with each other before
issuing, and provide each other the opportunity to review and comment upon, any
press release or other public statements with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger, and shall not issue any
such press release or make any such public statement prior to such consultation,
except as may be required by applicable law, court process or by obligations
pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities exchange.

          SECTION 5.12. Tax and Accounting Treatment. (a) Each of Parent and the
Company shall not knowingly take any action and shall not knowingly fail to take
any action which action or failure to act would prevent, or would be likely to
prevent, the Merger from qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code and shall use reasonable efforts to obtain the
opinion of counsel referred to in Section 6.03(c).

          (b) Each of the Company and Parent shall not take any action, and
shall not fail to take any action, which action or failure to act would prevent,
or would be reasonably likely to prevent, the Merger from qualifying for pooling
of interests accounting treatment under GAAP. The Company shall take such
reasonable actions with respect to the Company, its affiliates and the Company
Subsidiaries that are within the control of the Company in order to assist
Parent in enabling the Merger to qualify for pooling of interests accounting
treatment under GAAP. Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
Merger to qualify for pooling of interests accounting treatment under GAAP.

          SECTION 5.13. Affiliates. (a) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company
shall deliver to Parent a letter identifying all persons who are, at the time
this Agreement is submitted for approval to the stockholders of the Company,
"affiliates" of the Company (including all


<PAGE>


                                                                              62

directors of the Company) for purposes of Rule 145 under the Securities Act. The
Company shall use reasonable efforts to cause each such person to deliver to
Parent on or prior to the Closing Date a written agreement substantially in the
form attached hereto as Exhibit A.

          (b) Prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall deliver to the Company a
letter identifying all persons who are, at the time this Agreement is submitted
for approval to the stockholders of the Company, "affiliates" of Parent
(including directors of Parent). Parent shall use reasonable efforts to cause
such person to deliver to the Company on or prior to the Closing Date a written
agreement substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B.

          SECTION 5.14. Stock Exchange Listings. Parent shall use reasonable
best efforts to cause the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in the
Merger and pursuant to the Company Stock Plans to be approved for listing on the
NYSE and the TSE and to cause the issuance of the Parent Special Voting Share to
be approved by the TSE, in each case subject to official notice of issuance,
prior to the Closing Date. Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
the OSC Exemption and the TSE Approval to be obtained as soon as practicable
after the date hereof.

          SECTION 5.15. Alternative Structure. In the event that (i) the TSE
Approval and/or the OSC Exemption shall not be granted by a date that is
sufficiently in advance of the Outside Date in order to permit the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated on the terms set forth herein
or (ii) the proposed treatment of the Exchangeable Shares pursuant to Section
2.03 would result in the failure of a condition in Section 6.01, (other than
Section 6.01(b) or (e)), then in any such case the parties shall take such
actions as are necessary or appropriate (including implementing an arrangement
or amalgamation with respect to the Exchangeable Shares or amendment to the
Exchangeable Share Provisions so as to exchange or otherwise change or convert
the Exchangeable Shares into shares of Parent Common Stock) to permit the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated on terms as close
as possible to the terms of this Agreement.

          (c) Antitrust. The waiting periods (and any extensions thereof)

advance ruling certificate ("ARC") under Section 102 of the Competition Act or
the applicable waiting period under Part IX of the Competition Act shall have
expired or been waived and the Commissioner or his representative shall have

shall have been waived pursuant to Section 113(c) of the Competition Act. Any
consents, approvals and filings under any other foreign antitrust or competition
law or the foreign investment laws of Argentina or Chile, the absence of which
would prohibit the consummation of the Merger, shall have been obtained or made.

          (d) No Injunctions or Restraints. No temporary restraining order,
preliminary or permanent injunction or other order issued by any court of
competent jurisdiction or other legal restraint or prohibition preventing the
consummation of the Merger shall be in effect; provided, however, that subject

of the Company set forth in this Agreement, without regard to any qualifications
or exceptions contained therein as to materiality or Company Material Adverse
Effect, shall be true and correct, as of the date of this Agreement and as of
the Closing Date as though made on and as of the Closing Date, except to the

respect to the representations and warranties contained in Sections 3.01(c),
3.01(r) and 3.01(x)(ii) and the last sentence of 3.01(j) (which must be true and
correct in all material respects), the foregoing condition shall be deemed

the Company to such effect.

          (c) Letters from Company Affiliates. Parent shall have received from
each person named in the letter referred to in Section 5.13(a) an executed copy

of this Agreement any event, change, effect or development which, individually
or in the aggregate, has had

or would reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

          (e) FIRPTA Certificate. The Company shall provide Parent with a
certificate pursuant to Sections 1.897-2(h) and 1.1445-2(c)(3) of the Treasury
regulations (in a form reasonably satisfactory to Parent) to the effect that the

United States real property holding corporation within the meaning of section
897 of the Code. The certificate shall be signed by a duly authorized officer of
the Company under penalties of perjury and dated as of the Closing Date. In
connection with such certification, the Company shall comply with the
notification requirements of Treasury regulation section 1.897-2(h)(2).

of the Company to effect the Merger is further subject to the satisfaction or
waiver by the Company on or prior to the Closing Date of the following
conditions:

          (a) Representations and Warranties. The representations and warranties

     Closing Date, except to the extent any such representation or warranty
     expressly relates to an earlier date (in which case as of such date);
     provided, however, that the foregoing condition shall be deemed satisfied
     unless the failure of such representations and warranties to be true and
     correct, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to
     result in a Parent Material Adverse Effect. The Company shall have received
     a certificate signed on behalf of Parent by the Chief Executive Officer and
     the Chief Financial Officer of Parent to such effect.

          (b) Performance of Obligations of Parent and Sub. Parent and Sub shall
     have performed in all material respects all obligations required to be
     performed by them under this Agreement at or prior to the Closing Date, and

     the party seeking to terminate this Agreement;

          (iii) if any court of competent jurisdiction or other Governmental
     Entity shall have issued an order, decree or ruling or taken any other

     would give rise to a failure of a condition as described in clause (A)
     above);

          (c) by either Parent or the Company in the event that any condition to
the obligation of such party to effect the Merger set forth in Section 6.02 (in

of being satisfied prior to the Outside Date;

          (d) by the Company, if the Board of Directors of the Company shall
have approved, and the Company shall concurrently with such termination enter

complied with the proviso to the second sentence of Section 4.02(b) and (iii) no
termination pursuant to this Section 7.01(d) shall be effective unless the

twelve months of such termination the Company enters into an agreement providing
for or consummates a Company Takeover Proposal, (ii) this Agreement is

of this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.03 or an extension or waiver pursuant to

                       Form of Company Affiliate Agreement

Dear Sirs:

          The undersigned, a holder of shares of common stock, par value $1.00
per share ("Company Common Stock"), of Homestake Mining Company, a Delaware
corporation (the "Company"), acknowledges that the undersigned may be deemed an
"affiliate" of the Company within the meaning of Rule 145 ("Rule 145")
promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"),
by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") and may be deemed an
"affiliate" of the Company for purposes of qualifying the Merger (as defined
below) for pooling of interests accounting treatment under Opinion 16 of the
Accounting Principles Board and applicable SEC rules and regulations, although
nothing contained herein should be construed as an admission of either such
fact. Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of June
24, 2001 (the "Merger Agreement"), among Barrick Gold Corporation, a corporation
organized under the laws of the Province of Ontario ("Parent"), Havana
Acquisition Inc., a Delaware corporation and a direct, wholly owned subsidiary
of Parent ("Sub"), and the Company, Sub will be merged with and into the Company
(the "Merger"), and in connection with the Merger, the undersigned is entitled
to receive common shares in the capital of Parent ("Parent Common Stock").

          In consideration of the Merger and the mutual covenants contained
herein, the undersigned, Parent and the Company hereby agree as follows:

          If in fact the undersigned were an affiliate under the Securities Act,
the undersigned's ability to sell, assign or transfer the shares of Parent
Common Stock received by the undersigned in exchange for any shares of Company
Common Stock in connection with the Merger may be restricted unless such
transaction is registered under the Securities Act or an exemption from such
registration is available (including Regulation S under the Securities Act). The
undersigned understands that such exemptions are limited and the undersigned has
obtained or will obtain advice of counsel as to the nature and conditions of
such exemptions, including information with respect to the applicability to the
sale of such securities of Rules 144 and 145(d) promulgated under the Securities
Act. Other than pursuant to Section 3.04 of the Stockholders Agreement (as
defined in the Merger Agreement), the undersigned understands that Parent will
not be required to maintain the effectiveness of


<PAGE>


                                                                               2

any registration statement under the Securities Act for the purposes of resale
of Parent Common Stock by the undersigned.

          The undersigned hereby represents to and covenants with Parent that
the undersigned will not sell, assign or transfer any of the shares of Parent
Common Stock received by the undersigned in exchange for shares of Company
Common Stock in connection with the Merger except (i) pursuant to an effective
registration statement under the Securities Act, (ii) in conformity with the
volume and other limitations of Rule 145 or (iii) in a transaction which, in the
opinion of counsel to the undersigned, such counsel to be reasonably
satisfactory to Parent and such opinion to be in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Parent, or as described in a "no-action" or interpretive letter
from the Staff of the SEC specifically issued with respect to a transaction to
be engaged in by the undersigned, is not required to be registered under the
Securities Act.

          The undersigned hereby further represents to and covenants with Parent
and the Company that the undersigned has not, within the 30 days prior to the
Closing Date, effected a Transfer (as defined below) of any shares of Company
Common Stock held by the undersigned and that the undersigned will not Transfer
any Parent Common Stock received by the undersigned in connection with the
Merger until after such time as results covering at least 30 days of post-Merger
combined operations of the Company and Parent have been published by Parent (the
"Report"), in the form of a quarterly earnings report, an effective registration
statement filed with the SEC, a report to the SEC on Form 10-K, 10-Q, 8-K or
6-K, or any other public filing or announcement which includes such combined
results of operations (the "Pooling Restricted Period"). Parent will publish the
Report within 30 days following the end of the first calendar month during which
the 30th day of post-Merger combined operations of the Company and Parent
occurs.

          Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the immediately
preceding paragraph, the undesigned will be permitted, during the Pooling
Restricted Period, (i) to sell, exchange, transfer, pledge or otherwise dispose
of or grant any option, establish any "short" or "put"-equivalent position with
respect to or enter into any similar transaction (through derivatives or
otherwise) intended to have the effect, directly or indirectly, of reducing the
undersigned's risk relative to any shares of Company Common Stock or Parent
Common Stock received by the undersigned in connection with the Merger (a
"Transfer") in an amount equal

                                                                               3

to the lesser of (A) 10% of the Company Common Stock, or equivalent post-Merger
Parent Common Stock, owned by the undersigned and (B) the undersigned's pro rata
portion of 1% of the total number of outstanding shares of Company Common Stock,
or equivalent post-merger Parent Common Stock, owned by the undersigned and all
other stockholders of the Company (in each of clause (A) and (B) above as
measured as of the date of the beginning of the Pooling Restricted Period and
subject to confirmation of such calculation by Parent), and (ii) to make bona
fide charitable contributions of gifts of such securities; provided, however,
that the transferee(s) of such charitable contributions or gifts agree(s) in
writing to hold such securities during the Pooling Restricted Period.

          In the event of a sale or other disposition by the undersigned of the
shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Rule 145(d)(1), the undersigned will
supply Parent with evidence of compliance with such Rule, in the form of a
letter in the form of Annex I hereto or the opinion of counsel or no-action
letter referred to above. The undersigned understands that Parent may instruct
its transfer agent to withhold the transfer of any shares of Parent Common Stock
disposed of by the undersigned, but that (provided such transfer is not
prohibited by any other provision of this letter agreement) upon receipt of such
evidence of compliance, Parent shall cause the transfer agent to effectuate the
transfer of the shares of Parent Common Stock sold as indicated in such letter.
Parent agrees, for a period of two years after the effective date of the Merger,
to file on a timely basis all reports required to be filed by it pursuant to
Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
"Exchange Act"), so that there is available adequate current public information
with respect to Parent within the meaning of Rule 144(c) promulgated by the SEC
as the same is presently in effect and so that in the event the undersigned
desires to transfer any shares of Parent Common Stock issued to the undersigned
pursuant to the Merger, Rule 145(d) will be available to the undersigned. Until
the second anniversary of the Effective Date of the Merger, Parent agrees that,
at the time of any proposed transfer by the undersigned of shares of Parent
Common Stock received by the undersigned in the Merger, Parent will on request
provide the undersigned with a written statement to the effect that Parent has
filed all reports required to be filed by it under Section 13 or 15(d) of the
Exchange Act during the then preceding 12 months and has been subject to such
filing requirements for the then past 90 days, provided that Parent need not
provide any such written statement if the most recent quarterly or annual report
filed by Parent with the

SEC contains a statement on its cover to the foregoing effect.

          This Agreement shall simultaneously be terminated and of no further
force and effect whatsoever (a) in the event of the termination of the Merger
Agreement pursuant to the terms of Article VII thereof or (b) in the case of Mr.
August von Finck, Mr. August-Francois von Finck, Mr. Luitpold-Ferdinand von
Finck and Ms. Maria-Theresia von Finck, in the event of the termination of the
Stockholders Agreement pursuant to Section 4.01(c) thereof with respect to such
individuals.

          If the undersigned is an employee of the Company on the date of the
Merger Agreement, Parent agrees that it shall not terminate the employment of
the undersigned until the Pooling Restricted Period has expired.

          The undersigned acknowledges and agrees with the Company and Parent
that if the undersigned were to take any of the actions prohibited by this
letter during the Pooling Restricted Period, such actions could result in the
Merger ceasing to be eligible for pooling of interests accounting treatment
under GAAP.

          The undersigned acknowledges that (i) the undersigned has carefully
read this letter and understands the requirements hereof and the limitations
imposed upon the distribution, sale, transfer or other disposition of Parent

Common Stock and (ii) the receipt by Parent of this letter is an inducement to
Parent's obligations to consummate the Merger.
