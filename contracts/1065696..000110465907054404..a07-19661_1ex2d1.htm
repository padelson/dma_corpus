 ** _AGREEMENT_**

  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth in this
Agreement and intending to be legally bound hereby, the Parties agree as
follows:

  

 **Article 1. 
 Defined Terms and Interpretation**

  

 _Section 1.1_ _ __Certain Definitions_. For purposes of this
Agreement, the term:

  

" _Affiliate_ " shall mean, as to any Person, any other Person that directly
or indirectly, through one or more intermediaries, controls, is controlled
by, or is under common control with, such Person. For purposes of this
definition, "control" (including the terms "controlled by" and "under common
control with"), when used with respect to a specific Person, shall mean the
possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to direct or cause the
direction of the management or policies of such Person, whether through the
ownership of voting securities, by Contract or otherwise.

  

" _Business Day_ " shall mean any day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or a
legal holiday under the Laws of the State of Illinois or the State of
California.

  

" _Company Material Adverse Effect_ " shall mean any event, change,
circumstance, trend or occurrence that has a material adverse effect on the
business, results of operations or financial condition of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries taken as a whole; _provided_ , that in no event shall
any of the following events, changes, or occurrences alone or in combination
(or the effects or consequences thereof) constitute a "Company Material
Adverse Effect" or be taken into account in determining whether a
"Company Material Adverse Effect" has occurred or is likely or expected to
occur: (a) any change in the market price or trading volume of the Company
Common Stock (but not the underlying causes of such change), (b) the
negotiation (including activities relating to due diligence), execution,
delivery, public     

announcement or pendency of this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated herein or any actions taken in compliance herewith or otherwise
with the consent of Parent, including the impact thereof on the relationships
of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries with customers, suppliers,
distributors, consultants, employees, insurance companies or independent
contractors or other Third Parties with whom the Company or any Company
Subsidiary has any relationship, (c) any event, occurrence or circumstance
related to the Company, any Company Subsidiary or any of their respective
businesses set forth in the Company Disclosure Schedule, (d) any failure by
the Company to meet any budgets, Wall Street expectations, or to meet or
exceed any projections or forecasts for any period (but not the underlying
causes of such failure), (e) any changes in any analysts recommendations,
any credit rating or any other recommendations or ratings as to the Company
or any Company Subsidiary (but not the underlying causes of such changes),
(f) changes or developments generally affecting any segment of the industries
in which the Company or the Company Subsidiaries operate, affecting the
automotive or automotive replacement parts industries generally or affecting
the economy or financial or securities markets generally, except to the
extent that any such change or development disproportionately affects the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries (taken as a whole) relative to other
members of the Companys industry, (g) acts of God, calamities, national or
international political or social conditions, including the engagement by any
country in hostilities (whether commenced before or after the date hereof,
and whether or not pursuant to the declaration of a national emergency or
war), or the occurrence of any military or terrorist attack, (h) changes in
Law or GAAP (or any interpretation thereof), (i) any actions taken or
required to be taken by the Company or the Company Subsidiaries in order to
obtain any approval or authorization for the consummation of the Merger under
applicable antitrust or competition Laws, provided such actions do not amount
to a Burdensome Condition or have been consented to by Parent (and in either
such case, for further clarification, such actions shall not constitute a
"Company Material Adverse Effect" or be taken into account in determining
whether a "Company Material Adverse Effect" has occurred or is likely or
expected to occur; and for further clarification, any actions referred to in
this clause (i) shall be subject to and governed by Section 6.5.6), or (j)
any changes or effects arising out of or resulting from any legal claims or
other proceedings made by any of the Companys shareholders (on their own
behalf or on behalf of the Company) arising out of or related to this
Agreement, the Merger or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, other
than such claims or proceedings by or at the behest of any executive officers
of the Company, any members of the Company Board, or any Affiliate, agent or
representative thereof that did not arise out of or result from any action
taken by Parent, any Subsidiary of Parent or any Parent Representative.

  

" _Equity Interest_ " shall mean any share, capital stock, partnership,
membership, unit or similar interest in any entity and any option, warrant,
right or security convertible, exchangeable or exercisable therefor.

  

" _Knowledge_ " shall mean (a) in the case of the Company, the actual
knowledge of the Persons listed in Section 1.1 of the Company Disclosure
Schedule and (b) in the case of Parent or Merger Sub, the actual knowledge of
the Persons listed in Section 1.1 of the Parent Disclosure Schedule.

  

" _Law_ " shall mean any domestic or foreign law, statute, code, ordinance,
rule, regulation or Order.

  

" _Person_ " shall mean an individual, corporation, limited liability
company, partnership, association, trust, unincorporated organization or
other entity.

  

" _Subsidiary_ " or " _Subsidiaries_ " of the Company, the Surviving
Corporation, Parent, Merger Sub or any other Person shall mean any
corporation, limited liability company, partnership or other legal entity of
which the Company, the Surviving Corporation, Parent, Merger Sub or such
other Person, as the case may be (either alone or through or together with
any other Subsidiary), owns, directly or indirectly, a majority of the stock
or other Equity Interests, the holders of which are generally entitled to
vote for the election of the board of directors or other governing body of
such corporation or other legal entity.

        

" _Superior Proposal_ " shall mean a bona fide Takeover Proposal (for this
purpose, substituting "50 percent" for each reference to "20 percent" in the
definition of Takeover Proposal) which the Company Board determines in good
faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial
advisors) (a) is reasonably likely to be consummated and (b) if consummated,
would result in a transaction more favorable to the holders of Company Common
Stock than the transactions provided for in this Agreement, in each case with
respect to clauses (a) and (b), taking into account, in the reasonable good
faith judgment of the Company Board after consultation with its legal counsel
and financial advisors, such factors as the Company Board deems appropriate,
including the Third Party making such Takeover Proposal and the legal,
financial, regulatory, fiduciary and other aspects of this Agreement and such
Takeover Proposal, including any conditions relating to financing, regulatory
approvals or other events or circumstances (and, for the avoidance of doubt,
a Superior Proposal may be a transaction where the consideration per share to
be received by the holders of Company Common Stock is comprised of cash
and/or other property or securities).

  

" _Takeover Proposal_ " shall mean any inquiry, proposal or offer from any
Third Party relating to, in a single transaction or series of related
transactions, (a) a merger, reorganization, consolidation, share exchange,
business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar
transaction involving a direct or indirect acquisition of the Company (or any
Company Subsidiary whose business constitutes 20 percent or more of the net
revenues, net income or assets (based on fair market value) of the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole) or (b) the acquisition
(including by way of tender or exchange offer) in any manner, directly or
indirectly, of over 20 percent of (i) the Company Common Stock then
outstanding or (ii) the consolidated total assets (based on fair market
value) of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, in each case other than
the Merger.

  

" _Third Party_ " shall mean any Person or "group" (within the meaning of
Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) other than the Company, the Company
Subsidiaries, Parent or Merger Sub or any of their Subsidiaries.

that this Agreement may be terminated pursuant to and in accordance with
Section 8.1 such that the Parties shall not be required to effect the

cause the Merger to be consummated by filing this Agreement together with the
related officers certificates required by Section 1103 of the CGCL, in a
customary form (the " _Certificate of Merger_ "), with the Secretary of State

executed in accordance with, the CGCL. The Merger shall become effective at
the time specified in the Certificate of Merger (the _"Effective Time_ ").

  

 _Section 2.4_ _ __Effect of the Merger_. At the Effective Time, the
effect of the Merger shall be as provided in this Agreement and
the applicable provisions, including Section 1107, of the CGCL.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, at the Effective Time, all
the property, rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises of the
Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all
debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the
debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

  

 _Section 2.5_ _ __Articles of Incorporation; Bylaws_. At the Effective
Time, the Company Certificate and the Company Bylaws shall be the Articles of
Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter

Agreement and as provided by applicable Law, in each case in accordance with
the obligations set forth in Section 6.9.1.

of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with the

 **Article 3. 
 Conversion of Securities; Exchange of Certificates**

  

 _Section 3.1_ _ __Conversion of Securities_. At the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger
Sub, the Company or any of their shareholders, the following shall occur.

  

 _Section 3.1.1 Conversion Generally. _Each share of common stock of
the Company, no par value per share (" _Company Common Stock_ "), issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any
shares of Company Common Stock to be canceled pursuant to Section 3.1.2 and
any

        

Dissenting Shares), shall be converted into the right to receive $48.00 in
cash, payable to the holder thereof, without interest (the " _Merger
Consideration_ "). All shares of Company Common Stock that have been
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in
this Section 3.1.1 shall as of the Effective Time no longer be outstanding
and shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and
each Certificate and each Book-Entry Share which immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented such shares shall thereafter represent only the
right to receive the Merger Consideration therefor in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement. Certificates and Book-Entry Shares previously
representing shares of Company Common Stock (other than any shares of Company
Common Stock to be canceled pursuant to Section 3.1.2) shall be exchanged for
the Merger Consideration, without interest, upon the surrender of such
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with the provisions of
Section 3.2.

  

 _Section 3.1.2 Cancellation of Certain Shares._ Each share of Company
Common Stock held by Parent, Merger Sub, any Subsidiary of Parent or Merger
Sub, in the treasury of the Company or by any Company Subsidiary immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to
exist without any conversion thereof and no payment shall be made with
respect thereto.

  

 _Section 3.1.3 Merger Sub._ Each share of common stock, $0.01 par
value per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one newly and validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation. From and after the Effective Time, all certificates representing
the common stock of Merger Sub shall be deemed for all purposes to represent
the number of shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation into which
they were converted in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence.

  

 _Section 3.1.4 Change in Shares._ If between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time the outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock, or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for
shares of Company Common Stock, shall have been changed into a different
number of shares or a different class, by reason of any stock dividend
(excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, normal quarterly cash dividends),
subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, reverse split,
combination, exchange of shares or any other similar transaction, the Merger
Consideration shall be correspondingly adjusted to reflect such stock
dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, reverse
split, combination, exchange of shares or other similar transaction.

  

 _Section 3.2_ _ __Exchange of Certificates._

  

 _Section 3.2.1 Paying Agent._ Prior to the Effective Time, Parent
shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with a bank or trust company
mutually acceptable to Parent and the Company (the " _Paying Agent_ "), for
the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock, for exchange
in accordance with this _Article 3_, cash in U.S. dollars in an
amount sufficient to pay the aggregate amount of the Merger Consideration
(such cash being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ ") payable
pursuant to Section 3.1 in exchange for outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock. The Paying Agent shall, and Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to,
promptly after the Effective Time, pursuant to irrevocable instructions,
deliver the Merger Consideration contemplated to be paid pursuant to Section
3.1 out of the Exchange Fund. The Exchange Fund shall be invested by the
Paying Agent as reasonably directed by Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that
no such investment or losses thereon shall affect the Merger Consideration
payable to the holders of Company Common Stock, and following any losses,
Parent shall promptly provide additional funds to the Paying Agent for the
benefit of the holders of the shares of the Company Common Stock in the
amount of any such losses. Any net profit resulting from, or interest or
income produced by, such investments shall be payable to the Surviving
Corporation or Parent, as Parent directs. The Exchange Fund shall not be used
for any other purpose.

  

 _Section 3.2.2 Exchange Procedures._ Promptly following the
Effective Time (but in no event later than two Business Days following the
Effective Time), the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying

        

Agent to mail to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates which
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock (the " _Certificates_ ") or of non-certificated shares
of Company Common Stock represented by book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ")
(a) a letter of transmittal in customary form, which shall be subject to the
reasonable approval of the Parties prior to the Effective Time and (b)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the
Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of Certificates (or affidavits of loss
and appropriate bonds in lieu thereof), or in the case of Book-Entry Shares,
upon adherence to the applicable procedures set forth in the letter of
transmittal, for cancellation to the Paying Agent together with such letter
of transmittal, properly completed and duly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be reasonably required
by the Paying Agent or pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor the Merger Consideration which such holder has the right to
receive in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented
by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, and the Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. No interest will be paid
or accrued on any Merger Consideration payable to holders of Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares. In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of
Company Common Stock which is not registered in the transfer records of the
Company, the Merger Consideration may be issued to a transferee if the
Certificate representing such shares of Company Common Stock is presented to
the Paying Agent (or in the case of Book-Entry Shares, upon adherence to the
applicable procedures set forth in the letter of transmittal), accompanied by
all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence
that any applicable stock transfer Taxes have been paid. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this Section 3.2, each Certificate and each Book-Entry Share
shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the
right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration or the right to
demand to be paid the "fair market value" of the shares represented thereby
as contemplated by Section 3.3.

  

 _Section 3.2.3 Further Rights in Company Common Stock._ All
Merger Consideration paid in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed
to have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such
shares of Company Common Stock.

  

 _Section 3.2.4 Termination of Exchange Fund._ Any portion of the
Exchange Fund (including any interest received with respect thereto) which
remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock on the first
anniversary of the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving
Corporation upon demand, and any holders of Company Common Stock who have not
theretofore complied with this _Article 3_ shall thereafter look only to
the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other
similar Laws) for payment of the Merger Consideration, without any interest
thereon. The Surviving Corporation shall pay all charges and expenses,
including those of the Paying Agent, in connection with the exchange of
shares of Company Common Stock for the Merger Consideration.

  

 _Section 3.2.5 No Liability._ None of Parent, the Company or
the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any holder of shares of Company
Common Stock entitled to payment of the Merger Consideration under this
_Article 3_ for any cash from the Exchange Fund properly delivered to a
public official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

  

 _Section 3.2.6 Lost Certificates._ If any Certificate shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact
by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed in
the form required by the Paying Agent and, if required by Parent, the posting
by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable and customary amount as Parent
may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made with respect to
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the applicable Merger
Consideration without any interest thereon.

        

 _Section 3.2.7 Withholding._ Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the
Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Company Common
Stock, holder of Company Options or holder of a Company Stock-Based Award
such amounts as Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent are
required to deduct and withhold under the United States Internal Revenue Code
of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), or any applicable provision of state,
local or foreign tax Law, with respect to the making of such payment. To the
extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
the Paying Agent and paid over to the applicable domestic or foreign
governmental, administrative, judicial or regulatory authority (each, a "
_Governmental Entity_ "), such withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Company
Common Stock, holder of Company Options or holder of a Company Stock-Based
Award in respect of whom such deduction and withholding was made by Parent,
the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as the case may be.

  

 _Section 3.3_ _ __Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, in the event that the applicable requirements of
Section 1300(b) of the CGCL have been satisfied, shares of Company Common
Stock that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
and that are held by a shareholder who is entitled to demand and properly
demands that the Company purchase such shares in accordance with the
provisions of Chapter 13 of the CGCL (each, a " _Dissenting Shareholder_ "),
shall not be converted into or be exchangeable for the right to receive the
Merger Consideration (the " _Dissenting Shares_ "), but instead such
Dissenting Shareholder shall be entitled to have the Dissenting Shares
purchased by the Company for cash at the fair market value thereof as agreed
upon or determined in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 13 of the
CGCL. At the Effective Time, such Dissenting Shares shall no longer
be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist,
and such Dissenting Shareholder shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except the right to have the Dissenting Shares purchased by
the Company in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 13 of the CGCL,
unless and until such Dissenting Shareholder shall have failed to perfect or
shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such right to require the Company to
so purchase the Dissenting Shares. If any Dissenting Shareholder shall have
failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such right,
such holders shares of Company Common Stock shall thereupon be treated as if
they had been converted into and become exchangeable for the right to
receive, as of the Effective Time, the Merger Consideration for each such
share of Company Common Stock, in accordance with Sections 3.1.1 and 3.2,
without any interest thereon. The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice
of any written demands delivered pursuant to Chapter 13 of the CGCL,
attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served
pursuant to Chapter 13 of the CGCL and received by the Company relating to a
shareholders demand that the Company purchase shares of Company Common
Stock, and (ii) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings
with respect to such demands. The Company shall not, except with the prior
written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle, or
offer or agree to settle, any such demand for purchase and payment.

  

 _Section 3.4_ _ __Stock Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the
stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter there
shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of Company
Common Stock outstanding on the records of the Company prior to the Effective
Time. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates and
Book-Entry Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect to the shares
of Company Common Stock represented thereby except as otherwise provided
herein or by Law. From and after the Effective Time, any Certificates
presented to the Paying Agent, Parent or the Surviving Corporation for
transfer or any other reason shall be cancelled and exchanged for the
applicable Merger Consideration as provided in, and in accordance with, this
_Article 3_.

  

 _Section 3.5_ _ __Company Options and Stock-Based Awards_.

  

 _Section 3.5.1 Options._ _ _Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
Board (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof) shall take any actions
necessary, including adopting appropriate resolutions, to provide

        

that, concurrent with the Effective Time: (a) each outstanding, unexpired
and unexercised option to purchase Company Common Stock (the " _Company
Options_ ") granted under the stock plans of the Company or under any
individual consultant, employee or director agreement (the " _Company Stock
Plans_ "), whether or not then exercisable, conditioned or vested, shall
fully vest and be deemed to be exercised and cancelled and each holder of a
Company Option shall receive at the Effective Time (or as soon as
practicable thereafter, but in any event no later than three Business Days
after the Closing Date), in consideration of the deemed exercise and
cancellation of such Company Option, a payment by the Surviving Corporation
(or, at Parents option, Parent) in cash (subject to any applicable
withholding or other Taxes required to be withheld by applicable Law),
without interest, in an amount equal to the product of (x) the total number
of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option (assuming
such Company Option is fully vested and currently exercisable) and (y) the
excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share
of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option (such amounts payable
hereunder being referred to as the " _Option Payments_ ") and (b) each right
of any kind, contingent or accrued, to receive shares of Company Common Stock
or benefits measured by the value of a number of shares of Company Common
Stock, and each award of any kind consisting of shares of Company Common
Stock, granted under Company Stock Plans (including restricted stock,
restricted stock units, deferred stock and performance awards), other than
Company Options (each, a " _Company Stock-Based Award_ "), whether or not
then vested, shall vest on the terms set forth in the applicable Company
Stock Plan and related agreements (or, if such Company-Stock Based Awards

of the properties owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of its
business makes such qualification or good standing necessary, except for such
failures to be so qualified or in good standing that would not, individually
or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect. The Company has heretofore made available to Parent complete
and correct copies of the Company Certificate and Company Bylaws and the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws or similar organizational or
governing documents of each Company Subsidiary, and all amendments thereto,

Subject to such exceptions as are disclosed in the disclosure schedule (the "

concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement (it being
understood and agreed that (a) the disclosure of any fact or item in any
section of the Parent Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed disclosure with
respect to any other Section or subsection of this Agreement or the Parent
Disclosure Schedule to which the relevance of such information is reasonably

"materiality" or any word or phrase of similar import), Parent and Merger Sub

 _Section _5.1_ __Organization and Qualification_. Parent is a

qualified to do business, and is in good standing, in each jurisdiction where

of its business makes such qualification or good standing necessary, except
for such failures to be so qualified or in good standing that would not,
individually or in the aggregate, prevent or materially delay or impede
performance by Parent or Merger Sub of any of their material obligations
under this Agreement. Parent has heretofore made available to the Company

authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of Parent and Merger
Sub and no other corporate proceedings on the part of Parent or Merger Sub

Sub, (b) assuming that all consents, approvals and authorizations described
in Section 5.3.2 have been obtained prior to the Effective Time and

Exchange Act, any applicable state securities, takeover or "blue sky" Laws,

Agreement.

default or breach or an incurable failure to satisfy a condition precedent on

Commitment Letters, other than any such default or breach that has been
waived by the Lenders or otherwise cured in a timely manner by Parent or
Merger Sub to the satisfaction of the Lenders. Parent or Merger Sub has paid

or conditions of any kind whatsoever related to the funding of the full
amount of the Debt Financing (including any "flex provisions"), other than as
set forth in the signed copies thereof delivered to the Company on or prior
to the date hereof. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub has any reason to believe
that it or any other party to the Debt Commitment Letters will be unable to
satisfy on a timely basis any term or condition of closing that is required
to be satisfied by it or such other party as a condition of the Debt
Commitment Letters or that any portion of the Debt Financing will not be made

of Parent or Merger Sub.

expenses and exculpation of former or present directors, officers, employees
and agents than are set forth in the Company Certificate and the Company
Bylaws (or the equivalent organizational or governing documents of the
relevant Company Subsidiary) as in effect on the date hereof,
which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a
period of six years from the Effective Time in any manner that would
adversely affect the rights thereunder of any such Persons, except to the
extent, if any, that such amendment, repeal or modification is required by
applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the event any claim is
asserted against any Person entitled to the protections of such provisions
within such six year period, such provisions shall not be modified until the
final disposition of any such claim.

  

 _Section 6.9.2 The Indemnified Parties._ _ _From and after the
Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable
Law, and, without limiting the foregoing, as required pursuant to any
indemnity agreements of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, each present
and former director or officer of the Company and each Company Subsidiary
(collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") against any costs or expenses
(including attorneys fees and expenses), judgments, inquiries, fines,
losses, claims, settlements, damages or liabilities incurred in connection
with any actual or threatened claim, action, suit, proceeding

Company Subsidiary and (b) any and all matters pending, existing or occurring
at or prior to the Effective Time (including this Agreement, the Merger and

entitled to advancement of expenses (including attorneys fees) incurred in
the defense of such claim, action, suit proceeding or investigation from
Parent or the Surviving Corporation within 15 Business Days of receipt by
Parent of a written request for such advance; _provided_ , that any Person to
whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking, consistent with the
practices of the Company prior to the Effective Time, to repay such advances
if it is ultimately determined that such Person is not entitled to
indemnification, (b) neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall
settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any actual or
threatened claim, action, suit, proceeding, or investigation in which
indemnification could be sought by such Indemnified Party hereunder, unless
such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of
such Indemnified Party from all liability arising out of such claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation or such Indemnified Party otherwise
consents to such settlement or compromise or the entry of such judgment and
(c) the Surviving Corporation shall cooperate in the defense of any such
matter with any Indemnified Parties affected thereby and their respective
representatives (including their attorneys).

  

 _Section 6.9.3 DandO Insurance._ _ _At or prior to the Effective Time,

Insurance_") and in effect on the date of this Agreement.

  

 _Section 6.9.4 Successors._ _ _If Parent or the Surviving Corporation

or merge into any other Person and shall not be the

        

continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or (b) transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
Person, then, in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that the
successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation (or acquirer of
such assets), as the case may be, shall assume all of the obligations of
Parent or the Surviving Corporation set forth in this Section 6.9.

  

 _Section 6.9.5 Supplementary Rights._ _ _The rights of each
Indemnified Party under this Section 6.9 shall be in addition to any right
such Person might have under the Company Certificate and the Company Bylaws,
the Articles of Incorporation and the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation or

Subsidiaries, or under any agreement of any Indemnified Party with the
Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries.
The provisions of this Section 6.9 shall survive the consummation of the
Merger and are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable
by, each of the Indemnified Parties and their respective heirs and
representatives.

  

 _Section 6.10_ _ __State Takeover Statutes_. If any state takeover
statute or similar statute becomes applicable to this Agreement (including
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby), each of Parent,
Merger Sub, the Company and their respective Boards of Directors shall take
all reasonable action necessary so that such transactions may be consummated
as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby or otherwise act
to eliminate or minimize the effect of such statute or regulation on this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

  

 _Section 6.11_ _ __Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time,
the Company shall, and shall be permitted to, take all such steps as may
reasonably be necessary to cause the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including any dispositions of shares of Company Common
Stock (including any derivative securities with respect to such shares of
Company Common Stock) by each Person who is or will be subject to the
reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to
the Company, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange
Act.

  

 _Section 6.12_ _ __Financing_. Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall use
its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and
to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to
arrange, and close concurrently with the Closing, debt financing on terms and
conditions described in the Debt Commitment Letters and/or any Alternative
Financing (as defined below) (including obtaining rating agency approvals,
maintaining in effect the Debt Commitment Letters, satisfying on a timely
basis all conditions applicable to Parent and Merger Sub to obtaining the
financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters, negotiating
and entering into definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Commitment
Letters on terms and conditions contained therein or with respect to any
Alternative Financing, satisfying all conditions applicable to Parent and
Merger Sub in such definitive agreements that are within their respective
control and, if necessary, borrowing pursuant to the Debt Commitment Letters
in the event any "flex" provisions are exercised). Parent shall keep the
Company Board informed on a reasonably current basis in reasonable detail of
the status of its efforts to comply with the terms of, and satisfy the
conditions contemplated by, the Debt Commitment Letters in accordance with
this Section 6.12 and shall not, and shall not permit Merger Sub to, agree or
permit any amendment, supplement or other modification to be made to, or any
waiver of any provision or remedy under, the Debt Commitment Letters without
obtaining the prior written consent of the Company Board if such amendment,
supplement or other modification could reasonably be expected to impair,
delay or prevent consummation of the Debt Financing. Parent shall give the
Company Board prompt notice of any material breach by any party to the Debt
Commitment Letters, any termination of any of the Debt Commitment Letters or
any other circumstance, event or condition that would reasonably be likely to
prevent, delay or impede the consummation of the financing contemplated by
the Debt Commitment Letters, to the extent it becomes aware of such breach,
termination, circumstance, event or condition. Parent shall not, and shall
not permit

        

any of its Affiliates to, without the prior written consent of the Company,
take or fail to take any action or enter into any transaction, including any
merger, acquisition, joint venture, disposition, contract or debt or equity
financing, that could reasonably be expected to materially breach or make
materially untrue any representation or warranty contained in the Debt
Commitment Letters or otherwise impair, delay or prevent consummation of the
Debt Financing (or, if applicable, of any Alternative Financing). In the
event that all or any portion of the financing contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letters becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions set forth
in the Debt Commitment Letters, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts
to arrange, or if Parent is able to arrange debt financing in amounts
sufficient to fund the transactions contemplated hereby on terms and
conditions more favorable to Parent than those contained in the Debt
Commitment Letters, Parent may arrange, in each case as promptly as
practicable following the occurrence of such event and after giving the
Company prior written notice, alternative financing from alternative sources
in an amount sufficient to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement on terms that are no less beneficial to Parent or Merger Sub
(including with respect to conditionality) and on terms that would not
reasonably be expected to prevent, delay or impede the consummation of any
remaining financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters or
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the " _Alternative
Financing_ "). For the avoidance of doubt, if the financing provided for by
the Debt Commitment Letters has not been or cannot be obtained, Parent and
Merger Sub shall continue to be obligated to consummate the Merger on the
terms contemplated by this Agreement and subject only to the satisfaction or
waiver of the conditions set forth in Sections 7.1 and 7.2 of this
Agreement (other than those conditions that by their nature will not be
satisfied until the Closing) and to Parents rights under Section 8.1,
regardless of whether Parent and Merger Sub have complied with all of their
other obligations under this Agreement (including their obligations under
this Section 6.12).

  

 _Section 6.13_ _ __Cooperation in Securing Financing_. From the date
of this Agreement until the Closing Date, the Company shall, and shall cause
each Company Subsidiary to, use its reasonable best efforts to provide such
cooperation as may be reasonably requested by Parent ( _provided_  that such
requested cooperation does not interfere in any significant respect with the
ongoing operations of the Company or any Company Subsidiary) in connection
with obtaining the financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters (or
commitments for any Alternative Financing obtained in accordance with Section
6.12), including (a) participation in meetings, presentations, due diligence
sessions and sessions with rating agencies, (b) assistance with the
preparation of rating agency presentations, confidential
information memoranda and similar marketing documents required in connection
with the debt financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters, (c)
facilitating the pledging of collateral and execution and delivery of
definitive financing documents and other deliverables contemplated by the
Debt Commitment Letters; _provided_ that no obligation of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary under any such pledge or document shall be effective until
the Effective Time and (d) using its reasonable best efforts to
obtain customary legal opinions and other customary documentation and
items contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that notwithstanding the foregoing, (w) no officer, director or employee of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary shall be required to execute any
documents, including any registration statement to be filed with the SEC, any
pledge or security documents or any other definitive financing documents
prior to the Effective Time, (x) neither the Company nor any Company
Subsidiary shall be required to pay any commitment or other similar fee or
incur any other liability in connection with the financing contemplated by
the Debt Commitment Letters prior to the Effective Time, (y) neither the
Company nor any Company Subsidiary shall be required to issue any
private placement memoranda or prospectus (and no such private placement
memoranda or prospectus shall reflect the Company or any Company Subsidiary
as the issuer) and (z) none of the Company nor any Company Subsidiary shall
be required to indemnify any Person in connection with the financing
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters. Parent shall, promptly upon
request by the Company, reimburse the Company for all reasonable out-of-
pocket costs, fees and expenses incurred by the Company

        

or any Company Subsidiary in connection with such cooperation. Parent and
Merger Sub shall, on a joint and several basis, indemnify and hold harmless
the Company, each Company Subsidiary and the Company Representatives from and
against any and all liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses,
interest, awards, judgments and penalties suffered or incurred by them in
connection with the arrangement of the financing contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letters and any information utilized in connection therewith;
_provided_  that such indemnity shall not, as to any such indemnitee, be
available to the extent that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or
related expenses are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final
and nonappealable judgment to have resulted from the fraud or willful
misconduct of such indemnitee. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, the closing condition set forth in Section 7.2.2
of this Agreement, as it applies to the Companys obligations under this
Section 6.13, shall be deemed satisfied unless the financing contemplated by
the Debt Commitment Letters has not been obtained as a result of the
Companys willful and material breach of its obligations under this Section
6.13.

  

 _Section 6.14_ _ __Parent s Board_. Prior to the Effective Time,
Parent shall (a) designate two Company Directors to serve as directors of
Parent, effective as of the Effective Time, and upon receipt of such notice,
Parent shall take all such actions as may be necessary to (i) cause the
number of directors comprising Parents Board of Directors as of
the Effective Time to be sufficient to permit such Company Directors to
be appointed directors of Parent as of the Effective Time and (ii)
appoint such Company Directors as directors of Parent as of the Effective
Time, and (b) designate any or all Company Directors not designated by the
Company to serve as directors of Parent pursuant to clause (a) of this
Section 6.14 to serve as members of an advisory board to advise the board of
directors of Parent regarding transition issues for a period of three years
following the Effective Time (the " _Advisory Board_ "), and upon receipt of
such notice, Parent shall take all such actions as may be necessary to (i)
establish the Advisory Board and (ii) appoint such Company Director(s) to
the Advisory Board. " _Company Directors_ " shall mean all Persons who, as
of the date of this Agreement, are members of the Company Board.

require Parent to cause the Debt Financing to be funded or to waive any such

Section 8.1(d)(i)) such that the closing condition set forth in Section 7.3.1
would not be satisfied if the Closing Date were at the time of such

 _Section 8.4_ _ __Company Termination Fee_.

  

 _Section 8.4.1_ _ Company Termination Fee._ _ _If this Agreement is
terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(c)(ii) or by Parent
pursuant to Section 8.1(d)(ii) and neither Parent nor Merger Sub is in
material default under this Agreement at the time of such termination, then
the Company shall pay to Parent (or as directed by Parent), by wire transfer
of same day funds, (x) $30,000,000 (the " _Company_ ___Termination Fee_ ")
plus (y) all of Parents actual and reasonably documented out-of-pocket fees
and expenses (including reasonable legal fees and expenses) incurred by
Parent and its Affiliates in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement in an amount up to but not greater than $1,400,000 (the "
_Parent Expenses_ "), in each case, as promptly as reasonably practicable
(and, in any event, within two Business Days following such termination). If
this Agreement is terminated by either the Company or Parent pursuant to
Section 8.1(b)(i) and neither Parent nor Merger Sub is in material default of
this Agreement at the time of such termination, then, in the event that, (a)
at any time after the date of this Agreement and prior to the occurrence of
the action or event that gave rise to Parents right to terminate pursuant to
Section 8.1(b)(i), any Third Party shall have publicly made, proposed,
communicated or disclosed an intention to make a bona fide Takeover Proposal,
which bona fide Takeover Proposal was not retracted or rescinded prior to the
occurrence of the action or event that gave rise to Parents right to
terminate pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(i), and (b) within twelve months of the
termination of this Agreement, the Company consummates a Takeover Proposal,
then the Company shall pay, or cause to be paid, to Parent, by wire transfer
of same day funds, the Company Termination Fee and the Parent Expenses, such
payments to be made upon the consummation of such Takeover Proposal. For
purposes of this Section 8.4.1, each reference in the definition of Takeover
Proposal to "20 percent" will be deemed to be references to "50 percent."

  

 _Section 8.4.2 Sole Remedy._ _ _If paid, the Company Termination Fee
and the Parent Expenses shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent,
Merger Sub and their Affiliates against the Company, any Company Subsidiary
and any Company Representative for any loss or damage suffered as a result of
the breach of any representation, warranty or covenant contained in this
Agreement by the Company, any Company Subsidiary or any Company
Representative and the failure of the Merger to be consummated and, upon
payment of the Company Termination Fee and the Parent Expenses in accordance
with Section 8.4.1, none of the Company, any Company Subsidiary or any
Company Representative shall have further liability or obligation to Parent,
Merger Sub or any other Person relating to or arising out of this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. For the avoidance 

        

of doubt, in no event shall the Company be obligated to pay, or cause to be
paid, the Company Termination Fee or the Parent Expenses on more than one
occasion.

  

 _Section 8.4.3 Acknowledgement._ _ _The Company acknowledges that the
agreements contained in this Section 8.4 are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and that, without these
agreements, Parent and Merger Sub would not enter into this Agreement. If the
Company fails to pay the Company Termination Fee or the Parent Expenses when
due, and, in order to obtain such payment Parent commences a suit which
results in a judgment against the Company for all or any portion of the
Company Termination Fee or the Parent Expenses, the Company shall pay to
Parent its reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees) in connection with such suit.

  

 _Section 8.5_ _ __Parent Termination Fee_.

  

 _Section 8.5.1 Parent Termination Fee._ If this Agreement is
terminated by the Company or Parent pursuant to Sections 8.1(b)(ii) or
8.1(b)(iii) as a result of the failure to satisfy the closing conditions set
forth in Section 7.1.2 or 7.1.3 (solely as a result of governmental action
under any antitrust Laws), and at the date of termination the closing
conditions set forth in Sections 7.1.1, 7.2.1 and 7.2.2 have been or would be
satisfied if the Closing Date were at the time of such termination, then the
Company may require Parent to, and, if so required Parent shall, pay to the
Company (or as directed by the Company), by wire transfer of same day funds,
(x) $30,000,000 (the " _Parent Termination Fee_ ") plus (y) all of the
Companys actual and reasonably documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses
(including reasonable legal fees and expenses) incurred by the Company and
its Affiliates in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement in an amount up to but not greater than $5,000,000 (the " _Company
Expenses_ "), in each case, as promptly as reasonably practicable (and, in
any event, within two Business Days following such termination).

  

 _Section 8.5.2 Sole Remedy._ _ _If Parent pays the Company the Parent
Termination Fee, then payment of the Parent Termination Fee and the amount of
the Company Expenses to the Company (or as directed by the Company) in
accordance with Section 8.5.1 shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the
Company and its Affiliates against Parent, Merger Sub and any Parent
Representative for any loss or damage suffered as a result of the breach of
any representation, warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement by
Parent, Merger Sub or any Parent Representative and the failure of the Merger
to be consummated, and upon payment of the Parent Termination Fee and the
Company Expenses in accordance with Section 8.5.1, none of Parent, Merger Sub
or any Parent Representative shall have any further liability or obligation
to the Company or any other Person relating to or arising out of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. For the
avoidance of doubt, in no event shall Parent be obligated to pay, or cause to
be paid, the Parent Termination Fee or the Company Expenses on more than one
occasion. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall be entitled to
enforce all of its rights and remedies under this Agreement (including its
right to payment of the Company Expenses) in the event that the Company or
Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to Sections 8.1(b)(ii)
or 8.1(b)(iii), but the Company elects not to require Parent to pay the
Parent Termination Fee.

  

 _Section 8.5.3 Acknowledgement._ _ _Parent acknowledges that the
agreements contained in this Section 8.5 are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these
agreements, the Company would not enter into this Agreement. If Parent fails
to promptly pay the Parent Termination Fee or the Company Expenses when due
and, in order to obtain any such payment, the Company commences a suit which
results in a judgment against Parent for all or any portion of the Parent
Termination Fee or the Company Expenses, Parent shall pay to the Company its
reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys
fees) in connection with such suit.

 _Section 8.6_ _ __Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the
Effective Time, Parent or the Company may, to the extent permitted
by applicable Law, (a) extend the time for the performance of any of
the obligations or other acts of the other Party under this Agreement, (b)
waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other
Party contained herein or in any instrument delivered pursuant hereto or (c)
waive compliance with any of the covenants or agreements of the other Party
or conditions to the obligations of the waiving Party contained herein;
_provided_ , _however_ , that after any approval of this Agreement by the
shareholders of the Company, no extension or waiver that, by Law or in
accordance with the rules of any relevant stock exchange, requires further
approval by such shareholders may be made without such shareholder approval.
Any agreement on the part of a Party to any such extension or waiver shall be
valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed by such Party. The
failure or delay of any Party to assert any of its rights under this
Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of those rights, nor
shall any single or partial exercise of any right under this Agreement
preclude any other or further exercise of any rights hereunder.

  

 _Section 8.7_ _ __Amendment_. At any time prior to the Effective Time,
this Agreement may be amended by the Parties by action taken by or on behalf
of their respective Boards of Directors; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that,
after approval of the Agreement by the shareholders of the Company, no
amendment that, by Law or in accordance with the rules of any relevant stock
exchange, requires further approval by such shareholders may be made without
such shareholder approval. This Agreement may not be amended except by an
instrument in writing signed by Parent, Merger Sub and the Company.

  

 _Section 8.8_ _ __Acknowledgment_. The Parties acknowledge that
neither the Company Termination Fee nor the Parent Termination Fee shall be
relevant in terms of determining levels of materiality for purposes of
this Agreement.
