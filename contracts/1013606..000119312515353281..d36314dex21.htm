WHEREAS, it is proposed that the Parties effect a combination of the Company
with Parent through the merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company, with
the Company surviving the merger upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement and in accordance with the General Corporation
Law of the State of Delaware (the "DGCL") (the "Merger");

 

WHEREAS, in connection with the Merger, each outstanding share of common
stock, $0.01 par value per share, of the Company ("Company Common Stock")
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any
Cancelled Shares or Dissenting Shares) will automatically be converted into
the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and in accordance with
the DGCL;

WHEREAS, the Parties intend that the Merger will qualify as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and that this Agreement be adopted as a
"plan of reorganization" for purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the Code;

WHEREAS, the board of directors of the Company (the "Company Board
of Directors") has unanimously (a) approved the execution and delivery by the
Company of this Agreement, the performance by the Company of its covenants and
agreements contained herein and the consummation of the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby (the "Transactions") upon the terms
and subject to the conditions contained herein and (b) resolved to recommend
that the holders of shares of Company Common Stock adopt this Agreement at
any meeting of the Companys stockholders held for such purpose and any
adjournment or postponement thereof (such recommendation, the "Company
Recommendation");

 

WHEREAS, the boards of directors of Parent and Merger Sub have approved this
Agreement and determined that this Agreement and the Transactions, including
the Merger and the issuance of Parent Common Stock in the Merger, are
advisable and fair to, and in the best interests of, Parent and Merger Sub and
their respective stockholders, as applicable;

 

WHEREAS, as a condition and inducement to Parents willingness to enter into
this Agreement, certain stockholders of the Company are simultaneously
herewith entering into those certain Voting Agreements (the "Voting
Agreements"), pursuant to which, among other things, such stockholders agree
to vote shares of Company Common Stock owned by them in favor of the adoption
of this Agreement;

WHEREAS, as a condition and inducement to Parents willingness to enter into
this Agreement, certain Key Employees are simultaneously herewith entering
into the Noncompetition Agreements which are effective conditioned on the

covenants and agreements specified herein in connection with the Merger and
to prescribe certain conditions to the Merger.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, and intending to be
legally bound hereby, the Parties agree as follows:

 

ARTICLE I

THE MERGER 

Section 1.1 The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement, and in accordance with the DGCL, at the Effective Time,
Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company, whereupon the separate
existence of Merger Sub will cease, with the Company surviving the Merger (the
Company, as the surviving entity in the Merger, sometimes being referred to
herein as the "Surviving Corporation"), such that, following the Merger, the
Surviving Corporation will be a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent. The
Merger shall be governed by Section 251(c) of the DGCL.

Section 1.2 Closing. The closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall take
place via the electronic exchange of execution versions of all closing
documents and the signature pages thereto via facsimile or email by .pdf at
10:00 a.m., Pacific time, as soon as practicable following receipt of the
Company Stockholder Approval, and no later than the third (3rd) Business Day
after the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted by applicable Law)
of the last of the conditions set forth in _ARTICLE VII_ (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at or immediately prior
to the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions),
but no earlier than January 4, 2016, or at such other place, date and time as
the Company and Parent may agree in writing. The date on which the Closing
actually occurs is referred to as the "Closing Date." If the third (3rd)
Business Day after the satisfaction of all of the conditions set forth in
ARTICLE VII (other than those conditions that by their nature are to
be satisfied at or immediately prior to the Closing) occurs prior to January
4, 2016 (such date, the "Satisfaction Date"), and the Company is able to
satisfy all of the conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at
or immediately as of the Satisfaction Date, and Parent elects to delay the
Closing until January 4, 2014 pursuant to the prior sentence, then the Company
shall be deemed to have satisfied all of the conditions to Closing as of the
Satisfaction Date and shall not be required to satisfy such conditions again
as of January 4, 2016 when the Closing occurs.

Section 1.3 Effective Time. At the Closing, the Parties shall cause a
certificate of merger with respect to the Merger (the "Certificate of Merger")
to be duly executed and filed with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware (the "Delaware Secretary") as provided under the DGCL and make any
other filings, recordings or publications required to be made by the Company
or Merger Sub under the DGCL in connection with the Merger. The Merger shall
become effective at such time as the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with
the Delaware Secretary or on such later date and time as shall be agreed to by
the Company and Parent and specified in the Certificate of Merger in
accordance with the DGCL (such date and time being hereinafter referred to as
the "Effective Time").

 



2 Section 1.4 Effects of the Merger. The effects of the Merger shall be as
provided in this Agreement and in the applicable provisions of the DGCL.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the
Effective Time, all of the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises
of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and
all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become
the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation, all as
provided under the DGCL.

 

Section 1.5 Organizational Documents of the Surviving Corporation. At the
Effective Time, the Company Certificate shall, by virtue of the Merger, be
amended and restated in its entirety to read as the certificate of
incorporation of Merger Sub in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time,
except that all references therein to Merger Sub shall be deemed to be
references to the Surviving Corporation, until thereafter changed or amended
as provided therein or by applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that
Article I thereof shall read as follows: "The name of the Corporation is
TriVascular Technologies, Inc." The bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation, except that all references therein to Merger Sub shall be deemed
to be references to the Surviving Corporation, until thereafter changed or
amended as provided therein or by applicable Law.

Section 1.6 Directors. Subject to applicable Law, the directors of Merger Sub
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial directors of the
Surviving Corporation and shall hold office until their respective successors
are duly elected and qualified, or their earlier death, resignation or
removal.

Section 1.7 Officers. The officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation and

Section 2.2 Effect on Capital Stock.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of any of the Parties or the holder of any shares of Company Common
Stock or common stock of Merger Sub:

(i) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Each share of Company Common
Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other
than any Cancelled Shares and any Dissenting Shares) shall be automatically
converted into the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration. From
and after the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Common Stock shall
no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease
to exist, and each holder of such shares of Company Common Stock shall cease
to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive, upon
the surrender of such shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with
_Section 2.3_, the Per Share Merger Consideration into which such shares of
Company Common Stock have been converted pursuant to this  _Section 2.2(a)_,
together with the Fractional Share Cash Amount and any dividends or other
distributions to which holders of Company Common Stock become entitled in
accordance with _Section 2.3_.

 

(ii) _Cancellation of Company Common Stock_. Each share of Company Common
Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that is
owned or held in treasury by the Company and each share of Company Common
Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that is
owned by Parent, the Company or any direct or indirect wholly-
owned Subsidiary of Parent (including Merger Sub) or the Company shall no
longer

 



5  be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist
(the "Cancelled Shares"), and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange
therefor.

 

(iii) _Treatment of Merger Sub Shares_. At the Effective Time, each issued and
outstanding share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of Merger Sub
(the "Merger Sub Common Stock") shall be automatically converted into and
become one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation and shall constitute the only outstanding share of capital stock
of the Surviving Corporation. From and after the Effective Time, all
certificates representing shares of Merger Sub Common Stock shall be deemed
for all purposes to represent the shares of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation into which they were converted in accordance with the
immediately preceding sentence.

(b) _Shares of Dissenting Stockholders_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, any shares of Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time ("Dissenting Shares") and
held by a person (a "Dissenting Stockholder") who has not voted in favor of
the adoption of this Agreement at any meeting of the Companys stockholders
held for such purpose or any adjournment or postponement thereof, or otherwise
consented thereto, and has complied with all the provisions of the DGCL
concerning the right of holders of shares of Company Common Stock to require
appraisal of their shares (the "Appraisal Provisions") of Company Common
Stock, to the extent the Appraisal Provisions are applicable, shall not be
converted into the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration as
described in _Section 2.2(a)_, but shall become the right to receive such
consideration as may be determined to be due to such Dissenting Stockholder
pursuant to the procedures set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL. If such
Dissenting Stockholder, after the Effective Time, withdraws its demand for
appraisal or fails to perfect or otherwise loses its right of appraisal, in
any case pursuant to the DGCL, each of such Dissenting Stockholders shares of
Company Common Stock shall thereupon be treated as though such shares of
Company Common Stock had been converted as of the Effective Time into
the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section
2.2(a)_. The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any demands for
appraisal of shares of Company Common Stock received by the Company,
withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to
Section 262 of the DGCL and shall give Parent the opportunity to direct all
negotiations and proceedings with respect thereto. The Company shall not,
without the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment
with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands.

(c) _Certain Adjustments_. If, between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or Parent
Common Stock shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a
different class of shares by reason of any stock dividend, subdivision,
reclassification, stock split, reverse stock split, combination or exchange of
shares, or any similar event shall have occurred (other than in connection
with the Transactions), then the Per Share Merger Consideration shall
be equitably adjusted, without duplication, to proportionally reflect such
change; provided that nothing in this _Section 2.2(c)_ shall be construed to

be issued in connection with the Merger, no certificates or scrip representing

6  receive any dividends or to exercise any other rights of a holder of shares
of Parent Common Stock. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement,
each holder of shares of Company Common Stock converted pursuant to _Section
2.2(a)_ who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a
share of Parent Common Stock (after aggregating all shares represented by the
Certificates and Book-Entry Shares delivered by such holder) shall receive,
in lieu thereof and upon surrender thereof, cash rounded up the nearest cent
in an amount determined by multiplying (i) the closing price per share of
Parent Common Stock on Nasdaq, as reported in _The Wall Street Journal_ (or,
if not reported thereby, as reported in another authoritative source), on the
Closing Date by (ii) the fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after
aggregating all shares represented by the Certificates and Book-Entry Shares
delivered by such holder rounded up to the nearest one thousandth when
expressed in decimal form) to which such holder would otherwise be entitled
(the "Fractional Share Cash Amount").

appoint a bank or trust company to act as exchange agent (such exchange
agent, the "Exchange Agent") for the payment of the Per Share Merger
Consideration in the Merger and shall enter into an agreement relating to the
Exchange Agents responsibilities under this Agreement.

 

(b) _Deposit of Merger Consideration_. Parent shall deposit, or cause to be
deposited, with the Exchange Agent, prior to or concurrently with the
Effective Time, cash sufficient to pay the aggregate Per Share Cash
Consideration (together with, to the extent then determinable, the Fractional
Share Cash Amount) payable in the Merger to holders of Company Common Stock
and shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent,
prior to or concurrently with the Effective Time, evidence of Parent Common
Stock in book-entry form (and/or certificates representing such Parent Common
Stock, at Parents election) representing the number of shares of Parent
Common Stock sufficient to deliver the aggregate Per Share Stock Consideration
payable in the Merger to holders of Company Common Stock (such cash and
shares, together with any dividends or distributions with respect thereto,
the "Exchange Fund").

(c) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any
event within three (3) Business Days thereafter), Parent shall, and shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each
holder of record of shares of Company Common Stock whose shares of Company
Common Stock were converted pursuant to _Section 2.2(a)_ into the right to
receive the Per Share Merger Consideration (i) a letter of transmittal in
customary form (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk
of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such
other provisions as Parent and the Company shall reasonably agree) (the
"Letter of Transmittal") and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Per Share
Merger Consideration, the Fractional Share Cash Amount and any dividends or
other distributions to which such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares become
entitled in accordance with this _Section 2.3_. Parent shall cause the
Exchange Agent to make, and the Exchange Agent shall make, delivery of the Per
Share Merger Consideration, including payment of the Fractional Share Cash
Amount and any amounts payable in respect of dividends or other distributions

with this Agreement. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any purpose that
is not expressly provided for in this Agreement.

 



7 (d) _Surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares_. Upon surrender of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent together with the
Letter of Transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with
the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may customarily be
required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Per Share Merger
Consideration, the Fractional Share Cash Amount and any dividends or other
distributions to which such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares become entitled
in accordance with this _Section 2.3_. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of shares of Company Common Stock that is not registered in the
transfer or stock records of the Company, any cash to be paid upon, or shares
of Parent Common Stock to be issued upon, due surrender of the Certificate or
Book-Entry Share formerly representing such shares of Company Common Stock may
be paid or issued, as the case may be, to such a transferee if such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share is presented to the Exchange Agent,
accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and
to evidence that any applicable stock transfer or other similar Taxes have
been paid or are not applicable. No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on
the cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate or Book-Entry Share. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 2.3_, each Certificate and Book-
Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent
only the right to receive, upon such surrender, the Per Share Merger
Consideration, the Fractional Share Cash Amount and any dividends or other
distributions to which such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares become entitled
in accordance with _Section 2.3(e)_ that such holder is entitled to receive
pursuant to this _ARTICLE II_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, any holder of Book-Entry Shares shall not be required to
deliver a certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the Exchange
Agent to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration, the Fractional Share Cash
Amount and any dividends or other distributions to which such Certificates
or Book-Entry Shares become entitled in accordance with _Section 2.3(e)_
that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to this _ARTICLE II_. In lieu
thereof, each holder of record of one or more Book-Entry Shares whose shares
of Company Common Stock were converted into the right to receive the Per
Share Merger Consideration, the Fractional Share Cash Amount and any dividends
or other distributions to which such Book-Entry Shares become entitled in
accordance with  _Section 2.3(e)_ shall upon receipt by the Exchange Agent
of an "agents message" in customary form (or such other evidence, if any, as
the Exchange Agent may reasonably request), be entitled to receive, and Parent
shall cause the Exchange Agent to pay or issue, as the case may be, as
promptly as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the Per Share
Merger Consideration, the Fractional Share Cash Amount and any dividends or
other distributions to which such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares become
entitled in accordance with _Section 2.3(e)_ in respect of each such share of
Company Common Stock, and the Book-Entry Shares of such holder shall forthwith
be cancelled.

 

(e) _Treatment of Unexchanged Shares_. No dividends or other distributions
with respect to Parent Common Stock, if any, with a record date after the
Effective Time with respect to Parent Common Stock, shall be paid to the
holder of any unsurrendered share of Company Common Stock to be converted into
the right to receive shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to  _Section
2.2(a)(i)_ until such holder shall surrender such share of Company Common
Stock in accordance with this _Section 2.3_. After the surrender in
accordance with this _Section 2.3_ of a share of Company Common Stock to be
converted into the right to receive shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to
_Section 2.2(a)(i)_, the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive (in
addition to the Per Share Merger Consideration and the Fractional Share
Cash Amount payable to such holder pursuant to this _ARTICLE II_ ) any such
dividends or other distributions, without any interest thereon, which
theretofore had become payable after the Effective Time with respect to the
Parent Common Stock issuable in respect of such share of Company Common
Stock.

 



8 (f) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. The shares of
Parent Common Stock issued and cash paid in accordance with the terms of this
_ARTICLE II_ upon conversion of any shares of Company Common Stock shall be
deemed to have been delivered and paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock (subject to applicable Law
in the case of Dissenting Shares). From and after the Effective Time, (i) all
holders of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares (other than any Cancelled Shares
or Dissenting Shares) shall cease to have any rights as stockholders of the
Company other than the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration
into which the shares represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
have been converted pursuant to this Agreement upon the surrender of such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share in accordance with _Section 2.3(d)_ (together
with the Fractional Share Cash Amount and any dividends or other distributions
to which the holders of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
become entitled in accordance with _Section 2.3(e)_), without interest
thereon, and (ii) the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and
there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer
books of the Surviving Corporation or the Surviving Corporation of shares of
Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time. If, at any time after Effective Time, any Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares formerly representing shares of Company Common Stock are presented to
the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Exchange Agent for any reason, such
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided
in this _ARTICLE II_ , subject to applicable Law in the case of Dissenting
Shares.

(g) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall invest any
cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent; _provided_ that
such investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States
of America, in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by
Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Financial Services LLC,
respectively, in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or
bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $1 billion, or
in money market funds having a rating in the highest investment category
granted by a recognized credit rating agency at the time of investment. No
such investment or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to holders of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to this _ARTICLE II_ and,
following any losses from any such investment, or to the extent the cash
portion of the Exchange Fund otherwise diminishes for any reason below the
level required for the Exchange Agent to make cash payments pursuant to this
_ARTICLE II_ , Parent shall promptly provide additional funds to the Exchange
Agent for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock at the
Effective Time in the amount of such losses or other shortfall,
which additional funds will be deemed to be part of the Exchange Fund. Any
interest and other income resulting from such investment shall become a part
of the Exchange Fund, and any cash amounts in excess of the amounts payable
under this _ARTICLE II_ , shall be promptly returned to Parent.

(h) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including any interest or other amounts received with respect thereto) that
remains unclaimed by, or otherwise undistributed to, the holders of
Certificates and Book-Entry Shares for one hundred eighty (180) days after the
Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon Parents demand, and any
holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares who has not theretofore complied
with this _ARTICLE II_ shall thereafter look only to Parent or the Surviving
Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws),

Merger Consideration (together with the Fractional Share Cash Amount and any
dividends and distributions which such holder has the right to receive
pursuant to _Section 2.3(e)_).

Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of any portion of the Exchange
Fund or the Per Share Merger Consideration delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

Share Merger Consideration or the cash to be paid in accordance with this
_ARTICLE II_ that remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates and
Book-Entry Shares as of the second (2nd) anniversary of the Effective Time
(or immediately prior to such earlier date on which the Per Share Merger
Consideration or such cash would otherwise escheat to or become the property
of any Governmental Entity), shall, to the extent permitted by applicable
Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all
claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto.

 

(j) _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, the
Surviving Corporation and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement, such
amounts as may be required to be deducted or withheld with respect to the
making of such payment under any applicable tax Law. Any amounts so deducted
or withheld shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the person in respect of which such deduction or withholding was
made.

 

(k) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
Parent or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such person of a bond in

indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or the Surviving
Corporation with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent (or, if
subsequent to the termination of the Exchange Fund and subject to _Section

distribution, sale or use of any of the Company Products
infringes, misappropriates or has infringed or misappropriated Intellectual
Property of such third party. All Company Owned Intellectual Property that is
owned by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and all material Company Owned
Intellectual Property that is exclusively licensed by the Company and

Permitted Liens or licenses granted to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries). Other than the Company Owned Intellectual Property exclusively
licensed to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under the Contracts set
forth in Section 3.16(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company is

the knowledge of the Company, are threatened, that challenge the Companys or
any of its Subsidiaries ownership of or

 



28  right to practice any material Company Owned Intellectual Property; (ii) no
interference, opposition, post-grant review, reissue, reexamination or other
similar proceeding is pending or, to the knowledge of the Company,
threatened, in which the scope, validity, enforceability or ownership of any
application for a Patent or Patent included in the material Company Registered
Intellectual Property is being or has been contested or challenged; (iii) the
Company has not received any written notice alleging the invalidity or
unenforceability of the Company Registered Intellectual Property or any
infringement or misappropriation of any other persons Intellectual Property
and the Company has no knowledge of any basis for any such claims; (iv) none
of the Company Owned Intellectual Property that is owned by the Company or its
Subsidiaries is subject to any outstanding judgment, decree, order,
writ, award, injunction or determination of an arbitrator or court or other
Governmental Entity affecting adversely the rights of the Company or any
Subsidiary of the Company with respect thereto (excluding communications and
decisions made in the ordinary course of patent prosecution); and (v) to the
knowledge of the Company, no person has infringed upon or misappropriated any
of the Company Owned Intellectual Property, or has claimed any ownership
interest in any Company Owned Intellectual Property, or is currently doing

any material Trade Secret owned by the Company by any person; (ii) no

in the course of performance as an employee, independent contractor or agent
creating or contributing to the Company Owned Intellectual Property; and (iii)
no employee, independent contractor or agent of the Company or any Subsidiary
of the Company is in material default or material breach of any term of any
employment agreement, nondisclosure agreement, assignment of invention
agreement or similar agreement or Contract relating in any way to the
protection, ownership, development, use or transfer of the Company Owned
Intellectual Property. The Company and its Subsidiaries have implemented
commercially reasonable measures to protect the confidentiality, integrity and
security of the Companys and its Subsidiaries material Trade Secrets and
third party confidential information provided to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. There are no claims pending or, to the knowledge of the Company,
threatened against the Company or the Company Subsidiaries alleging a
violation of any third persons privacy or personal information or data
rights except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 

(e) All inventors of inventions within Company Owned Intellectual Property

contractual obligation to assign their entire right, title and interest in and
to such inventions and the corresponding Intellectual Property to their
respective employers.

registration, declaration, notice or filing with, any Governmental Entity is
necessary, under applicable Law, for the consummation by Parent or Merger Sub
of the Transactions.

 



35 (c) The execution and delivery by Parent and Merger Sub of this Agreement does

any loss or suspension, limitation or impairment of any right of Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries to own or use any assets required for the conduct of
their business or result in any violation of, or default (with or without
notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise to a right of
termination, cancellation, first offer, first refusal, modification or
acceleration of any obligation or to the loss of a benefit under any Contract
or Governmental Authorization binding upon Parent or any of its Subsidiaries

Securities Act and the Exchange Act and registered or exempt from registration
under any applicable state securities or "blue sky" Laws.

Section 4.10 Absence of Certain Changes or Events.

Agreement, since June 30, 2015 through the date of this Agreement, the
businesses of Parent and its Subsidiaries have been conducted in all material

event, occurrence or development that has had or would reasonably be expected

in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect or prevent or materially delay the consummation of the Transactions,
(a) to the knowledge of Parent, there is no investigation or review pending or

claims, and inquiries and investigations of which Parent has knowledge, in
each case pending or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened against or

Section 4.12 Information Supplied. The information supplied by Parent
expressly for inclusion in the Form S-4 (including the

Statement/Prospectus (and any amendment or supplement thereto) are first
mailed to the stockholders of the Company, or at the time the Form S-4 is
declared effective by the SEC, or on the date of the Company Stockholder
Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading, except that no representation or warranty is made by Parent
with respect to information or statements made or incorporated by reference in
the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Form S-4 which were not supplied by or
on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub.

Section 4.13 Intellectual Property.

 

(a) With respect to the Intellectual Property owned by, or exclusively
licensed to, Parent and each Subsidiary of Parent (collectively, the "Parent
Owned Intellectual Property"), Section 4.13(a) of the Parent Disclosure
Schedule sets forth, in each case as of the date hereof, an accurate and
complete list of all: (i) Patents, including the patent number or application
serial number, the date issued or filed, and the current status; (ii)
registrations for and applications to register Trademarks, including the
application serial number or registration number, for each country or regional
filing, and the class of goods covered; (iii) Domain Names, including the
registration date, any renewal date and name of registry; and (iv)
registrations for and applications to register Copyrights, including the
number and date of registration for each country or regional filing in which
a Copyright has been registered (clauses (i) through (iv), collectively, the
"Parent Registered Intellectual Property"). Except as set forth in Section
4.13(a) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule, as of the date of this Agreement,
none of the Parent Registered Intellectual Property (x) has expired, been
canceled or been abandoned, except (A) for such expirations, cancelations and
abandonments intended or permitted by Parent in its reasonable business
judgment or by the third party controlling prosecution and maintenance thereof
in its reasonable business judgment, or (B) in accordance with the expiration
of its ordinary term, or (y) has been held invalid or unenforceable by a
court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction. With respect to Patents
(other than any provisional patent applications) covering subject matter
directed to Parent Products, to the knowledge of Parent, there is no material
prior art, prior use, prior sale or other novelty defeating acts that were not
submitted to relevant Governmental Entities that applicable law would require
to be submitted. Each granted Patent, registered Trademark and registered
Copyright of Parent Registered Intellectual Property is valid, subsisting and
enforceable.

(b) To the knowledge of Parent, the research, development, manufacture,
marketing, distribution, sale or use of the Parent Products by or on behalf of
Parent prior to the date of this Agreement has been performed without
infringing any granted Patent or misappropriating any Trade Secret or
confidential information that is owned or controlled by a third party. Parent
has not received any written notice from any third party asserting or alleging
that any research, development,

  



43  manufacturing, marketing, distribution sale or use of any of the Parent
Products infringes, misappropriates or has infringed or misappropriated
Intellectual Property of such third party. All Parent Owned Intellectual
Property that is owned by Parent or its Subsidiaries and all material Parent
Owned Intellectual Property that is exclusively licensed by Parent and
directed to Parent Products is free and clear of all Liens (except
for Permitted Liens or licenses granted to Parent or its Subsidiaries). Other
than the Parent Owned Intellectual Property exclusively licensed to Parent
under the Contracts set forth in Section 4.13(b) of the Parent Disclosure
Schedule, Parent is the sole owner of all Parent Owned Intellectual Property.

(c) Except as set forth in Section 4.13(c) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule:
(i) there are no proceedings, claims, or actions that have been instituted or
are pending against Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent, or to the knowledge of
Parent are threatened, that challenge Parents or any of its Subsidiaries
ownership of or right to practice any material Parent Owned Intellectual
Property; (ii) there are no interference, opposition, post-grant review,
reissue, reexamination, or other similar proceeding is or has been pending
or threatened, in which the scope, validity, enforceability, or ownership of
any application for a Patent or Patent included in the material Parent
Registered Intellectual Property is being or has been contested or challenged;
(iii) Parent has not received any notice alleging the invalidity or
unenforceability of the Parent Registered Intellectual Property or any
infringement or misappropriation of any other persons Intellectual Property
and Parent has no knowledge of any basis for any such claims; (iv) none of
Parent Owned Intellectual Property is subject to any outstanding judgment,
decree, order, writ, award, injunction or determination of an arbitrator or
court or other Governmental Entity affecting adversely the rights of Parent
or any Subsidiary of Parent with respect thereto (excluding communications and
decisions made in the ordinary course of patent prosecution); and (v) to the
knowledge of Parent no person has infringed upon or misappropriated any of
the Parent Owned Intellectual Property, or has claimed any ownership interest
in any Parent Owned Intellectual Property, or is currently doing so.

 

(d) To the knowledge of Parent (i) there has been no misappropriation of any
material Trade Secret owned by Parent by any person; (ii) no employee,
independent contractor or agent of Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent has
misappropriated any material Trade Secret of any other person in the course of
performance as an employee, independent contractor or agent creating
or contributing to the Parent Owned Intellectual Property; and (iii) no
employee, independent contractor or agent of Parent or any Subsidiary of
Parent is in material default or material breach of any term of any employment
agreement, nondisclosure agreement, assignment of invention agreement or
similar agreement or Contract relating in any way to the protection,
ownership, development, use or transfer of the Parent Owned Intellectual
Property. Parent and its Subsidiaries have implemented commercially
reasonable measures to protect the confidentiality, integrity and security of
Parents and its Subsidiaries material Trade Secrets and third party
confidential information provided to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries. There
are no claims pending or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened against
Parent or Parents Subsidiaries alleging a violation of any third persons
privacy or personal information or data rights except as would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Parent Material Adverse Effect.

(e) All inventors of inventions within (i) Parent Owned Intellectual Property
that are owned by Parent or its Subsidiaries or (ii) Patents included in
Parent Owned Intellectual Property that are not owned by Parent or its
Subsidiaries have assigned or have a contractual obligation to assign their
entire right, title and interest in and to such inventions and the
corresponding Intellectual Property to their respective employers.

 



44 Section 4.14 Finders or Brokers. Except for Piper Jaffray and Co.,
neither Parent nor any of Parents Subsidiaries has employed any investment
banker, broker or finder in connection with the Transactions who would be
entitled to any fee or any commission in connection with or upon consummation
of the Merger.

 

Section 4.15 Merger Sub. The authorized capital stock of Merger Sub consists
solely of 1,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, 100
shares of which are validly issued and outstanding. All of the issued and
outstanding capital stock of Merger Sub is, and at the Effective Time will be,
owned by Parent (free and clear of all Liens). Since its date
of incorporation, Merger Sub has not carried on any business nor conducted
any operations or activities and has not incurred any liabilities or
obligations whatsoever, in each case other than the execution and delivery of
this Agreement, the performance of its obligations hereunder and matters
ancillary thereto.

Section 4.16 Ownership of Company Common Stock. As of and for the three (3)
years prior to the date of this Agreement, neither Parent nor any of its
Subsidiaries (nor any of their respective "affiliates" or "associates" (as
such terms are defined in Section 203 of the DGCL)) "owns" or "owned" (as
such terms are defined in Section 203 of the DGCL) any shares of Company
Common Stock or other securities convertible into, exchangeable into or
exercisable for shares of Company Common Stock. Other than the Voting
Agreements, there are no voting trusts or other agreements or understanding to
which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is a party with respect to the voting
of the capital stock or other equity interest of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries.

Section 4.17 Tax Matters. Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries knows of
the existence of any fact, or has taken or agreed to take any action, that
would reasonably be expected to prevent or impede the Merger from qualifying
as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

 

Section 4.18 No Other Representations. Except for the representations and
warranties contained in this _ARTICLE IV_ , the Company acknowledges that
neither Parent nor Merger Sub nor any person on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub
makes any other express or implied representation or warranty with respect to
Parent or Merger Sub or any of its Subsidiaries or in connection with the
Transactions.

49 Section 5.3 No Solicitation.

 

(a) Except to the extent otherwise permitted by this _Section 5.3_, during
the Pre-Closing Period, the Company shall not, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries not to, and shall direct and shall use reasonable efforts to
cause its and their respective officers, directors and employees and their
respective agents, financial advisors, investment bankers, attorneys
and accountants (such officers, directors, employees, agents, financial
advisors, investment bankers, attorneys and accountants, collectively,
"Representatives") not to, directly or indirectly through intermediaries, (i)
solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate any inquiries
regarding, or the making of any proposal or offer that constitutes, or could
reasonably be expected to lead to, a Company Takeover Proposal, (ii) engage
in, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations
regarding, or furnish to any other person any information in connection with
or for the purpose of soliciting, initiating, knowingly encouraging or
knowingly facilitating, a Company Takeover Proposal (other than, solely in
response to an unsolicited inquiry, to refer the inquiring person to this
_Section 5.3_ and to limit its conversation or other communication
exclusively to such referral), or (iii) approve, recommend or enter into, or
propose to approve, recommend or enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum
of understanding, agreement (including an acquisition agreement, merger
agreement or joint venture agreement) or similar document, agreement,
commitment or agreement in principle (whether written, oral, binding or non-
binding) with respect to a Company Takeover Proposal (other than an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement entered into in accordance with Section 5.3(c)) (an
"Alternative Acquisition Agreement").

(b) The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, promptly request
that each Person that has executed a confidentiality or non-disclosure
agreement in connection with any actual or potential Company Takeover Proposal
that remains in effect as of the date of this Agreement to return or destroy
all confidential information in the possession of such person or its
Representatives. The Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not
to, release any third party from, or waive, amend or modify any provision of,
or grant permission under or fail to enforce, any standstill provision in any
agreement to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party;
_provided_ that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, if the Company Board of Directors determines in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel that the failure to take such
action would be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under
applicable Law, the Company may waive any such standstill provision solely to
the extent necessary to permit a third party to make, on a confidential basis
to the Company Board of Directors, a Company Takeover Proposal, conditioned
upon such third party agreeing that the Company shall not be prohibited from
providing any information to Parent (including regarding any such Company
Takeover Proposal) in accordance with, and otherwise complying with, this
_Section 5.3_. Except to the extent otherwise permitted by the proviso in the
foregoing sentence, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to,
enforce the confidentiality and standstill provisions of any such agreement.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if,
at any time after the date of this Agreement and prior to the earlier of the
time that the Company Stockholder Approval is obtained or this Agreement is
terminated in accordance with _Section 7.1_ (the "Cut-off Time"), the
Company or any of its Representatives receives a bona fide, unsolicited
written Company Takeover Proposal from any person that did not result from a
knowing or intentional breach of this  _Section 5.3_ by the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries or their respective Representatives that the Company Board
of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with its independent
financial advisor and outside legal counsel, constitutes a Company Superior
Proposal or would reasonably be expected to result in a Company Superior
Proposal and the

 



50  Company Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with
its outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law, then
the Company and its Representatives may (i) furnish information (including
non-public information) with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to
the person who has made such Company Takeover Proposal if the Company
receives from such person an executed confidentiality agreement containing
terms that are not less restrictive to the other party than those contained in
the Confidentiality Agreement (it being understood and agreed that
such confidentiality agreement need not contain a standstill provision or
otherwise prohibit the making or amendment of a Company Takeover Proposal)
(such confidentiality agreement, an "Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement"); 
_provided_ that the Company shall concurrently with the delivery to such
person make available to Parent any non-public information concerning the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries that is provided or made available to such
person or its Representatives that has not been previously provided to Parent
and (ii) engage in or otherwise participate in discussions or negotiations
with the person making such Company Takeover Proposal and its Representatives
regarding such Company Takeover Proposal. The Company shall promptly (and in
any event within forty-eight (48) hours) notify Parent and Merger Sub if the
Company commences furnishing non-public information and/or commences
discussions or negotiations as provided in this _Section 5.3(c)_.

(d) The Company shall promptly (and in no event later than forty-eight (48)
hours after receipt) notify Parent in writing in the event that the Company
or any of its Representatives receives a Company Takeover Proposal or a
request for information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
that contemplates a Company Takeover Proposal, including the identity of the
person making the Company Takeover Proposal and the material terms and
conditions thereof (including an unredacted copy of such Company Takeover
Proposal or, where such Company Takeover Proposal is not in writing,
a description of the terms thereof). The Company shall keep Parent reasonably
informed, on a reasonably current basis, as to the status of discussions or
negotiations relating to such Company Takeover Proposal (including by promptly
(and in no event later than forty-eight (48) hours after receipt) providing
to Parent copies of any correspondence, proposals, indications of interest,
and/or draft agreements relating to such Company Takeover Proposal). The
Company agrees that it and its Subsidiaries will not enter into any agreement
with any person subsequent to the date of this Agreement that prohibits the
Company from providing any information to Parent in accordance with, or
otherwise complying with, this  _Section 5.3_.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, if,
at any time prior to the Cut-off Time, the Company or any of its
Representatives receives a bona fide written Company Takeover Proposal from
any person that did not result from a knowing or intentional breach of this
_Section 5.3_ by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective
Representatives that the Company Board of Directors determines in good faith,
after consultation with its independent financial advisor and outside legal
counsel, constitutes a Company Superior Proposal and the Company Board
of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside
legal counsel, that the failure to terminate this Agreement in order to enter
into a definitive Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to such
Company Superior Proposal would be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary
duties under applicable Law, then the Company Board of Directors may terminate
this Agreement in accordance with _Section 7.1(h)_ but only if: (i) prior to
taking any such action, the Company provides Parent with no fewer than four
(4) Business Days prior written notice of its intention to take such action,
attaching a copy of the Company Superior Proposal or any proposed Alternative
Acquisition Agreement and a copy of any related financing commitments in the
Companys possession (or, where no such copy is available, a description of
such Company Superior Proposal or proposed Alternative Acquisition Agreement),
and during the 

 



51  four (4) Business Day period, the Company has negotiated, and has caused its
Representatives to negotiate, in good faith with Parent during such notice
period, to the extent Parent wishes to negotiate, concerning any revisions to
the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent and either (A) Parent shall not
have irrevocably proposed revisions to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement prior to the end of such period or (B) if Parent within such period
shall have proposed irrevocable revisions to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, the Company Board of Directors determines in good faith, after
consultation with its independent financial advisor and outside legal
counsel, that the Company Takeover Proposal remains a Company Superior
Proposal with respect to Parents revised proposal and, after consultation
with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to terminate this Agreement
and accept such Company Superior Proposal would be inconsistent with the
directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ , that, in the
event of any change to any of the financial terms (including the form, amount
and timing of payment of consideration or any financing contingencies) of
such Company Takeover Proposal, the Company shall, in each case, have
delivered to Parent an additional notice consistent with the notice described
in clause (i) above and the four (4) Business Days notice period referred to
in clause (i) above shall be extended for an additional two (2) Business Days
after notification of such change to Parent to the extent Parent wishes to
negotiate; (ii) prior to or substantially simultaneously with such
termination the Company shall have entered into a definitive Alternative
Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Company Superior Proposal; and
(iii) immediately prior to or concurrently with such termination the Company
shall have paid Parent the Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 7.3(a)(iv)_.

(f) The Company Board of Directors shall not (i) (A) fail to include the
Company Recommendation in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus when disseminated to
the Companys stockholders, (B) change, qualify, withhold, withdraw or modify
(or authorize or publicly propose to change, qualify, withhold, withdraw or
modify), in any such case in a manner adverse to Parent, the Company
Recommendation, (C) publicly make any recommendation in connection with a
tender offer or exchange offer other than a recommendation against such offer
or a temporary "stop, look and listen" communication by the Company Board of
Directors of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act,
(D) adopt, approve or recommend, or publicly propose to adopt, approve or
recommend to stockholders of the Company a Company Takeover Proposal, or (E)
other than with respect to a tender offer or exchange offer covered by
_Section 5.3(e)(i)(C)_, if a Company Takeover Proposal shall have been
publicly announced or disclosed, fail to recommend against such Company
Takeover Proposal or fail to reaffirm the Company Recommendation, in either
case on or prior to the later of (x) the second (2nd) Business Day prior to
the date of the Company Stockholder Meeting (or any adjournment or
postponement thereof), or (y) the tenth (10th) Business Day after the Company
Takeover Proposal shall have been publicly announced or disclosed, but in any
event at least one (1) Business Day prior to the Company Stockholder Meeting,
as applicable) (any action described in this clause (i) being referred to as a
"Company Adverse Recommendation Change"), or (ii) authorize, cause or permit
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into any Alternative
Acquisition Agreement.

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
prior to the Cut-off Time, but not after, if (x) an Intervening Event shall
have occurred or (y) a bona fide written Company Takeover Proposal is received
from any person that did not result from a knowing or intentional breach of
this _Section 5.3_ that the Company Board of Directors has determined in good
faith, after consultation with its independent financial adviser and outside
legal counsel, constitutes a Company Superior Proposal and, in each case of
(x) and (y), the Company Board of Directors determines in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel, that failure to make a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with the directors
fiduciary

 



52  duties under applicable Law, then the Company Board of Directors may make a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change; _provided_ , _however_ , that, prior to
taking such action, (i) the Company has given Parent at least four (4)
Business Days prior written notice of its intention to take such action,
including, (A) if the Company Adverse Recommendation Change is due to an
Intervening Event, a description of such Intervening Event and the reasons
for the proposed Company Adverse Recommendation Change, and (B) if the Company
Adverse Recommendation Change is in connection with a purported Company
Superior Proposal, the terms and conditions of, and the identity of the
person making, any such Company Superior Proposal and a copy of the Company
Superior Proposal or any proposed Alternative Acquisition Agreement and a copy
of any related financing commitments in the Companys possession (or, in each
case, if not provided in writing to the Company, a written summary of the
terms thereof), (ii) the Company has negotiated, and has caused its
Representatives to negotiate, in good faith with Parent during such notice
period, to the extent Parent wishes to negotiate, concerning any revisions to
the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent, and (iii) following the end of
such notice period, the Company Board of Directors shall have determined,
after consultation with its independent financial advisor and outside legal
counsel, and giving due consideration to the revisions to the terms of this
Agreement to which Parent has irrevocably committed in writing, that (A) if
such proposed Company Adverse Recommendation Change is in response to an
Intervening Event, the failure to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change
would be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable
Law and (B) if such proposed Company Adverse Recommendation Change is in
response to a purported Company Superior Proposal, the Company Superior
Proposal would nevertheless continue to constitute a Company Superior Proposal
(assuming the revisions committed to by Parent were to be given effect) and
that the failure to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change would be
inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law, and
(iv) if such proposed Company Adverse Recommendation Change is in response
to a purported Company Superior Proposal, in the event of any change to any
of the financial terms (including the form, amount and timing of payment of
consideration) of such Company Superior Proposal, the Company shall, in each
case, have delivered to Parent an additional notice consistent with that
described in clause (i) above of this proviso and the four (4) Business Days
notice period referred to in clause (i) above of this proviso shall be
extended for an additional two (2) Business Days after notification of such
change to Parent.

(h) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.3_ shall prohibit the Company or
the Company Board of Directors from complying with its disclosure obligations
under applicable Law with regard to a Company Takeover Proposal, including (i)
taking and disclosing to the stockholders of the Company a
position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a)(2)-(3) promulgated under the Exchange
Act or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A or complying with the provisions of Rule
14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act, (ii) making any "stop, look and
listen" communication to the stockholders of the Company pursuant to Rule
14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act, or (iii) making any disclosure to
the Companys stockholders if the Company Board of Directors determines in
good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to
do so would be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties or other
obligations under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that in any event
the Company Board of Directors shall not make or resolve to make a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change except in accordance with _Section 5.3(g)_, or
otherwise take, agree or resolve to take any action prohibited or governed by
this  _Section 5.3_ except in accordance with this _Section 5.3_.

 



53 Section 5.4 Preparation of Proxy Statement; Stockholder Meeting.

 

(a) As promptly as practicable following the date hereof, Parent and the
Company shall jointly prepare and Parent shall file with the SEC
a registration statement on Form S-4 to register under the Securities Act the
offer and sale of Parent Common Stock pursuant to the Merger (the "Form S-4"),
which shall include a proxy statement in preliminary form related to
the Company Stockholder Meeting, which shall also serve as the prospectus of
Parent in connection with the offer and sale of Parent Common Stock pursuant
to the Merger (together with any amendments thereof or supplements thereto,
the "Proxy Statement/Prospectus"). Each of Parent and the Company shall use
its reasonable best efforts to (i) have the Form S-4 declared effective under
the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after its filing, (ii) ensure
that the Form S-4 complies in all material respects with the applicable
provisions of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, and (iii) keep the Form
S-4 effective for so long as necessary to complete the Merger. The Company
shall file with the SEC the Proxy Statement/Prospectus in definitive form as
soon as practicable after the Form S-4 is declared effective by the SEC. Each
of the Parties shall furnish to the other all information concerning such
Party that is required by applicable Laws to be included in the Form S-4 and
the Proxy Statement/Prospectus so as to enable Parent to file the Form S-4 and
the Company to comply with its obligations under this _Section 5.4(a)._
Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall cooperate in good faith to determine
the information regarding each of them that is necessary to include in the
Form S-4 and the Proxy Statement/Prospectus in order to satisfy applicable
Laws. Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly correct any
information provided by it or any of its Representatives for use in the Form
S-4 and the Proxy Statement/Prospectus if and to the extent that such
information shall have become false or misleading in any material respect.
Each Party shall (A) provide the other and their respective counsels with a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Form S-4 and the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus (and any amendments or supplements to the
foregoing) prior to the filing thereof with the SEC, and shall give
reasonable and good faith consideration to any timely comments thereon made by
the other Party or its counsel, (B) promptly notify the other Party of the
receipt of, and promptly provide the other Party copies of, all comments
from, and all correspondence with, the SEC or its staff with respect to the
Form S-4 and the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and shall promptly notify the
other Party of any request by the SEC or its staff for any amendment or
supplement thereto or for additional information, (C) provide the other Party
and its counsel with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any
proposed correspondence between it and/or any of its Representatives on
the one hand and the SEC or its staff on the other hand with respect to the
Form S-4 and the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and shall give reasonable and good
faith consideration to any comments thereon made by the other Party or its
counsel and (D) promptly provide the other Party with final copies of any
correspondence sent by it and/or any of its Representatives to the SEC or its
staff with respect to the Form S-4 and the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, and of
any amendments or supplements to the Form S-4 and the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus. The Proxy Statement/Prospectus shall include the
fairness opinion of the Companys financial advisor referenced in _Section
3.19_ and the notice and other information required by Section 262(d) of the
DGCL.

(b) Subject to applicable Law, (i) Parent and Merger Sub may, by providing
written notice to the Company, require the Company, within two (2) Business
Days after receipt of such notice, to, and the Company shall, establish a
record date consented to by Parent (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), which date shall be selected so as to
permit the Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be mailed, and a meeting of the
Companys stockholders to be held, as soon as reasonably practicable after the
effectiveness of the Form S-4, for the purpose of voting upon the adoption of
this Agreement (together with any adjournments or postponements

 



54  thereof, the "Company Stockholder Meeting") and (ii) Parent and Merger Sub
may, by providing written notice to the Company (a "Meeting Election"),
require the Company, within two (2) Business Days, to, and the Company shall
(A) give notice of the Company Stockholder Meeting, and (B) as soon as
practicable after the Form S-4 is declared effective under the Securities Act,
mail to the holders of Company Common Stock as of the record date established
for the Company Stockholders Meeting the Proxy Statement/Prospectus (the date
the Company is required to take such action, the "Mailing Date"). The Company
shall duly call, convene and hold the Company Stockholder Meeting as soon as
practicable after the Mailing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event
shall such meeting be held later than twenty-five (25) Business Days following
the date the Proxy Statement/Prospectus is mailed to the Companys
stockholders and any adjournments or postponements of such meetings shall
require the prior written consent of Parent other than to the extent necessary
to allow reasonable additional time for the filing and/or mailing, and review
by the Companys stockholders prior to the date of the Company Stockholder
Meeting, of any supplemental or amended disclosure that the Company Board of
Directors determines in good faith is required by applicable Law or the rules
and regulations of Nasdaq. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may, and
Parent may require the Company to, adjourn or postpone the Company Stockholder
Meeting one (1) time (for a period of not more than thirty (30) calendar days
but not past two (2) Business Days prior to the End Date), unless prior to
such adjournment or postponement the Company shall have received an aggregate
number of proxies voting for the adoption of this Agreement, which have not
been withdrawn, such that the condition in _Section 6.1(a)(ii)_ would be
satisfied at such meeting if it were to be held without such postponement or
adjournment. Once the Company has established a record date for the
Company Stockholder Meeting, the Company shall not change such record date or
establish a different record date for the Company Stockholder Meeting without
the prior written consent of Parent, unless required to do so by applicable
Law or the Companys Bylaws. Unless the Company Board of Directors shall have
effected a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, the Company shall use best
efforts to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval, including to solicit
proxies in favor of the adoption of this Agreement. Unless this Agreement has
been terminated pursuant to _ARTICLE VII_ , the Company shall submit this
Agreement to its stockholders at the Company Stockholder Meeting even if the
Company Board of Directors shall have effected a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change or proposed or announced any intention to do so. The
Company shall, upon the reasonable request of Parent, advise Parent at least
on a daily basis on each of the last seven (7) Business Days prior to the date
of the Company Stockholder Meeting as to the aggregate tally of proxies
received by the Company with respect to the Company Stockholder Approval.
Without the prior written consent of Parent, the adoption of this Agreement
shall be the only matter (other than related procedural matters) that the
Company shall propose to be acted on by the stockholders of the Company at the
Company Stockholder Meeting. Nothing contained in this _Section 5.4_ shall in
any way affect the Companys termination rights pursuant to _ARTICLE VII_.

Section 5.5 Employee Matters.

 

(a) Effective as of the Effective Time and until the one (1) year anniversary
of the Closing Date, Parent shall provide, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to provide, to each employee of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries who continue to be employed by Parent or the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries following the Effective
Time (the "Company Employees") for so long as the applicable Company Employee
remains employed by Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective Subsidiaries, (i) annual cash compensation (in the form of base
salary and cash-based incentive compensation opportunity) which is no less
than that provided to such Company Employee immediately prior to the Effective
Time,

 



55  (ii) employee benefits that are no less favorable in the aggregate than
employee benefits provided to similarly situated employees of Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries, but in no event less than those received by such Company
Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (iii) an equity-based
incentive compensation opportunity that is no less favorable that that
provided to similarly situated employees of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries.

(b) Following the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, cause any employee benefit plans sponsored or maintained by
Parent or the Surviving Corporation or their respective Subsidiaries in which
the Company Employees are eligible to participate following the Closing Date
(collectively, the "Post-Closing Plans") to recognize the service of each
Company Employee with the Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective
Time for purposes of eligibility, vesting and benefit accrual (including
vacation and other paid time off credit) under such Post-Closing Plans, in
each case, to the same extent such service was recognized immediately prior to
the Effective Time under a comparable Company Benefit Plan in which such
Company Employee was eligible to participate immediately prior to the
Effective Time;  _provided_ that such recognition of service shall not (i)
apply for purposes of any defined benefit retirement plan or plan that
provides retiree welfare benefits, (ii) operate to duplicate any benefits of a
Company Employee with respect to the same period of service, (iii) apply for
purposes of any plan, program or arrangement of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries that is grandfathered or frozen, either with respect to level of
benefits or participation. With respect to any Post-Closing Plan, for the
plan year in which such Company Employee is first eligible to participate,
Parent shall (A) cause any pre-existing condition limitations or eligibility
waiting periods or actively-at-work requirements under such plan to be waived
with respect to such Company Employee, and (B) with respect to any Post-
Closing Plan that provides medical, dental, pharmaceutical or vision
insurance, credit each Company Employee for an amount equal to any medical,
dental, pharmaceutical or vision expenses incurred by such Company Employee
in the year that includes the Closing Date (or, if later, the year in which
such Company Employee is first eligible to participate in such Post-Closing
Plan, if applicable) for purposes of any applicable deductible, coinsurance
and annual out-of-pocket expense requirements under any such Post-Closing Plan
to the extent such expenses would have been credited under the Company Benefit
Plan in which such Company Employee participated immediately prior to the
Effective Time. Such credited expenses shall also count toward any annual or
lifetime limits, treatment or visit limits or similar limitations that apply
under the terms of the applicable plan.

 

(c) Unless otherwise directed in writing by Parent at least five (5) Business
Days prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board of Directors (or the
appropriate committee thereof) shall adopt resolutions and take such corporate
action as is reasonably necessary to terminate the Companys 401(k) plan (the
"Company 401(k) Plan"), effective as of the Business Day prior to the
Effective Time. Following the Effective Time and as soon as practicable
following receipt of a favorable determination letter from the IRS on the
termination of the Company 401(k) Plan, the assets thereof shall be
distributed to the participants, and Parent shall take any and all actions as
may be required, including amendments to the Company 401(k) Plan and/or
Parents applicable 401(k) plan (the "Parent 401(k) Plan") to permit the
Company Employees who are then actively employed to make rollover
contributions of "eligible rollover distributions" (within the meaning of
Section 401(a)(31) of the Code, in the form of cash, shares of Parent Common
Stock, notes (in the case of loans) or a combination thereof in an amount
equal to the full account balance distributed to such Company Employee from
the Company 401(k) Plan to the Parent 401(k) Plan, it being agreed that there
shall be no gap in participation by any Company Employee in a tax-qualified
defined contribution plan.

 



56 (d) Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any Company Employee or other
service provider any right to continue in the employ or service of Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, or shall interfere with or restrict in
any way the rights of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, which
rights are hereby expressly reserved, to discharge or terminate the services
of any Company Employee at any time for any reason whatsoever, with or without
cause. In no event shall the terms of this Agreement be deemed to (i)
establish, amend, or modify any Company Benefit Plan or any "employee benefit
plan" as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, or any other benefit plan, program,
agreement or arrangement maintained or sponsored by Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries (including, after the Closing Date, the Company and its
Subsidiaries) or Affiliates; or (ii) alter or limit the ability of Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries (including, after the Closing Date, the Company and
its Subsidiaries) or Affiliates to amend, modify or terminate any Company
Benefit Plan or any other compensation or benefit or employment plan, program,
agreement or arrangement after the Closing Date. Notwithstanding any provision
in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing in this _Section 5.5_
shall create any third party beneficiary rights in any Company Employee or
current or former service provider of the Company or its Affiliates (or any
beneficiaries or dependents thereof).

 

Section 5.6 Regulatory Approvals; Efforts.

 

(a) Prior to the Closing, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall use their
respective reasonable best efforts to consummate the Merger and make
effective the Merger as promptly as practicable, including with respect to (i)
the preparation and filing of all forms, registrations, applications and
notices required to be filed under applicable Law to consummate the Merger
(including the Form S-4 and the Proxy Statement/Prospectus), (ii) the
satisfaction of the conditions to the consummation of the Merger, (iii) the
taking of all reasonable actions necessary to obtain (and cooperating with
each other in obtaining) any consent, authorization or approval of, or any
Order or exemption by, any third party, including any Governmental Entity
required to be obtained or made by Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any of
their respective Subsidiaries in connection with the Merger or the taking of
any action contemplated by this Agreement, and (iv) the execution and delivery
of any reasonable additional instruments necessary to consummate the Merger
and to fully carry out the purposes of this Agreement.

 

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, the Company and
Parent shall make an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form
pursuant to the HSR Act as promptly as practicable, but in any event no later
than ten (10) Business Days after the date of this Agreement, unless the
Company and Parent mutually agree on a later date. Each of the Company and
Parent shall use its respective reasonable best efforts to supply as promptly
as practicable any additional information and documentary material that may be
requested by any Governmental Entity pursuant to the HSR Act or any other
Antitrust Law and use its respective reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all other actions consistent with this _Section 5.6_
necessary to cause the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting
periods under the HSR Act as soon as practicable. Each party shall use
reasonable best efforts to ensure that its respective HSR Act filing is in
compliance with the requirements of the HSR Act and the rules promulgated
thereunder. The Company and Parent shall each request early termination of
the waiting period with respect to the Merger under the HSR Act. If the
Parties are served with a "second request for additional documents and
information" (a "Second Request") regarding the Transactions, then Parent and
the Company shall make, or cause to be made, as promptly as reasonably
practicable and after reasonable consultation with each other, a mutually
agreeable appropriate response to such request.

 



57 (c) Parent agrees not to extend, directly or indirectly, any waiting period
under the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Law or enter into any agreement with
a Governmental Entity to delay or not to consummate the Merger or any of the
other Transactions, except with the prior written consent of the Company,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; _provided, however_ , that
Parent may in accordance with the rules promulgated under the HSR Act pull-
and-refile its HSR filing once to extend the initial waiting period by an
additional thirty (30) days without Companys consent.

(d) Parent and the Company shall each keep the other apprised of the status of
matters relating to the completion of the Merger, including any proceeding
initiated by a private Person, and work cooperatively in connection with
obtaining all required consents, authorizations or approvals of, or any Orders
or exemptions by, any Governmental Entity, pursuant to the provisions of this
_Section 5.6_. In that regard, prior to the Closing, each Party shall
promptly consult with the other Parties to this Agreement with respect to and
provide any reasonable information and assistance as the other Parties may
reasonably request with respect to all filings, notifications or submissions
made by such Party with any Governmental Entity, or in connection with any
proceeding by a private Person, made to any other Person, or any other
information supplied by such Party to a Governmental Entity, or in connection
with any proceeding by a private Person, made to any other Person, in
connection with this Agreement and the Merger. Each Party to this Agreement
shall promptly inform the other Parties to this Agreement and, if in writing,
furnish the other Parties with copies of (or, in the case of oral
communications, advise the other Parties orally of) any communication from or
to any Governmental Entity regarding the Merger, or in connection with any
proceeding by a private Person, to or from any other Person, and afford the
other Parties a reasonable opportunity to review and discuss in advance, and
consider in good faith the views of the other Parties in connection with, any
proposed communication with any such Governmental Entity, or in connection
with any proceeding by a private Person, with any other Person.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parties agree that it is Parents sole
right to devise the strategy for all filings, notifications, submissions and
communications with a Governmental Entity subject to this _Section 5.6_;
provided, that Parent agrees to consult in advance with the Company on the
strategy for such filings, notifications, submissions and communications. If
any Party to this Agreement or any Representative of such Party receives a
request for additional information or documentary material from any
Governmental Entity with respect to the Merger, then such Party shall use
reasonable best efforts to make, or cause to be made, as promptly as
reasonably practicable and after reasonable consultation with the other
Parties to this Agreement, an appropriate response to such request. Each Party
agrees to consult with the other Party in advance of any meeting or
teleconference with any Governmental Entity discussing substantive issues or,
in connection with any proceeding by a private Person, with any other Person,
and, to the extent not prohibited by the Governmental Entity or other Person,
give the other Party the opportunity to attend and participate in such
meetings and teleconferences. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent and the
Company may, as each deems advisable and necessary, reasonably designate any
competitively sensitive material provided to the other under this _Section
5.6_ as "Antitrust Counsel Only Material." Such materials and the information
contained therein shall be given only to the outside antitrust counsel of the
recipient and will not be disclosed by such outside counsel to employees,
officers or directors of the recipient unless express permission is obtained
in advance from the source of the materials (Parent or the Company, as the
case may be) or its legal counsel. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this _Section 5.6_, materials provided pursuant to this _Section
5.6_ may be redacted (i) to remove references concerning the valuation of the
Company and the Merger or other confidential information, (ii) as necessary
to comply with contractual arrangements, and (iii) as necessary to address
reasonable privilege concerns.

 



58 (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
nothing shall require Parent to take any action, including: (i) disposing or
transferring any asset, including those of Parent or the Company; (ii)
licensing or otherwise making available to any Person, any technology or other
intellectual property of Parent or the Company; (iii) holding separate any
assets or operations (either before or after the Closing Date) of Parent or
the Company; or (iv) changing or modifying any course of conduct or otherwise
making any commitment (to any Governmental Entity or otherwise) regarding
future operations of the businesses of Parent or the Company to obtain any
approval from any Governmental Entity or to prevent the initiation of any
lawsuit by any Governmental Entity under any Antitrust Law or to prevent the
entry of any Order that would otherwise make the Merger unlawful. Parent shall
not be obligated to defend any action or proceeding instituted (or threatened
to be instituted) challenging the Transactions as violative of any
Antitrust Law, or if any Order is entered, enforced or attempted to be
entered or enforced by a Governmental Entity, which Order would make the
Transactions illegal or would otherwise prohibit, prevent, restrict, impair or
delay consummation of the Transactions, Parent is not required to take any
action to contest or resist any such action or proceeding or to have vacated,
lifted, reversed or overturned any such Order, whether temporary, preliminary
or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts
consummation of the Transactions or to have such Order repealed, rescinded or
made inapplicable so as to permit consummation of the Transactions.

 

Section 5.7 Takeover Statutes. None of Parent, the Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries shall take any action that would cause the
Transactions or any Voting Agreement, to be subject to requirements imposed by
any takeover statute. If any "moratorium", "control share acquisition", "fair
price", "supermajority", "affiliate transactions" or "business combination
statute or regulation" or other similar state anti-takeover Laws and
regulations may become, or may purport to be, applicable to the Transactions,
or any Voting Agreement, each of the Company and Parent and their respective
boards of directors shall grant such approvals and take such actions as are
reasonably necessary so that the transactions contemplated hereby and by the
Voting Agreements may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated hereby and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of

Section 5.9 Indemnification and Insurance.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, indemnify and hold harmless,
to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, each present and former
director and officer of the Company and any of its Subsidiaries (in each case,
when acting in such capacity) (collectively, together with their 

 



59  respective heirs, executors and administrators, the "Company Indemnified
Parties") against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys
fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or Liabilities incurred in
connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or related to
the fact that such person is or was a director or officer of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries and pertaining to matters existing or occurring or
actions or omissions taken prior to the Effective Time, including (i) the
Transactions, and (ii) actions to enforce this  _Section 5.9_ or any other
indemnification or advancement right of any Company Indemnified Party, and the
Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to, also advance expenses to the Company Indemnified Parties as incurred to
the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law; _provided_ that the Company
Indemnified Party to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to
repay such advances if it is ultimately determined by a final
and nonappealable judicial determination that such Company Indemnified Party
is not entitled to indemnification.

(b) From and after the Effective Time until the sixth (6th) anniversary
thereof, the Organizational Documents of the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time shall contain provisions no less
favorable with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and
exculpation of individuals who were, prior to the Effective Time, directors,
officers or employees of the Company, a Subsidiary of the Company or any of
their predecessor entities, than are presently set forth in the Company
Organizational Documents and the Company Subsidiary Organizational Documents,
which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any
manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any such
individuals.

 

(c) All rights to indemnification and exculpation from Liabilities for acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time and rights to
advancement of expenses relating thereto now existing in favor of any Company
Indemnified Party or as provided in the Company Organizational Documents (or
Company Subsidiary Organizational Documents), or any indemnification
agreements in existence as of the date hereof between such Company
Indemnified Party and the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that are set
forth on _Section 5.9(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, shall survive
the Transactions and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance
with their terms, and shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for
a period of six (6) years after the Closing Date in any manner that would
adversely affect the rights thereunder of such Company Indemnified Parties.

(d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall and, if the Company is
unable to, the Surviving Corporation shall promptly following the Effective
Time, obtain and fully pay the premium for the extension of the directors and
officers liability coverage of the Companys existing directors and
officers insurance policies for a claims reporting or discovery period of at
least six (6) years from and after the Closing Date from an insurance carrier
with the same or better credit rating as the Companys current insurance
carrier with respect to directors and officers liability insurance and
fiduciary liability insurance (collectively, "DandO Insurance") with terms,
conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are at least as favorable
as the Companys existing policies with respect to any actual or alleged
error, misstatement, misleading statement, act, omission, neglect, breach of
duty or any matter claimed against a director or officer of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries by reason of him or her serving in such capacity that
existed or occurred at or prior to the Effective Time (including in connection
with this Agreement or the Transactions). If the Company or the Surviving
Corporation for any reason fails to obtain such "tail" insurance policies as
of the Effective Time, then, for a period of six (6) years after the Closing
Date, the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be maintained in effect the DandO
Insurance in place as of the date hereof with terms, conditions,

 



60  retentions and limits of liability that are at least as favorable as those
provided in the Companys existing policies as of the date hereof (provided
that the Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor policies with a
substantially comparable insurer of similar national reputation that have at
least the same coverage and amounts as the DandO Insurance in place on the date
hereof and containing terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability
which are no less advantageous to the Company Indemnified Parties than those
of the DandO Insurance in place on the date hereof) with respect to claims
arising from facts or events, or actions or omissions, which occurred or are
alleged to have occurred at or before the Effective Time; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Surviving Corporation shall not be obligated to make
annual premium payments for such insurance to the extent such premiums exceed
300% of the premiums paid as of the date hereof by the Company for such
insurance (the "Premium Cap"), and if such premiums for such insurance would
at any time exceed the Premium Cap, then the Surviving Corporation shall cause
to be maintained policies of insurance which, in the Surviving Corporations
good faith determination, provide the maximum coverage available at an annual
premium equal to the Premium Cap.

 

(e) The rights of each Company Indemnified Party pursuant to this _Section
5.9_ shall be in addition to, and not in limitation of, any other rights such
Company Indemnified Party may have under the Company Organizational Documents
(or Company Subsidiary Organizational Documents) or under any applicable
Contracts or Law.

 

(f) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other
corporation or entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation
or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any individual, corporation
or other entity, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made
so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation
shall assume all of the obligations set forth in this _Section 5.9_.

 

(g) The provisions of this _Section 5.9_ and _(b)_ shall survive the
Effective Time and are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, each Company Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and
representatives.

Section 5.10 Section 16 Matters. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the
Company shall take all such steps as may be required to cause any dispositions
of Company Common Stock (including derivative securities with respect to
Company Common Stock) or acquisitions of shares of Parent Common Stock
(including derivative securities with respect to Parent Common Stock)
resulting from the Transactions by each individual who is subject to the
reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to
the Company or will become subject to such reporting requirements with respect
to Parent, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 

Section 5.11 Transaction Litigation. The Company shall give Parent the
opportunity to participate in, but not control, the Companys defense or
settlement of any stockholder litigation against the Company and/or its
directors or executive officers relating to the Transactions. The Company
agrees that it shall not settle or offer to settle any litigation
commenced prior to or after the date of this Agreement against the Company or
its directors, executive officers or similar persons by any stockholder of the
Company relating to this Agreement, the Merger, or the other Transactions
without the prior written consent of Parent, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed.

 



61 Section 5.12 Nasdaq Matters.

 

(a) Parent shall file a notification of listing of additional shares (or such
other form as may be required) with Nasdaq with respect to the shares of
Parent Common Stock to be issued in connection with the Merger and such other
shares of Parent Common Stock to be reserved for issuance in connection with
the Merger, and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the shares of
Parent Common Stock to be issued in connection with the Merger and such other
shares of Parent Common Stock to be reserved for issuance in connection with
the Merger to be approved for listing on Nasdaq, subject to official notice of
issuance, prior to the Effective Time.

(b) The Company shall cooperate with Parent and use reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions reasonably necessary, proper or
advisable on its part under applicable Laws and rules and policies of Nasdaq
to enable the delisting of the Company Common Stock from Nasdaq and the
termination of its registration under the Exchange Act, in each case, as
promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, provided that such delisting
and termination shall not be effective until after the Effective Time.

 

Section 5.13 Certain Tax Matters. Each of the Company and Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain the opinions of counsel referenced in
_Section 6.2(d)_ and _Section 6.3(d)_), including by executing and
delivering customary tax representation letters to each such counsel in form
and substance reasonably satisfactory to such counsel. None of the Parties
shall (and each Party shall cause its respective Subsidiaries not to)
knowingly take any action (or fail to take any reasonable action) which action
(or failure to act) would reasonably be expected to prevent or impede the
Merger from qualifying as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Code. The Parties intend to report and, provided the above
referenced opinions of counsel are received, except to the extent otherwise
required by Law, shall report, for federal income tax purposes, the Merger as
a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

 

Section 5.14 Advice of Changes. The Company and Parent shall each promptly
advise the other Party of (i) any notice or other communication from any
counterparty to a Contract with regard to any action, consent, approval or
waiver that is required to be taken or obtained with respect to such Contract
in connection with the consummation of the Transactions (and provide a copy
thereof), (ii) any notice or other communication from any other person
alleging that the consent of such person is or may be required in connection
with the Transactions (and provide a copy thereof) or (iii) upon receiving
any communication from any Governmental Entity or third party whose consent
or approval is required for consummation of the Transactions that causes such
Party to believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that any such consent
or approval will not be obtained or that the receipt of any such consent or
approval will be materially delayed. The Company shall notify Parent as
promptly as practicable of any notice or other communication from any party to
any Company Material Contract to the effect that such party has terminated or
intends to terminate or otherwise materially adversely modify its relationship
with the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company as a result of the
Transactions.

 

Section 5.15 Parent Board. Parent shall take all appropriate actions at or
prior to the Closing to appoint Christopher G. Chavez to Class II of the

the due, prompt and faithful payment, performance and discharge by Merger Sub
of, and the compliance

 



62  by Merger Sub with, all of the covenants, agreements, obligations and
undertakings of Merger Sub under this Agreement in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement, and covenants and agrees to take all actions necessary or
advisable to ensure such payment, performance and discharge by Merger Sub
hereunder. Parent shall, promptly following execution of this Agreement,
approve and adopt this Agreement in its capacity as sole stockholder
of Merger Sub and deliver to the Company evidence of its vote or action by
written consent approving and adopting this Agreement in accordance with
applicable Law and the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of Merger Sub.

of such termination, in each case other than any failures of such conditions
to be satisfied that result from a breach by Parent of this Agreement where
such breach proximately contributed to the failure of such conditions to be
satisfied or capable of satisfaction) have been satisfied or waived on or
prior to the date of such termination, then Parent shall pay to the Company
the Reverse Termination Fee, by wire transfer (to an account designated by

Company or Parent (the "Breaching Party") fails to pay in a timely manner any
amount due pursuant to this _Section 7.3_, and, in order to obtain such
payment, the other Party (the "Non-Breaching Party") commences a suit that
results in a judgment against the Breaching Party for the amounts set forth
in this _Section 7.3_ or any portion thereof, then (i) the Breaching Party
shall reimburse the Non-Breaching Party for all costs and expenses (including
disbursements and reasonable fees of counsel) incurred in connection with
such suit and (ii) the Breaching Party shall pay to the Non-Breaching Party
interest on such amount from and including the date payment of such amount was
