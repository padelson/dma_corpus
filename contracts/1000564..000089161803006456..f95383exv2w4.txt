                          AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

      This Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of November 17, 2003, is
entered into by and among CPI ACQUISITION CORP., a Delaware corporation
("ACQUIROR"), CPI MERGER SUB CORP., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned
subsidiary of Acquiror ("MERGER SUB"), COMMUNICATIONS & POWER INDUSTRIES HOLDING
CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation (the "COMPANY"), and GREEN EQUITY INVESTORS,
II, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership ("GEI"), as the Securityholders'
Representative.

      A. The respective boards of directors of Acquiror, Merger Sub and the
Company have approved this Agreement and have determined that it is advisable
and in the best interests of each such corporation and its respective
stockholders to effect a merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company, with
the Company as the surviving corporation, pursuant to the Certificate of Merger
and upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein.

      B. Pursuant to the Merger, all shares of Company Common Stock (other than
Dissenting Shares, shares owned by Acquiror or Merger Sub, and shares held in
the treasury of the Company) shall be cancelled and converted into the right to
receive cash and, all vested Stock Options shall either be cancelled and
converted automatically into the right to receive cash or if agreed to in
writing by Acquiror and any holder of Stock Options, converted into options to
purchase stock of Acquiror.

      C. Stockholders of the Company holding at least a majority of the
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock have approved the Merger and have
approved and adopted this Agreement.

      D. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, the Company,
Acquiror, the Securityholders' Representative and certain stockholders and
option holders of the Company are entering into a voting and indemnification
agreement in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A (the "VOTING AND
INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENT"), pursuant to which (i) such stockholders and option
holders are agreeing to vote all shares of Company Common Stock now owned or
hereafter acquired by them in favor of, or deliver written consents approving,
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (ii) such stockholders and
option holders are severally and proportionally agreeing to indemnify Acquiror
following the Closing, all as more fully set forth therein.

      NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual
representations, warranties and covenants contained herein and intending to be
legally bound, the parties hereto agree as follows (capitalized terms used
herein but not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings set forth in
Article X hereof):
<PAGE>
                                    ARTICLE I
                                   THE MERGER

      1.1 THE MERGER.

            1.1.1 At the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and
into the Company in accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law (the
"DGCL") and the terms and conditions hereof (the "MERGER"). Upon consummation of
the Merger, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and the
Company, as the surviving corporation in the Merger (the "SURVIVING
CORPORATION"), shall continue its existence under the DGCL.

            1.1.2 On the Closing Date, Merger Sub and the Company shall cause a
certificate of merger (the "CERTIFICATE OF MERGER") to be executed and filed
with the Secretary of State of Delaware as provided in Section 251 of the DGCL
and will make all other filings or recordings required by applicable Law in
connection with the Merger. The Merger shall become effective at such time as
the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with the Secretary of State of Delaware
or at such later time as is agreed to by the parties hereto and is specified in
the Certificate of Merger (such date and time being referred to herein as the
"EFFECTIVE TIME").

            1.1.3 The Merger shall have the effects set forth in the DGCL.

            1.1.4 Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the closing of the
Merger (the "CLOSING") and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall
take place at the offices of Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP, 425 Lexington
Avenue, New York, New York 10017 at 9:00 A.M. (Eastern Standard time) on a date
to be mutually agreed upon by Acquiror and the Securityholders' Representative,
which date shall be no later than the third Business Day after all of the
conditions set forth in Article VI have been satisfied or waived (other than
those conditions that by their terms are intended to be satisfied at the
Closing) or at such other place and time as Acquiror and the Securityholders'
Representative may agree. The date upon which the Closing occurs is hereinafter
referred to as the "CLOSING DATE."

            1.1.5 At least two (2) Business Days prior to the scheduled Closing
Date, the Company shall deliver to Acquiror (a) a certificate signed by an
officer of the Company certifying as to (i) a schedule setting forth the Net
Indebtedness and Preferred Stock Amount as of the scheduled Closing Date, (ii)
the list of Persons to whom Transaction Expenses are owed as of the scheduled
Closing Date and as to the amount of each Transaction Expense as of such date
and (iii) the amount of the unpaid Specified Bonuses as of the scheduled Closing
Date and the Persons to whom such unpaid Specified Bonuses are payable and (b) a
list of the accounts to which funds to pay any Indebtedness, Senior Preferred
Stock, Junior Preferred Stock and such Transaction Expenses and unpaid Specified
Bonuses shall be wired. If the Closing does not occur on the scheduled Closing
Date, the Company shall deliver an updated certificate with respect to the
amounts as of any subsequently scheduled Closing Date.

      1.2 MERGER CONSIDERATION AND CONVERSION OF SECURITIES. At the Effective
Time, pursuant to this Agreement and by virtue of the Merger and without any


                                      - 2 -
<PAGE>
action on the part of Acquiror, Merger Sub, the Company or the holders of any of
the following securities:

            1.2.1 (a)(i) Each Stock Option outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time, to the extent unvested, shall immediately become vested, and
(ii) each share of restricted Company Common Stock set forth on Schedule 1.2.1
and issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, to the
extent unvested, shall immediately become vested; (b) Each vested Stock Option
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, including any such Stock
Option that becomes vested pursuant to Section 1.2.1(a), immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be exercisable, at the sole discretion of the holder of
such Stock Options, for shares of Company Common Stock. Schedule 1.2.1(b) (which
shall be prepared by the Company and Acquiror after the date hereof and prior to
Closing) shall set forth the specific Stock Options to be so exercised.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that the vesting of the Stock
Options would result in an "excess parachute payment" pursuant to Section 280G
of the Code, such Stock Options shall not be vested unless the requisite
approval of the stockholders of the Company pursuant to Section 280G(b)(5)(ii)
of the Code is obtained. If stockholder approval for such vesting is not
obtained, then the unvested portion of such Stock Options shall not be exchanged
for cash as provided in Section 1.2.3 but shall instead be converted into
options to purchase common stock of Acquiror subject to the following
parameters: (i) the vesting schedule of the options shall be the same as the
vesting schedule for the unvested Stock Options and (ii) each option shall
preserve the product of (A) the difference between (x) the Per Share Amount
minus (y) the exercise price per share of the applicable Stock Option multiplied
by (B) the number of the shares subject to the unvested portion of such Stock
Option. In addition, with respect to each share subject to the unvested portion
of such Stock Options, the holder of such option shall be entitled to (x) the
Per Share Additional Amount (if any) and (y) the payment described in Section
2.3.1(e) and distributions from the Expense Escrow Amount and the Working
Capital Escrow Amount, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and
the Escrow Agreement.

            1.2.2 Each vested share of the Common Stock, par value $0.01 per
share, of the Company ("COMPANY COMMON STOCK") issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any Dissenting Shares and
shares to be cancelled pursuant to Section 1.2.4) shall be cancelled and shall
be converted automatically into (a) the right to receive, at the Effective Time,
an amount in cash equal to the Per Share Amount, (b) the right to receive,
subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, an amount in cash equal
to the Per Share Additional Amount (if any) and (c) the right to receive,
subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement,
the payment described in Section 2.3.1(e) and the distributions from the Expense
Escrow Amount and the Working Capital Escrow Amount pursuant to Sections 2.3.2
and 2.3.3 (the shares of Company Common Stock being converted into the right to
receive the amounts set forth in subsections (a)-(c) above are hereinafter
referred to as the "COMPANY SHARES"). The amount payable to any holder of
Company Shares pursuant to clause (a) of this Section 1.2.2 shall be reduced by
the aggregate principal amount and accrued and unpaid interest (through and
including the Closing Date) with respect to any Management Equity Loans owing by
such holder.

            1.2.3 Except as otherwise agreed to in writing by Acquiror and any
holder of Stock Options, each vested Stock Option outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective


                                      - 3 -
<PAGE>
Time shall be cancelled, shall cease to be outstanding and shall be converted
automatically into (a) the right to receive, at the Effective Time, an amount in
cash equal to (i) the Per Share Amount per share of Company Common Stock
issuable upon the exercise of such Stock Option less (ii) the exercise price for
each such share of Company Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of such Stock
Option, (b) the right to receive, subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, an amount in cash equal to the Per Share Additional Amount, if any,
per share of Company Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of such Stock
Option, and (c) the right to receive, subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, the payment described in Section
2.3.1(e) and the distributions from the Expense Escrow Amount and the Working
Capital Escrow Amount pursuant to Sections 2.3.2 and 2.3.3.

            1.2.4 Each share of Company Common Stock held in the treasury of the
Company or held by Acquiror or Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist without any
conversion thereof and no payment or distribution shall be made with respect
thereto.

            1.2.5 Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of
Merger Sub that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be converted into one share of common stock, par value $0.01 per
share, of the Surviving Corporation.

      1.3 PAYMENT AND EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES.

            1.3.1 At the Effective Time, Acquiror or Merger Sub shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to possess an amount in cash that, together with cash of
the Company on hand at such time, shall be sufficient to pay (a) the aggregate
Merger Consideration payable pursuant to Sections 1.2.2(a) and 1.2.3(a), (b) the
Net Indebtedness and Preferred Stock Amount as of the Closing Date, (c) the
amount of Transaction Expenses listed on the certificate delivered pursuant to
Section 1.1.5 and (d) the Escrow Amount.

            1.3.2 At the Effective Time, the Company will deliver or cause to be
delivered to each holder of Stock Options being cancelled pursuant to Section
1.2.3 an amount in cash equal to the Merger Consideration payable to such holder
pursuant to Section 1.2.3(a).

            1.3.3 Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall mail to each
holder of record of Company Shares (a) a form of letter of transmittal (which
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
certificates or other instrument(s) evidencing the Company Shares (the "SHARE
CERTIFICATES") shall pass, only upon proper delivery of a Share Certificate to
the Company, and which shall be in such form and have such other provisions as
Acquiror and the Company may reasonably specify prior to the Effective Time) and
(b) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Share Certificates
pursuant to such letter of transmittal. Upon the later to occur of (i) the
surrender to the Company of a Share Certificate, together with such letter of
transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be required pursuant to
such instructions and (ii) the Effective Time, subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, the Company shall pay to the holder of such Share


                                      - 4 -
<PAGE>
Certificate in exchange therefor the amounts set forth in Section 1.2 for each
Company Share formerly represented by such Share Certificate, and the Share
Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. Except as otherwise
specifically provided herein, no interest shall accrue or be paid on the amounts
set forth in Section 1.2 upon the surrender of any Share Certificate for the
benefit of the holder of such Share Certificate. Until surrendered and exchanged
as contemplated by this Section 1.3.3, each Share Certificate (other than
certificates representing Dissenting Shares and shares to be cancelled pursuant
to Section 1.2.4) shall, from and after the Effective Time, be deemed to
represent only the right to receive the amounts set forth in Section 1.2, and,
until such surrender, no cash or payment of any kind shall be paid to the holder
of such outstanding Share Certificate in respect thereof. All of the payments
provided for in Sections 1.3.2 and 1.3.3 shall be paid by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the bank accounts designated in writing by the
respective payees at least two (2) days prior to the Closing Date; provided,
however, that any such payment may be made by means of a check if (x) the amount
of any such payment is less than $150,000 or (y) wire instructions are not
provided on a timely basis.

            1.3.4 If payment of the amounts set forth in Section 1.2 is to be
made to a Person other than the registered holder of the Company Shares
represented by the Share Certificate so surrendered in exchange therefor, it
shall be a condition to such payment that the Share Certificate so surrendered
shall be properly endorsed, with signature guaranteed, or otherwise be in proper
form for transfer and that the Person requesting such payment shall pay to the
Company any transfer or other Taxes required as a result of such payment to a
Person other than the registered holder of such Company Shares or establish to
the satisfaction of the Company that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Acquiror, the
Surviving Corporation or the Company shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from the amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement (including any
transaction contemplated by this Agreement) to any Securityholder or holder of
Senior Preferred Stock, Junior Preferred Stock or Dissenting Shares such amounts
as Acquiror, the Surviving Corporation or the Company are required to deduct and
withhold under the Code or any provision of any applicable Law, with respect to
the making of such payment. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by
Acquiror, the Surviving Corporation or the Company, such withheld amounts shall
be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
Securityholder or holder of Senior Preferred Stock, Junior Preferred Stock or
Dissenting Shares (as applicable) in respect of whom such deduction and
withholding was made by Acquiror, the Surviving Corporation or the Company.

            1.3.5 After the Effective Time, there shall be no further transfers
on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the Company Shares
that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, Share Certificates previously representing Company Shares are
presented to the Surviving Corporation, they shall be cancelled and exchanged
for the amounts provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set forth,
in this Article I, subject to applicable law in the case of Dissenting Shares.

            1.3.6 In the event that any Share Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such Share Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required
by the Surviving Corporation, the


                                      - 5 -
<PAGE>
delivery by such holder of an indemnity agreement in such form and substance as
is reasonably requested by the Surviving Corporation as indemnity against any
claim that may be made against it with respect to such Share Certificate, the
Company will issue in exchange for and in lieu of such lost, stolen or destroyed
Share Certificate the amounts set forth in Section 1.2.

            1.3.7 The Surviving Corporation shall not be liable to any holder of
Company Shares for any amount paid to a public official pursuant to applicable
unclaimed property laws. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of Company
Shares six (6) years after the Effective Time (or such earlier date immediately
prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property
of any Governmental Entity) shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of any claims
or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

      1.4 ESCROW AMOUNTS. At the Effective Time, Acquiror shall deliver, or
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to possess sufficient funds to enable it
to deliver, and will cause it to deliver, to an escrow agent reasonably
acceptable to Acquiror and the Company (the "ESCROW AGENT") an amount in cash
equal to Two Million Dollars ($2,000,000) (together with all interest, income
and other amounts earned thereon, the "WORKING CAPITAL ESCROW AMOUNT") to
satisfy any Underpayment Amount owing pursuant to Section 2.3.1(b), plus an
amount in cash equal to Two Hundred Thousand Dollars ($200,000) to satisfy any
and all third party fees and expenses incurred by or on behalf of the
Securityholders' Representative (in its capacity as such) in connection with its
activities pursuant to Articles I and II hereof (together with all interest,
income and other amounts earned thereon, the "EXPENSE ESCROW AMOUNT," and,
collectively with the Working Capital Escrow Amount, the "ESCROW AMOUNT"). The
Escrow Agent shall hold the Escrow Amount in accordance with, and subject to,
the terms and conditions of an Escrow Agreement, by and among Acquiror, the
Company, GEI, as the Securityholders' Representative, and the Escrow Agent in
substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit B (the "ESCROW AGREEMENT"),
which shall be executed and delivered on the Closing Date.

      1.5 DISSENTING SHARES. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this
Agreement, shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by a holder who has
not voted such shares of Company Common Stock in favor of the Merger nor
consented thereto in writing and who has properly perfected its rights of
appraisal within the meaning of Section 262 of the DGCL or, if applicable,
Chapter 13 of the California Code, and who, as of the Effective Time, shall not
have effectively withdrawn or lost such right to relief as a dissenting
stockholder ("DISSENTING SHARES"), shall not be converted into the right to
receive the amounts set forth in Section 1.2. The holders of such Dissenting
Shares shall be entitled only to such rights as are granted by Section 262 of
the DGCL or, if applicable, Chapter 13 of the California Code. Each holder of
Dissenting Shares who becomes entitled to payment of the appraised value for
such Dissenting Shares pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL or, if applicable,
Chapter 13 of the California Code, shall receive payment therefor from the
Surviving Corporation in accordance with the DGCL or, if applicable, Chapter 13
of the California Code; provided, however, that if any such holder of Dissenting
Shares (i) shall have failed to establish such holder's entitlement to appraisal
as a dissenting stockholder as provided in Section 262 of


                                      - 6 -
<PAGE>
the DGCL, or, if applicable, Chapter 13 of the California Code, (ii) shall have
effectively withdrawn such holder's demand for appraisal as a dissenting
stockholder with respect to such Dissenting Shares, (iii) shall have lost such
holder's right of appraisal as a dissenting stockholder and payment under
Section 262 of the DGCL or, if applicable, Chapter 13 of the California Code, or
(iv) shall have failed to file a complaint with the appropriate court seeking
relief as to determination of the value of all Dissenting Shares within the time
provided in Section 262 of the DGCL or, if applicable, Chapter 13 of the
California Code, such holder shall forfeit the right of appraisal as a
dissenting stockholder with respect to such Dissenting Shares and each such
Dissenting Share shall be converted into the right to receive the amounts set
forth in Section 1.2, without interest thereon, from the Surviving Corporation
as provided in Section 1.2.2. The Company shall give Acquiror prompt notice of
any demands for appraisal filed pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL or, if
applicable, Chapter 13 of the California Code, received by the Company and
withdrawals of such demands received by the Company prior to the Effective Time,
and Acquiror shall have the right to participate in all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to demands made pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL or,
if applicable, Chapter 13 of the California Code. The Company shall not, except
with the prior written consent of Acquiror (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed), make any payment with respect to, or settle
or offer to settle, any such demands, or waive any failure to timely deliver a
written demand for appraisal or timely take any other action to perfect
appraisal rights in accordance with the DGCL or, if applicable, Chapter 13 of
the California Code.

      1.6 CORPORATE MATTERS.

            1.6.1 The certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation

certificate of incorporation and the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.

      1.7 MANAGEMENT ROLLOVER. Acquiror and any holder of Stock Options that is
a member of the management of CPI may enter into an agreement providing that any
or all of the Stock Options held by such holder shall be converted into stock
options of Acquiror on the terms and subject to the conditions to be specified
in such agreement. Schedule 1.7 (which shall be prepared by the Company and
Acquiror after the date hereof

                                   ARTICLE II
               WORKING CAPITAL ADJUSTMENT TO MERGER CONSIDERATION

      2.1 PREPARATION OF FINAL WORKING CAPITAL STATEMENT. As promptly as
practicable following the Closing Date (but in no event later than ninety (90)
days after the Closing Date), Acquiror shall prepare a statement (the "FINAL
WORKING CAPITAL STATEMENT") setting forth the computation of the Final Working
Capital of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the opening of business on the
Closing Date, and provided, for the avoidance of doubt, that no effect shall be
given to, and the Final Working Capital Statement shall not reflect, (i) any
transaction occurring between the opening of business on the Closing Date and
the close of business on the Closing Date relating to Acquiror's financing of
either the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) any transaction occurring on
the Closing Date between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries on the one hand
and/or Acquiror or any of its Affiliates on the other hand or (iii) any purchase
accounting or other similar adjustments resulting from the Final Working Capital
Statement. All accounting entries (including all liabilities and accruals) will
be taken into account regardless of their amount, and all errors and omissions
with respect to such accounting entries will be corrected and all proper
adjustments will be made. After delivery of the Final Working Capital Statement,
the Surviving Corporation shall provide the Securityholders' Representative and
its Representatives reasonably timely access to its accounting and financial
personnel and to such working papers, trial balances, financial information and
other similar information as may be reasonably requested by the Securityholders'
Representative.

      2.2 REVIEW BY SECURITYHOLDERS' REPRESENTATIVE.

            2.2.1 Upon completion of the Final Working Capital Statement,
Acquiror shall promptly deliver the same to the Securityholders' Representative
with a notice (the "NOTICE OF ADJUSTMENT") of Acquiror setting forth its
proposed adjustment, if any, of the Merger Consideration.

            2.2.2 Following receipt of the Notice of Adjustment, the
Securityholders' Representative will be afforded a period of twenty (20)
Business Days (the "FIRST 20-DAY PERIOD") to review the Notice of Adjustment. At
or before the end of the First 20-Day Period, the Securityholders'
Representative (i) will accept the Final Working Capital (as set forth in the
Notice of Adjustment) in its entirety, in which case the Final Working Capital
will be as set forth in the Notice of Adjustment or (ii) will deliver to
Acquiror a written notice (the "OBJECTION NOTICE") containing a detailed written
explanation of those items in the Final Working Capital Statement (as set forth
in the Notice of Adjustment) that the Securityholders' Representative disputes,
and specifying the amount thereof in dispute and the basis therefor, in which
case the items so identified by the Securityholders' Representative in such
Objection Notice shall be deemed to be in dispute. The failure by the
Securityholders' Representative to deliver the Objection Notice within the First
20-Day Period shall constitute the Securityholders' Representative's acceptance
of the Final Working Capital as set forth in the Notice of Adjustment. If the
Securityholders' Representative


                                      - 8 -
<PAGE>
delivers the Objection Notice in a timely manner, then, within a further period
of twenty (20) Business Days from the end of the First 20-Day Period, the
parties and, if desired, their accountants, will attempt to resolve in good
faith any disputed items and reach a written agreement (the "SETTLEMENT
AGREEMENT") with respect thereto. Failing such resolution, the unresolved
disputed items will be referred for final binding resolution to Deloitte &
Touche LLP or another nationally recognized independent accounting firm mutually
acceptable to the Securityholders' Representative and Acquiror (the "ARBITRATING
ACCOUNTANTS"). If the disputed items are referred to the Arbitrating
Accountants, (i) the Arbitrating Accountants shall consider only those items or
amounts as to which Acquiror and the Securityholders' Representative disagree
and (ii) the Final Working Capital will be deemed to be as determined by such
Arbitrating Accountants. Such determination (the "ACCOUNTANTS' DETERMINATION")
(A) shall be in writing, (B) shall be furnished to the Securityholders'
Representative and Acquiror as soon as practicable after the items in dispute
have been referred to the Arbitrating Accountants, (C) shall be made in a manner
that is consistent with the prescribed manner of preparation of the Final
Working Capital Statement pursuant to Section 2.1, (D) shall be nonappealable
and incontestable by the Company, the Securityholders' Representative, Acquiror
or any of their respective Affiliates, and (E) shall not be subject to
collateral attack for any reason absent manifest error or fraud.

            2.2.3 If any fees and expenses of the Arbitrating Accountants are
required to be paid prior to the final determination of the Final Working
Capital, then the Surviving Corporation shall pay all such fees and expenses
when due, provided that Acquiror and the Securityholders' Representative shall
give the Escrow Agent instructions to release to the Surviving Corporation from
the Working Capital Escrow Amount one-half (1/2) of any amounts paid to the
Arbitrating Accountants by the Surviving Corporation pursuant to this Section
2.2.3.

            2.2.4 Following the final determination of the Final Working
Capital, the total fees and expenses of the Arbitrating Accountants shall be
allocated among the Securityholders (but solely out of the Working Capital
Escrow Amount), on the one hand, and the Surviving Corporation, on the other
hand, in proportion to the extent to which each such party(ies) prevailed with
respect to the total amount in dispute. Such allocation shall be accomplished by
means of the payments described in Sections 2.3.1(d), 2.3.1(e) and 2.3.2(a). For
purposes of this Agreement, "SURVIVING CORPORATION'S SHARE OF ACCOUNTING
EXPENSES" shall mean the total fees and expenses of the Arbitrating Accountants
allocated to the Surviving Corporation pursuant to the first sentence of this
Section 2.2.4.

      2.3 ADJUSTMENT.

            2.3.1 Upon the final determination of the Final Working Capital in
accordance with this Article II, the following amounts will be payable within
five (5) Business Days of the Final Determination Date in accordance with the
following terms:

                  (a) if the Final Working Capital is greater than the Estimated
Closing Date Working Capital, Acquiror shall promptly pay to each Securityholder
in accordance with written payment instructions furnished by such holder to
Acquiror, such holder's Per Share Additional Amount. All of the payments to
Securityholders provided for in this Section 2.3.1(a) shall be paid by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to the


                                      - 9 -
<PAGE>
bank accounts designated in writing by the respective payees at least two (2)
days prior to the date of such payments; provided, however, any such payment may
be made by means of a check if (x) the amount of any such payment is less than
$100,000 or (y) wire instructions are not provided at least two (2) Business
Days prior to the fifth Business Day following such final determination;

                  (b) if the Final Working Capital is less than the Estimated
Closing Date Working Capital (such difference, the "UNDERPAYMENT AMOUNT"), then
the payments described in Section 2.3.2(c) shall be paid to Acquiror from the
Working Capital Escrow Amount; provided, however, in no event shall any
Securityholder have any personal or individual liability for payment of the
Underpayment Amount, any portion thereof or any portion of the fees of the
Arbitrating Accountants;

                  (c) if the Final Working Capital is equal to the Estimated
Closing Date Working Capital, no adjustment shall be made to the Merger
Consideration;

                  (d) the Surviving Corporation shall pay to the Arbitrating
Accountants any remaining outstanding fees and expenses of the Arbitrating
Accountants; and

                  (e) if (x) the Surviving Corporation's Share of Accounting
Expenses exceeds (y) the sum of the total amounts previously paid by the
Surviving Corporation pursuant to Section 2.2.3 that were not previously
reimbursed out of the Working Capital Escrow Amount and the amounts paid by the
Surviving Corporation pursuant to Section 2.3.1(d), then the Surviving
Corporation, at its option, (i) shall pay to each Securityholder such
Securityholder's Percentage Share of such excess or (ii) shall reduce payments
(if any) to be made to Acquiror pursuant to Section 2.3.2(c) by the amount of
any such excess.

      2.3.2 Upon the final determination of Final Working Capital in accordance
with this Article II, the Securityholders' Representative and Acquiror shall
give instructions to the Escrow Agent to cause the following payments to be made
from the Working Capital Escrow Amount within five (5) Business Days of the
Final Determination Date in accordance with the following terms:

                  (a) (i) If Arbitrating Accountants were engaged, and (x) the
sum of the total amounts previously paid by the Surviving Corporation pursuant
to Section 2.2.3 that were not previously reimbursed out of the Working Capital
Escrow Amount and the amounts paid by the Surviving Corporation pursuant to
Section 2.3.1(d), exceeds (y) the Surviving Corporation's Share of Accounting
Expenses, then the Securityholders' Representative and Acquiror shall give
instructions to the Escrow Agent to disburse from the Working Capital Escrow
Amount to the Surviving Corporation the lesser of the amount of such excess and
the remaining Working Capital Escrow Amount.

                        (ii) To the extent not previously disbursed to Acquiror
pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Escrow Agreement, the
Securityholders' Representative and Acquiror shall give instructions to the
Escrow Agent to disburse to Acquiror from the Working Capital Escrow Amount an
amount sufficient to pay the taxes


                                     - 10 -
<PAGE>
owed by Acquiror with respect to income allocated to Acquiror pursuant to the
Escrow Agreement, pursuant to and as more fully set forth in the Escrow
Agreement.

                  (b) If the Final Working Capital is greater than the Estimated
Closing Date Working Capital, then the Securityholders' Representative and
Acquiror shall give instructions to the Escrow Agent to disburse to each
Securityholder an amount equal to the product of (i) such Securityholder's
Percentage Share and (ii) the Working Capital Escrow Amount remaining after the
payment (if any) set forth in Section 2.3.2(a) hereof.

                  (c) If the Final Working Capital is less than the Estimated
Closing Date Working Capital, then the Securityholders' Representative and
Acquiror shall instruct the Escrow Agent to pay to Acquiror an amount equal to
the lesser of (i) the Underpayment Amount and (ii) the Working Capital Escrow
Amount remaining after the payment (if any) set forth in Section 2.3.2(a)
hereof. If the Underpayment Amount is less than the Working Capital Escrow
Amount remaining after the payment (if any) set forth in Section 2.3.2(a) is
made, then the Securityholders' Representative and Acquiror shall also give
instructions to the Escrow Agent to disburse to each Securityholder an amount
equal to the product of (i) such Securityholder's Percentage Share and (ii) the
Working Capital Escrow Amount remaining after the payment (if any) set forth in
the preceding sentence has been made.

            2.3.3 The Securityholders' Representative shall give instructions to
the Escrow Agent to disburse to each Securityholder an amount equal to the
product of (i) such Securityholder's Percentage Share and (ii) the remaining
Expense Escrow Amount (if any) within five (5) days after: (a) all third party
fees and expenses incurred by or on behalf of the Securityholders'
Representative (in its capacity as such) in connection with its activities
pursuant to Articles I and II hereof have been fully and finally satisfied, and
the Securityholders' Representative has been fully reimbursed from the Expense
Escrow Amount for any such fees and expenses previously paid or disbursed by it
and (b) all taxes owed by the Securityholders' Representative with respect to
income allocated to the Securityholders' Representative pursuant to the Escrow
Agreement have been fully satisfied out of the Expense Escrow Amount, pursuant
to and as more fully set forth in the Escrow Agreement, but in no event later
than sixty (60) days after the final determination of Final Working Capital has
been made.

            2.3.4 Any required adjustment to the Merger Consideration pursuant
to Section 2.3.1 shall be referred to as the "MERGER CONSIDERATION ADJUSTMENT."

            2.3.5 Interest shall accrue on the Merger Consideration Adjustment,
if any, at the per annum rate equal to the prime rate set forth in The Wall
Street Journal published on the Closing Date, from the Closing Date until the
date on which such amount is paid.

            2.3.6 The parties hereto agree to treat any adjustment made pursuant
to Section 2.3.1 as an adjustment to the Merger Consideration for all Tax
purposes.

with, and has not violated in any material respect, any Laws or Orders relating
to Hazardous Substances or protection of the environment ("ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS");

                  (b) there has been no release, generation, treatment, storage,
disposal or transportation of Hazardous Substances (it being understood that,
for purposes of this Section 3.9.1(b), migration of Hazardous Substances present
in soil or groundwater on August 11, 1995 does not constitute any release,
generation, treatment, storage, disposal or transportation of Hazardous
Substances) by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or at any of the Company
Owned Real Estate or at the Company's Palo Alto, California site, Beverly,
Massachusetts site, San Carlos, California site or Georgetown, Ontario site, or,
to the knowledge of the Company, at any other Company Leased Real Estate,
except, in any case, for any release, generation, treatment, storage, disposal

<PAGE>
                  (c) excepting claims based on events occurring or conditions
existing on or before August 11, 1995 that were made by third parties or
governmental agencies to Varian and to which Varian has responded without
asserting that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is responsible in whole or
in part, none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has received any written
claim asserted under any Environmental Law or with respect to any Hazardous
Substances, except for claims that could not reasonably be expected to
materially and adversely affect the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; and

                  (d) none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has entered
into any consent decree or material settlement agreement with any Governmental
Entity, and none of the Company or its Subsidiaries has been subject to any
judgment or decree or material order, in either case under any Environmental

agreements, judgments or orders, if any, as to which Varian has assumed full
responsibility under the Varian Environmental Indemnity and the terms of which
do not materially affect the Company.

            3.9.2 The Company has provided or made available to Acquiror true
copies of all of the reports set forth on Schedule 3.9.2 without omitting any
portion thereof in the possession of the Company. There are no other reports in
the Company's possession that identify any material conditions (including, for
the avoidance of doubt, any conditions existing on or before August 11, 1995)
that could reasonably be expected to result in a material liability to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries under any Environmental Laws, which
conditions are not described in the reports set forth on Schedule 3.9.2. To the
knowledge of the Company, there are no material conditions (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, any conditions existing on or before August 11, 1995) that
could reasonably be expected to result in a material liability to the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries under any Environmental Laws, that are not described in
the reports set forth on Schedule 3.9.2.

            3.9.3 The provisions in Article X of the Stock Sale Agreement, dated
as of June 6, 1995 (the "STOCK SALE AGREEMENT"), by and between Varian and the
Company (as amended), relating to indemnification by Varian respecting certain
environmental matters (the "VARIAN ENVIRONMENTAL INDEMNITY") are applicable to,
and the Company is indemnified as to, any Hazardous Substances in soil and
ground water at certain of the Company Owned Real Estate and the Company's Palo
Alto, California site, Beverly, Massachusetts site, San Carlos, California site
and Georgetown, Ontario site, as described in the reports listed on Schedule
3.9.2, to the extent set forth in such Article X. The Company has not received
any written notice by or on behalf of Varian asserting any material objection to
or denial of indemnification under the Varian Environmental Indemnity, it being
understood that Varian (i) from time to time over the last approximately twelve
(12) months from the date hereof raised objections to the Company's requests for
indemnification in connection with the redevelopment of the Company's San
Carlos, California site, and (ii) during or before 1996 objected to
indemnification of certain claims asserted under proviso 10.2(a)(2) of the
Varian Indemnity Agreement, which claims have been resolved in a manner
satisfactory to the Company.

            3.10 PERMITS. Except as set forth in Schedule 3.10 and other than in
connection with matters described in Section 3.18, the Company and each of its

lease and operation of its properties and to conduct the Business, in each case
in all material respects in the manner as it is currently being conducted,
except where a failure to obtain or to be in compliance with such Permit or
Approval would not reasonably be expected to be material to the Business. All
such Permits and Approvals are in full force and effect, except where failure to
be in full force or effect would not reasonably be expected to be material to
the Business, and none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has received
any written notice of any proceeding threatening the non-renewal, suspension,
revocation or adverse modification of any Permit or Approval, except with
respect to any non-renewal, suspension, revocation or adverse modification the
effect of which would not reasonably be expected to be material to the Business.

which any of them is bound or to which any of their assets is subject: (a) as of

      3.12 REAL PROPERTY AND LEASEHOLDS.

            3.12.1 Schedule 3.12.1 identifies all parcels of real property owned
in fee by the Company or its Subsidiaries as of the date hereof (collectively,
the "COMPANY OWNED REAL ESTATE"). The Company or the applicable Subsidiary owns
each of the real properties constituting Company Owned Real Estate with good,
marketable and insurable fee title, free and clear of all Encumbrances, except
for (i) Encumbrances disclosed in the Company Schedules, (ii) liens for taxes,
assessments or governmental charges or levies that are not material in amount
relative to the property affected, or that are not yet delinquent or are being
contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings, during which collection or
enforcement is stayed, so long as adequate security has been posted for the
payment of such amounts, (iii) any Encumbrance or imperfection of title that
does not materially impair the ownership, occupancy or use of the Company Owned
Real Estate or Company Leased Real Estate for the purposes for which it is
currently owned, occupied or used in connection with the Business, and, (iv)
with respect to the Company Leased Real Estate, any Encumbrances placed upon
such property by the owner thereof and the provisions of the leases thereof (the
items in clauses (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) above being referred to herein
collectively as "REAL PROPERTY PERMITTED ENCUMBRANCES"); provided, however, that
no Real Property Permitted Encumbrances may materially interfere with access to
or use of such Company Owned Real Estate as the same is presently being used or
occupied. Except for the Real Property Permitted Encumbrances and as otherwise
set forth in Schedule 3.12.1, none of the Company Owned Real Estate is subject
to any right or option of any other Person to purchase or lease or otherwise
obtain title to, or an interest in, such Company Owned Real Estate, and no
Person other than the Company or its Subsidiaries has any right to occupy or
lease any of the Company Owned Real Estate.

            3.12.2 Schedule 3.12.2 identifies all parcels of real property
leased or subleased to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as of the date
hereof (collectively, the "COMPANY LEASED REAL ESTATE"), as well as each Lease
as to which the annual rent exceeds $50,000. A true and complete copy of each
Lease as to which the annual rent exceeds $50,000 per year has been provided or
made available by the Company to Acquiror. Except as set forth in Schedule
3.12.2, the Company or the applicable Subsidiary owns each of the leaseholds
constituting Company Leased Real Estate, free and clear of all Encumbrances
other than Real Property Permitted Encumbrances. Each Lease is in full force and
effect, and constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the Company or the
applicable Subsidiary and, to the knowledge of the Company, the respective
parties thereto (other than the Company or any of its Subsidiaries), and is
legally enforceable against the Company or the


                                     - 20 -
<PAGE>
applicable Subsidiary and, to the knowledge of the Company, the respective
parties thereto (other than the Company or any of its Subsidiaries). For
purposes hereof, "LEASE" means any lease or sublease for Company Leased Real
Estate, together with any amendments, modifications and supplements thereto.

            3.12.3 With respect to each Lease described in Schedule 3.12.2,
except as set forth in Schedule 3.12.3, to the knowledge of the Company, neither
the Company, nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor any other party thereto is in
default with respect to any material term or condition thereof, no rent or other
material sums and charges payable thereunder are delinquent, and no event has
occurred that through the passage of time or the giving of notice, or both,
would constitute a material default thereunder. The Company and its Subsidiaries
have not received any notice from the other party to any Lease of the
termination thereof.

            3.12.4 There is no pending or, to the knowledge of the Company or
any Subsidiary, threatened condemnation or eminent domain or similar proceeding
affecting all or any part of the Company Owned Real Estate or, to the knowledge
of the Company, the Company Leased Real Estate (the Company Owned Real Estate
and the Company Leased Real Estate being referred to herein collectively as the
"PROPERTIES"), and neither the Company, nor any Subsidiary has received any
written notice of any of the same.

            3.12.5 Subject to the need to perform customary periodic repairs
that do not materially interfere with the Business, the buildings and other
structures on the Properties are fit for the purposes for which they are
presently used.

            3.12.6 There is no known violation of a condition or agreement
contained in any easement, restrictive covenant or any similar instrument or
agreement affecting any of the Company Owned Real Estate. No Company Owned Real
Estate is taxed as part of any real property that does not constitute Company
Owned Real Estate.

            3.12.7 Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received
any written notice from the utility company or municipality of any proposed
discontinuation of presently provided sewer, water, electric, gas, telephone or
other utilities or services for any of the Properties.

            3.12.8 To the knowledge of the Company, there are no proposed
reassessments of any Properties by any taxing authority that could give rise to
a material increase in real property Taxes or assessments against any of the
Properties, and there are no threatened or pending special assessments or other
actions or proceedings that could give rise to a material increase in real
property Taxes or assessments against any of the Properties; provided, that the
foregoing shall not apply to any reassessments arising out of or resulting from
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

            3.12.9 To the extent that the operation of the Business as presently
conducted on any of the Properties requires the use (other than for utility
service) of a property that is not Company Owned Real Estate or Company Leased
Real Estate, the Company or one of its Subsidiaries has the right to use such
other property.

the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties, at
law, in equity or in any arbitral proceeding, and there is no investigation or

be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
Effect.

      3.15 EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS. For purposes of this Agreement, the term
"PLANS" shall mean all "Employee Benefit Plans" (as such term is defined in
Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended
("ERISA"), and all stock purchase, stock option, severance, employment,
change-in-control, fringe benefit, collective bargaining, bonus, incentive,
deferred compensation, employee loan and all other employee benefit plans,
agreements, programs, policies or other arrangements, whether or not subject to
ERISA, including, without limitation, multiemployer plans within the meaning of
Section 3(37) of ERISA) (including any funding mechanism therefor now in effect
or required in the future as a result of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or otherwise), whether formal or informal, oral or written, legally
binding or not, under which the Company, its Subsidiaries, or any member of the
same controlled group of businesses as the Company within the meaning of Section
4001(a)(14) of ERISA (an "ERISA AFFILIATE") is a sponsor or participating
employer or as to which the Company, its Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate
makes contributions or is required to make contributions or to which the
Company, its Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate has any liability, other than a
"Foreign Plan" as defined below. Schedule 3.15(a) lists all Plans and


                                     - 23 -
<PAGE>
Foreign Plans; provided, however, that such Schedule 3.15(a) lists only the
standard forms of employment offer letters for non-executive employees used by
the Company and its Subsidiaries, rather than individual executed employment
offer letters with such non-executive employees. No Plan is or ever was a "multi
employer plan," as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA, a plan subject to Title IV
of ERISA, or a plan subject to Section 412 of the Code and none of the Company,
its Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate has any liabilities under Title IV of
ERISA that remains unsatisfied. Each Plan that is required to comply with the
provisions of Sections 4980B and 4980C of the Code, or with the requirements
referred to in Section 4980D(a) of the Code, has complied in all material
respects, and, except as required by such sections of the Code or other than any
such Plan in which the employee is required to pay the full cost of such
benefits, no Plan that is a "welfare benefit plan," as defined in Section 3(1)
of ERISA, provides for post-employment benefits. Each of the Plans that is
intended to be a qualified plan under Section 401(a) of the Code has received a
favorable determination letter from the Service, has been operated substantially
in accordance with its terms and with the provisions of the Code and, to the
Company's knowledge, nothing has occurred that could reasonably be expected to
cause the loss of the qualified status of any such Plan. All of the Plans have
been administered and maintained in substantial compliance with their terms,
ERISA, the Code and all other applicable Laws. None of the Company, its
Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate has any knowledge of any circumstances that
reasonably might result in any material, liability, tax or penalty, including,
but not limited to, a penalty under Section 502 of ERISA, as a result of a
breach of any duty under ERISA or under any other Laws. All contributions
required to be made to each of the Plans and the Foreign Plans under the terms
of such Plan or Foreign Plan, as the case may be, ERISA, the Code or any other
applicable Laws have been timely made. Other than routine claims for benefits
under the Plans and the Foreign Plans, there are no pending, or, to the
knowledge of the Company, threatened, investigations, proceedings, claims,
lawsuits, disputes, actions, audits or controversies involving the Plans or the
Foreign Plans, as the case may be, or the fiduciaries, administrators, or
trustees of any of the Plans or the Foreign Plans or the Company, its
Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate of either as the employer or sponsor under
any Plan or Foreign Plan, with any of the Service, the Department of Labor, the
Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation or any other Governmental Entity, any
participant in or beneficiary of any Plan or Foreign Plan or any other Person
whomsoever, except for any such investigations, proceedings, claims, lawsuits,
disputes, actions, audits or controversies that would not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to be material to the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries. Except as disclosed on Schedule 3.15(b), the execution and
performance of this Agreement will not (i) result in any obligation or liability
(with respect to accrued benefits or otherwise) of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to any Plan, or any present or former employee of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) be a trigger event under any Plan that will result
in any payment (whether of severance pay or otherwise) becoming due to any
present or former employee, officer, director, stockholder, contractor, or
consultant, or any of their dependents, or (iii) except as otherwise expressly
contemplated by this Agreement, accelerate the time of payment or vesting, or
increase the amount, of compensation due to any present or former employee,
officer, director, stockholder, contractor, or consultant of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries. Except as set forth in Schedule 3.15(c), there is no
contract, plan or arrangement (written or otherwise) covering any employee or
former employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that, individually or
collectively, could give rise to the payment of any amount that would not be
deductible pursuant to the terms of Section 280G


                                     - 24 -
<PAGE>
of the Code. With respect to each Plan (including any standard forms of
employment offer letters for non-executive employees used by the Company and its
Subsidiaries) and Foreign Plan, other than individual executed employment offer
letters with non-executive employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries and
each Foreign Plan that covers ten (10) or fewer participants, the Company has
provided or made available to Acquiror a current, accurate and complete copy
(or, to the extent no such copy exists, an accurate description) thereof and, to
the extent applicable: (i) any related trust agreement or other funding
instrument, (ii) the most recent determination letter, if applicable, (iii) any
summary plan description, summary of material modification, or written
communication by the Company or its Subsidiaries to all participants in such
Plan or Foreign Plan; (iv) a summary of any proposed amendments or changes
anticipated to be made to the Plans at any time within the twelve months
immediately following the date hereof, and (v) for the most recent year for
which they are available (A) the Form 5500 and attached schedules, (B) audited
financial statements and (C) actuarial valuation reports. Except for employment
agreements, individual executed employment offer letters and Plans and Foreign
Plans previously delivered or made available to Acquiror, the Plans and Foreign
Plans that each cover ten (10) or fewer participants do not, in the aggregate,
provide benefits that could reasonably result in a material liability to the
Company and its Subsidiaries. With respect to each employee benefit, fringe
benefit, supplemental unemployment benefit, bonus, incentive, profit sharing,
termination, change in control, pension, retirement, stock option, stock
purchase, stock appreciation, health, welfare, medical, dental, disability, life
insurance and similar plan, program, arrangement or practice relating to current
or former employees, officers or directors of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries maintained, sponsored or funded by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries that is maintained outside of the United States primarily for the
benefit of persons substantially all of whom are nonresident aliens (a "FOREIGN
PLAN"): (A) the Foreign Plan has been maintained in all material respects in
accordance with its terms and applicable Law, (B) if intended to qualify for
special tax treatment, the Foreign Plan substantially satisfies the requirements
for such treatment, (C) the Foreign Plan is substantially funded and/or book
reserved to the extent required by applicable Law, (D) no insurance policy or
any other agreement affecting the Foreign Plan requires or permits a retroactive
increase in contributions, premiums or payments due thereunder and (E) no
commitments to improve or otherwise amend the Foreign Plan have been made,
except as required by applicable Law. No Foreign Plan that would be a "welfare
benefit plan" within the meaning of Section 3(1) of ERISA if it were a Plan
subject to ERISA provides benefits to retired employees or to the beneficiaries
or dependents of retired employees, except as required by applicable Law or
other than any such Foreign Plan in which the retired employees, beneficiaries
or dependents are required to pay the full cost of such benefits.

            5.5.2 Cooperation. The Company and Acquiror (and the appropriate
respective Persons) shall promptly file any additional information requested as
soon as practicable after receipt of a request for additional information. The
Company and Acquiror shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
early termination of the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act. The
parties hereto will coordinate and cooperate with one another in exchanging such
information and providing such reasonable assistance as may be requested in
connection with such filings. The Company and Acquiror shall keep each other
apprised of the status of any material communications with, and any inquiries or
requests for additional information from, the FTC, the DOJ or any other
Governmental Entity and shall comply promptly with any such inquiry or request.
The Company and Acquiror shall each bear its own costs and expenses incurred in

indebtedness for which the Company or its Subsidiaries is a guarantor, or to or

cooperate, and shall request the Company's auditors to reasonably cooperate, on

<PAGE>
            5.7.2 Without limitation of the foregoing Section 5.7.1, each of the
Company and its Subsidiaries agree to provide, and will request their respective
Representatives to provide, reasonable cooperation in connection with the

Closing in respect of transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Such
cooperation shall include, to the extent reasonable and customary, arranging for
senior officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries to meet with prospective

Acquiror shall use its commercially reasonable best efforts to negotiate and
finalize definitive loan documentation for the Debt Financing. Acquiror shall
keep the Company reasonably informed as to the status of the Debt Financing. If
at any time any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on terms that
are not materially less favorable to Acquiror than those in the Commitment
Letter, Acquiror shall inform the Company and shall use its commercially
reasonable best efforts to obtain replacement Debt Financing on terms
substantially comparable to those terms set forth in the Commitment Letter. For
the avoidance of doubt, nothing herein shall limit the ability of Acquiror to
pursue alternative financing prior to the time set forth in the preceding
sentence so long as Acquiror either (i) continues to use its commercially
reasonable best efforts to pursue the Debt Financing or (ii) obtains commitment
letters with respect to such alternative financing that are acceptable to the
Securityholders' Representative in its sole discretion.

         5.8 COVENANT TO SATISFY CONDITIONS. The Company will use all
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the conditions set forth in Section
6.3.1(a) hereof to be satisfied, insofar as such matters are within the control
of the Company, and Acquiror will use all commercially reasonable efforts to
cause the conditions set forth in Section 6.2.1(a) hereof to be satisfied,
insofar as such matters are within the control of Acquiror. Each party hereto

the other parties any legally permitted information and copies of and assistance
with all filings made by such party with any Governmental Entity or any other
information supplied by such party to a Governmental Entity (other than
confidential personnel information) in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby. The Company and Acquiror further covenant and
agree, with respect to a pending or threatened preliminary or permanent
injunction or other Order or Law that would adversely affect the ability of the
parties hereto to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, to use
commercially reasonable efforts to prevent or lift the entry, enactment or
promulgation thereof, as the case may be.

         5.9 FURTHER ASSURANCES. Subject to the terms and conditions herein
provided, each of the parties hereto agrees to use all commercially reasonable
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law to
consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,

transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Acquiror and the Company will
consult with each other (including, without limitation, with respect to (i) the
determination of which employees require the requisite approval of stockholders
referred to Section 1.2.1 or (ii) any other stockholder approval designed to
satisfy Section 280G(b)(5)(ii) has been obtained) prior to the Closing
concerning whether any such acceleration of Stock Options or payment of such
Specified Bonuses, alone or in conjunction with other benefits or payments to be
provided to any employee of the Company would result in such employee being
deemed to have received an "excess parachute payment" within the meaning of
Section 280G of the Code; and, if Acquiror reasonably concludes that any such
benefit or payment would so result in an "excess parachute payment," then the
Company shall cause the acceleration of Stock Options and the payment of such
Specified Bonuses, and/or the payment of other benefits or payments to be
provided to such employee to be reduced to the minimum amount necessary to avoid
an "excess parachute payment."

         7.1 INDEMNIFICATION FOR THE BENEFIT OF ACQUIROR INDEMNIFIED PARTIES.
From and after the Closing, but subject to the conditions and limitations set
forth in this Agreement, the Acquiror Indemnified Parties shall be indemnified
and held harmless from and against Losses resulting from or arising out of any

                                     - 44 -
<PAGE>
(i) breach of any representation or warranty of the Company contained herein or
(ii) non-fulfillment or breach of any pre-Closing covenant of the Company
contained herein, as set forth in, and pursuant to the terms and subject to the
conditions and limitations of, the Voting and Indemnification Agreement. It is
understood that from and after the Closing, the sole and exclusive remedy of the
Acquiror Indemnified Parties with respect to any and all claims arising out of
or relating to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (other
than for fraud or for breaches that constitute bad faith) shall be pursuant to
the indemnification provisions of the Voting and Indemnification Agreement.

         7.2 INDEMNIFICATION FOR THE BENEFIT OF COMPANY INDEMNIFIED PARTIES.
From and after the Closing, but subject to the conditions and limitations set
forth in this Agreement, Acquiror shall defend, indemnify and save the Company
Indemnified Parties harmless from and against any and all Losses whatsoever
resulting from or arising out of any (i) breach of any surviving representation
or warranty of Acquiror contained herein, which breach shall be determined
without regard to materiality qualifiers (including Material Adverse Effect) and
(ii) non-fulfillment or breach of any covenant of Acquiror contained herein.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, after the
Closing (i) Acquiror shall not be obligated to indemnify or hold harmless the
Company Indemnified Parties with respect to any Losses resulting from breaches
of Acquiror's or Merger Sub's representations and warranties contained herein
until the aggregate amount of such Losses exceeds $1,000,000, and then Acquiror
shall only be liable to pay such Losses hereunder in excess of $1,000,000, and
(ii) the total maximum aggregate indemnification payments by Acquiror pursuant
to this Section 7.2 shall not exceed $20,000,000 in the aggregate. The foregoing
limitations shall not apply to any non-fulfillment or breach of any covenants to
be performed at or after the Closing. For purposes of indemnification provided
in this Article VII, the representations and warranties contained herein shall
be deemed to be made as of the date hereof and as of the Closing Date; provided,
however, that any representations and warranties that address matters as of a
particular date shall be deemed to have been made as of such date.

         7.3 CLAIMS.

            7.3.1 If a Company Indemnified Party (the "CLAIMANT") desires to
make a claim pursuant to this Article VII, the Claimant shall give prompt
written notice to Acquiror (in such capacity, the "INDEMNITY REPRESENTATIVE") of
the amount and circumstances surrounding the same and the amount (estimated, if
necessary) of the Loss incurred or reasonably expected to be incurred in respect
of any such claim; provided that the failure to so notify an Indemnity
Representative shall not relieve the Indemnity Representative of its obligations
hereunder except to the extent prejudiced thereby. If the Indemnity
Representative notifies the Claimant that it disputes the Claimant's right of
indemnification with respect to any such claim for indemnification, then the
Claimant and the Indemnity Representative shall use reasonable efforts to
resolve such dispute. If the Claimant and the Indemnity Representative reach a
written agreement as to the amount of Losses payable to the Claimant in respect
of such claim, the Indemnity Representative shall be required to pay to the
Claimant the amount of such Losses within fifteen (15) days after the date of
such written agreement.

                                     - 45 -
<PAGE>
            7.3.2 With respect to indemnification claimed by a Claimant with
respect to a third party claim or Action ("CLAIM"), the Claimant (a) shall give
prompt written notice to the Indemnity Representative of (i) the institution of
such Claim at any time instituted against or made upon Claimant in connection
with which the Claimant could claim indemnification; provided, that the failure
to so notify the Indemnity Representative shall not relieve the Indemnity
Representative of its obligations hereunder except to the extent prejudiced
thereby and (ii) to the extent known, of the amount and circumstances
surrounding the same, and (b) shall permit the Indemnity Representative, at its
option, to assume and control the defense against such Claim through counsel of
its choice (which counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Claimant) if
the Indemnity Representative gives written notice of its intention to do so to
the Claimant within thirty (30) calendar days after the receipt of notice of
such Claim from Claimant. If the Indemnity Representative does not notify the
Claimant within thirty (30) calendar days after the receipt of the Claimant's
notice of a claim of indemnity hereunder that it elects to undertake the defense
of such Claim, the Claimant shall have the right to contest the Claim but shall
not thereby waive any right to indemnity therefor pursuant to this Agreement. In
the event that the Indemnity Representative undertakes the defense against any
such Claim as provided above, the Claimant shall cooperate with the Indemnity
Representative in such defense and make available to the Indemnity
Representative, all witnesses, pertinent records, materials and information in
its possession or under its control reasonably relating thereto as is reasonably
required by the Indemnity Representative. Any Claimant shall be entitled to
participate in the defense of such Claim and to employ counsel of its choice for
such purpose; provided, that the fees and expenses of such separate counsel
shall be borne by the Claimant. No such Claim may be settled by the Indemnity
Representative without the written consent of the Claimant, provided that such
consent shall not be withheld or delayed unless, as a result of such settlement,
injunctive or other equitable relief will be imposed against the Claimant or
such settlement does not expressly and unconditionally release the Claimant from
all liabilities and obligations with respect to such Claim. If the Indemnity
Representative has assumed the defense of a Claim, no such Claim may be settled
by the Claimant without the prior written consent of the Indemnity
Representative, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. In
the event that the Indemnity Representative elects to assume and control the
defense of such Claim as provided in this Section 7.3, the Indemnity
Representative shall bear the costs of such defense.

         7.4 TIME LIMITATION ON CLAIMS FOR INDEMNIFICATION.

            7.4.1 Any claim for indemnification under Section 7.2 must be
asserted in writing in accordance with the provisions of Section 7.3 and must be
asserted within the time period for survival of the provision of this Agreement
upon which such claim is based, as set forth in Section 9.1.

            7.4.2 So long as any claim is asserted in writing in accordance with
the provisions of this Agreement on or prior to the time limitations set forth
in this Section 7.4, any right to indemnification under this Agreement shall
survive such time period through and until the validity of such claim is finally
determined. None of Acquiror, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation shall have
any liability hereunder with respect to any claim that is not brought within the
time limits set forth in this Section 7.4.

                                     - 46 -
<PAGE>
         7.5 ADDITIONAL LIMITATIONS ON INDEMNIFICATION. Each Claimant shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to pursue available third party insurance,
indemnification, contribution or similar claims in respect of which a notice of
claim is submitted to the Indemnity Representative to the same extent as it
would if any Losses were not subject to indemnification hereunder; provided that
failure to take any such actions shall not relieve Acquiror of its obligations
hereunder. The amount of Acquiror's liability under this Agreement shall be
determined net of any applicable insurance proceeds actually received by the
respective Claimant and any indemnity, contribution or other similar payment
actually received by such Claimant from any third party with respect thereto (in
each case, net of any expenses incurred by the Claimant in collecting such
amount, including the cost of maintaining any such insurance policy), in each
case to the extent actually received prior to the time such Claimant receives a
payment (an "INDEMNITY PAYMENT") required by this Agreement in respect of any
claim hereunder. In addition, if a Claimant receives an Indemnity Payment and
subsequently actually receives any proceeds from any third party
indemnification, contribution, insurance or similar claim with respect to such
claim (the "RECOVERED PROCEEDS"), then such Claimant will pay to Acquiror an
amount equal to the excess of the Indemnity Payment received over the amount of
the Indemnity Payment that would have been due from Acquiror to such Claimant if
the Recovered Proceeds (in each case, net of any expenses incurred by such
Claimant in collecting such amount, including the cost of maintaining any such
insurance policy) had been received, realized or recovered before the Indemnity
Payment was made.

         7.6 THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARIES. The provisions of this Article VII are
intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by the Company
Indemnified Parties.

         7.7 SOLE REMEDY. From and after the Closing, the sole and exclusive
remedy of the Company Indemnified Parties with respect to any and all claims
arising out of or relating to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby (other than for fraud or for breaches that constitute bad faith) shall be
pursuant to the indemnification provisions of this Agreement.

         7.7 EFFECT OF INDEMNIFICATION PAYMENTS. The parties hereto agree that
any payments in respect of Acquiror's indemnification obligations pursuant to
this Agreement shall be treated as an adjustment to the Merger Consideration.

                                  ARTICLE VIII
                                  TERMINATION

warranties hereunder) by notice to the

Merger Sub is in material breach of its covenants, representations or warranties
hereunder and such breach either is incapable of cure or is not cured within
fifteen (15) days after receipt of notice from the Company; and

            8.1.4 by Acquiror by notice to the Company if the Company is in
material breach of its covenants, representations or warranties hereunder and
such breach either is incapable of cure or is not cured within fifteen (15) days
after receipt of notice from Acquiror.

         8.2 RIGHTS AFTER TERMINATION. Upon termination of this Agreement as
provided in Section 8.1 above, the parties shall be released from all
obligations arising hereunder and this Agreement shall become void and of no
further force and effect; provided, however, that termination shall not affect
(i) the rights and remedies available to the Company as a result of any breach
of this Agreement by Acquiror or Merger Sub, (ii) the rights and remedies
available to Acquiror or Merger Sub as a result of any breach of this Agreement
by the Company, and (iii) the provisions of Sections 3.17 and 4.4, and Article

and investment bankers' fees) incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby and (b) the Company shall pay all of its costs
and expenses (including, without limitation, attorneys', accountants' and
investment bankers' fees) incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, provided that, in the event that the Closing
occurs, the Transaction Expenses shall either be paid by the Company prior to
the Closing or, if unpaid prior to the Closing, shall be borne by the
Securityholders as provided in the definition of "Merger Consideration" and
subject to the Voting and Indemnification Agreement.

         9.3 NOTICES. All notices and other communications hereunder shall be in
