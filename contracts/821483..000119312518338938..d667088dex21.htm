Notwithstanding the above, Buyer may elect, by delivery of written notice to

6.9 _Transfer Taxes_. Notwithstanding any requirement at Law or anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, Buyer and Seller shall each bear fifty
percent (50%) of any Transfer Taxes which arise by reason of the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Parties shall
cooperate in good faith to minimize, to the extent permissible under
applicable Law, the amount of any such Transfer Taxes, to file any Tax Returns
with respect to any such Transfer Taxes and in remitting such Transfer Taxes
to the appropriate Governmental Authority.

 

6.10 _[Reserved.]_

 

6.11 _Tax Matters_.

 

(a) Buyer shall prepare any and all Tax Returns required to be filed by the
Acquired Companies after the Closing Date, which Tax Returns shall be
prepared in a manner consistent with past practice except to the extent
required by applicable Law. Not later than thirty (30) days prior to the due
date (including extensions) for filing each such Tax Return (other than Tax
Returns relating to sales, use, payroll, or other Taxes that are required to
be filed contemporaneously with, or promptly after, the close of a Tax period,
which shall be provided as promptly as practicable), Buyer shall deliver a
draft of such Tax Return, together with all supporting documentation and
workpapers, to Seller for its review and comment. Buyer shall revise such Tax
Return to take into account any reasonable comments received from Seller not
less than ten (10) days prior to the due date (including available
extensions) for filing such Tax Return and shall deliver a final copy of such
Tax Return to Seller not less than five (5) days prior to such due date. Buyer
shall cause each such Tax Return (as revised to incorporate Sellers timely
comments) to be timely executed and filed and shall cause all Taxes shown as
due thereon to be timely paid.

(b) For purposes of determining Company Taxes and Buyer Taxes, in the case of
Taxes that are payable with respect to any Straddle Period, the portion of any
such Taxes that are attributable to the portion of such Straddle Period ending
on and including the Closing Date and the portion of such Straddle Period
beginning immediately after the Closing Date shall be determined as follows:

(i) in the case of Taxes that are either (A) based upon or related to income
or receipts, or (B) imposed in connection with any sale or other transfer or
assignment of property (real or personal, tangible or intangible), deemed
equal to the amount that would be payable if the Tax period of the Acquired
Companies ended on the Closing Date; _provided_ that exemptions, allowances
or deductions that are calculated on an annual basis (including depreciation
and amortization deductions) shall be allocated between the portion of the
Straddle Period ending on and including the Closing Date and the portion of
the Straddle Period beginning immediately after the Closing Date in proportion
to the number of days in each such portion of such Straddle Period; and

 

(ii) in the case of Taxes that are imposed on a periodic basis with respect to
the assets or capital of the Acquired Companies, deemed to be the amount of
such Taxes for the entire Straddle Period (or, in the case of such Taxes
determined on an arrears basis, the amount of such Taxes for the immediately
preceding period), multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the
number of calendar days in the relevant portion of the Straddle Period and the
denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the entire Straddle
Period.

 

(c) The Parties shall cooperate as and to the extent reasonably requested by
the other Party, in connection with the filing of Tax Returns and any audit
or other Proceeding with respect to Taxes imposed on or with respect to the
Assets, operations or activities of the Acquired Companies (each a " _Tax
Proceeding_ "). Such cooperation shall include the retention for a period
lasting until sixty (60) days after the expiration of the applicable statute
of limitations, and (upon the other Partys request) the provision of records
and information which are reasonably relevant to any such Tax Return or
Tax Proceeding and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis
to provide additional information and explanation of any materials provided
hereunder.

 

(d) Buyer shall promptly notify Seller regarding, and in no event after ten
(10) days of, the receipt by Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including the
Acquired Companies) of notice of any Tax Proceeding with respect to any Taxes
for which it may be responsible pursuant to the Agreement or otherwise. Seller
shall be entitled to exclusively control the resolution of any Tax
Proceeding relating to any Taxes for which it may be responsible pursuant to
the Agreement or otherwise and at Sellers sole cost and expense; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if Seller elects not to control such Tax Proceeding or the
resolution of such Tax Proceeding reasonably could be expected to have a
material adverse effect on Buyer or the Acquired Companies in any period
beginning or ending after the Closing Date for which Seller is not
responsible, then with respect to each such Tax Proceeding described in this
_Section_ __ _ 6.11(d)_, (i) the non-controlling Party may fully participate
in the dispute of such Tax Proceeding at such Partys sole cost and
expense, including having the right to employ separate counsel (who may be
selected by the non-controlling

 Party in its sole discretion), (ii) the controlling Party shall keep the
non-controlling Party timely informed with respect to the commencement, status
and nature of any such Tax Proceeding and (iii) the controlling Party shall
not settle, compromise or dispose of any such Tax Proceeding without the
consent of the non-controlling Party (which is not to be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned).

(e) Any refund, rebate, abatement, reduction or other recovery (whether direct
or indirect through a right of setoff or credit) of Taxes (" _Tax Refunds_ ")
of any Acquired Company for or with respect to any Tax period (or portion
thereof) ending on or before the Closing Date (including as a result of
carryback of any losses, credits or similar items to such a period) shall be
for the account of Seller. Any Tax Refunds of any Acquired Company for or with
respect to any Tax period (or portion thereof) beginning after the Closing
Date shall be for the account of Buyer. Any Tax Refunds of any Acquired
Company for any Straddle Period shall be equitably apportioned between Seller
and Buyer in a reasonable manner consistent with the principles set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 6.11(b)_. Each Party shall forward, and shall cause its
Affiliates to forward, to the Party entitled to receive a Tax Refund pursuant
to this _Section_ __ _ 6.11(e)_ the amount of such Tax Refund within ten (10)
days after such refund is received, net of any reasonable costs or expenses
incurred by such Party or its Affiliates in procuring such Tax Refund. For the
avoidance of doubt, the determination of a Tax Benefit, of Net Working Capital
or of amounts due to Seller pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 6.11(e)_ shall
be made without duplication of amounts previously taken into account in
another such determination.

 

(f) If Buyer elects to increase the Equity Purchase Price pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 2.2(a)_ and Seller determines in good faith that, if Buyer
complies with this _Section_ __ _ 6.11(f)_, the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement could be validly treated as a "reorganization" within the
meaning of Section 368(a)(1)(A) of the Code, then if Seller delivers written
notice to Buyer no later than two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date,
Buyer, Seller and their Affiliates agree to take such actions as are
reasonably necessary to: (i) cause Buyer (or an entity disregarded as
separate from Buyer for U.S. federal income Tax purposes) to be the purchaser
of title and beneficial ownership of all of the Interests of the Company
pursuant to this Agreement at Closing (and for the avoidance of doubt, shall
not assign the right to acquire any such Interests pursuant to this Agreement
to any other Person), (ii) cause the Company to merge with and into Buyer (or
an entity disregarded as separate from Buyer for U.S. federal income tax
purposes) immediately following the Closing, (iii) for U.S. federal income
Tax purposes (and purposes of any similar applicable state or local Tax Law)
treat (A) the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as a valid
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a)(1)(A) of the Code,
pursuant to which no gain or income is recognized by Seller other than with
respect to any "boot" received pursuant to such reorganization and no gain or
loss is recognized by any Acquired Company, and (B) this Agreement as a "plan
of reorganization" within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Sections
1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a), and (iv) not to take any position in any Tax
Return or Tax Proceeding or any other action that is inconsistent with this
_Section_ __ _ 6.11(f)_, in each case, unless otherwise required by a final
"determination" within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code (or a
similar final determination under applicable state or local Tax Law).

(g) All obligations set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 6.11_ shall survive for
a period lasting until sixty (60) days after the expiration of the applicable
statute of limitations.

(h) Any Claims with respect to Taxes and Tax Proceedings shall be governed
primarily by this _Section_ __ _ 6.11_, and for the avoidance of doubt, to
the extent there is any conflict between the provisions of this _Section_ __ _
6.11_ and  _Article_ __ _ X_ (or any other provision of this Agreement), the
provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.11_ shall control.

 

6.12 _Public Announcements_. Except as otherwise required by applicable Law,
each of the Parties will, and will cause their Affiliates (as applicable),
to, consult with the other regarding the timing and content of any press
releases or public statements with respect to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that notwithstanding the foregoing in no event will Buyer (or Buyer Parent)
or Seller issue any press release or public statement naming or containing any
information with respect to Seller or Buyer or their respective Affiliates
without the prior written consent of the other Party.

6.13 _Further Assurances_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, at any time or from time to time after the Closing, at either
Partys request and without further consideration, the other Party shall (and
in the case of Buyer, Buyer shall and shall cause the applicable Acquired
Company or Buyer Parent to) execute and deliver to such Party such other
instruments of sale, transfer, conveyance, assignment and confirmation,
provide such materials and information and take such other actions as such
Party may reasonably request in order to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , no such instruments,
materials, information or actions shall increase either Partys liability, or
decrease its rights, under this Agreement.

 

6.14 _Employee and Benefit Matters_.

 

(a) Within twenty (20) days following the date of this Agreement, Seller
agrees to provide Buyer with an updated list of all Acquired Company
Employees as of such date, which list includes the information as set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 4.16(a)_ for each such Acquired Company Employee.

 

(b) Following the Closing Date, Buyer shall, or shall cause its post-Closing
Affiliates who are subject to Collective Bargaining Agreements to (i) honor
the terms of all Collective Bargaining Agreements applicable to those Acquired
Company Employees on the Closing Date whose employment is subject to the terms
of a Collective Bargaining Agreement or who are otherwise represented by
the Union or, if applicable, any other labor union (collectively, the "
_Union Employees_ "); (ii) otherwise acknowledge the Union that represents the
Union Employees as of the time immediately prior to the Closing as
the collective bargaining representative of such Union Employees; and (iii)
engage in all bargaining that is required under applicable Law with respect to
the terms and conditions of employment of any Union Employee. For the
avoidance of doubt, following the Closing, Buyer shall cause USOR to continue
to recognize the Union as the exclusive representative of the bargaining unit
that is subject to the

 Tacoma CBA and continue to employ Union Employees who are subject to the
Tacoma CBA pursuant to the terms of the Tacoma CBA, for as long as such
agreement is in effect. During the twelve (12)-month period following the
Closing Date, Buyer shall (or shall cause one of its Affiliates to): provide
each individual who is an Acquired Company Employee on the Closing Date but
not a Union Employee (each, a " _Continuing Employee_ ") with (A) base salary
or base wages, as applicable, that are no less than the base salary or base
wages, as applicable, that such Continuing Employee received from an Acquired
Company or any of its Affiliates immediately prior to the Closing Date, (B)
incentive compensation and bonus opportunities that are no less favorable, in
the aggregate, to those provided by Buyer or its Affiliates to their similarly
situated employees, and (C) employee benefits that are no less favorable, in
the aggregate, to those provided by Buyer or its Affiliates to their similarly
situated employees.

(c) To the extent a Continuing Employee becomes eligible to participate in a
Benefit Plan that is not an Acquired Company Benefit Plan following the
Closing Date, Buyer shall (and shall cause its Affiliates to): (i) recognize,
for all purposes, (including eligibility, vesting and benefit levels and
accruals, but other than benefit accrual under a defined benefit pension plan)
service with Seller, the Acquired Companies and their respective Affiliates
prior to the Closing Date to the extent such service was recognized under an
analogous Acquired Company Benefit Plan (except to the extent that such
recognition would result in a duplication of benefits); (ii) waive any pre-
existing condition exclusion, actively-at-work requirement or waiting period;
and (iii) provide full credit for any co-payments, deductibles or similar
payments such Continuing Employee made or incurred under an analogous
Acquired Company Benefit Plan for the plan year in which the Closing Date
occurs.

 

(d) Buyer shall, or shall cause one of its Affiliates to, credit each
Continuing Employee with the amount of accrued but unused vacation time, sick
time and other time-off benefits as such Continuing Employee had with the
Acquired Companies as of the Closing Date.

 

(e) With respect to any Continuing Employee whose employment terminates due to
an Involuntary Termination during the twelve (12)-month period following the

Employee a lump sum payment in an amount equal to the sum of (i) six (6)
months worth of such Continuing Employees base salary or base wages, as
applicable, in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date and (ii) (A) six
(6), _multiplied by_ (B) the monthly amount such Continuing Employee would be
required to pay if such Continuing Employee elected to continue
coverage under USORs group health plans for such Continuing Employee and
such Continuing Employees spouse and eligible dependents pursuant to the
Consolidated Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended, or any similar
state law;  _provided_ that, if such Continuing Employees employment is
terminated due to an Involuntary Termination prior to the date that is six (6)
months following the Closing Date, the number of months used in clause (i) and
(ii)(A) to calculate the Severance Payment for such Continuing Employee shall
be increased by a number of months equal to the positive difference, if any,
of (x) six (6) minus (y) the number of thirty (30) day periods between the
Closing Date and the date such Continuing Employees employment is terminated
due to an Involuntary Termination

 ((i) and (ii) collectively, the " _Severance Payment_ "); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (1) such Severance Payment will not be payable pursuant to
this  _Section_ __ _ 6.14(e)_ to the extent that the payment of such
Severance Payment would result in the duplication of benefits between this
_Section_ __ _ 6.14(e)_ and the applicable severance plan, policy,
or arrangement, if any, of Buyer or its Affiliates, and (2) such Severance
Payment shall be contingent upon the Continuing Employees execution, and non-
revocation of, a general release and waiver agreement in a form acceptable to
Buyer and its Affiliates.

(f) Buyer shall be responsible for performing and discharging all
requirements under the WARN Act to the extent that such requirements arise
from any action taken by Buyer or its Affiliates with respect to any
Continuing Employee, and Buyer shall take no action (or omit to take any
action) with respect to a Continuing Employee that creates any obligation or
Loss for Seller or any of its Affiliates. Seller shall not, and shall cause
the Acquired Companies not to, take any action prior to the Closing that
violates the WARN Act.

 

(g) Prior to the Closing, to the extent required by applicable Law or a
Collective Bargaining Agreement, Seller or its Affiliate shall cause the
Acquired Companies to provide sufficient advance notice of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement to any union or employee representative
organization that is a party to the Collective Bargaining Agreements, and, in
response to a request from any such union or employee representative
organization to engage in bargaining over the effect of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, Seller shall cause the Acquired Companies to
engage in good faith efforts to bargain as required by any applicable Law. In
the event that, during the Interim Period, any of Collective Bargaining
Agreements are the subject of negotiation between any of the Acquired
Companies and the applicable union or employee representative organization,
(i) Buyer will be given notice by Seller or the Acquired Companies of any
meeting scheduled between the Acquired Companies and the union or employee
representative organization to conduct such bargaining not later than
three (3) Business Days prior to such meeting; and (ii) to the extent
permitted by Law, Buyer will be provided the opportunity by Seller or its
Affiliate to have a representative present at any such meeting.

 

(h) Prior to Closing, Seller shall cause the applicable Acquired Company to
take the necessary corporate action to terminate, subject to and conditioned
upon the occurrence of the Closing and effective as of immediately prior to
the Closing, each of the Acquired Company Benefit Plans, if any, in which
Union Employees are not eligible to participate that are included on a list
provided by Buyer to Seller in writing at least fifteen (15) days prior to
the Closing; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) if any such Acquired Company
Benefit Plan is intended to satisfy the requirements of Sections 401(a) and
401(k) of the Code, such corporate action shall be effective as of the day
immediately prior to the Closing Date; and (ii) in no event shall any
corporate action be required to be taken pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
6.14(h)_ if such corporate action could violate any applicable Law or the
terms of a Collective Bargaining Agreement.

survive any such termination and, subject to the limitations in this 
_Section_ __ _ 9.2_ and _Section_ __ _ 10.6(b)_, each Party shall continue
to be liable for (x) knowing and intentional breach made in bad faith by such
Party prior to termination of this Agreement of any covenant or agreement of

(b) In the event (i) Seller validly terminates this Agreement pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 9.1(b)_ due to (x) a breach of Buyers obligation to make any

 portion of such Buyer Termination Fee without the need for any consent,
approval or other action of the part of Buyer or any other Person, and Buyer
shall pay immediately to Seller an amount in immediately available funds
equal to the Buyer Termination Fee, less the lesser of (x) the face amount of

10.7 _Procedure with Respect to Third-Party Claims_.

 

(a) Promptly after any Party (the " _Claiming Party_ ") believes that it has a
Claim for indemnification against another Party (the " _Responding Party_ ")
as a result of a pending or threatened Claim by a third party (a " _Third
Party Claim_ "), the Claiming Party shall promptly notify the Responding Party
of such Third Party Claim and specify in such notice, in reasonable detail,
each individual Loss subject to indemnification hereunder, the basis for any
alleged indemnification obligation related to each such Loss (including, the
nature of the misrepresentation, breach of warranty, breach of covenant or
indemnification Claim on which such Claim for indemnification is based) and
the computation of the amount of indemnification to which such Claiming Party
claims to be entitled hereunder. The Claiming Party shall enclose with such
notice a copy of all papers served with respect to such Third Party Claim, if
any, and any other material documents in the possession or under the control
of such Claiming Party relating to such Third Party Claim. Any failure of
a Claiming Party to so notify a Responding Party shall not relieve the
Responding Party of liability hereunder except to the extent that the defense
of such Third Party Claim is materially prejudiced by the failure to give such
notice.

 

(b) Within thirty (30) days following receipt by a Responding Party of a
notice from a Claiming Party pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 10.7(a)_, the
Responding Party shall be entitled to assume the defense or prosecution of
such Third Party Claim, if (i) the Responding Party provides notice to the
Claiming Party that the Responding Party intends to undertake such defense
and acknowledges in writing its obligation to indemnify the Claiming Party for
Losses related to such Third Party Claim or compromise, settlement or defense
thereof, (ii) the Responding Party conducts the defense of the Third Party
Claim with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Claiming Party, and (iii) if
the Responding Party is a party to the Proceeding, the Responding Party has
not determined in good faith that joint representation would be inappropriate
because of a conflict in interest. The Claiming Party shall, in its sole
discretion, have the right to employ separate counsel (who may be selected by
the Claiming Party in its sole discretion) in any such action and to
participate in the defense thereof; _provided_ that the Claiming Party may
not file any papers or consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any
settlement with respect to the Third Party Claim without the prior written
consent of the Responding Party. The fees and expenses of any counsel
retained by the Claiming Party shall be paid by such Claiming Party;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if the Responding Party determines in good faith
that there exists a conflict in interest that would make it inappropriate for
the same counsel to represent both the Claiming Party and the Responding
Party, then the Claiming Party shall be entitled to retain a single firm to
serve as its own counsel, at the expense of the Responding Party. The
Claiming Party shall, at the cost and expense of the Responding Party, fully
cooperate with the Responding Party and its counsel in the defense or
prosecution of such Third Party Claim. The Responding Party may compromise or
settle any such Third Party Claim without the Claiming Partys written
consent; _provided_ , _however_ , that the prior written consent of the
Claiming Party shall be required with respect to any such compromise or
settlement if (A) the Claiming Party or any of its Affiliates would be
required to pay any monetary damages as a result of such compromise or
settlement, (B) such compromise or settlement contains any sanction or
restriction that would adversely affect the conduct of any

 business of the Claiming Party or its Affiliates in any material respect, or
(C) such compromise or settlement does not fully and unconditionally release
the Claiming Party with respect to such Third Party Claim. The Responding
Party will not be obligated to indemnify the Claiming Party hereunder for any
settlement or compromise of any Third Party Claim entered into without the
Responding Partys prior written consent.

 

(c) If the conditions set forth in clauses (i) through (iii) of _Section_ __ _
10.7(b)_ are not satisfied, then the Claiming Party may (upon notice to the
Responding Party) undertake the defense or prosecution of such Third Party
Claim with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Responding Party; _provided_
, _however_ , that the Responding Party shall reimburse the Claiming Party
for the costs of defending against such Third Party Claim (including
reasonable attorneys fees and expenses of a single firm) and shall remain
otherwise responsible for any indemnifiable Losses with respect to amounts
arising from or related to such Third Party Claim, in both cases, to the
extent it is ultimately determined that such Responding Party is obligated to
indemnify the Claiming Party with respect to such Third Party Claim under this
Agreement. 

10.8 _Access to Information_. After the Closing, Buyer shall, upon reasonable
prior notice from Seller, grant Seller and its Representatives, and Buyer
shall cause each Acquired Company to grant to Seller and its Representatives,
access, at all reasonable times and at Sellers sole cost and expense, to all
of the Records relating to each Acquired Company in its possession or the
possession of any Acquired Company, and shall afford Seller the right to take
extracts therefrom and to make copies thereof, to the extent relating to
events that occurred prior to Closing and to the extent needed for a
legitimate business purpose (excluding any investigation, Claim or Proceeding
among the Parties and/or their Affiliates arising under this Agreement but
expressly including any investigation, Claim or Proceeding that was initiated
by Buyer or any of its Affiliates, on the one hand, against Seller or any of
its Affiliates, on the other hand). Buyer shall maintain, and shall cause each
Acquired Company to maintain, such Records in accordance with Buyers good
faith retention policies in effect from time to time, or if any of the
Records pertain to any Claim or dispute pending on the date such retention
period expires in accordance with the applicable policy of Buyer then in
effect, Buyer shall maintain any of the Records designated by Seller or its
Representatives until such Claim or dispute is finally resolved and the time
for all appeals has been exhausted. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, Seller and its Representatives shall have no right of access to,
and Buyer shall have no obligation, and shall have no obligation to cause any
of its Affiliates, including the Acquired Companies, to provide any
information the disclosure of which could reasonably be expected to (a)
jeopardize any attorney-client privilege or work product doctrine available
to Buyer or any of its Affiliates, including any Acquired Company, (b) cause
Buyer or any of its Affiliates, including any Acquired Company, to breach a
third-party Contract, if and to the extent Buyer or such Affiliate has
utilized reasonable efforts to obtain consent from the third party to grant
access to Seller, or (c) result in any violation of Law. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Buyer shall not have access to
the Excluded Records, whether prior to, at or after the Closing.

10.9 _Tax Characterization of Indemnity Payments_. Any indemnity payments
made from one Party to another under this Agreement will be treated for all
Tax purposes as an adjustment to the Purchase Price, unless otherwise required
by applicable Law.

 

10.10 _Indemnification Insurance_ _Policies_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, other than claims for Fraud, from and after the
Closing, the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall have no recourse to Seller or any
of the Non-Company Affiliates for Losses as a result of, arising out of, or
related to (a) any breach of or inaccuracy in any representation or warranty
of Seller in this Agreement (or in any certificate delivered hereunder), and
(b) any and all Company Taxes and Buyer Taxes, and the sole and exclusive
remedy and recourse of the Buyer Indemnified Parties for Losses as a result
of, arising out of, or related to any breach of or inaccuracy in any
representation or warranty of Seller in this Agreement (or in any certificate
delivered hereunder) or Company Taxes shall be to recover against
Indemnification Insurers under any Indemnification Insurance Policy. If
purchased, Buyer shall cause each Indemnification Insurance Policy to
expressly provide that the Indemnification Insurer(s) issuing such policy
shall waive or otherwise not pursue any subrogation rights against Seller or
any of its Affiliates and/or any of their respective equityholders, officers,
directors, employees, agents, advisors or representatives, except in the case
of Fraud by such Person, as applicable. From and after the date of this
Agreement, Buyer shall not (and shall cause its Affiliates to not) grant any
right of subrogation or otherwise amend, modify, terminate, or waive any term
or condition of an Indemnification Insurance Policy in a manner inconsistent
with the immediately preceding sentence. Subject to the Purchase Price
adjustment for the Tax Insurance Policy Costs contemplated in _Section_ __ _
2.2(a)(vii)_, at or prior to Closing, Buyer shall pay or cause to be paid,
all costs and expenses related to each Indemnification Insurance Policy,
including the total premium, underwriting costs, brokerage commission, and
other fees and expenses of such policy. From and after issuance of
each Indemnification Insurance Policy, Buyer, the Acquired Companies and
their Affiliates shall not amend, modify, or otherwise change, terminate, or
waive any provision of such Indemnification Insurance Policy in a manner
adverse to Seller.

 

10.11 _Holdback Amount_.

 

(a) If at any time prior to the Holdback Deadline, Buyer delivers to Seller a
Notice of Claim that Buyer is entitled to indemnity pursuant to  _Section_ __
_ 10.1(a)_ from the Holdback Amount for any alleged Losses, within thirty
(30) days after receipt of any such Notice of Claim, Seller shall either (i)
(A) provide the Transfer Agent with the applicable Transfer Agent
Documentation, in which case Buyer shall also provide the Transfer Agent with
any applicable Transfer Agent Documentation, and (B) Seller and Buyer shall
deliver to the Transfer Agent joint written instructions instructing
the Transfer Agent to (1) transfer to Buyer Parent from the Holdback Amount a
number of shares of Buyer Parent Common Stock (calculated at the Current
Price) equal to all or a stipulated amount of such alleged Losses set forth in
such Notice of Claim and (2) remove the Contract Legend on such shares or
(ii) deliver to Buyer (A) a notice that Seller disputes that the members of
the Buyer Indemnified Group are entitled to indemnity of all or any portion of
the amount of the alleged Losses in Buyers Notice of Claim or (iii) any
combination of clause (i) or (ii).

(b) If Seller (i) fails to timely deliver a notice to Buyer in response to
a Buyers Notice of Claim in accordance with this Agreement or (ii) timely
delivers a notice that Seller disputes only a portion of the Losses alleged in
Buyers Notice of Claim in accordance with this Agreement, then (A) in
the case of subpart (i) of this _Section_ __ _ 10.11(b)_, Seller and Buyer
shall (1) provide the Transfer Agent with the applicable Transfer Agent
Documentation and (2) deliver to the Transfer Agent joint
written instructions instructing the Transfer Agent to (I) transfer from the

(calculated at the Current Price) equal to entire amount of the alleged Losses

Legend on such shares and (B) in the case of subpart (ii) of this _Section_ __
_ 10.11(b)_, Seller and Buyer shall (1) provide the Transfer Agent with
the applicable Transfer Agent Documentation and (2) deliver to the Transfer
Agent joint written instructions instructing the Transfer Agent to (I)
transfer to Buyer Parent from the Holdback Amount a number of shares of Buyer
Parent Common Stock (calculated at the Current Price) equal to the alleged
Losses specified in Sellers notice that are not in dispute and (II) remove
the Contract Legend on such shares.

 

(c)

(i) Promptly after the Holdback Deadline (but in no event more than three
Business Days thereafter), Seller and Buyer shall (A) provide the Transfer
Agent with the applicable Transfer Agent Documentation and (B) deliver to the
Transfer Agent joint written instructions instructing the Transfer Agent to
remove the Contract Legend on the amount, if any, of the Buyer Parent Common
Stock equal to the remainder of (x) the Holdback Amount minus (y) a number of
shares of Buyer Parent Common Stock (calculated at the Current Price as of
the Holdback Deadline) equal to all undisbursed or unpaid alleged Losses
alleged by Buyer in one or more Buyers Notices of Claims.

 

(ii) If following the Holdback Deadline the Parties reach final agreement or
other final non-appealable resolution as to the Losses alleged by Buyer in
one or more Buyers Notices of Claim that remained unresolved as of the
Holdback Deadline, Seller and Buyer shall (A) provide the Transfer Agent with
the applicable Transfer Agent Documentation and (B) deliver to the Transfer
Agent joint written instructions instructing the Transfer Agent to (x)
transfer to Buyer a number of shares of Buyer Parent Common Stock (calculated
at the Current Price as of the Holdback Deadline) equal to any amounts to
which Buyer is entitled upon resolution of such dispute and remove the
Contract Legend on such shares and (y) remove the Contract Legend on the
remaining shares of Buyer Parent Common Stock that were held back in respect
of the applicable claim pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 10.11(c)(i)_.

(d) In the event that the Transfer Agent fails to remove the Contract Legend
within five (5) Business Days of (x) delivery of the Transfer Agent
Documentation by Seller and Buyer, as applicable, and (y) joint written
instructions from Buyer and Seller with respect to the shares of Buyer Parent
Common Stock to which Seller is entitled under this _Section_ __ _ 10.11_
(the " _Eligible Shares_ "), Buyer shall either (1) pay to Seller an amount in
cash equal to the product of (x) the number of Eligible Shares and (y) the
Current Price (on the date on which the Transfer Agent was required to remove
the Contract Legend pursuant to this Agreement) or (2) issue to Seller
additional shares equal to the number of Eligible Shares without any
Contract Legend. After Buyer shall have satisfied its obligations under this
_Section_ __ _ 10.11(d)_, (A) Seller and Buyer shall provide the Transfer
Agent with the applicable Transfer Agent Documentation and (B) deliver the
Transfer Agent joint written instructions to transfer to Buyer the applicable
Eligible Shares and remove the Contract Legends on such shares.

Company Material Adverse Effect or is material (or not material) to or outside
(or in) the ordinary course of business of any Acquired Company (or the
Business) (or that any such matter, fact, occurrence, information or
circumstance is above or below any specified threshold).

third parties, the existence or non-existence of third-party rights, the
absence of breaches or defaults by third parties, or similar matters or
statements, are intended only to allocate rights and risks between the Parties
and are not intended to be admissions against interests, give rise to any
inference or proof of accuracy, be admissible against any Party, or give rise
to any Claim or benefit to any Person. In addition, the disclosure of any
matter in the Schedules is not to be deemed an admission against any Party
that such matter actually constitutes noncompliance with or a violation of
Contract or Law or other topic to which such disclosure is applicable.

 

(f) In disclosing any matter, fact, occurrence, information or circumstance in
this Agreement, the disclosing party is not waiving any attorney-client
privilege associated with any such matter, fact, occurrence, information or

respect to any of the same.

time by the Party that is entitled to the benefit thereof. No agreement on

Agreement, in any one or more instances, shall be deemed to be or construed as
a waiver of the same or any other term or condition of this Agreement on any
future occasion. All remedies, either under this Agreement or by Law, will,
subject to _Section_ __ _ 10.6_, be cumulative and not alternative.

11.6 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended, supplemented or modified
only by a written instrument duly executed by Seller and Buyer.

11.12 _Governing Law; Venue; and Jurisdiction_.

 

(a) This Agreement, and all claims or causes of action (whether in contract or
tort) that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement, or
the negotiation, execution, or performance of this Agreement, shall be
governed by and construed in accordance with the Laws of the State of New
York, without giving effect to any conflict or choice of law provision that
would result in the imposition of another states Law.

(b) Each Party hereby irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
United States District Court for the Southern District of New York and of any
New York state court, in each case, sitting in the Borough of Manhattan in the
City of New York (or any appellate court therefrom), in connection with any
Proceeding brought in connection with the rights and obligations of the
Parties pursuant to this Agreement, and agrees that any such Proceeding may be
brought in such court. Each Party hereby irrevocably waives the defense of an
inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any such Proceeding. Each Party
further agrees to accept service of process out of any of the before mentioned
courts in any such dispute by registered or certified mail addressed to the
Party at the address set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 11.1_.

(c) EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES TO THE FULLEST
EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY PROCEEDING RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT AND WITH RESPECT TO ANY COUNTERCLAIM THEREIN.

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, each of the
Parties agrees that it will not bring or support any dispute, suit, action or
claim against any Debt Financing Source, or any Affiliates of any such Person
or any of their respective stockholders, members, partners, managers,
officers, directors, employees, agents, advisors, representatives, successors
or permitted assigns (each such Person, a " _Debt Financing Party_ ") in any
way relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to
the Debt Commitment Letter or the performance thereof, in any forum other than
the forums identified above in this  _Section_ __ _ 11.12_.

11.13 _Attorneys_ __ _Fees_. If either Party shall bring an action to
enforce the provisions of this Agreement, the prevailing Party shall be
entitled to recover its reasonable attorneys fees and expenses incurred in
such action from the unsuccessful Party.

 

11.14 _Specific Performance_. Each Party hereby acknowledges and agrees that
the rights of each Party to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby
(including the satisfaction of any condition to Closing) are special, unique
and of extraordinary character and that, if either Party violates, fails or
refuses to perform or otherwise breaches any covenant or agreement made by it
herein, the non-breaching Party will be without an adequate remedy at law. If
either Party violates,

 fails or refuses to perform or otherwise breaches any covenant or agreement
made by such Party herein, the non-breaching Party, subject to the
terms hereof, may (at any time prior to the earlier of valid termination of
this Agreement pursuant to _Article_ __ _ IX_ and the Closing) institute and
prosecute an action in any court of competent jurisdiction to enforce
specific performance of such covenant or agreement or seek any other
equitable relief. For purposes of clarification, nothing contained in this
Agreement, shall prevent or impair the ability of a Party to seek specific
performance prior to the earlier of valid termination of this Agreement in
accordance with _Article_ __ _ IX_ and the Closing; _provided_ that,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, it is agreed that
Seller shall not be entitled to specific performance of Buyers obligation to
consummate the Closing (but Seller shall be entitled to specific performance
of each of Buyers other obligations under this Agreement), even if all of the
conditions to Buyers obligation proceed with the Closing under _Article_ __
_ VII_ have been satisfied or waived by Buyer and Buyer fails to close, and
Seller recognizes that its sole and exclusive remedy in such instance is to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 9.1(b)_ and recover the
Buyer Termination Fee pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.2_. Each Party further
agrees that no Party or any other Person shall be required to obtain, furnish
or post any bond or similar instrument in connection with or as a condition
to obtaining any remedy referred to in this _Section_ __ _ 11.14_, and each
Party irrevocably waives any right it may have to require the obtaining,
furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar instrument.

11.15 _Counsel Waiver_. Buyer agrees, on its own behalf and on behalf of its
Affiliates and Representatives (including the Acquired Companies following
Closing), that, following the Closing, Vinson and Elkins L.L.P. (" _Seller
Counsel_ ") may serve as counsel to Seller and its Affiliates in connection
with any matters related to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, including any dispute arising out of or relating to this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement notwithstanding
any representation by Seller Counsel of the Acquired Companies prior to the
Closing. Buyer, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates and Representatives
(including the Acquired Companies after the Closing) hereby (a) consents to
representation of Seller and its Affiliates by Seller Counsel in connection
with any matters related to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, (b) waives any Claim it has or may have that Seller Counsel
has a conflict of interest or is otherwise prohibited from engaging in such
representation based on its representation of the Acquired Companies prior to
the Closing, and (c) agrees that, in the event that a dispute arises between
Buyer and/or either of the Acquired Companies or any of their respective
Affiliates on the one hand, and Seller and/or its Affiliates on the other
hand, Seller Counsel may represent Seller and/or their Affiliates in such
dispute even though the interests of Seller and its Affiliates may be
directly adverse to Buyer or the Acquired Companies or any of their
respective Affiliates and even though Seller Counsel may have represented the
Acquired Companies in a matter substantially related to such dispute. Buyer
further agrees that, as to all communications among Seller Counsel, the
Acquired Companies, Seller or their respective Affiliates and Representatives
prior to the Closing that relate in any way to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the attorney-client privilege
belongs, to the extent such privilege exists, to Seller and their Non-Company
Affiliates and may be controlled by Seller and their Non-Company Affiliates
and will not, with respect to such

 privileged communications, pass to or be claimed by Buyer or the Acquired
Companies or any of their respective Affiliates. To the extent that Buyer, the
Acquired Companies, or any of their respective Affiliates has or maintains
any ownership of the privilege with respect to these communications, they
agree, except as may be required by applicable Law, not to waive or to attempt
to waive the privilege without the express written approval of Seller.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a dispute arises between
Buyer or any Acquired Company, on the one hand, and a Person (other than
Seller and its Non-Company Affiliates) or any Governmental Authority, on the
other hand, after the Closing, the Acquired Companies may assert the attorney-
client privilege against such Person to prevent disclosure of confidential
communications by or with Seller Counsel.

 

11.16 _No Recourse to Debt Financing Parties_. Subject to the rights of the
parties to the Debt Commitment Letter under the terms thereof, none of Seller
nor any of its Affiliates, solely in their capacities as parties to this
Agreement, shall have any rights or claims against any Debt Financing Party,
in connection with this Agreement or the Debt Financing, whether at law
or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise.
