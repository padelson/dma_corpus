(b)to the extent not expressly included in Section 1.2(g), all logs,
interpretive data, technical evaluations, technical outputs, reserve estimates
and economic estimates;

(c)all rights to any refund of Taxes or other costs or expenses borne by
Seller or Seller's predecessors in interest attributable to periods prior to
the Effective Time;

(d)all trade credits, account receivables, note receivables, take-or-pay
amounts receivable, and other receivables attributable to the Assets with
respect to any period of time prior to the Effective Time;

(e)royalties, overriding royalties, and net profits interests;

(f)all right, title and interest of Seller in and to vehicles used in
connection with the Assets;

(g)all rights, titles, claims and interests of Seller or any Affiliate of
Seller to or under any policy or agreement of insurance or any insurance
proceeds; except to the extent provided in Section 3.5; and

(h)any patent, patent application, logo, service mark, copyright, trade name
or trademark of or associated with Seller or any Affiliate of Seller or any
business of Seller or of any Affiliate of Seller.

Section 1.4 Effective Time; Proration of Costs and Revenues.

(a) Subject to Section 1.5, possession of the Assets shall be transferred from
Seller to Purchaser at the Closing, but certain financial benefits and burdens
of the Assets shall be transferred effective as of 7:00 A.M., local time,
where the respective Assets are located, on October 1, 2013 (the "Effective
Time"), as described below.

(b) Purchaser shall be entitled to all Hydrocarbon production from or
attributable to the Leases, Units and Wells at and after the Effective Time
(and all products and proceeds attributable thereto), and to all other income,
proceeds, receipts and credits earned with respect to the Assets at or after
the Effective Time, and shall be responsible for (and entitled to any refunds
with respect to) all Property Costs incurred at and after the Effective Time.
Seller shall be entitled to all Hydrocarbon production from or attributable to
Leases, Units and Wells prior to the Effective Time (and all products and
proceeds attributable thereto), and to all other income, proceeds, receipts
and credits earned with respect to the Assets prior to the Effective Time, and
shall be responsible for (and entitled to any refunds with respect to) all
Property Costs incurred prior to the Effective Time. "Earned" and "incurred,"
as used in this Agreement, shall be interpreted in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles and Council of Petroleum Accountants Society
(COPAS) standards. "Property Costs" means all costs attributable to the
ownership and operation of the Assets (including without limitation costs of
insurance and ad valorem, property, severance, Hydrocarbon production and
similar Taxes based upon or measured by the ownership or operation



Page 8 of 54 of the Assets or the production of Hydrocarbons therefrom, but excluding any
other Taxes) and capital expenditures incurred in the ownership and operation
of the Assets in the ordinary course of business and, where applicable, in
accordance with the relevant operating or unit agreement, if any, and overhead
costs charged to the Assets, but excluding, without limitation, liabilities,
losses, costs, and expenses attributable to (i) Claims for personal injury or
death, property damage or violation of any Law, (ii) obligations to plug wells
or dismantle, abandon and salvage facilities, (iii) obligations to remediate
any contamination of groundwater, surface water, soil, equipment or pipelines
under applicable Environmental Laws, (iv) obligations to furnish make-up gas
according to the terms of applicable gas sales, gathering or transportation
contracts, (v) gas balancing obligations except Imbalances existing as of the
Effective Time and (vi) obligations to pay working interests, royalties,
overriding royalties or other interests held in suspense, all of which are
addressed in Article 10. For purposes of this Section 1.4, determination of
whether Property Costs are attributable to the period before or after the
Effective Time shall be based on when services are rendered, when the goods
are delivered, or when the work is performed. For purposes of allocating
Hydrocarbon production (and accounts receivable with respect thereto), under
this Section 1.4, (i) liquid Hydrocarbons shall be deemed to be "from or
attributable to" the Leases, Units and Wells when they pass through the
pipeline connection into the storage facilities into which they are run and
(ii) gaseous Hydrocarbons shall be deemed to be "from or attributable to" the
Leases, Units and Wells when they pass through the delivery point sales meters
on the pipelines through which they are transported. Seller shall utilize
reasonable interpolative procedures to arrive at an allocation of Hydrocarbon
production when exact meter readings or gauging and strapping data is not
available. Seller shall provide to Purchaser, no later than five (5) Business
Days prior to Closing, all data necessary to support any estimated allocation,
for purposes of establishing the adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to
Section 2.2 hereof that will be used to determine the Closing Payment (as
defined in Section 8.4(a)). Taxes, right-of-way fees, insurance premiums and
other Property Costs that are paid periodically shall be prorated based on the
number of days in the applicable period falling before, and the number of days
in the applicable period falling at or after, the Effective Time, except that
Property Taxes measured by production shall be prorated based on the number of
units actually produced, purchased or sold or proceeds of sale, as applicable,
before, and at or after, the Effective Time. In each case, Purchaser shall be
responsible for the portion allocated to the period at and after the Effective
Time and Seller shall be responsible for the portion allocated to the period
before the Effective Time.

Section 1.5 Delivery and Maintenance of Records.

(a) Seller, at Purchaser's cost, shall use reasonable efforts to deliver the
Records (FOB Seller\'s office) to Purchaser within thirty (30) days following
Closing. Seller may retain original Records of those items set forth in
Section 1.2(g) and/or copies of any Records. If Seller elects to retain
original files, Purchaser will be provided with copies of same, at Purchaser's
cost.



(b) Purchaser, for a period of seven (7) years following Closing, will (i)
retain the Records, (ii) provide Seller, its Affiliates, and its and their
officers, employees and representatives with access to the Records during
normal business hours for review and copying at Seller's expense, and (iii)
provide Seller, its Affiliates, and its and their officers, employees and
representatives with access, during normal business hours, to materials
received or produced after Closing relating to any Indemnity Claim made under
Section 10.4 of this Agreement for review and copying at Seller's expense.





Page 9 of 54 ARTICLE 2 
PURCHASE PRICE



Section 2.1 Purchase Price.

The purchase price for the Assets (the "Purchase Price") shall be Five Hundred
Eighty-One Million Dollars ($581,000,000.00) adjusted as provided in Section
2.2.



Section 2.2 Adjustments to Purchase Price.

The Purchase Price for the Assets shall be adjusted as follows with all such
amounts being determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles and Council of Petroleum Accountants Society (COPAS) standards:

(a) Reduced by the aggregate amount of the following proceeds received by
Seller between the Effective Time and the Closing Date (with the period
between the Effective Time and the Closing Date referred to as the "Adjustment
Period"): (i) proceeds from the sale of Hydrocarbons (net of any royalties,
overriding royalties or other burdens on or payable out of Hydrocarbon
production, gathering, processing and transportation costs and any Hydrocarbon
production, severance, sales or excise Taxes not reimbursed to Seller by the
purchaser of Hydrocarbon production) produced from or attributable to the
Properties during the Adjustment Period, and (ii) other proceeds earned with
respect to the Assets during the Adjustment Period;

(b) Reduced to the extent provided in Section 6.6 with respect to Preference
Rights and Retained Assets;

(c) (i) If Seller makes the election under Section 3.4(d)(i) with respect to a
Title Defect, subject to the Individual Title Deductible and the Aggregate
Title Deductible, reduced by the Title Defect Amount with respect to such
Title Defect if the Title Defect Amount has been determined prior to Closing
and (ii) increased by the Title Benefit Amount with respect to each Title
Benefit, subject to the Individual Title Deductible and the Aggregate Title
Deductible, for which the Title Benefit Amount has been determined prior to
Closing;

(d) Increased by the amount of all Property Costs and other costs attributable
to the ownership and operation of the Assets which are paid by Seller and
incurred at or after the Effective Time (including any prepayments relating to
the time period from and after the Effective Time), except any Property Costs
and other such costs already deducted in the determination of proceeds in
Section 2.2(a);

(e) Increased by the amount of merchantable Hydrocarbons stored in tanks and
pipelines above the pipeline connection or upstream of the sales meter (as
evidenced by tank straps and/or gauge sheets) attributable to the ownership
and operation of the Assets that belong to Seller as of the Effective Time;
and

(f) Increased or reduced, as appropriate, by the aggregate amount of
Imbalances reflected on Schedule 4.13 as of the Effective Time, multiplied by
$3.00 per mcf;

(g) Reduced by the amount required to pay working interests, royalties,
overriding royalties and other interests held in suspense and not paid to
Purchaser; and



Page 10 of 54 (h) Increased or reduced as agreed upon in writing by Seller and Purchaser or
as otherwise provided in Section 8.4.

Each adjustment made pursuant to Section 2.2(a) shall serve to satisfy, up to
the amount of the adjustment, Purchaser's entitlement under Section 1.4 to
Hydrocarbon production from or attributable to the Properties during the
Adjustment Period, and to the value of other income, proceeds, receipts and
credits earned with respect to the Assets during the Adjustment Period, and as
such, Purchaser shall not have any separate rights to receive any Hydrocarbon
production or income, proceeds, receipts and credits with respect to which an
adjustment has been made. Similarly, the adjustment described in Section
2.2(c) shall serve to satisfy, up to the amount of the adjustment, Purchaser's
obligation under Section 1.4 to pay Property Costs and other costs
attributable to the ownership and operation of the Assets which are incurred
during the Adjustment Period, and as such, Purchaser shall not be separately
obligated to pay for any Property Costs or other such costs with respect to
which an adjustment has been made.

Section 2.3 Code Section 1060.

Each party will comply with the allocation and reporting requirements of
Section 1060 of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended (the "Code"), and the
Treasury Regulations thereunder, to the extent applicable to the transactions
under this Agreement.

Section 2.4 Deposit.

Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Purchaser has paid to
Seller an earnest money deposit in an amount equal to ten percent (10%) of the
Purchase Price (the "Deposit"). The Deposit shall accrue interest at the rate
of two percent (2%) per annum and shall be applied with accrued interest
against the Purchase Price if the Closing occurs or shall be otherwise
distributed in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

ARTICLE 3 
TITLE MATTERS



Section 3.1 Seller's Title.

(a) Except for the special warranty of title referenced herein, Seller makes
no warranty or representation, express, implied, statutory or otherwise, with
respect to Seller's title to any of the Assets and Purchaser hereby
acknowledges and agrees that Purchaser's sole remedy for any defect of title,
shall be pursuant to such special warranty of title. The conveyance to be
delivered by Seller to Purchaser shall be substantially in the form of Exhibit
B hereto (the "Conveyance") and contain a special warranty of Defensible Title
by, through and under Seller but not otherwise to the Leases, Units and Wells
shown on Exhibit A and Exhibit Aâ€‘1, subject to the Permitted Encumbrances, but
shall otherwise be without warranty of title of any kind, express, implied or
statutory or otherwise.

(b) Purchaser shall not be entitled to protection under Seller's special
warranty of title in the Conveyance against any Title Defect reported under
this Article 3 and/or any Title Defect disclosed to or known by Purchaser
prior to the Title Claim Date.





Page 11 of 54 (c) Notwithstanding anything herein provided to the contrary, if a Title
Defect under this Article 3 results from any matter which could also result in
the breach of any representation or warranty of Seller set forth in Article 4,
then Purchaser shall only be entitled to assert such matter (i) before
Closing, as a Title Defect to the extent permitted by this Article 3, or (ii)
after Closing, as a breach of Seller's special warranty of title contained in
the Conveyance to the extent permitted by this Section 3.1, and shall be
precluded from also asserting such matter as the basis of the breach of any
such representation or warranty.



Section 3.2 Definition of Defensible Title.

As used in this Agreement, the term "Defensible Title" means that title of
Seller with respect to the Units or Wells shown in Exhibit A-1 that, except
for and subject to Permitted Encumbrances:

(a) Entitles Seller to receive a share of the Hydrocarbons produced, saved and
marketed from any Unit or Well shown in Exhibit A-1 throughout the duration of
the productive life of such Unit or Well (after satisfaction of all royalties,
overriding royalties, net profits interests or other similar burdens on or
measured by production of Hydrocarbons) (a "Net Revenue Interest"), of not
less than the Net Revenue Interest shown in Exhibit A-1 for such Unit or Well,
except decreases in connection with those operations in which Seller may after
the Effective Time be a non-consenting co-owner, decreases resulting from the
establishment or amendment after the Effective Time of pools or units, and
decreases required to allow other working interest owners to make up past
underproduction or pipelines to make up past under deliveries, and except as
stated in such Exhibit A-1;

(b) Obligates Seller to bear a percentage of the costs and expenses for the
maintenance and development of, and operations relating to any Unit or Well
shown in Exhibit A-1 not greater than the "working interest" shown in Exhibit
A-1 for such Unit or Well without increase throughout the productive life of
such Unit or Well, except as stated in Exhibit A-1 and except increases
resulting from contribution requirements with respect to non-consenting co-
owners under applicable operating agreements and increases that are
accompanied by at least a proportionate increase in Seller's Net Revenue
Interest; and

(c) Is free and clear of liens, encumbrances, obligations, security interests,
irregularities, pledges, or other defects.

As used in this Agreement, the term "Title Defect" means any lien, charge,
encumbrance, obligation (including contract obligation), defect, or other
matter (including without limitation a discrepancy in Net Revenue Interest or
working interest) that causes Seller not to have Defensible Title in and to
the Units or Wells shown in Exhibit Aâ€‘1 as of the Effective Time. As used in
this Agreement, the term "Title Benefit" shall mean any right, circumstance or
condition discovered by Seller after the date of this Agreement that operates
to increase the Net Revenue Interest of Seller in any Unit or Well shown on

Section 3.4 Notice of Title Defect Adjustments.

(a) To assert a claim of a Title Defect, Purchaser must deliver claim notices
to Seller (each a "Title Defect Notice") on or before January 15, 2014 (the
"Title Claim Date"). Each Title Defect Notice shall be in writing and shall
include (i) a description of the alleged Title Defect(s), (ii) the Units or
Wells affected by the Title Defect (each a "Title Defect Property"), (iii) the
Allocated Value of each Title Defect Property, (iv) supporting documents
reasonably necessary for Seller (as well as any title attorney or examiner
hired by Seller) to verify the existence of the alleged Title Defect(s), and
(v) the amount by which Purchaser reasonably believes the Allocated Value of
each Title Defect Property is reduced by the alleged Title Defect(s) and the
computations and information upon which Purchaser's belief is based.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
Purchaser shall be deemed to have waived its right to assert Title Defects
under this Agreement of which Seller has not been given notice on or before
the Title Claim Date provided, however, such waiver shall have no effect or
limitation on the special warranty of title in the Conveyance. For purposes of
this Agreement, the term "Allocated Value" shall mean the portion of the
Purchase Price that has been allocated to a Unit or Well in Exhibit Aâ€‘1.





Page 14 of 54 (b) Seller shall have the right, but not the obligation, to deliver to
Purchaser on or before the Title Claim Date with respect to each Title Benefit
a notice (a "Title Benefit Notice") including (i) a description of the Title
Benefit, (ii) the Units or Wells affected, (iii) the Allocated Values of the
Units or Wells subject to such Title Benefit and (iv) the amount by which the
Seller reasonably believes the Allocated Value of those Units or Wells is
increased by the Title Benefit, and the computations and information upon
which Seller's belief is based. Seller shall be deemed to have waived all
Title Benefits of which it has not given notice on or before the Title Claim
Date.



(c) Seller shall have the right, but not the obligation, to attempt, at its
sole cost, to cure or remove at any time prior to Closing (the "Cure Period"),
unless the parties otherwise agree, any Title Defects of which it has been
advised by Purchaser.



(d) In the event that any Title Defect is not waived by Purchaser or cured on
or before Closing, Seller shall, at its sole election, elect to:



(i) subject to the Individual Title Deductible and the Aggregate Title
Deductible, reduce the Purchase Price by an amount agreed upon ("Title Defect
Amount") pursuant to Section 3.4(g) by Purchaser and Seller as being the value
of such Title Defect, taking into consideration the Allocated Value of the
Property subject to such Title Defect, the portion of the Property subject to
such Title Defect and the legal effect of such Title Defect on the Property
affected thereby; provided, however, that the methodology, terms and
conditions of Section 3.4(g) shall control any such determination;



(ii) indemnify Purchaser against all liability, loss, cost and expense
resulting from such Title Defect ;



(iii) retain the entirety of the Property that is subject to such Title
Defect, together with all associated Assets, in which event the Purchase Price
shall be reduced by an amount equal to the Allocated Value of such Property;
or



(iv) if applicable, terminate this Agreement.



(e) With respect to each Unit or Well affected by Title Benefits reported
under Section 3.4(b), the Purchase Price shall be increased by an amount (the
"Title Benefit Amount") equal to the increase in the Allocated Value for such
Unit or Well caused by such Title Benefits, as determined pursuant to Section
3.4(h).



(f) Section 3.4(d) shall be the exclusive right and remedy of Purchaser with
respect to Title Defects asserted by Purchaser pursuant to Section 3.4.



(g) The Title Defect Amount resulting from a Title Defect shall be the amount
by which the Allocated Value of the Title Defect Property affected by such
Title Defect is reduced as a result of the existence of such Title Defect and
shall be determined in accordance with the following methodology, terms and
conditions:



(i) if Purchaser and Seller agree on the Title Defect Amount, that amount
shall be the Title Defect Amount;





Page 15 of 54 (ii) if the Title Defect is a lien, encumbrance or other charge which is
undisputed and liquidated in amount, then the Title Defect Amount shall be the
amount necessary to be paid to remove the Title Defect from the Title Defect
Property;



(iii) if the Title Defect represents a discrepancy between (A) the Net Revenue
Interest for any Title Defect Property and (B) the Net Revenue Interest stated
on Exhibit A-1, then the Title Defect Amount shall be the product of the
Allocated Value of such Title Defect Property multiplied by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the Net Revenue Interest decrease and the denominator of
which is the Net Revenue Interest stated on Exhibit A-1;



(iv) if the Title Defect represents an obligation, encumbrance, burden or
charge upon or other defect in title to the Title Defect Property of a type
not described in subsections (i), (ii) or (iii) above, the Title Defect Amount
shall be determined by taking into account the Allocated Value of the Title
Defect Property, the portion of the Title Defect Property affected by the
Title Defect, the legal effect of the Title Defect, the potential economic
effect of the Title Defect over the life of the Title Defect Property, the
values placed upon the Title Defect by Purchaser and Seller and such other
factors as are necessary to make a proper evaluation; and



(v) notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article 3, the aggregate
Title Defect Amounts attributable to the effects of all Title Defects upon any
Title Defect Property shall not exceed the Allocated Value of the Title Defect
Property.



(h) The Title Benefit Amount for any Title Benefit shall be the product of the
Allocated Value of the affected Unit or Well multiplied by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the Net Revenue Interest increase and the denominator of
which is the Net Revenue Interest stated on Exhibit A-1.

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, (i) in no event shall there be
any adjustments to the Purchase Price or other remedies provided by Seller for
individual Title Defects that do not exceed $50,000.00 ("Individual Title
Deductible"); and (ii) in no event shall there be any adjustments to the
Purchase Price or other remedies provided by Seller for Title Defects unless
the amount of all such Title Defects, in the aggregate, excluding any Title
Defects cured by Seller, exceeds a deductible in an amount equal to two
percent (2%) of the Purchase Price ("Aggregate Title Deductible"), after which
point Purchaser shall be entitled to adjustments to the Purchase Price or
other remedies only with respect to Title Defects in excess of such Aggregate
Title Deductible.

(j) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, (i) in no event shall there be
any adjustments to the Purchase Price or other remedies provided by Purchaser
for individual Title Benefits that do not exceed $50,000.00 ("Individual Title
Deductible"); and (ii) in no event shall there be any adjustments to the
Purchase Price or other remedies provided by Purchaser for Title Benefits
unless the amount of all such Title Benefits, in the aggregate, exceeds a
deductible in an amount equal to two percent (2%) of the Purchase Price
("Aggregate Title Deductible"), after which point Seller shall be entitled to
adjustments to the Purchase Price or other remedies only with respect to Title
Benefits in excess of such Aggregate Title Deductible.



(k) Seller and Purchaser shall attempt to agree on all Title Defect Amounts
and Title Benefit Amounts prior to Closing. If Seller and Purchaser are unable
to agree by Closing, the Title Defect Amounts and Title Benefit Amounts in
dispute shall be exclusively and finally resolved by



Page 16 of 54 arbitration pursuant to this Section 3.4. The Parties shall exchange their
final proposed Title Defect Amounts or Title Benefit Amounts with respect to
any unresolved Title Defects or Title Benefits. There shall be a single
arbitrator, who shall be a title attorney with at least ten (10) year's
experience in oil and gas titles involving properties in the regional area in
which the Properties are located, as selected by mutual agreement of Purchaser
and Seller within fifteen (15) Business Days after the end of the Cure Period,
and absent such agreement, by the Houston office of the American Arbitration
Association (the "Title Expert"). The arbitration proceeding shall be held in
Houston, Texas and shall be conducted in accordance with the Commercial
Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association, to the extent such
rules do not conflict with the terms of this Section. The Title Expert's
determination shall be made within fifteen (15) Business Days after submission
of the matters in dispute and shall be final and binding upon both parties,
without right of appeal. In making a determination, the Title Expert shall be
bound by the rules set forth in Sections 3.4(g) and 3.4(h) and may consider
such other matters as in the opinion of the Title Expert are necessary or
helpful to make a proper determination.



Section 3.5 Casualty or Condemnation Loss.

(a) Purchaser shall assume all risk of loss with respect to, and any change in
the condition of the Assets from the Effective Time until Closing for
production of Hydrocarbons through normal depletion (including but not limited
to the watering out of any Well, collapsed casing or sand infiltration of any
Well) and the depreciation of personal property due to ordinary wear and tear.

(b) If, after the date of this Agreement but prior to the Closing Date, any
portion of the Assets is destroyed by fire or other casualty or is taken in
condemnation or under right of eminent domain, and the loss as a result of
such individual casualty or taking exceeds five percent (5%) of the Purchase
Price, Purchaser shall nevertheless be required to close and Seller shall
elect by written notice to Purchaser prior to Closing either (i) to cause the
Assets affected by any casualty or taking to be repaired or restored to at
least its condition prior to such casualty, at Seller's sole cost, as promptly
as reasonably practicable (which work may extend after the Closing Date), (ii)
to indemnify Purchaser against any costs or expenses that Purchaser reasonably
incurs to repair the Assets subject to any casualty or taking, or (iii) to
treat such casualty or taking as a Title Defect with respect to the affected
Property or Properties under Section 3.4. In each case, Seller shall retain
all rights to insurance and other claims against third parties with respect to
the casualty or taking except to the extent the parties otherwise agree in
writing.

(c) If, after the date of this Agreement but prior to the Closing Date, any
portion of the Assets is destroyed by fire or other casualty or is taken in
condemnation or under right of eminent domain, and the loss as a result of
such individual casualty or taking is five percent (5%) or less of the
Purchase Price, Purchaser shall nevertheless be required to close and Seller
shall, at Closing, pay to Purchaser all sums paid to Seller by third parties
by reason of such casualty or taking and shall assign, transfer and set over
to Purchaser or subrogate Purchaser to all of Seller's right, title and
interest (if any) in unpaid awards, and other rights against third parties
(other than Affiliates of Seller and its and their directors, officers,
employees and agents) arising out of the casualty or taking. In addition,
Seller shall make Purchaser as loss payee under the Seller\'s Oil Insurance
Limited (OIL) insurance policy in accordance with this Section 3.5.







Page 17 of 54 Section 3.6 Limitations on Applicability.



The right of Purchaser to assert a Title Defect under this Agreement shall
terminate as of the Title Claim Date, provided there shall be no termination
of Purchaser's or Seller's rights under Section 3.4 with respect to any bona
fide Title Defect properly reported in a Title Defect Notice on or before the
Title Claim Date. Thereafter, Purchaser's sole and exclusive rights and
remedies with regard to title to the Assets shall be as set forth in, and
arise under, the Conveyance transferring the Assets from Seller to Purchaser.



Section 3.7 Government Approvals Respecting Assets.

(a) Federal and State Approvals. Purchaser, within thirty (30) days after
Closing, shall file for approval with the applicable government agencies all
assignment documents and other state and federal transfer documents required
to effectuate the transfer of the Assets. Purchaser further agrees promptly
after Closing to take all other actions reasonably required of it by federal
or state agencies having jurisdiction to obtain all requisite regulatory
approvals with respect to this transaction, and to use its reasonable
commercial efforts to obtain the approval by such federal or state agencies,
as applicable, of Seller's assignment documents requiring federal or state
approval in order for Purchaser to be recognized by the federal or state
agencies as the owner of the Assets. Purchaser shall provide Seller with
approved copies of the assignment documents and other state and federal
transfer documents, as soon as they are available.

(b) Title Pending Governmental Approvals. Until all of the governmental
approvals provided for in Section 3.7(a) have been obtained, the following
shall occur with respect to the affected portion of the Assets:

(i) Seller shall continue to hold record title to the affected Leases and
other affected portion of the Assets as nominee for Purchaser;

(ii) Purchaser shall be responsible for all assumed obligations with respect
to the affected Leases and other affected portion of the Assets as if
Purchaser were the record owner of such Leases and other portion of the Assets
as of the Effective Date; and

(iii) Seller shall act as Purchaser's nominee but shall be authorized to act
only upon and in accordance with Purchaser's instructions, and Seller shall
have no authority, responsibility or discretion to perform any tasks or
functions with respect to the affected Leases and other affected portion of
the Assets other than those which are purely administrative or ministerial in
nature, unless otherwise specifically requested and authorized by Purchaser in
writing.

(c) Denial of Required Governmental Approvals. If the federal or state agency
fails to grant approval within twenty-four (24) months after the Closing,
Seller may continue to hold record title to the affected Leases and other
affected Assets as Purchaser's nominee or at Seller's option it may terminate
this Agreement and all its obligations hereunder as to the affected Leases and
other affected portion of the Assets by giving sixty (60) days written notice
to Purchaser. Upon such termination: (i) this Agreement shall be null and void
and terminated as to the affected Leases and other affected portion of the
Assets, (ii) Purchaser shall immediately reassign and return to Seller the
assignment documents and any and all other documents, materials and data
previously



Page 18 of 54 delivered to Purchaser with respect to the affected Leases and other affected
portion of the Assets, and (iii) Seller shall pay to Purchaser the Allocated
Value of the affected Property, without interest, less the proceeds of
Hydrocarbon production received by Purchaser (which shall be retained by
Purchaser as its sole property) net of all expenses, overhead, royalties, and
costs of operations (including plugging and abandonment expenses but excluding
mortgage interest and any burdens, liens, or encumbrances created by Purchaser
which must be released prior to this payment) attributable to the affected
Leases or other affected portion of the Assets from the Effective Date
forward. In no event, however, shall Seller ever be required to reimburse
Purchaser for any expenditures associated with workovers, recompletions,
sidetracks, or the drilling, completion or plugging and abandonment of wells
drilled or work performed by Seller.

Until the Closing,

(a) Purchaser shall notify Seller promptly after Purchaser obtains actual
knowledge that any representation or warranty of Seller contained in this

respect as of the Closing Date or that any covenant or agreement to be

knowledge that any representation or warranty of Purchaser contained in this

been so performed or observed in any material respect.

(c) If any of Purchaser's or Seller's representations or warranties is untrue
or shall become untrue in any material respect between the date of execution
of this Agreement and the Closing Date, or if any of Purchaser's or Seller's
covenants or agreements to be performed or observed prior to or on the Closing
Date shall not have been so performed or observed in any material respect, but
if such breach of representation, warranty, covenant or agreement shall (if
curable) be cured by the Closing (or, if the Closing does not occur, by the
date set forth in Section 10.1), then such breach shall be considered not to
have occurred for all purposes of this Agreement.



Page 26 of 54 Section 6.4 Public Announcements.

Until the Closing, neither party shall make any press release or other public
announcement regarding the existence of this Agreement, the contents hereof or
the transactions contemplated hereby without the prior written consent of the
other, except that Purchaser may issue a press release upon the execution of
this Agreement substantially in the form set forth in Schedule 6.4; provided,
however, the foregoing shall not restrict disclosures by Purchaser or Seller
which are required by applicable securities or other laws or regulations or
the applicable rules of any stock exchange having jurisdiction over the
disclosing party or its Affiliates. At or after Closing, the content of any
press release or public announcement shall be subject to the prior review and
reasonable approval of Seller and Purchaser.

Section 6.5 Operation of Business.

Seller (i) shall cause the Properties to be operated and maintained in
accordance with its past practices in all material respects, (ii) conduct
their business, activities and practices with respect to such Properties in
all material respects only in the ordinary course of business and consistent
with past practice or as otherwise permitted by this Agreement, (iii) will
not, without the prior written consent of Purchaser, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, commit to any operation, or series of related
operations, reasonably anticipated by Seller to require future capital
expenditures by the owner of the Assets in excess of $150,000.00,
proportionate to Seller's working interest, or make any capital expenditures
in excess of $150,000.00, proportionate to Seller's working interest, or
terminate, materially amend, execute or extend any material agreements
affecting the Assets, (iv) will maintain insurance coverage on the Assets
presently furnished by nonaffiliated third parties in the amounts and of the
types presently in force, (v) will use commercially reasonable efforts to
maintain in full force and effect all Leases, (vi) will not transfer, farmout,
sell, hypothecate, encumber or otherwise dispose of any material Assets except
for sales and dispositions of Hydrocarbon production and equipment made in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practices and (vii) will not
commit to do any of the foregoing. Purchaser's approval of any action
restricted by this Section 6.5 shall be considered granted within ten (10)
days (unless a shorter time is reasonably required by the circumstances and
such shorter time is specified in Seller's written notice) of Seller's notice
to Purchaser requesting such consent unless Purchaser notifies Seller to the
contrary in writing during that period. In the event of an emergency, Seller
may take such action as a prudent owner would take and shall notify Purchaser
of such action promptly thereafter.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Seller shall have
no liability to Purchaser for the incorrect payment of delay rentals,
royalties, shut-in payments or similar payments made during the period from
the Effective Time to the Closing Date or for failure to make such payments
through mistake or oversight (including Seller\'s negligence).

Purchaser acknowledges that Seller owns an undivided interest in the Assets
and Purchaser agrees that the acts or omissions of the other working interest
owners who are not affiliated with Seller shall not constitute a violation of
the provisions of this Section 6.5 nor shall any action required by a vote of
working interest owners constitute such a violation so long as Seller has
voted its interest in a manner consistent with the provisions of this Section
6.5.



Page 27 of 54 Section 6.6 Preference Rights and Transfer Requirements.

(a) Purchaser's purchase of the Assets is expressly subject to all validly
existing and applicable Preference Rights and Transfer Requirements. Prior to
the Closing Date, Seller shall initiate all procedures which in Seller's good
faith judgment are reasonably required to comply with or obtain the waiver of
the Preference Rights and Transfer Requirements set forth in Schedule 4.16
part 1 with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Seller
shall not be obligated to pay any consideration to (or incur any cost or
expense for the benefit of) the holder of any Preference Right or Transfer
Requirement in order to obtain the waiver thereof or compliance therewith.

(b) The portion of the Purchase Price to be allocated to any Asset or portion
thereof affected by a Preference Right (a "Preference Property") or that
becomes a Retained Asset shall be the portion of the Purchase Price allocated
thereto in Exhibit A-1. If a Preference Property or a Retained Asset affects
only a portion of a Property and a portion of the Purchase Price has not been
allocated specifically to such portion of a Property in Exhibit A-1, then the
portion of the Purchase Price to be allocated to such Preference Property or
Retained Asset shall be determined in a reasonable manner taking into account
the net acreage (or net acre feet, as appropriate) that the portion of such
Property affected by such Preference Property or Retained Asset bears to the
net acreage (or net acre feet, as appropriate) in the entire Property. Any
Preference Property or Retained Asset that is a Property shall include a pro
rata share of all of Seller's right, title and interest in, to and under all
equipment, Hydrocarbon production and Records included in the Assets that are
directly related or attributable to such Preference Property or Retained
Asset.

(c) If the holder of a Preference Right who has been offered a Preference
Property pursuant to Section 6.6(a) elects prior to Closing to purchase such
Preference Property in accordance with the terms of such Preference Right, and
Seller and Purchaser receive written notice of such election prior to the
Closing, such Preference Property will be eliminated from the Assets and the
Purchase Price shall be reduced by the portion of the Purchase Price allocated
to such Preference Property pursuant to Section 6.6(b). If for any reason the
purchase and sale of the Properties covered by a Preference Right which has
been exercised by the holder thereof is not or cannot be consummated with the
holder of the Preference Right in accordance with the agreement under which
the applicable Preference Right arises, or the holder of the applicable
Preference Right is unable to satisfy the conditions to closing contained
therein, Seller shall promptly notify Purchaser and, if the Closing has not
yet occurred, the affected Property shall be included in the Closing or, if
the Closing has previously occurred, then within ten (10) Business Days after
Purchaser's receipt of such notice, the Parties shall conduct an additional
closing whereby Seller shall sell, assign and convey to Purchaser, and
Purchaser shall purchase and accept from Seller, such Property pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement and for the Allocated Value with respect to such
Property in Exhibit A-1 (except "Closing Date" with respect to any such
Property shall mean the date of assignment of such Property from the
applicable Seller to Purchaser), subject to any Purchase Price adjustments
consistent with this Agreement.

(d) If

(i) the time for election with respect to a Preference Right has not expired
prior to the Closing Date and such Preference Right is not waived; or



Page 28 of 54 (ii) an Asset is subject to a Transfer Requirement that provides that transfer
of such Asset without compliance with such Transfer Requirement will result in
termination or other material impairment of any rights in relation to such
Asset, and such Transfer Requirement is not waived, complied with or otherwise
satisfied prior to the Closing Date,

then, unless otherwise mutually agreed by Seller and Purchaser, the Asset or
portion thereof affected by such Preference Right or Transfer Requirement (a
"Retained Asset") shall be held back from the Assets to be transferred and
conveyed to Purchaser at Closing and the Purchase Price to be paid at Closing
shall be reduced by the portion of the Purchase Price which is allocated to
such Retained Asset pursuant to Section 6.6(b). Any Retained Asset so held
back at the initial Closing will be conveyed to Purchaser at a delayed Closing
(which shall become the new Closing Date with respect to such Retained Asset),
within ten (10) days following the date on which Seller complies with, obtains
a waiver of or notice of election not to exercise or otherwise satisfies, all
remaining Preference Rights and Transfer Requirements with respect to such
Retained Asset as contemplated by this Section. At the delayed Closing,
Purchaser shall pay Seller a purchase price equal to the amount by which the
Purchase Price was reduced on account of the holding back of such Retained
Asset (as adjusted pursuant to Section 2.2 through the new Closing Date
therefor).

(e) Purchaser acknowledges that Seller desires to sell all of the Assets and
would not have entered into this Agreement but for Purchaser's agreement to
purchase all of the Assets as herein provided. Accordingly, it is expressly
understood and agreed that Seller does not desire to sell any Preference
Property unless the sale of all of the Assets is consummated by the Closing
Date in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. In furtherance of the
foregoing, Seller's obligation hereunder to sell the Preference Properties to
Purchaser is expressly conditioned upon the consummation by the Closing Date
of the sale of all of the Assets in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, either by conveyance to Purchaser or conveyance pursuant to an
applicable Preference Right; provided that, nothing herein is intended or
shall operate to extend or apply any Preference Right to any portion of the
Assets which is not otherwise burdened thereby. Time is of the essence with
respect to the parties' agreement to consummate the sale of the Assets by the
Closing Date (or by the delayed Closing Date pursuant to Section 6.6(d)).

Section 6.7 Tax Matters.

(a) Subject to the provisions of Section 11.3, Seller shall be responsible for
all Taxes related to the Assets (other than ad valorem, property, severance,
Hydrocarbon production and similar Taxes based upon or measured by the
ownership or operation of the Assets or the production of Hydrocarbons
therefrom, which are addressed in Section 1.4 and below) attributable to any
period of time at or prior to the Closing Date, and Purchaser shall be
responsible for all such Taxes related to the Assets attributable to any
period of time after the Closing Date. Regardless of which party is
responsible, Seller shall handle payment to the appropriate Governmental Body
of all Taxes with respect to the Assets which are required to be paid prior to
Closing (and shall file all Tax Returns with respect to such Taxes). Ad
valorem, real property, personal property, severance, production, and similar
Taxes attributable to the Properties ("Property Taxes") shall be prorated as
of the Effective Time (as determined pursuant to the following sentences),
with the portion of Property Taxes attributable to the period ending
immediately prior to the Effective Time being allocated to Seller, and the
portion of Property Taxes attributable to the period beginning at the
Effective Time being allocated to Purchaser. The Parties understand and agree
that Property Taxes based on production during a calendar year, including any
severance Taxes, shall be prorated based upon production before and at and
after the Effective Time. Thus, for example, tax year



Page 29 of 54 2013 taxes (as based on 2012 production) are solely the responsibility of
Seller under this Section, and tax year 2014 taxes (based on 2013 production)
shall be prorated based upon production before the Effective Time (which shall
be the responsibility of Seller) and at and after the Effective Time (which
shall be the responsibility of Purchaser). Seller shall file Tax Returns for
tax year 2013 Property Taxes. The Parties further acknowledge that, absent the
transfer of the Properties by Seller to Purchaser pursuant to the terms
hereof, Seller would be permitted to recoup in the normal course of business a
portion of Property Taxes based on production from the Properties that is
attributable to interest owners on whose behalf Seller paid such Property
Taxes, and that after such transfer Seller may be unable to exercise, or
otherwise enforce, its rights with respect to such recoupment. Purchaser
agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to recoup any such Property
Taxes and shall cooperate with Seller, to the extent reasonably requested by
Seller, in the recoupment of any such Property Taxes. All other Property Taxes
(i.e., Property Taxes not based on production) shall be prorated based upon
the percentage of the assessment period occurring before and after the
Effective Time. Seller shall deliver to Purchaser within thirty (30) days of
filing copies of all Tax Returns filed by Seller after the Closing Date
relating to the Assets and any supporting documentation provided by Seller to
taxing authorities, excluding Tax Returns related to income tax, franchise
tax, or other similar Taxes.

(b) Purchaser agrees to cooperate (at no cost or liability to Purchaser) with
Seller so that Seller's transfer of the Assets to Purchaser shall, at Seller's
election, be accomplished in a manner enabling the transfer to qualify as a
part of a like-kind exchange of property by Seller within the meaning of
Section 1031 of the Code. If Seller so elects, Purchaser shall reasonably
cooperate with Seller to effect such like-kind exchange, which cooperation
shall include, without limitation, taking such actions as Seller reasonably
requests in order to pay the Purchase Price in a manner which enables such
transfer to qualify as part of a like-kind exchange of property within the
meaning of Section 1031 of the Code, and Purchaser agrees that Seller may
assign its rights (but not its obligations) under this Agreement to a
qualified intermediary as defined in Treasury Regulations Section 1.1031(k) -
1(g)(4)(iii) under United States Treasury Regulations, to qualify the transfer
of the Assets as a part of a like-kind exchange of property within the meaning
of Section 1031 of the Code.

Section 6.8 NORM, Wastes and Other Substances.

Purchaser acknowledges that the Assets have been used for exploration,
development, and production Hydrocarbons and that there may be petroleum,
produced water, wastes, or other substances or materials located in, on or
under the Properties or associated with the Assets. equipment and sites
included in the Assets may contain asbestos, hazardous substances, or NORM.
NORM may affix or attach itself to the inside of wells, materials, and
equipment as scale, or in other forms. The wells, materials, and equipment
located on the Properties or included in the Assets may contain NORM and other
wastes or hazardous substances. NORM containing material and/or other wastes
or hazardous substances may have come in contact with various environmental
media, including without limitation, water, soils or sediment. Special
procedures may be required for the assessment, remediation, removal,
transportation, or disposal of environmental media, wastes, asbestos,
hazardous substances, and NORM from the Assets.

Section 6.9 Further Assurances.

After Closing, Seller and Purchaser each agrees to take such further actions
and to execute, acknowledge and deliver all such further documents as are
reasonably requested by the other



Page 30 of 54 party for carrying out the purposes of this Agreement or of any document
delivered pursuant to this Agreement.

Section 6.10 Parent Company Guaranty.

On or before Closing, Purchaser shall provide Seller with a Parent Company
Guaranty in a form substantially similar to that attached as Exhibit D
acceptable to Seller as to obligation and guarantor.

Section 6.11 Audit Rights.

Purchaser, at Purchaser's expense, may engage an auditing firm to conduct an
audit of the revenues and expenses of Seller attributable to the Assets for
the period of up to three (3) calendar years prior to the Effective Time
through the Closing Date. Seller agrees, from the date of this Agreement until
one hundred eighty (180) days after Closing, that Seller will cooperate and
assist such auditors, including making available (at Purchaser's sole cost and
expense) books, records and personnel of Seller reasonably requested by such
auditing firm; provided, however, that in no event shall Seller or its
Affiliates be required to provide any representation letters to any Person as
a result of its obligations under this Section 6.11; and provided further,
however, that nothing in this Section 6.11 shall require any such cooperation
or assistance on the part of Seller to the extent it would interfere
unreasonably with the business or operations of Seller.

Section 6.12 Litigation.

Purchaser acknowledges that certain of the Assets are subject to the outcome
of the litigation disclosed on Schedule 4.7 and that, inter alia, the proceeds
of production from, and the interests of Sellers in, the Properties that are
subject of such litigation may be reduced.

(d) The Accounting Expert shall be KPMG LLP (the "Accounting Expert").

(e) In the event the Accounting Expert named in Section 8.4(d) is unavailable

alternate Person to serve as the Accounting Expert within ten (10) Business
Days after receiving notice that the initial Accounting Expert is unavailable
or unwilling to serve. If the Parties cannot so agree, then the Parties shall
request that the CPR select an Accounting Expert who the Parties acknowledge
and agree is a neutral accountant that does not represent and has not recently
represented either Party and who has at least 10 years of experience in oil
and gas acquisition and divestiture accounting.

(f) Within ten (10) Business Days after the selection of the Accounting

(h) The Accounting Expert shall make its determination and provide to the
Parties written findings within 30 days after it has received the materials
under Section 8.4 (f). The decision of the Accounting Expert shall be final,
binding on the Parties and non-appealable and shall be limited to awarding
only the final proposal of one Party or the other Party with respect to each
disputed amount (as exchanged by the Parties under Section 8.4(c). The
Accounting Expert shall make a separate determination with respect to each
disputed amount submitted and shall provide a detailed written finding
supporting such determination in accordance with Section 8.4(j).

(i) Each Party shall each bear its own legal fees and other costs of preparing
and presenting its case. Seller shall bear one-half and Purchaser shall bear

Expert's finding as to each disputed amount, including the Accounting Expert's
rationale for the award.

(k) The Accounting Expert shall act as an expert for the limited purpose of
determining the specific matters disputed and shall not act as an arbitrator
and may not award damages, interest or penalties to either Party with respect
to any matter. The Parties intend that the procedures set forth in this

rules of evidence and may consider any documentation it determines is relevant
and credible.

Purchaser shall be by electronic transfer of immediately available funds to a

ARTICLE 9 
TERMINATION



Section 9.1 Termination.

Unless terminated earlier pursuant to other provisions provided herein, this
Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to Closing: (i) by the mutual
prior written consent of Seller and Purchaser; (ii) by Seller if the
conditions in Section 7.1 are not satisfied on the Closing Date; (iii) by
Purchaser if the conditions in Section 7.2 are not satisfied on the Closing
Date; or (iv) by Seller



Page 35 of 54 or Purchaser, if Closing has not occurred on or before February 17, 2014. A
Party shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section
9.1 if it is then in breach of this Agreement.

Section 9.2 Effect of Termination.

If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 9.1, this Agreement shall
become void and of no further force or effect (except for the provisions of
Sections 4.6, 5.5, 6.4, 9.3, 10.4(b)(vi), 10.8, 10.9, 11.6, 11.12 and 11.15 of
this Agreement all of which shall continue in full force and effect) and
Seller shall be free immediately to enjoy all rights of ownership of the
Assets and to sell, transfer, encumber or otherwise dispose of the Assets to
any party without any restriction under this Agreement. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, except as provided in Section 9.3,
the termination of this Agreement under Section 9.1(i) or 9.1(ii) shall not
relieve any party from liability for any willful or negligent failure to
perform or observe in any material respect any of its agreements or covenants
contained herein which are to be performed or observed at or prior to Closing.
In the event this Agreement terminates under Section 9.1(i) or 9.1(ii) because
a Party has willfully or negligently failed to perform or observe in any
material respect any of its agreements or covenants contained herein which are
to be performed at or prior to Closing, then the other Party shall be entitled
to all remedies available at law or in equity and shall be entitled to recover
court costs and attorneys' fees in addition to any other relief to which such
Party may be entitled, except as provided in Section 9.3.

Section 9.3 Distribution of Deposit Upon Termination.

(a) If Seller terminates this Agreement (i) because Purchaser wrongfully fails
to tender performance at Closing; or (ii) as the result of any default or
breach by Purchaser of Purchaser\'s obligations hereunder, and Seller is ready
to tender performance at Closing and is not in default or breach of this
Agreement, then Seller may retain the Deposit plus accrued interest as
liquidated damages, free of any claims by Purchaser or any other Person with
respect thereto. Purchaser's failure to close shall not be considered wrongful
if Purchaser has validly terminated this Agreement under Section 9.1(iii) or
Section 9.1(iv) (provided in the case of termination pursuant to Section
9.1(iv) that Purchaser has not wrongfully failed to tender performance). The
remedy set forth herein shall be Seller's sole and exclusive remedy for
Purchaser's failure to close the transactions described in this Agreement and
Seller expressly waives any and all other remedies, legal and equitable, that
it otherwise may have had for Purchaser's failure to close. It is expressly
stipulated by the parties that the actual amount of damages resulting from
such a termination would be difficult if not impossible to determine
accurately because of the unique nature of this Agreement, the unique nature
of the Assets, the uncertainties of applicable commodity markets and
differences of opinion with respect to such matters, and that the liquidated
damages provided for herein are a reasonable estimate by the parties of such
damages.

(b) If this Agreement is terminated for any reason other than the reasons set
forth in Section 9.3(a), then Seller shall deliver the Deposit plus accrued
interest to Purchaser within five (5) Business Days following such
termination, free of any claims by Seller or any other Person with respect
thereto, and neither Party shall have any right or remedy against the other
Party as a result of such termination; provided, however, that the provisions
of Sections 4.6, 5.5, 6.4, 9.2, 10.4(b)(vi), 10.8, 10.9, 11.6, 11.12 and 11.15
of this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.

against same; and (b) all Property Costs for which Purchaser is responsible
under Section 1.4 shall be the sole obligation of Purchaser and Purchaser

interest audits and other audits of Property Costs (including Property Taxes)

liabilities of Seller to the extent that they are the continuing

Agreement.

(d) Additional Provisions.

It is the intention of the parties that this Article 10 shall govern the
allocation of risks and liabilities between Purchaser and Seller except to the
extent that it is expressly stated (whether elsewhere in this Article 10 or in
some other Article hereof) that the provisions of such other Article (or part
thereof) shall control over the terms of all or part of this Article 10.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, this
Section 10.4 contains the parties' exclusive remedy against each other with
respect to breaches of the representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements of the parties contained in Articles 4, 5 and Sections 6.1, 6.2,
6.3, 6.4 and 6.5 and the affirmations of such representations, warranties,

In connection with Purchaser Indemnitees' access to the Assets prior to
Closing, the parties acknowledge that such access may be subject to boarding
agreements, releases or other agreements required by Seller or the operator of
non-Seller Operated Properties. In the event of a conflict between the
provisions of such agreements and Section 10.4(b)(vi) of this Agreement,
Section 10.4(b)(vi) of this Agreement shall control.

Section 10.5 Indemnification Actions.

All claims for indemnification under Section 10.4 shall be asserted and
resolved as follows:

(a) For purposes of this Article 10, the term "Indemnifying Party" shall mean
the party or parties having an obligation to indemnify another party or
parties pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. The term "Indemnified Party"
shall mean the party or parties having the right to be indemnified by another
party or parties pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.

(b) To make a claim for indemnification ("Indemnity Claim") under Section
10.4, and/or any other Article (or part thereof) expressly stating that it
controls over the terms of this Article 10, an Indemnified Party shall notify
the Indemnifying Party in writing of its Indemnity Claim, including the
specific details of and specific basis under this Agreement for its Indemnity
Claim (the "Claim Notice"). The Indemnified Party shall provide its Claim
Notice promptly after the Indemnified Party has actual knowledge of the Claim
for which it seeks indemnification and shall enclose a copy of all papers (if
any) served with respect to the Claim; provided that the failure of



Page 40 of 54 any Indemnified Party to give notice of a Claim as provided in this Section
10.5 shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations under Section
10.4 except to the extent such failure results in insufficient time being
available to permit the Indemnifying Party to effectively defend against the
Claim or otherwise prejudices the Indemnifying Party's ability to defend
against the Claim. In the event that the Indemnity Claim is based upon an
inaccuracy or breach of a representation, warranty, covenant or agreement, the
Claim Notice shall specify the representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
which was inaccurate or breached.

(c) The Indemnifying Party shall have thirty (30) days from its receipt of the
Claim Notice to notify the Indemnified Party whether it admits or denies its
liability to defend the Indemnified Party against the relevant Claim at the
sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party. The Indemnified Party is
authorized, prior to and during such 30-day period, to file any motion, answer
or other pleading that it shall deem necessary or appropriate to protect its
interests or those of the Indemnifying Party and that is not prejudicial to
the Indemnifying Party.

(d) If the Indemnifying Party admits its liability to indemnify the
Indemnified Party, it shall have the right and obligation to diligently
defend, at its sole cost and expense, the Claim. The Indemnifying Party shall
have full control of such defense and proceedings, including any compromise or
settlement thereof. If requested by the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified
Party agrees to cooperate in contesting any Claim which the Indemnifying Party
elects to contest. The Indemnified Party may participate in, but not control,
any defense or settlement of any Claim controlled by the Indemnifying Party
pursuant to this Section 10.5(d). An Indemnifying Party shall not, without the
written consent of the Indemnified Party, (i) settle any Claim or consent to
the entry of any judgment with respect thereto which does not include an
unconditional written release of the Indemnified Party from all liability in
respect of such Claim, or (ii) settle any Claim or consent to the entry of any
judgment with respect thereto in any manner that may materially and adversely
affect the Indemnified Party (other than as a result of money damages covered
by the indemnity). For avoidance of doubt, the provisions of this paragraph
(d) shall apply to indemnification for the proceedings in Doyle Hartman, et.
al., Plaintiffs v. Lance Oil and Company, et. al. and any related cases.

(e) If the Indemnifying Party does not admit its liability to indemnify the
Indemnified Party or admits its liability but fails to diligently prosecute or
settle the Claim, then the Indemnified Party shall have the right to defend
against the Claim at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party, with
counsel of the Indemnified Party's choosing, subject to the right of the
Indemnifying Party to admit its liability and assume the defense of the Claim
at any time prior to settlement or final determination thereof. If the
Indemnifying Party has not yet admitted its liability for a Claim, the
Indemnified Party shall send written notice to the Indemnifying Party of any
proposed settlement and the Indemnifying Party shall have the option for ten
(10) Business Days following receipt of such notice to (i) admit in writing
its liability to indemnify the Indemnified Party from and against the Claim
and (ii) if liability is so admitted, reject, in its reasonable judgment, the
proposed settlement.

Section 10.6 Release.

(a) EFFECTIVE WITH CLOSING, PURCHASER RELEASES, REMISES AND FOREVER DISCHARGES
SELLER INDEMNITEES FROM ANY AND ALL CLAIMS, KNOWN OR UNKNOWN, WHETHER NOW
EXISTING OR ARISING IN THE FUTURE, CONTINGENT OR OTHERWISE, WHICH PURCHASER

agreements shall be of no further force and effect after the date of their
expiration, provided that there shall be no termination of any bona fide Claim
asserted pursuant to this Agreement with respect to the breach of such a
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on or before its expiration
date.

indemnification, except in each case as to Claims asserted pursuant to this
Agreement with respect to the breach of such representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement on or before such termination date. Purchaser's

Section 10.9 Waiver of Deceptive Trade Practices Act.

(a) It is the intention of the parties that Purchaser\'s rights and remedies
with respect to this transaction and with respect to all acts or practices of
Seller, past, present or future, in connection with this transaction shall be
governed by legal principles other than the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices -
Consumer Protection Act, Tex. Bus. and Com. Code Ann. Â§17.41 et seq. (the

bargaining position with Seller.

Purchaser is a party capable of making such investigation, inspection, review

Assets, their value, operation and suitability. Each of Seller and Purchaser
has had substantial input into the drafting and preparation of this Agreement
and has had the opportunity to exercise business discretion in relation to the
negotiation of the details of the transactions contemplated hereby. This

strongly for nor against either party.

Notwithstanding any other provision contained elsewhere in this Agreement to

contemplated hereby is not affected in a materially adverse manner with
respect to either party.
