AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

  



  

THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this " _Agreement_ ") is made and entered
into as of July 30, 2019, by and between Simmons First National Corporation
(" _Simmons_ "), an Arkansas corporation, and The Landrum Company (" _Landrum_
"), a Missouri corporation.

  



  

Preamble

  



  

The respective boards of directors of Landrum and Simmons have approved this
Agreement and declared that this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby are advisable and in the best interests of the Parties
and their respective shareholders. Under the terms and subject to the
conditions of this Agreement and in accordance with the Arkansas Business
Corporation Act of 1987 (the " _ABCA_ ") and The General and Business
Corporation Law of Missouri (the " _GBCL_ "), Landrum will merge with and into
Simmons (the " _Merger_ "), with Simmons as the surviving corporation in the
Merger (sometimes referred to in such capacity as the " _Surviving
Corporation_ ").

  



  

As an inducement for Simmons to enter into this Agreement, each of the
directors and certain executive officers of Landrum have simultaneously
with the execution of this Agreement entered into a Voting Agreement (each a
" _Voting Agreement_ " and collectively, the " _Voting Agreements_ ") in
connection with the Merger, in the form of _Exhibit A_ hereto. The
transactions described in this Agreement are subject to the approvals of the
shareholders of Landrum and applicable regulatory authorities and the
satisfaction of certain other conditions described in this Agreement.

  



  

The Parties intend that the Merger will qualify as a "reorganization" within
the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, and the Parties
intend that this Agreement will be adopted as a "plan of reorganization"
within the meaning of Section 361(a) of the Internal Revenue Code.

  



  

The Parties desire to make certain representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe
certain conditions to the Merger.

  



  

Capitalized terms used in this Agreement and not otherwise defined herein are
defined in Section 10.1 of this Agreement.

  



  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the above and the mutual warranties,
representations, covenants, and agreements set forth herein, the
Parties agree as follows:

and Section 351.410 _et. seq._ of the GBCL with the effects set forth in the
ABCA and the GBCL. Simmons shall be the Surviving Corporation resulting from

Merger the separate corporate existence of Landrum shall terminate.

be filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Missouri. Subject to the
terms and conditions hereof, unless otherwise mutually agreed upon in writing
by the authorized officers of each Party, the Parties shall cause the
Effective Time to occur on a date within 30 days following satisfaction
or waiver (subject to applicable Law) of the last to occur of the conditions
set forth in ARTICLE 8 (other than those conditions that by their nature are
to be satisfied or waived at the Effective Time) as determined by Simmons.

  



  

1.4.  Charter.

immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the articles of incorporation
of the Surviving Corporation until duly amended or repealed.

ARTICLE 2 
 MANNER OF CONVERTING SHARES

  



  

2.1.  Conversion of Shares.

  



  

Subject to the provisions of this ARTICLE 2, at the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of Simmons, Landrum or
the shareholders of either of the foregoing, the shares of Landrum and
Simmons shall be converted as follows:

  



  

(a)  Each share of capital stock of Simmons issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain issued and
outstanding from and after the Effective Time.

  



  

(b)  Each share of issued Landrum Capital Stock that,
immediately prior to the Effective Time, is held by Landrum, any
Landrum Subsidiary, by Simmons or any Simmons Subsidiary (in each case other
than shares held in any Employee Benefit Plans or related trust accounts or
otherwise held in any fiduciary or agency capacity or as a result of debts
previously contracted) (collectively, the " _Canceled Shares_ ") shall
automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no
payment shall be made with respect thereto.

  



   

5

 



    

  

(c)  Each share of Landrum Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (excluding the Canceled Shares and
the Landrum Dissenting Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive,
without interest, the Stock Consideration.

  



  

(d)  Each share of Landrum Common Stock, when so converted
pursuant to Section 2.1(c) shall automatically be canceled and retired and
shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate (a " _Certificate_ ")
or book-entry share (a " _Book-Entry Share_ ") registered in the transfer
books of Landrum that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
shares of Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock shall cease to have
any rights with respect to such Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock
other than the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with
ARTICLE 3.

  



  

2.2.  Anti-Dilution Provisions.

  



  

In the event Simmons changes the number of shares of Simmons Common Stock
issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a result of a
stock split, stock dividend, or similar recapitalization with respect to such
stock and the record date therefor (in the case of a stock dividend) or the
effective date thereof (in the case of a stock split or similar
recapitalization for which a record date is not established) shall be prior
to the Effective Time, the Merger Consideration shall be equitably and
proportionately adjusted, if necessary and without duplication, to reflect
fully the effect of any such change.

  



  

2.3.  Treatment of Landrum ESOP and Combined Benefits Plan.

  



  

(a)  For the avoidance of doubt, at the Effective Time, each
share of Landrum Common Stock held in The Landrum Company Employee Stock
Ownership Plan (" _ESOP_ ") shall be converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 2.1(c). Without limiting
Section 7.8 hereof, Landrum shall, prior to the Closing and effective as of no
later than the day immediately prior to, and contingent upon, the Closing
(the " _ESOP Termination Date_ "), adopt such necessary resolutions and
amendments to the ESOP to provide (i) that no new participants shall be
admitted to the ESOP on or after the ESOP Termination Date, (ii) the ESOP
shall accept no further contributions except for contributions that have been
accrued prior to the ESOP Termination Date on behalf of participants in the
ESOP, (iii) for full vesting for all participants whose account balances had
not previously been distributed in full, and (iv) that the ESOP shall be
terminated as of the ESOP Termination Date. The form and substance of such
resolutions and amendments shall be subject to the prior review and approval
of Simmons, and Landrum shall deliver to Simmons an executed copy of such
resolutions and amendments as soon as practical following their adoption
and shall fully comply with such resolutions and amendments.

  



  

(b)  For the avoidance of doubt, at the Effective Time, each
share of Landrum Common Stock held in the Landrum Combined Benefits Plan ("
_CBP_ ") shall be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
in accordance with Section 2.1(c). Without limiting Section 7.8 hereof,
Landrum shall, prior to the Closing and effective as of no later than the date
immediately prior to, and contingent upon, the Closing (" _CBP Termination
Date_ ") adopt such necessary resolutions and amendments to the CBP to
provide the same as stated in subclauses (i) through (iv) above in Section
2.3(a) with regard to the ESOP. The form and substance of such resolutions
and amendments shall be subject to the prior review and approval of Simmons
and Landrum shall deliver to Simmons an executed copy of such resolutions and
amendments as soon as practical following their adoption and shall fully
comply with such resolutions and amendments.

2.4.  Fractional Shares.

  



  

No certificate, book-entry share or scrip representing fractional shares of
Simmons Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, no dividend or distribution of Simmons
shall be payable on or with respect to any such fractional share
interests, and such fractional share interests will not entitle the owner
thereof to vote or to any other rights of a shareholder of
Simmons. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder
of shares of Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock exchanged pursuant
to the Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of
a share of Simmons Common Stock (after taking into account all Certificates
or Book-Entry Shares delivered by such holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof,
a cash payment rounded up to the nearest cent (without interest), which
payment shall be determined by multiplying (i) the fraction of a share
(rounded to the nearest thousandth when expressed in decimal form) of Simmons
Common Stock that such holder of shares of Class A Common Stock or Class B
Common Stock would otherwise have been entitled to receive pursuant to Section
2.1(c) by (ii) the Average Closing Price (the " _Fractional Share Payment_
").

  



  

2.5.  Treatment of Series E Preferred Stock.

  



  

At the Effective Time, each share of Series E Preferred Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
the right to receive one share of series D preferred stock of Simmons ("
_Simmons Series D Preferred Stock_ "), which shall have such rights,
preference, privileges, and voting powers, and limitations and restrictions
thereof, which, taken as a whole, are not materially less favorable to the
holders of Series E Preferred Stock than the rights, preferences, privileges,
and voting powers, and limitations and restrictions thereof, of the Series E
Preferred Stock that are in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time,
taken as a whole. Each share of Series E Preferred Stock, when so converted,
shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and
retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder shall cease to have any
rights with respect to such Series E Preferred Stock other than the right to
receive the Simmons Series D Preferred Stock in accordance with this
Section 2.5.

  



  

ARTICLE 3 
 EXCHANGE OF SHARES

  



  

3.1.  Exchange Procedures.

  



  

(a)   _Deposit of Merger Consideration_. At or promptly
following the Effective Time, Simmons shall deposit, or shall cause to be
deposited, with Computershare, Simmons' transfer agent, or another exchange
agent reasonably acceptable to Simmons (provided that Simmons shall consult
with Landrum regarding the selection of such other exchange agent) (the "
_Exchange Agent_ "), for the benefit of the holders of record of shares of
Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock (excluding the Canceled Shares)
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (collectively,
the " _Holders_ ") and the holders of record of shares of Series E Preferred
Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, for
exchange in accordance with this ARTICLE 3, (i) certificates or evidence of
Simmons Common Stock in book-entry form issuable pursuant to Section 2.1(c)
(collectively referred to as " _Simmons Certificates_ ") for shares of Simmons
Common Stock equal to the Aggregate Stock Consideration, (ii) immediately
available funds for (A) the aggregate Fractional Share Payments to the extent
then determinable and (B), after the Effective Time, if applicable, any
dividends or distributions which such Holders have the right to receive
pursuant to Section 3.1(d) (collectively, the " _Exchange Fund_ "), and (iii)
certificates or evidence of Simmons Series D Preferred Stock in book-entry
form issuable pursuant to Section 2.5. Simmons shall instruct the Exchange
Agent to timely pay the Merger Consideration and the Simmons Series D
Preferred Stock in accordance with this Agreement. The cash portion of the
Exchange Fund shall be invested by the Exchange Agent as directed by Simmons
or the Surviving Corporation. Interest and other income on the Exchange Fund
shall be the sole and exclusive property of Simmons and the Surviving
Corporation and shall be paid to Simmons or the Surviving Corporation, as
Simmons directs. No investment of the Exchange Fund shall relieve Simmons,
the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent from making the payments
required by this Agreement and following any losses from any such investment,
Simmons shall promptly provide additional funds to the Exchange Agent to the
extent necessary to satisfy Simmons' obligations hereunder for the benefit of
the Holders, which additional funds will be deemed to be part of the Exchange
Fund.

  



   

7

 



    

  

(b)   _Delivery of Merger Consideration_. As soon as reasonably
practicable after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each
Holder of a Certificate (and Book-Entry Share, if required by the Exchange
Agent or at the request of Simmons) notice advising such Holders of the
effectiveness of the Merger, including appropriate transmittal materials
specifying that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, if applicable, shall pass, only upon
proper delivery of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, if applicable, and
instructions for surrendering the Certificates, or Book-Entry Shares, if
applicable, to the Exchange Agent (such materials and instructions to include
customary provisions with respect to delivery of an "agent's message" with
respect to Book-Entry Shares). Upon proper surrender of a Certificate or Book-
Entry Shares for exchange and cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together
with the appropriate transmittal materials, duly completed and validly
executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents
as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the Holder of such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor the Merger Consideration with respect to the shares of Class A
Common Stock or Class B Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate
or Book-Entry Share and such Certificate or Book-Entry Share so surrendered
shall forthwith be canceled. No interest will be paid or accrued for the
benefit of Holders on the Merger Consideration payable upon the surrender of
the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. The Stock Consideration delivered to
each Holder shall be in non-certificated book-entry form.

  



  

(c)   _Share Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the share
transfer books of Landrum shall be closed, and thereafter there shall be no
further registration of transfers of shares of Landrum Common Stock or Series
E Preferred Stock. From and after the Effective Time, Holders who held shares
of Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock, as well as holders of Series
E Preferred Stock, immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to
have rights with respect to such shares, except as otherwise provided for
herein. Until surrendered for exchange in accordance with the provisions of
this Section 3.1, each Certificate or Book-Entry Share theretofore
representing shares of Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock (other
than the Canceled Shares) and each share of Series E Preferred Stock shall
from and after the Effective Time represent for all purposes only the right to
receive the consideration provided in ARTICLE 2 in exchange therefor,
subject, however, to Simmons' obligation to pay any dividends or make any
other distributions with a record date prior to the Effective Time which have
been declared or made by Landrum in respect of such shares of Class A Common
Stock, Class B Common Stock or Series E Preferred Stock in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement and which remain unpaid at the Effective Time. On or
after the Effective Time, any Certificates or Book-Entry Shares presented to
the Exchange Agent or the Surviving Corporation for any reason shall be
canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration with respect to the
shares of Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock formerly represented
thereby. On or after the Effective Time, each share of Series E Preferred
Stock presented to the Exchange Agent or the Surviving Corporation for any
reason shall be canceled and exchanged for Simmons Series D Preferred Stock.

  



  

(d)   _Dividends with Respect to Simmons Common Stock_. No
dividends or other distributions declared with respect to Simmons Common
Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the Holder
of any unsurrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Shares with respect to the
whole shares of Simmons Common Stock issuable with respect to such Certificate
or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with this Agreement until the surrender of
such Certificate or Book-Entry Share (or affidavit of loss in lieu
thereof) in accordance with this Agreement. Subject to applicable Laws,
following surrender of any such Certificate or Book-Entry Share (or affidavit
of loss and other documentation required by the Exchange Agent or Surviving
Corporation hereunder in lieu thereof) there shall be paid to the record
holder of the whole shares of Simmons Common Stock, if any, issued in exchange
therefor, without interest, (i) all dividends and other distributions payable
in respect of any such whole shares of Simmons Common Stock with a record
date after the Effective Time and a payment date on or prior to the date of
such surrender and not previously paid and (ii) at the appropriate payment
date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after
the Effective Time but prior to such surrender and with a payment date
subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such shares of Simmons
Common Stock.

  



   

8

 



    

  

(e)   _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the
Exchange Fund (including any interest and other income received with respect
thereto) which remains undistributed to the former Holders, and any shares of
Simmons Series D Preferred Stock which remain undistributed to the holders of
Series E Preferred Stock, on the first anniversary of the Effective Time shall
be delivered to Simmons; and any former Holders who have not theretofore
received any Merger Consideration, and any holders of Series E
Preferred Stock who have not theretofore received any Simmons Series D
Preferred Stock, to which they are entitled under this Agreement
shall thereafter look only to Simmons and the Surviving Corporation for
payment of their claims with respect thereto.

  



  

(f)   _No Liability_. If any Certificates or Preferred
Certificates shall not have been surrendered (or any Book-Entry Shares have
not been canceled) prior to five years after the Effective Time (or
immediately prior to such earlier date on which the Merger Consideration
would escheat to or become the property of any Regulatory Authority), any such
Merger Consideration in respect thereof shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, become the property of Simmons, free and clear of all claims
or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto or their successors,
assigns, or personal representatives. None of Simmons, Landrum, the
Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent, or any employee, officer,
director, agent or Affiliate of any of them, shall be liable to any Holder or
holder of Series E Preferred Stock in respect of any amount that would have
otherwise been payable in respect of any Certificate or Preferred Certificate
(or Book-Entry Shares) from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

  



  

(g)   _Withholding Rights_. Each and any of Simmons, the
Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent, as applicable, shall be entitled
to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration, Simmons Series D
Preferred Stock and any other amounts or property otherwise payable or
distributable to any Person pursuant to this Agreement, such amounts or
property (or portions thereof) as Simmons, the Surviving Corporation or the
Exchange Agent is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making
of such payment or distribution under the Internal Revenue Code, and the
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or any provision of applicable
Tax Law. Any amounts so deducted or withheld and remitted to the appropriate
Regulatory Authority by Simmons, the Surviving Corporation, or the Exchange
Agent, as applicable, shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made by Simmons, the Surviving Corporation, or the
Exchange Agent, as applicable.

  



  

(h)   _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate, or any
certificate representing shares of Series E Preferred Stock ("
_Preferred Certificate_ "), shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, then
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such

free and clear of all Liens, except (a) statutory Liens securing payments not
yet due, (b) Liens for real property Taxes not yet due and payable, (c)
easements, rights of way, and other similar encumbrances that do not

Landrum Financial Statements, free and clear of all Liens of any nature
whatsoever, except for Permitted Liens, and is in possession of the
properties purported to be owned or leased thereunder, as applicable. There

eminent domain proceedings against any real property that is owned or leased
by Landrum. The Landrum Entities own or lease all properties as are necessary
to their operations as now conducted and no Person has any option or right to
acquire or purchase any ownership interest in the owned real property or any
portion thereof.

  



  

(b)  Section 4.12(b) of Landrum's Disclosure Memorandum sets
forth a complete and correct list of all street addresses and fee owners of
all real property owned, leased or licensed by any Landrum Entity or otherwise
occupied by a Landrum Entity or used or held for use by any Landrum Entity

4.12(b) of Landrum's Disclosure Memorandum, there are no Persons in possession
of any portion of any of the Real Property owned or leased by any Landrum
Entity other than such Landrum Entity, and no Person other than a

Entity, as lessee, leases Real Property, are valid, binding and enforceable
in accordance with their respective terms and Landrum or such Landrum
Subsidiary has good and marketable leasehold interests to all Real Property
leased by them. There is not under any such lease any material existing
Default by any Landrum Entity or, to Landrum's Knowledge, any other party
thereto, or any event which with notice or lapse of time would constitute
such a material Default and all rent and other sums and charges due and
payable under such lease have been paid.

  



  

(d)  The Assets reflected in the most recent Landrum Financial
Statements which are owned or leased by the Landrum Entities, and in
combination with the Real Property, the Intellectual Property of any Landrum
Entity, and contractual benefits and burdens of the Landrum Entities,
constitute, as of the Closing Date, all of the Assets, rights and

Entity as it is currently conducted. Each Landrum Entity is the owner of or
has a license, with the right to sublicense, to any Intellectual Property sold
or licensed to a third party by such Landrum Entity in connection with such
Landrum Entity's business operations, and such Landrum Entity has the right
to convey by sale or license any Intellectual Property so conveyed. No Landrum

Landrum threatened, which challenge the rights of any Landrum Entity with
respect to Intellectual Property used, sold or licensed by such Landrum
Entity in the course of its business, nor has any Person claimed or alleged
any rights to such Intellectual Property. The conduct of the business of each
Landrum Entity and the use of any Intellectual Property by each Landrum Entity
does not infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate the Intellectual
Property rights of any other Person. No Person has asserted to Landrum in
writing that any Landrum Entity has infringed, misappropriated or otherwise
violated the Intellectual Property rights of such Person. The
validity, continuation and effectiveness of all licenses and other agreements
relating to Intellectual Property used by any Landrum Entity in the course of
its business and the current terms thereof will not be affected by the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the use of the "Landmark Bank"
and "The Landrum Company" trademarks will be transferred to Simmons in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and after the
Effective Time, no Person besides Simmons shall have right and title to the
"Landmark Bank" and "The Landrum Company" trademarks and trade names. All of
the Landrum Entities' right to the use of and title to the names "Landmark

businesses of the Landrum Entities as currently conducted and (ii) the
Systems are in good working condition to effectively perform all computing,
information technology and data processing operations necessary for the
operation of the respective businesses of the Landrum Entities. To
Landrum's Knowledge, no third party or Representative has gained unauthorized
access to any Systems owned or controlled by any Landrum Entity, and each
Landrum Entity has taken commercially reasonable steps and implemented
commercially reasonable safeguards to ensure that the Systems are secure from
unauthorized access and free from any disabling codes or instructions,
spyware, Trojan horses, worms, viruses or other software routines that permit
or cause unauthorized access to, or disruption, impairment, disablement, or
destruction of, software, data or other materials. Each Landrum Entity has
implemented backup and disaster recovery policies, procedures and systems
consistent with generally accepted industry standards and sufficient to
reasonably maintain the operation of the respective businesses of the Landrum
Entities in all material respects. Each Landrum Entity has implemented and
maintained commercially reasonable measures and procedures designed to
reasonably mitigate the risks of cybersecurity breaches and attacks.

  



  

(c)  Each Landrum Entity has (i) complied in all material
respects with all applicable Laws which govern the receipt,
collection, compilation, use, storage, processing, sharing, safeguarding,
security, disposal, destruction, disclosure, transmission or transfer of the

misuse of any such Personally Identifiable Information by any Landrum Entity
or any other Person.

Labor Relations Act or comparable state Law) or other violation of state or
federal labor Law or seeking to compel it or any other Landrum Entity to

Each current and former employee of the Landrum Entities who has contributed
to the creation or development of any Intellectual Property owned by any
Landrum Entity has executed a nondisclosure and assignment-of-rights agreement
for the benefit of the Landrum Entities vesting all rights in work product
created by the employee during the employee's employment or affiliation with

her employment with the applicable Landrum Entity as of the date hereof, and,
as of the date hereof, to Landrum's Knowledge, no Key Employee intends to
terminate his or her employment with Landrum before Closing.

  



  

(c)  Section 4.18(c) of Landrum's Disclosure Memorandum
contains a complete and accurate listing of the name and contact information
of each entity or individual (if not an employee or agent of a contracting
entity) who has provided personal services to any Landrum Entity as an
independent contractor, consultant, freelancer or other similar service
provider (collectively, " _Contractors_ ") during the prior two years. A copy
of each Contract relating to the services provided by any such Contractor to a
Landrum Entity has been made available to Simmons prior to the date hereof.
To Landrum's Knowledge, no Contractor used by the Landrum Entities is a party
to, or is otherwise bound by, any agreement or arrangement with any third
party, including any confidentiality or non-competition agreement, that in
any way adversely affects or restricts the performance of such Contractor's
duties for the Landrum Entities. Each Contractor ever retained by the Landrum
Entities who has contributed to the creation or development of any
Intellectual Property owned by any Landrum Entity has executed a
nondisclosure and assignment-of-rights agreement for the benefit of the
Landrum Entities and the Landrum Entities are the owner of all rights in and
to all Intellectual Property created by each Contractor in
performing services for the Landrum Entities vesting all rights in work
product created in the Landrum Entities. To Landrum's Knowledge, no current
Contractor used by the Landrum Entities intends to terminate his or her or its
relationship with any Landrum Entity. The Landrum Entities have no obligation
or liability with respect to any taxes (or the withholding thereof) in
connection with any Contractor nor has Landrum performed any act or engaged
in any activity that could result in Landrum being found to be a
joint employer of a Contractor under the National Labor Relations Act, the
Fair Labor Standards Act, any Occupational Safety and Health Administration
laws or regulations, any state worker's compensation laws, or any other law or
regulation. The Landrum Entities have properly classified, pursuant to the
Internal Revenue Code, the Fair Labor Standards Act and any other applicable
Law, all Contractors used by the Landrum Entities at any point. The
engagement of each Contractor of each Landrum Entity is terminable at will by
the relevant Landrum Entity without any penalty, liability or severance
obligation incurred by any Landrum Entity.

governing the employment of labor and the withholding of taxes, including but
not limited to, all contractual commitments and all such Laws relating to
wages, hours, affirmative action, collective bargaining,
discrimination, civil rights, disability accommodation, employee leave,
unemployment, worker classification, immigration, safety and health,
workers' compensation and the collection and payment of withholding or Social
Security taxes and similar taxes.

  



   

23

 



    

  

(f)  Since July 31, 2014, there have not been any wage and
hour claims or any discrimination, disability accommodation, or
other employment claims or charges by any employee of any Landrum Entity or
by any individual who has applied for employment with any Landrum Entity nor,
to Landrum's Knowledge, are there any such claims or charges currently
threatened by any employee or applicant of any Landrum Entity. To the
Knowledge of Landrum, there are no governmental investigations open with or
under consideration by the U.S. Department of Labor (" _DOL_ "), Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission, or any other federal or state governmental
body charged with administering or enforcing employment related Laws.

United States and are either United States citizens or are legally entitled
to work in the United States under the Immigration Reform and Control Act of
1986, as amended, other United States immigration Laws and the Laws related
to the employment of non-United States citizens applicable in the state in
which the employees are employed. Each individual who renders services to any
Landrum Entity has provided proof of employment eligibility and is properly
classified as having the status of an employee or independent contractor or
other non-employee status (including for purposes of taxation and Tax
reporting and under Landrum Benefit Plans).

  



  

(h)  Since July 31, 2014 none of the Landrum Entities has
implemented any plant closing or mass layoff, as defined under the WARN Act,
and no such actions are currently contemplated, planned or announced.

  



  

4.19.  Employee Benefit Plans.

  



  

(a)  Landrum has made available to Simmons prior to the
execution of this Agreement, true and correct copies of each Employee Benefit
Plan currently adopted, maintained by, sponsored in whole or in part by, or
contributed to by any Landrum Entity or ERISA Affiliate thereof for the
benefit of employees, retirees, dependents, spouses, directors, independent
contractors, or other beneficiaries or under which employees, retirees,
former employees, dependents, spouses, directors, independent contractors, or
other beneficiaries are eligible to participate or with respect to which
Landrum or any ERISA Affiliate has or may have any obligation or
Liability (collectively, the " _Landrum Benefit Plans_ "). For the avoidance
of doubt, the term "Landrum Benefit Plans" includes plans, programs,
policies, and arrangements sponsored or maintained by a third-party
professional employer organization in which the current or former employees,
retirees, dependents, spouses, directors, Contractors, or other beneficiaries
of a Landrum Entity or any of its affiliates are eligible to participate.
Section 4.19(a) of Landrum's Disclosure Memorandum has a complete and
accurate list of all Landrum Benefit Plans. No Landrum Benefit Plan is subject
to any Laws other than those of the United States or any state, county, or
municipality in the United States. Landrum has made available to Simmons prior
to the execution of this Agreement (i) for each Landrum Benefit Plan, the
plan document(s), as amended through the date of this Agreement, or a
written summary of any unwritten Landrum Benefit Plan, (ii) all trust
agreements or other funding arrangements for all Landrum Benefit Plans, (iii)
all determination letters, opinion letters, information letters or advisory
opinions issued by the IRS, the DOL or the Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation (" _PBGC_ ") regarding a Landrum Benefit Plan during this calendar
year or any of the preceding three calendar years, or the most recent such
letter or opinion if issued prior to the three preceding calendar years, (iv)
annual reports or returns, audited or unaudited financial statements,
actuarial or allocation reports, non-discrimination tests and valuations
prepared for any Landrum Benefit Plan for the current plan year and the
preceding three plan years, (v) the most recent summary plan descriptions and
any material modifications thereto for any Landrum Benefit Plan, (vi) any
correspondence with the DOL, IRS, PBGC, or any other governmental entity
regarding a Landrum Benefit Plan, (vii) any correspondence, memorandum or
calculations regarding errors corrected or to be corrected with respect to any
Landrum Benefit Plan under the IRS Employee Plans Compliance Resolution
System or the DOL Voluntary Fiduciary Correction Program, (viii) all actuarial
valuations of Landrum Benefit Plans, and (ix) any other material agreements
that insure or implement the Landrum Benefit Plans, including, with respect to
the ESOP, any agreement with the ESOP Trustees and/or the ESOP Financial
Advisor.

  



   

24

 



    

  

(b)  Each Landrum Benefit Plan is and has been maintained in
compliance with the terms of such Landrum Benefit Plan, and in
compliance with the applicable requirements of the Internal Revenue Code,
ERISA, and any other applicable Laws. No Landrum Benefit Plan is required to
be amended within the ninety-day period beginning on the Closing Date in order
to continue to comply with ERISA, the Internal Revenue Code, and other
applicable Law. Each Landrum Benefit Plan that is intended to be qualified
under Section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code is so qualified and has
received a favorable determination letter, or for a prototype or volume
submitter plan, opinion letter, from the IRS that is still in effect and
applies to the Landrum Benefit Plan and on which such Landrum Benefit Plan is
entitled to rely. Nothing has occurred and no circumstance exists that could
adversely affect the qualified status of such Landrum Benefit Plan. Within
the past three years, no Landrum Entity has taken any action to make a
material correction, or make a filing under any voluntary correction program
of the IRS, DOL or any other Regulatory Authority, with respect to any
Landrum Benefit Plan. Other than shares of Landrum Common Stock held in the
ESOP and the CBP, all assets of each Landrum Benefit Plan that is a
retirement plan consist exclusively of cash and actively traded securities.

  



  

(c)  There is no loan outstanding between the ESOP and any
other Person. The ESOP has at all times been primarily invested in "employer
securities" as defined in Section 409(l) of the Internal Revenue Code, and has
never acquired or held any employer security that was not a "qualifying
employer security" as defined in Section 407(d)(5) of ERISA. Neither
Landrum nor any ERISA Affiliate of Landrum has been subject to any unpaid Tax
imposed by Sections 4978 and 4979A of the Internal Revenue Code. Any
transaction to which the ESOP was at any time a party involving the purchase,
sale or exchange of any security complied with the applicable requirements of
ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code, including Section 3(18) of ERISA. To
Landrum's Knowledge, the ESOP Trustees have complied in all material respects
with all of the responsibilities and duties imposed on the ESOP Trustees in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including but
not limited to the ESOP Trustees' fiduciary obligations under ERISA.

  



  

(d)  There are no threatened or pending claims or disputes
under the terms of, or in connection with, the Landrum Benefit Plans other
than claims for benefits in the Ordinary Course that are not expected to
result in material liability to any Landrum Entity, and no action,
proceeding, prosecution, inquiry, hearing, investigation or audit has been
commenced with respect to any Landrum Benefit Plan.

  



  

(e)  None of Landrum, the Affiliates of Landrum and the ESOP
Trustees has engaged in any prohibited transaction for which there is not an
exemption, within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Internal Revenue Code or
Section 406 of ERISA, with respect to any Landrum Benefit Plan and no
prohibited transaction has occurred with respect to any Landrum Benefit Plan
that would be reasonably expected to result in any liability or excise Tax
under ERISA or the Internal Revenue Code. No ESOP Trustee, Landrum Entity,
Landrum Entity employee, nor any committee of which any Landrum Entity
employee is a member has breached his or her fiduciary duty with respect to a
Landrum Benefit Plan in connection with any acts taken (or failed to be taken)
with respect to the administration or investment of the assets of any Landrum
Benefit Plan. To Landrum's Knowledge, no fiduciary, within the meaning of
Section 3(21) of ERISA, who is not an ESOP Trustee, a Landrum Entity or any
Landrum Entity employee, has breached his or her fiduciary duty with respect
to a Landrum Benefit Plan or otherwise has any liability in connection with
any acts taken (or failed to be taken) with respect to the administration or
investment of the assets of any Landrum Benefit Plan that would reasonably be
expected to result in any liability or excise Tax under ERISA or the Internal
Revenue Code being imposed on Landrum or any Affiliate of Landrum.

  



  

(f)  Neither Landrum nor any ERISA Affiliate has at any time
been a party to or maintained, sponsored, contributed to or has been
obligated to contribute to, or had any liability with respect to, or would
reasonably be expected to have any such obligation to contribute to or
liability with respect to: (i) a plan subject to Title IV of ERISA, (ii) a
"multiemployer plan" (as defined in ERISA Section 3(37) and 4001(a)(3)),
(iii) a "multiple employer plan" (within the meaning of ERISA or the Internal
Revenue Code), (iv) any voluntary employees' beneficiary association (within
the meaning of Section 501(c)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code), (v) a
"multiple employer welfare arrangement" (within the meaning of Section 3(40)
of ERISA), (vi) any self-funded health or welfare benefit plan (" _Self-
Funded Health or Welfare Plan_ "), or (vii) an arrangement that is not either
exempt from, or in compliance with, Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code
or that provides for indemnification for or gross-up of any taxes thereunder.

  



   

25

 



    

  

(g)  Each Landrum Benefit Plan that is a health or welfare plan
has been amended and administered in accordance with the requirements of the
Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (" _PPACA_ "), and complies
with and is administered in accordance with all aspects of all applicable
laws, including the PPACA, COBRA, HIPAA, ERISA, and the Internal Revenue Code,
including all reporting requirements thereunder. The eligibility provisions
of each Landrum Benefit Plan that is a health or welfare plan is limited to
Landrum's common law employees and, as applicable, former employees (and
spouses and dependents thereof) and only those persons provided coverage are
described in the health or welfare plan as being eligible for coverage;
provided, however, that certain of the Landrum directors are participants in
the Landrum health and dental benefit plans. Each Self-Funded Health or
Welfare Plan does not have any covered claims incurred in plan years preceding
the current plan year which are unpaid. Each Self-Funded Health or Welfare
Plan has stop loss insurance policies in force for which all premium payments
have been made and are current, and which provides for run-out or tail
coverage for covered claims incurred prior to the end of the plan year or
the termination of the applicable Self-Funded Health or Welfare Plan, but not
submitted and paid prior to the end of such period, and such coverage extends
for such period of time as provided under the applicable Self-Funded Health or
Welfare Plan to submit claims for the period incurred under the applicable
Self-Funded Health or Welfare Plan (the " _Claims Period_ "). In the event
the stop loss policies currently in place do not provide for run-out or tail
coverage to the end of such Claims Period, the Landrum Entities will obtain
such coverage at the satisfaction of Simmons prior to the Closing Date.

  



  

(h)  Except as shown in Section 4.19(h) of Landrum's Disclosure
Memorandum (relating to survivor benefits relating to split-
dollar arrangements related to bank owned life insurance), no Landrum Entity
has any Liability or obligation to provide postretirement health, medical or
life insurance benefits to any Landrum Entity's employees or former employees,
officers, or directors, or any dependent or beneficiary thereof, except as
otherwise required under state or federal benefits continuation Laws and
for which the covered individual pays the full cost of coverage. No Tax under
Internal Revenue Code Sections 4980B or 5000 has been incurred with respect
to any Landrum Benefit Plan and no circumstance exists which could give rise
to such Tax.

  



  

(i)  All contributions required to be made to any Landrum
Benefit Plan by applicable Law or regulation or by any plan document or other
contractual undertaking, and all premiums due or payable with respect to
insurance policies funding any Landrum Benefit Plan, for any period through
the date hereof, have been timely made or paid in full or, to the extent not
required to be made or paid on or before the date hereof, have been fully
reflected on the books and records of Landrum.

  



  

(j)  Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will (either alone
or in conjunction with any other event) result in, cause the vesting (except
for vesting caused by the termination of any of the Landrum Benefit Plans),
exercisability or delivery of, or increase in the amount or value of, any
payment, right or other benefit to any employee, officer, director or other
service provider of any Landrum Entity, or result in any (a) requirement
to fund any benefits or set aside benefits in a trust (including a rabbi
trust), (b) limitation on the right of any Landrum Entity to amend, merge,
terminate or receive a reversion of assets from any Landrum Benefit Plan or
related trust, (c) except for benefits that may become payable under
executive employment agreements between Landrum and certain Key Employees
whose employment is terminated without cause or for good reason following or
in contemplation of the Closing, acceleration of the time of payment or
vesting of any such payment, right, compensation or benefit, or (d)
entitlement by any recipient of any payment or benefit to receive a
"gross up" payment for any income or other Taxes that might be owed with
respect to such payment or benefit. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, no amount paid or payable (whether in cash, in property, or in the
form of benefits) in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby
(either solely as a result thereof or as a result of such transactions in
conjunction with any other event) will be an "excess parachute payment"
within the meaning of Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code. Section
4.19(j) of Landrum's Disclosure Memorandum sets forth accurate and complete
data with respect to each individual who has a contractual right to severance
pay or benefits (or increase in severance pay or benefits, including the
acceleration of any payment or vesting) triggered by a change in control and
the amounts potentially payable to each such individual in connection with
the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby (either alone or in conjunction with any
other event) or as a result of a termination of employment or service, noting
any contractual provisions relating to Section 280G of the Internal Revenue
Code. No Landrum Benefit Plan provides for, and no Landrum Entity has any
obligation to provide, the gross-up or reimbursement of Taxes under Section
4999 or 409A of the Internal Revenue Code, or otherwise.

Disclosure Memorandum together with all Contracts referred to in Sections
4.13 and 4.19(a), are referred to herein as the " _Landrum Contracts_." With

premium.

4.21.  Agreements with Regulatory Authorities.

  



  

No Landrum Entity is subject to any cease-and-desist or other Order or
enforcement action issued by, or is a party to any written agreement,
consent decree, or memorandum of understanding with, or is a party to any

business or Landmark Bank's acceptance of brokered deposits (each, whether or
not set forth in Landrum's Disclosure Memorandum, a " _Landrum
Regulatory Agreement_ "), nor has any Landrum Entity been advised in writing
or, to Landrum's Knowledge, orally, since July 31, 2014, by any Regulatory
Authority that Landmark Bank is in troubled condition or that the Regulatory
Authority is considering issuing, initiating, ordering, or requesting any
such Landrum Regulatory Agreement.

  



  

4.22.  Investment Securities.

  



  

(a)  Each Landrum Entity has good title in all material
respects to all securities and commodities owned by it (except those sold
under repurchase agreements, pledged to secure deposits of public funds,
borrowings of federal funds or borrowings from the Federal Reserve Banks or
Federal Home Loan Banks or held in any fiduciary or agency capacity), free and
clear of any Lien, except to the extent such securities or commodities are

material respects.

  



   

28

2014, been in compliance with such policies, practices and procedures in all
material respects.

currencies, commodities, bonds, equity securities, loans, interest

Landrum, threatened against any Landrum Entity, or against any current or

Simmons with the SEC will, when supplied or when the Registration Statement
becomes effective (or when incorporated by reference), be false or misleading
with respect to any material fact, or omit to state any material fact
necessary to make the statements therein not misleading. The portions of the
Registration Statement and the Proxy Statement/Prospectus relating to the

29

Landrum Entity or any Affiliate thereof for inclusion (including by
incorporation by reference) in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, and any other
documents to be filed by a Landrum Entity or any Affiliate thereof with any
Regulatory Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby,

Proxy Statement/Prospectus, when first mailed to the shareholders of Landrum,
be false or misleading with respect to any material fact, or omit to state
any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or, in the case of
the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto,
at the time of Landrum's Shareholders' Meeting, be false or misleading with
respect to any material fact, or omit to state any material fact necessary to

4.26.  State Takeover Statutes and Takeover Provisions.

  



  

Landrum has taken all action required to be taken by it in order to exempt
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby from, and this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby are exempt from, the
requirements of any "moratorium," "fair price," "affiliate transaction,"
"business combination," "control share acquisition" or similar provision of
any state anti-takeover Law (collectively, " _Takeover Laws_ "). No Landrum
Entity is the beneficial owner (directly or indirectly) of more than 10% of
the outstanding capital stock of Simmons entitled to vote in the election of
Simmons' directors.

  



  

4.27.  Opinion of Financial Advisor.

  



  

Prior to the execution of this Agreement, the board of directors of Landrum
has received the opinion of Keefe Bruyette and Woods, Inc., which, if
initially rendered verbally has been or will be confirmed by a written
opinion dated the same date to the effect that, as of such date and based
upon the terms, conditions, and qualifications set forth therein, the Stock
Consideration to be paid to the holders of Landrum Common Stock in the Merger
is fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders. Such opinion has not
been amended or rescinded as of the date of this Agreement.

  



  

4.28.  Tax and Regulatory Matters.

  



  

No Landrum Entity or, to the Knowledge of Landrum, any Affiliate thereof has
taken or agreed to take any action, and Landrum does not have any
Knowledge of any agreement, plan or other circumstance, that is reasonably
likely to (a) prevent the Merger from qualifying as a "reorganization" within
the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code or (b) materially
impede or delay receipt of any of the Requisite Regulatory Approvals.

  



  

4.29.  Loan Matters.

  



  

(a)  No Landrum Entity is a party to any written or oral Loan
in which any Landrum Entity is a creditor which as of June 30, 2019, had an
outstanding balance of $50,000 or more and under the terms of which the
obligor was, as of June 30, 2019, over 90 days or more delinquent in payment
of principal or interest. Except as such disclosure may be limited by any
applicable Law, Section 4.29(a) of Landrum's Disclosure Memorandum sets forth
a true, correct and complete list of all of the Loans of the Landrum Entities
that, (A) as of June 30, 2019 had an outstanding balance of $50,000 or more
and were (1) on non-accrual status or (2) classified by Landrum as "Other
Loans Specially Mentioned," "Special Mention," "Substandard," "Doubtful,"
"Loss," "Classified," "Criticized," "Credit Risk Assets," "Concerned Loans,"
"Watch List" or words of similar import, together with the principal amount of
and accrued and unpaid interest on each such Loan and the aggregate principal
amount of and accrued and unpaid interest on such Loans as of such date, or
(B) with respect to which, at any point since December 31, 2014, constituted a
"Troubled Debt Restructuring," as defined in the Accounting Standards
Codification Subtopic 310-40.

  



   

30

 



    

  

(b)  Each Loan _currently outstanding_ (i) is evidenced by
notes, agreements or other evidences of indebtedness that are true, genuine
and what they purport to be, (ii) to the extent secured, has been secured by
valid Liens which have been perfected and (iii) is a legal, valid and binding
obligation of the obligor named therein, enforceable in accordance with its
terms (except as may be limited by the Bankruptcy and Equity Exceptions). The
notes or other credit or security documents with respect to each such
outstanding Loan were in compliance in all material respects with all
applicable Laws at the time of origination or purchase by a Landrum Entity
and are complete and correct in all material respects.

  



  

(c)  Each outstanding Loan (including Loans held for resale to
investors) was solicited and originated, and is and has been
administered and, where applicable, serviced, and the relevant Loan files are
being maintained, in all material respects in accordance with the relevant
notes or other credit or security documents, Landrum's written underwriting
standards (and, in the case of Loans held for resale to investors, the
underwriting standards, if any, of the applicable investors) and with all
applicable requirements of Laws.

  



  

(d)  None of the Contracts pursuant to which any Landrum Entity
has sold Loans or pools of Loans or participations in Loans or pools of Loans
(other than repurchase obligations arising in the Ordinary Course out of the
transfer of Loans to secondary market investors) contains any obligation to
repurchase such Loans or interests therein solely on account of a payment
default by the obligor on any such Loan. Except as would not be material to
the Landrum Entities, each Loan included in a pool of Loans
originated, securitized or, to the Knowledge of Landrum, acquired by any
Landrum Entity (a " _Pool_ ") meets all eligibility requirements (including
all applicable requirements for obtaining mortgage insurance certificates and
Loan guaranty certificates) for inclusion in such Pool. All such Pools have
been finally certified or, if required, recertified in accordance with all
applicable Laws, rules and regulations, except where the time for
certification or recertification has not yet expired. No Pools have
been improperly certified, and, except as would not be material to Landrum
and its Subsidiaries, no Loan has been bought out of a Pool without all
required approvals of the applicable investors.

  



  

(e)  (i) Section 4.29(e) of Landrum's Disclosure Memorandum
sets forth a list of all Loans as of the date hereof by Landrum to any
directors, executive officers and principal shareholders (as such terms are
defined in Regulation O) of any Landrum Entity, (ii) there are no employee,
officer, director, principal shareholder or other affiliate Loans on which the
borrower is paying a rate other than that reflected in the note or other
relevant credit or security agreement or on which the borrower is paying a
rate which was not in compliance with Regulation O and (iii) all such Loans
are and were originated in compliance in all material respects with all
applicable Laws.

  



  

(f)  No Landrum Entity is now nor has it ever been since July
31, 2014, subject to any material fine, suspension, settlement or other
Contract or other administrative agreement or sanction by, or any reduction in
any loan purchase commitment from, any Regulatory Authority relating to the
origination, sale or servicing of mortgage or consumer Loans.

  

   

31

 



    



  

4.30.  Deposits.

  



  

All of the deposits held by Landmark Bank (including the records and
documentation pertaining to such deposits) have been established and are
held in compliance in all respects with (a) all applicable policies,
practices and procedures of Landmark Bank and (b) all applicable Laws,
including Money Laundering Laws and anti-terrorism or embargoed persons
requirements. All of the deposits held by Landmark Bank are insured to the
maximum limit set by the FDIC, and the FDIC premium and all assessments have
been fully paid, and no proceedings for the termination or revocation of such
insurance are pending, or, to the Knowledge of Landrum, threatened.

  



  

4.31.  Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses.

  



  

The allowance for loan and lease losses (" _ALLL_ ") reflected in the Landrum
Financial Statements was, as of the date of each of the Landrum Financial
Statements, in compliance with Landrum's existing methodology for determining
the adequacy of its ALLL and in compliance in all material respects with the
standards established by the applicable Regulatory Authority, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board and GAAP, and is adequate.

  



  

4.32.  Insurance.

  



  

Landrum Entities are insured with reputable insurers against such risks and
in such amounts as the management of Landrum reasonably has determined to be
prudent and consistent with industry practice. Section 4.32 of Landrum's
Disclosure Memorandum contains a true, correct and complete list and a brief
description (including the name of the insurer, agent, coverage and the
expiration date) of all insurance policies in force on the date hereof with
respect to the business and Assets of the Landrum Entities, correct and
complete copies of which policies have been provided to Simmons prior to the
date hereof. The Landrum Entities are in material compliance with their
insurance policies and are not in Default under any of the material terms
thereof. Each such policy is outstanding and in full force and effect and,
except for policies insuring against potential liabilities of officers,
directors and employees of the Landrum Entities, Landrum or Landmark Bank is
the sole beneficiary of such policies. All premiums and other payments due
under any such policy have been paid, and all claims thereunder have been
filed in due and timely fashion. To Landrum's Knowledge, no Landrum Entity
has received any written notice of cancellation or non-renewal of any such
policies, nor, to Landrum's Knowledge, is the termination of any such
policies threatened.

  



  

4.33.  OFAC; Sanctions.

  



  

None of Landrum, any Landrum Entity or any director or officer or, to the
Knowledge of Landrum, any agent, employee, affiliate or other Person

42

7.1.  Registration Statement; Proxy Statement/Prospectus;
Shareholder Approvals.

  



  

(a)  Simmons and Landrum shall promptly prepare and file with
the SEC, a proxy statement/prospectus in definitive form (including any
amendments thereto, the " _Proxy Statement/Prospectus_ ") and Simmons shall
prepare and file with the SEC the Registration Statement (including the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus constituting a part thereof and all related documents) as
promptly as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement, subject
to full cooperation of both Parties and their respective advisors and
accountants. Simmons and Landrum agree to cooperate, and to cause their
respective Subsidiaries to cooperate, with the other Party and its counsel
and its accountants in the preparation of the Registration Statement and the
Proxy Statement/Prospectus. Each of Simmons and Landrum agrees to use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the Registration Statement to be declared
effective under the Securities Act as promptly as reasonably practicable
after filing thereof, and Landrum shall thereafter mail or deliver the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus to its shareholders promptly following the date of

reasonable best efforts to obtain all necessary state securities law or "Blue
Sky" permits and approvals required to carry out the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and Landrum shall furnish all
information concerning Landrum and the holders of Landrum Common Stock as may
be reasonably requested in connection with any such action.

  



   

43

 



    

  

(b)  Landrum shall duly call, give notice of, establish a
record date for, convene and hold a shareholders' meeting (" _Landrum
's Shareholders' Meeting_"), to be held as promptly as reasonably practicable
after the Registration Statement is declared effective by the SEC, for the
purpose of obtaining the Landrum Shareholder Approval and, if so desired and
mutually agreed, such other related matters as it deems appropriate. Landrum
agrees that its obligations pursuant to this Section 7.1(b) shall not
be affected by the commencement, proposal, disclosure or communication to
Landrum of any Acquisition Proposal. Landrum shall (i) through its board of
directors recommend to its shareholders the approval of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby (the " _Landrum Recommendation_ "), (ii)
include such Landrum Recommendation in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and
(iii) use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Landrum Shareholder
Approval. Neither the board of directors of Landrum nor any committee thereof

Simmons, the Landrum Recommendation, (B) fail to make the Landrum
Recommendation or otherwise submit this Agreement to Landrum's shareholders
without such recommendation, (C) adopt, approve, agree to, accept, recommend
or endorse an Acquisition Proposal, (D) fail to publicly and without
qualification (1) recommend against any Acquisition Proposal or (2) reaffirm
the Landrum Recommendation within ten Business Days (or such fewer number of
days as remains prior to Landrum's Shareholders' Meeting) after an Acquisition
Proposal is made public or any request by Simmons to do so, (E) take any
action, or make any public statement, filing or release inconsistent with the
Landrum Recommendation, or (F) publicly propose to do any of the foregoing
(any of the foregoing being a " _Change in the Landrum Recommendation_ "). If
requested by Simmons, Landrum shall retain a proxy solicitor reasonably
acceptable to, and on terms reasonably acceptable to, Simmons in connection
with obtaining the Landrum Shareholder Approval.

  



  

(c)  Landrum shall adjourn or postpone Landrum's Shareholders'
Meeting, if, as of the time for which such meeting is originally scheduled
there are insufficient shares of Class A Common Stock represented (either in
person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business
of such meeting. Landrum shall also adjourn or postpone Landrum's
Shareholders' Meeting, if on the date of Landrum's Shareholders' Meeting
Landrum has not recorded proxies representing a sufficient number of shares
necessary to obtain the Landrum Shareholder Approval. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary herein, Landrum's Shareholders' Meeting shall be convened and
this Agreement shall be submitted to the shareholders of Landrum at
Landrum's Shareholders' Meeting, for the purpose of voting on the approval of
this Agreement and the other matters contemplated hereby, and nothing
contained herein shall be deemed to relieve Landrum of such obligation.

  



  

(d)  Landrum shall deliver to Simmons the ESOP Fairness
Opinion, dated on or about the date hereof, prior to the vote of the ESOP.
Landrum shall cause the ESOP Trustees to conduct a vote of the Landrum Common
Stock held in the ESOP in accordance with the requirements of Section 409(e)
of the Internal Revenue Code and all other applicable laws, the terms of the
ESOP and their ERISA fiduciary duties.

  



   

44

 



    

  

7.2.  Acquisition Proposals.

  



  

(a)  No Landrum Entity shall, and it shall cause its respective
Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate,
encourage (including by providing information or assistance), facilitate or
induce any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) engage or participate in any
discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish or cause to be furnished to
any Person any information or data in connection with, or take any other
action to facilitate any inquiries or the making of any offer or proposal that
constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition
Proposal, (iii) adopt, approve, agree to, accept, endorse or recommend any
Acquisition Proposal, or (iv) approve, agree to, accept, endorse or recommend,
or propose to approve, agree to, accept, endorse or recommend any Acquisition
Agreement contemplating or otherwise relating to any Acquisition Transaction.
Without limiting the foregoing, it is agreed that any violation of the
restrictions set forth in this Section 7.2 by any Subsidiary or
Representative of Landrum shall constitute a breach of this Section 7.2 by
Landrum. In addition to the foregoing, Landrum shall not submit to the vote
of its shareholders any Acquisition Proposal other than the Merger.

  



  

(b)  Each Landrum Entity shall, and shall cause their
respective Representatives to, (i) immediately cease and cause to be
terminated all existing activities, discussions, conversations, negotiations
and other communications with any Person conducted heretofore with respect to
any offer or proposal that constitutes, or may reasonably be expect to lead
to, an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) request the prompt return or destruction of
all confidential information previously furnished to any Person (other than
the Simmons Entities and their Representatives) that has made or indicated an
intention to make an Acquisition Proposal, (iii) not waive any or amend any
"standstill" provision or provisions of similar effect to which it is a
beneficiary and shall strictly enforce any such provisions and (iv) enforce
any existing confidentiality agreements to which it is a party.

  



  

(c)   If any Landrum Entity or their respective Representatives
receives an Acquisition Proposal or any request for nonpublic information or
any inquiry that could reasonably be expected to lead to any Acquisition
Proposal, Landrum shall as promptly as practicable (but in no event more than
24 hours) notify Simmons in writing of the receipt of such Acquisition
Proposal, request or inquiry and the terms and conditions of such Acquisition
Proposal, request or inquiry (including, in each case, the identity of the
Person making any such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry), and Landrum
shall as promptly as practicable (but in no event more than 24 hours) provide
to Simmons (i) a copy of such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry, if in
writing, or (ii) a written summary of the material terms of such Acquisition
Proposal, request or inquiry, if oral. Landrum shall provide Simmons as
promptly as practicable (but in no event more than 24 hours) with notice
setting forth all such information as is necessary to keep Simmons informed
on a current basis of all developments, discussions, negotiations and
communications regarding (including amendments or proposed amendments to)
such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry. If Landrum determines (after
consultation with outside legal counsel) that any term or condition of an
Acquisition Proposal is unclear, Landrum may request (but only
through written communication) clarification regarding such term or
condition; provided, however, that copies of all such communications and
responses thereto shall be provided to Simmons as promptly as practicable (but
in no event more than 24 hours).

  



  

(d)  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, the other provisions of this
Section 7.2), at any time prior to Landrum's Shareholders' Meeting, the board
of directors of Landrum may submit this Agreement to Landrum's shareholders
without recommendation (although the resolution approving this Agreement as of
the date hereof may not be rescinded or amended) if (i) Landrum has received
a Superior Proposal (after giving effect to the terms of any revised offer by
Simmons pursuant to this Section 7.2(d)), and (ii) the board of directors of
Landrum has determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside
legal counsel, that it would be a violation of the directors' fiduciary duties
under applicable Law to make or continue to make the Landrum Recommendation
in which event, the board of directors of Landrum may communicate the basis
for its lack of Landrum Recommendation; provided, that the board of directors
of Landrum may not take the actions set forth in this Section 7.2(d) unless:

  



   

45

 



    

  

(i)  Landrum has complied in all material respects with this
Section 7.2;

  



  

(ii)  Landrum has provided Simmons at least five Business Days
prior written notice of its intention to take such action and a reasonable
description of the events or circumstances giving rise to its determination to
take such action (including all necessary information under Section 7.2(c));

  



  

(iii)  during such five Business Day period, Landrum has and has
caused its financial advisors and outside legal counsel to, consider and
negotiate with Simmons in good faith (to the extent Simmons desires to so
negotiate) regarding any proposals, adjustments or modifications to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement proposed by Simmons; and

  



  

(iv)  the board of directors of Landrum has determined in good
faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and considering the
results of such negotiations and giving effect to any proposals, amendments or
modifications proposed to by Simmons, if any, that such Superior Proposal
remains a Superior Proposal and that it would nevertheless be a violation of
the director's fiduciary duties under applicable Law to make or continue to
make the Landrum Recommendation.

  



  

Any material amendment to any Acquisition Proposal, will be deemed to be a
new Acquisition Proposal for purposes of this Section 7.2(d) and will require
a new determination and notice period as referred to in this Section 7.2(d). 

  



  

(e)  Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent Landrum
or its board of directors from complying with applicable provisions of the
Exchange Act, including the SEC's Regulation 14E thereunder, with respect to
an Acquisition Proposal or from making any disclosure to the shareholders of
Landrum if the board of directors of Landrum (after consultation with outside
legal counsel) concludes that its failure to do so would be a violation of
the directors' fiduciary duties under applicable Law; provided that any
actions taken to comply with such rules will in no way eliminate or modify the
effect that any such action would otherwise have under this Agreement.

  



  

7.3.  Exchange Listing.

  



  

Simmons shall use its reasonable best efforts to list, prior to the Effective
Time, on Nasdaq, subject to official notice of issuance, the shares
of Simmons Common Stock to be issued to the holders of Landrum Common Stock
pursuant to this Agreement, and Simmons shall give all notices and make all
filings with Nasdaq required in connection with the transactions contemplated
herein.

  



  

7.4.  Consents of Regulatory Authorities.

  



  

(a)  Simmons and Landrum and their respective Subsidiaries
shall cooperate with each other and use their respective reasonable best
efforts to prepare all documentation, to effect all applications, notices,
petitions and filings and to obtain all Permits and Consents of all third
parties and Regulatory Authorities which are necessary or advisable to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the
Merger), and to comply with the terms and conditions of all such Permits and
Consents. Each of Landrum and Simmons shall use its respective reasonable
best efforts to resolve objections, if any, which may be asserted
with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby by any
Regulatory Authority or under any applicable Law or Order; provided, that in
no event shall any Simmons Entities be required, and the Landrum Entities
shall not be permitted (without Simmons' prior written consent in its sole
discretion) to take any action, or to commit to take any action, or to accept
any restriction or condition, involving the Landrum Entities or the Simmons
Entities, which is materially burdensome on Simmons' business or on the
business of Landrum or Landmark Bank, in each case following the Closing or
which would likely reduce the economic benefits of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement to Simmons to such a degree that Simmons would
not have entered into this Agreement had such condition or restriction been
known to it at the date hereof (any such condition or restriction, a "
_Burdensome Condition_ ").

  



   

46

 



    

  

(b)  Each of Simmons and Landrum shall have the right to review
in advance, and to the extent practicable each will consult with the other,
in each case subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of
information, with respect to, all material written information submitted to
any third party or Regulatory Authority in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, provided, that Landrum shall not have the
right to review portions of material filed by Simmons with a Regulatory
Authority that contain competitively sensitive business or other proprietary
information or confidential supervisory information filed under a claim of
confidentiality. In exercising the foregoing rights, each of the Parties
agrees to act reasonably and as promptly as practicable. Each Party agrees
that it will consult with the other Party with respect to the obtaining of all
Permits and Consents of third parties and Regulatory Authorities necessary or
advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
each Party will keep the other Party apprised of the status of material
matters relating to completion of the transactions contemplated hereby,
including advising the other Party upon receiving any communication from a
Regulatory Authority the Consent of which is required for the consummation of
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement that
causes such Party to believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that any
Requisite Regulatory Approval will not be obtained or that the receipt of
such Requisite Regulatory Approval may be materially delayed. Each Party shall
consult with the other in advance of any meeting or conference with any
Regulatory Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and, to the extent permitted by such Regulatory Authority, give the
other Party and/or its counsel the opportunity to attend and participate in
such meetings and conferences.

  



  

(c)  Each Party agrees, upon request, subject to applicable
Laws, to promptly furnish the other Party with all information
concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and shareholders and
such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection
with the Registration Statement, Proxy Statement/Prospectus or any other
statement, filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of Simmons,
Landrum or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any third party and/or
Regulatory Authority in connection with the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

7.5.  Investigation and Confidentiality.

  



  

(a)  Landrum shall promptly notify Simmons of any material
change in the normal course of its business or in the operation of its
properties and, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, of any material
governmental complaints, investigations or hearings (or communications
indicating that the same may be contemplated), or the institution or the
threat of a material claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation
involving Landrum or Landmark Bank.

  



  

(b)  Landrum shall promptly advise Simmons of any fact, change,
event, effect, condition, occurrence, development or circumstance known to
Landrum (i) that has had or would reasonably be expected to have, either
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Landrum or
(ii) which Landrum believes would or would be reasonably likely to cause or
constitute a material breach of any of its representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements contained herein or that reasonably could be
expected to give rise, individually or in the aggregate, to the failure of a
condition in ARTICLE 8; provided, that any failure to give notice in
accordance with the foregoing with respect to any breach shall not be deemed
to constitute a violation of this Section 7.5(b) or the failure of any
condition set forth in Section 8.2 to be satisfied, or otherwise constitute a
breach of this Agreement by the Party failing to give such notice, in each
case unless the underlying breach would independently result in a failure
of the conditions set forth in Section 8.2 to be satisfied; and provided,
further, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 7.5(b)
shall not cure any breach of, or noncompliance with, any other provision of
this Agreement or limit the remedies available to Simmons.

  



   

47

 



    

  

(c)  Prior to the Effective Time, Landrum shall permit the
Representatives of Simmons to make or cause to be made such investigation of
the business, Assets, information technology systems, Contracts, Books and
Records, and personnel and such other information of it and its Subsidiaries
and of their respective financial and legal conditions as Simmons reasonably
requests and furnish to Simmons promptly all other information concerning its
business, Assets, information technology systems, Contracts, Books and
Records, and personnel and such other information as Simmons may reasonably
request, provided that such investigation or requests shall not interfere
unnecessarily with normal operations. No investigation by Simmons shall affect
or be deemed to modify or waive the representations, warranties, covenants
and agreements of Landrum in this Agreement, or the conditions of such Party's
obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Neither Simmons nor Landrum nor any of their respective Subsidiaries shall be
required to provide access to or to disclose information where such access or
disclosure would violate or prejudice the rights of Simmons' or Landrum's, as
the case may be, customers, jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of the
institution in possession or control of such information (after giving due
consideration to the existence of any common interest, joint defense or
similar agreement between the Parties) or contravene any Law, fiduciary duty
or binding Contract entered into prior to the date of this Agreement. The
Parties will make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under
circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply.

  



  

(d)  Each Party shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and
Representatives to, hold any information obtained in connection with this
Agreement and in pursuit of the transactions contemplated hereby in accordance
with the terms of the confidentiality agreement, dated March 22, 2019,
between Simmons and Landrum (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ").

  



  

(e)  From the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the
Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement, Landrum shall, and shall
cause Landmark Bank also to, provide Simmons with at least five Business Days'
prior notice of any meeting of the board of directors of Landrum or Landmark
Bank, as well as the boards' respective committees, and permit up to two
representatives of Simmons to attend such meetings; provided, that
representatives of Simmons shall not be permitted to attend portions of
any such meetings (i) that relate to Acquisition Proposals, (ii) that relate
to the relationship of Landrum and Simmons under this Agreement, (iii) to the
extent such attendance would be prohibited by Law or (iv) whenever Landrum, on
the advice of counsel, determines that the attendance of Simmons
representatives would negatively impact Landrum's attorney-client privilege or
its or its board's fiduciary obligations.

  



  

7.6.  Press Releases.

  



  

Landrum and Simmons agree that no press release or other public disclosure or
communication (including communications to employees, agents and
contractors) related to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby shall be issued by either Party (or its Affiliates) without the prior
written consent of the other Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned); provided, that nothing in this Section 7.6
shall be deemed to prohibit any Party from making any press release or other
public disclosure required by Law or the rules or regulations of any United
States or non-United States securities exchange, in which case the
Party required to make the release or disclosure shall use its reasonable
best efforts to allow the other Party reasonable time to comment on such
release or disclosure in advance of the issuance thereof. The Parties have
agreed upon the form of a joint press release announcing the execution of
this Agreement.

  

   

48

 



    



  

7.7.  Tax Treatment.

  



  

(a)  Each of the Parties intends, and undertakes and agrees to
use its reasonable best efforts to cause, the Merger, and to take no action
which would cause the Merger not, to qualify as a "reorganization" within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, and none of the
Parties shall take any action that would cause the Merger to not so qualify.
The Parties shall cooperate and use their reasonable best efforts in order to
obtain the Tax Opinion. The Parties adopt this Agreement as a "plan of
reorganization" within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.368-2(g).

  



  

(b)  Each of the Parties shall use its respective reasonable
best efforts to cause their appropriate officers to execute and deliver to
Covington and Burling LLP, certificates containing appropriate representations
and covenants, reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to Covington and
Burling LLP, at such time or times as may be reasonably requested by such
counsel, including as of the effective date of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus
and the Closing Date, in connection with such counsel's deliveries of
opinions with respect to the Tax treatment of the Merger.

  



  

(c)  Unless otherwise required pursuant to a "determination"
within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, each of
Simmons and Landrum shall report the Merger as a "reorganization" within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code and shall not take any
inconsistent position therewith in any Tax Return.

  



  

7.8.  Employee Benefits and Contracts.

  



  

(a)  Following the Effective Time, except as contemplated by
this Agreement, Simmons shall provide generally to officers and employees (as
a group) who are actively employed by a Landrum Entity on the Closing Date ("
_Covered Employees_ ") while employed by Simmons following the Closing Date
employee benefits under Employee Benefit Plans offered to similarly
situated employees of Simmons, including severance benefits in accordance
with the applicable severance policy of Simmons (other than to any Covered
Employee who is party to individual agreements or letters that entitle such
person to different severance or termination benefits); provided, that in no
event shall any Covered Employee be eligible to participate in any closed or
frozen plan of any Simmons Entity. Until such time as Simmons shall cause the
Covered Employees to participate in the applicable Employee Benefit Plans of
Simmons, the continued participation of the Covered Employees in the Landrum
Benefit Plans shall be deemed to satisfy the foregoing provisions of this
clause (it being understood that participation in Simmons' Employee Benefit
Plans may commence at different times with respect to each of Simmons'
Employee Benefit Plans). Notwithstanding the foregoing, as soon as
administratively practicable following the Closing Date, but no later than
180 days after the Closing Date, Simmons shall have in effect a
defined contribution plan that is qualified under Section 401(a) of the
Internal Revenue Code and that includes a qualified cash or
deferred arrangement within the meaning of Section 401(k) of the Internal
Revenue Code in which Covered Employees who meet the eligibility criteria
thereof shall immediately be eligible to participate. For purposes of
determining eligibility to participate and vesting under Simmons' Employee
Benefit Plans, and for purposes of determining a Covered Employee's
entitlement to paid time off under Simmons' paid time off program, the
service of the Covered Employees with a Landrum Entity prior to the
Effective Time shall be treated as service with a Simmons Entity
participating in such employee benefit plans, to the same extent that
such service was recognized by the Landrum Entities for purposes of a similar
benefit plan; provided, that such recognition of service shall not (i)
operate to duplicate any benefits of a Covered Employee with respect to the
same period of service or (ii) apply for purposes of any plan, program or
arrangement (x) under which similarly-situated employees of Simmons Entities
do not receive credit for prior service, (y) that is grandfathered or frozen,
either with respect to level of benefits or participation, or (z) for
purposes of retiree medical benefits or level of benefits under a defined
benefit pension plan. In addition to the foregoing, (i) each Landrum employee
shall receive credit under any applicable Simmons medical plans for any
deductible and out-of-pocket expenses incurred under any Landrum medical
plans if terminated prior to the end of a plan year and (ii) each Landrum
employee will receive credit for any amounts remaining in spending accounts

(b)  If requested by Simmons in writing delivered to Landrum
prior to the Closing Date, the Landrum Entities shall take all
necessary action (including without limitation the adoption of resolutions
and plan amendments and the delivery of any required notices) to terminate,
effective as of no later than the day before the Closing Date, any Landrum
Benefit Plan that is intended to constitute a tax-qualified defined
contribution plan under Internal Revenue Code Section 401(a) (a " _401(a)
Plan_ "). Landrum shall provide Simmons with a copy of the resolutions, plan
amendments, notices and other documents prepared to effectuate the
termination of the 401(a) Plans in advance and give Simmons a reasonable
opportunity to comment on such documents (which comments shall be considered
in good faith), and prior to the Closing Date, Landrum shall provide Simmons
with the final documentation evidencing that the 401(a) Plans have been
terminated. For the avoidance of doubt, this includes the CBP.

  



  

(c)  Upon request by Simmons in writing prior to the Closing
Date, the Landrum Entities shall cooperate in good faith with Simmons prior
to the Closing Date to amend, freeze, terminate or modify any other Landrum
Benefit Plan to the extent and in the manner determined by Simmons effective
upon the Closing Date (or at such different time mutually agreed to by the
Parties) and consistent with applicable Law. Landrum shall provide Simmons
with a copy of the resolutions, plan amendments, notices and other
documents prepared to effectuate the actions contemplated by this Section
7.8(c), as applicable, and give Simmons a reasonable opportunity to comment
on such documents (which comments shall be considered in good faith), and
prior to the Closing Date, Landrum shall provide Simmons with the final
documentation evidencing that the actions contemplated herein have been
effectuated.

  



  

(d)  The provisions of this Section 7.8 are solely for the
benefit of the Parties, and no Covered Employee, current or former employee
or any other individual associated therewith shall be regarded for any purpose
as a third-party beneficiary of this Agreement. In no event shall the terms
of this Agreement: (i) establish, amend, or modify any Landrum Benefit Plan or
any "employee benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, or any other
benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement maintained or sponsored by
Simmons, Landrum or any of their respective Affiliates; (ii) alter or limit
the ability of Simmons or any Simmons Subsidiaries (including, after the
Closing Date, the Landrum Entities) to amend, modify or terminate any Landrum
Benefit Plan, employment agreement or any other benefit or employment plan,
program, agreement or arrangement after the Closing Date; or (iii) confer
upon any current or former employee, officer, director or consultant, any
right to employment or continued employment or continued service with Simmons
or any Simmons Subsidiaries (including, following the Closing Date, the
Landrum Entities), or constitute or create an employment agreement with any
employee, or interfere with or restrict in any way the rights of the Surviving
Corporation, Landrum, Simmons or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof to
discharge or terminate the services of any employee, officer, director or
consultant of Landrum or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates at any time for
any reason whatsoever, with or without cause.

  



  

7.9.  Indemnification.

  



  

(a)  For a period of six years after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the present
and former directors or officers of the Landrum Entities (each, an "
_Indemnified Party_ ") against all Liabilities arising out of actions or
omissions arising out of the Indemnified Party's service or services as
directors or officers of Landrum or, at Landrum's request, of another
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise occurring
at or prior to the Effective Time (including the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement) (each, a " _Claim_ ") to the fullest extent permitted under
Landrum's certificate of incorporation and bylaws as in effect on the date
hereof (subject to applicable Law), including provisions relating to advances
of expenses incurred in the defense of any Litigation; provided, that in the
case of advancement of expenses, any Indemnified Party to whom expenses are
advanced provides a written undertaking to repay such advances if it is
ultimately determined that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to
indemnification.

  



   

50

 



    

  

(b)  The Surviving Corporation shall use its reasonable best
efforts (and Landrum shall cooperate prior to the Effective Time in these
efforts) to maintain in effect for a period of six years after the Effective
Time Landrum's existing directors' and officers' liability insurance policy
(provided, that the Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor (i) policies
of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions
which are substantially no less advantageous to the insured or (ii) with the
consent of Landrum given prior to the Effective Time, any other policy) with
respect to claims arising from facts or events which occurred prior to the
Effective Time and covering persons who are currently covered by such
insurance; provided, that the Surviving Corporation shall not be obligated to
make aggregate premium payments for such six-year period in respect of such
policy (or coverage replacing such policy) which exceed, for the portion
related to Landrum's directors and officers, 200% of the annual premium
payments currently paid on Landrum's current policy in effect as of the date
of this Agreement (the " _Maximum Amount_ "). If the amount of the premiums
necessary to maintain or procure such insurance coverage exceeds the Maximum
Amount, the Surviving Corporation shall use its reasonable best efforts to
maintain the most advantageous policies of directors' and officers' liability
insurance obtainable for a premium equal to the Maximum Amount. In lieu of
the foregoing, Simmons, or Landrum in consultation with Simmons, may obtain on
or prior to the Effective Time, a six-year "tail" prepaid policy providing
equivalent coverage to that described in this Section 7.9(b) at a premium
not to exceed the Maximum Amount. If the premium necessary to purchase such
"tail" prepaid policy exceeds the Maximum Amount, Simmons, or Landrum in
consultation with Simmons, may purchase the most advantageous "tail" prepaid
policy obtainable for a premium equal to the Maximum Amount, and in each
case, Simmons and the Surviving Corporation shall have no further obligations
under this Section 7.9(b) other than to maintain such "tail" prepaid policy.

  



  

(c)  Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification
under Section 7.9(a), upon learning of any such Claim, shall promptly notify
the Surviving Corporation thereof. In the event of any such Claim (whether
arising before or after the Effective Time): (i) the Surviving Corporation
shall have the right to assume the defense thereof and the Surviving
Corporation shall not be liable to such Indemnified Parties for any legal
expenses of other counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred by such
Indemnified Parties in connection with the defense thereof, except that if
the Surviving Corporation elects not to assume such defense or
independent legal counsel for the Indemnified Parties advises that there are
substantive issues which raise conflicts of interest between the Surviving
Corporation and the Indemnified Parties, the Indemnified Parties may retain
counsel satisfactory to them, and the Surviving Corporation shall pay all
reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified Parties
promptly as statements therefor are received; provided, that the Surviving
Corporation shall be obligated pursuant to this Section 7.9(c) to pay for only
one firm of counsel for all Indemnified Parties; (ii) the Indemnified Parties
will cooperate in the defense of any such Claim; and (iii) the Surviving
Corporation shall not be liable for any settlement effected without its prior
written consent; and provided, further, that the Surviving Corporation shall
not have any obligation hereunder to any Indemnified Party when and if a court
of competent jurisdiction shall determine, and such determination shall have
become final, that the indemnification of such Indemnified Party in the
manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by applicable Law.

  



   

51

 



    

  

(d)  If the Surviving Corporation or any successors or assigns
shall consolidate with or merge into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving Person of such consolidation or merger or if the
Surviving Corporation (or any successors or assigns) shall transfer all or
substantially all of its Assets to any Person, then and in each case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving
Corporation shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 7.9.

  



  

(e)  The provisions of this Section 7.9 are intended to be for
the benefit of and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and their
respective heirs and Representatives.

  



  

(f)  Notwithstanding anything in this Section 7.9 to the
contrary, no indemnification payments will be made to an Indemnified Party
with respect to an administrative proceeding or civil action initiated by any
federal banking agency unless all of the following conditions are met: (i)
the Simmons' board of directors determines in writing that the Indemnified
Party acted in good faith and in the best interests of the Landrum or
Landmark Bank; (ii) the Simmons' board of directors determines that the
payment will not materially affect the Simmons' safety and soundness; (iii)
the payment does not fall within the definition of a prohibited
indemnification payment under 12 C.F.R. Part 359; and (iv) the Indemnified
Party agrees in writing to reimburse the Simmons, to the extent not covered
by permissible insurance, for payments made in the event that the
administrative or civil action instituted by a banking Regulatory Authority
results in a final order or settlement in which the Indemnified Party is
assessed a civil money penalty, is prohibited from banking, or is required to
cease an action or perform an affirmative action.

  



  

7.10.  Operating Functions.

  



  

Landrum and Landmark Bank shall cooperate with Simmons and Simmons Bank in
connection with planning for the efficient and orderly combination of
the Parties and the operation of Simmons Bank and Landmark Bank, and in
preparing for the consolidation of appropriate operating functions to be
effective at the Effective Time or such later date as Simmons may decide.
Landrum shall take any action Simmons may reasonably request prior to the
Effective Time to facilitate the combination of the operations of Landrum with
Simmons. Each Party shall cooperate with the other Party in preparing to
execute after the Effective Time conversion or consolidation of systems and
business operations generally (including by entering into customary
confidentiality, non-disclosure and similar agreements with such service
providers and/or the other party). Without limiting the foregoing, Landrum
shall provide office space and support services (and other
reasonably requested support and assistance) in connection with the
foregoing, and senior officers of Landrum and Simmons shall meet from time to
time as Landrum or Simmons may reasonably request to review the financial and
operational affairs of Landrum and Landmark Bank, and Landrum shall give due
consideration to Simmons' input on such matters, with the understanding that,
notwithstanding any other provision contained in this Agreement, (a) neither
Simmons nor Simmons Bank shall under any circumstance be permitted to
exercise control of Landrum, Landmark Bank or any other Landrum Subsidiaries
prior to the Effective Time, (b) neither Landrum nor any Landmark Bank shall
be under any obligation to act in a manner that could reasonably be deemed to
constitute anti-competitive behavior under federal or state antitrust Laws,
and (c) neither Landrum nor Landmark Bank shall be required to agree to
any material obligation that is not contingent upon the consummation of the
Merger. In addition, Landrum shall cooperate with Simmons' reasonable
requests in connection with the redemption of any Landrum Capital Stock.

  



  

7.11.  Shareholder Litigation.

  



  

Each of Simmons and Landrum shall promptly notify each other in writing of
any action, arbitration, audit, hearing, investigation, litigation,
suit, subpoena or summons issued, commenced, brought, conducted or heard by
or before, or otherwise involving, any Regulatory Authority or arbitrator
pending or, to the Knowledge of Simmons or Landrum, as applicable, threatened
against Simmons, Landrum or any of their respective Subsidiaries or
Representatives that (a) questions or would reasonably be expected to question
the validity of this Agreement or the agreements or transactions contemplated
hereby or any actions taken or to be taken by Simmons, Landrum or their
respective Subsidiaries with respect hereto, or (b) seeks to enjoin or
otherwise restrain the transactions contemplated hereby. Landrum shall give
Simmons prompt notice of any shareholder litigation against Landrum and/or its
directors or officers relating to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and shall give Simmons every opportunity to participate in the
defense or settlement of such litigation, provided that no such settlement
shall be agreed to without Simmons' prior written consent (such consent not
to be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

  



   

52

 



    

  

7.12.  Legal Conditions to Merger.

  



  

Subject to Sections 7.1 and 7.4 of this Agreement, each of Simmons and
Landrum shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use their reasonable
best efforts (a) to take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary, proper
or advisable to comply promptly with all legal requirements that may be
imposed on such Party or its Subsidiaries with respect to the Merger and,
subject to the conditions set forth in ARTICLE 8 hereof, to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (b) to obtain (and to
cooperate with the other Party to obtain) any Permit or Consent by, of any
Regulatory Authority or any other third party that is required to be obtained
by Landrum or Simmons or any of their respective Subsidiaries in connection
with, or to effect, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. In case at any time after the Effective Time any further
action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement
(including, any merger between a Simmons Subsidiary, on the one hand, and a
Landrum Subsidiary, on the other hand) or to vest the Surviving Corporation
with full title to all Assets, rights, approvals, immunities and franchises of
any of the Parties to the Merger, the proper officers and directors of each
Party and their respective Subsidiaries shall take all such necessary action
as may be reasonably requested by Simmons.

  



  

7.13.  Change of Method.

  



  

Simmons may at any time prior to the Effective Time change the method or
structure of effecting the combination of Landrum and Simmons (including by
providing for the merger of Landrum with a wholly owned Simmons Subsidiary) if
and to the extent requested by Simmons, and Landrum agrees to enter into such
amendments to this Agreement as Simmons may reasonably request in order to
give effect to such restructuring; provided, that no such change or amendment
shall (i) alter or change the amount or kind of the Merger Consideration
provided for in this Agreement, (ii) adversely affect the Tax treatment of
the Merger with respect to Landrum's shareholders or (iii) materially delay
or impede the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

7.14.  Takeover Laws.

  



  

None of Simmons, Landrum or their respective boards of directors shall take
any action that would cause any Takeover Law to become applicable to this
Agreement, the Merger, or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby,
and each shall take all necessary steps to exempt (or ensure the continued
exemption of) the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby from
any applicable Takeover Law now or hereafter in effect. If any Takeover Law
may become, or may purport to be, applicable to the transactions contemplated
hereby, each Party and the members of their respective boards of directors
will grant such approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to eliminate
or minimize the effects of any Takeover Law on any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including, if necessary, challenging the
validity or applicability of any such Takeover Law.

  



   

53

 



    

  

7.15.  Closing Financial Statements.

  



  

At least eight Business Days prior to the Effective Time, Landrum shall
provide Simmons with Landrum's consolidated financial statements
presenting the financial condition of Landrum and its Subsidiaries as of the
close of business on the last day of the last month ended prior to the
Effective Time and Landrum's consolidated results of operations, cash flows,
and shareholders' equity for the period from January 1, 2019 through the
close of business on the last day of the last month ended prior to the
Effective Time (the " _Closing Financial Statements_ "); provided, that if
the Effective Time occurs on or before the 15th Business Day of the month,
Landrum shall have provided consolidated financial statements as of and
through the second month preceding the Effective Time. Such Closing Financial
Statements shall have been prepared in accordance with GAAP and regulatory
accounting principles and other applicable legal and accounting requirements,
and reflect all period-end accruals and other adjustments. Such
Closing Financial Statements shall also reflect as of their date (a) accruals
for all fees, costs and expenses incurred or expected to be incurred (whether
or not doing so is in accordance with GAAP) in connection (directly or
indirectly) with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (b) the
capital ratios set forth in Section 8.2(g), and (c) the asset quality metrics
set forth in Section 8.2(e) and shall be accompanied by a certificate of
Landrum's chief financial officer, dated as of the Effective Time, to the
effect that such financial statements meet the requirements of this Section
7.15 and continue to reflect accurately, as of the date of such certificate,
the consolidated financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and
shareholders' equity of Landrum in all material respects.

  



  

7.16.  Dividends.

  



  

After the date of this Agreement, each of Landrum and Simmons shall
coordinate with the other regarding the declaration of any dividends in
respect of Landrum Capital Stock and Simmons Capital Stock and the record
dates and payment dates relating thereto, it being the intention of the
Parties that holders of Landrum Capital Stock shall not receive two dividends,
or fail to receive one dividend, in any quarter with respect to their shares
of Landrum Capital Stock and any shares of Simmons Capital Stock any such
holder receives in exchange therefor in the Merger.

shall be deemed not to include such qualifications. The representations and
warranties set forth in each other section in ARTICLE 4 shall, in the
aggregate, be true and correct in all respects except where the failure of
such representations and warranties to be true and correct, has not had or
would not reasonably be likely to have, either individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect; provided, that, for purposes of this
sentence only, those representations and warranties which are qualified by
references to "material" or "Material Adverse Effect" or to the "Knowledge" of
any Person shall be deemed not to include such qualifications.

  



  

(b)   _Performance of Agreements and Covenants_. Each and all
of the agreements and covenants of Landrum to be performed and complied with

conditions contained in Sections 8.2(g)(ii) through 8.2(g)(iv) may be waived

multiplied by the Average Closing Price shall be no less than the

period, it shall give prompt written notice to Landrum of such election and
the revised Aggregate Stock Consideration, whereupon no termination shall have
occurred pursuant to this Section 9.1(i) and this Agreement shall remain in
effect in accordance with its terms (except as the Aggregate Stock

"hereunder" and similar terms refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to
any specific Section. All pronouns and any variations thereof refer to the
masculine, feminine or neuter, singular or plural, as the context may require.
If a word or phrase is defined, the other grammatical forms of such word or
phrase have a corresponding meaning. A reference to a document, agreement or
instrument also refers to all addenda, exhibits or schedules thereto. A
reference to any "copy" or "copies" of a document, agreement or instrument
means a copy or copies that are complete and correct. Unless otherwise
specified in this Agreement, all accounting terms used in this Agreement will
be interpreted, and all accounting determinations under this Agreement will be
made, in accordance with GAAP. Any capitalized terms used in any schedule,
Exhibit, or Disclosure Memorandum but not otherwise defined therein shall
have the meaning set forth in this Agreement. All references to "dollars" or
"$" in this Agreement are to United States dollars. All references to "the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement" (or similar phrases) include the

(a)  Except as otherwise provided in this Section 10.3, each of
the Parties shall bear and pay all direct costs and expenses incurred by it
or on its behalf in connection with the transactions contemplated hereunder,
including filing, registration and application fees, printing and mailing

then Landrum shall pay to Simmons an amount equal to $15,000,000 (the "

to this Section 10.3(b) constitutes liquidated damages and not a penalty, and
shall be the sole monetary remedy of Simmons in the event of termination of
this Agreement pursuant to Sections 9.1(b)(iii), 9.1(c), 9.1(d) or 9.1(f). If
the Termination Fee shall be payable pursuant to subsection (i) of this

contemplated by this Agreement, and that without these agreements, they would
not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if Landrum fails to pay any fee
payable by it pursuant to this Section 10.3 when due, then Landrum shall pay
to Simmons its costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees) in connection
with collecting such fee, together with interest on the amount of the fee at
the prime rate of Citibank, N.A. from the date such payment was due under this
Agreement until the date of payment

Disclosure Memorandum of each of Landrum and Simmons, the Exhibits,
the schedules, and the other documents and instruments referred to herein)

constitute the entire agreement between the Parties with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereunder and thereunder and supersedes all prior
arrangements or understandings with respect thereto, written or oral. Nothing

herein) expressed or implied, is intended to confer upon any Person, other
than the Parties or their respective successors, any rights, remedies,
obligations, or liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement, other
than as specifically provided in Section 7.9. The representations and
warranties in this Agreement are the product of negotiations among the
Parties and are for the sole benefit of the Parties. Any inaccuracies in such
representations and warranties are subject to waiver by the Parties in
accordance herewith without notice or liability to any other Person. In some
instances, the representations and warranties in this Agreement may represent
an allocation among the Parties of risks associated with particular matters

other than the Parties may not rely upon the representations and warranties
in this Agreement as characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of
the date of this Agreement or as of any other date. Notwithstanding any other
provision hereof to the contrary, no consent, approval or agreement of any
third party beneficiary will be required to amend, modify to waive any
provision of this Agreement.

applicable Law. No such waiver shall be effective unless in writing signed by

(c)  The failure of any Party at any time or times to require
performance of any provision hereof shall in no manner affect the right of
such Party at a later time to enforce the same or any other provision of this
Agreement. No waiver of any condition or of the breach of any term contained
in this Agreement in one or more instances shall be deemed to be or construed
as a further or continuing waiver of such condition or breach or a waiver of
any other condition or of the breach of any other term of this Agreement.

10.9.  Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial

  



  

(a)  The Parties agree that this Agreement shall be governed by
and construed in all respects in accordance with the Laws of the State of
Arkansas without regard to any conflict of Laws or choice of Law principles
that might otherwise refer construction or interpretation of this Agreement
to the substantive Law of another jurisdiction (except that matters relating
to the fiduciary duties of the board of directors of Landrum shall be subject
to the Laws of the State of Missouri).

  



  

(b)  Each Party agrees that it will bring any action or
proceeding in respect of any claim arising out of or related to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby exclusively in any
federal or state court of competent jurisdiction located in the State of
Arkansas (the "Chosen Courts"), and, solely in connection with claims arising
under this Agreement or the transactions that are the subject of this
Agreement, (i) irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Chosen
Courts, (ii) waives any objection to laying venue in any such action or
proceeding in the Chosen Courts, (iii) waives any objection that the Chosen
Courts are an inconvenient forum or do not have jurisdiction over any party
and (iv) agrees that service of process upon such party in any such action or
proceeding will be effective if notice is given in accordance with Section
10.8.

  



  

(c)  EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY
WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND
DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW,
ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY SUIT,
ACTION OR OTHER PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING
TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH
PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT: (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR
ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE,
THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF ANY ACTION, SUIT OR
PROCEEDING, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (II) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS
AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (III) EACH PARTY MAKES
THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (IV) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO
THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS
IN THIS SECTION 10.9.

  



  

10.10.  Counterparts; Signatures.

  



  

This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which
shall be deemed to be an original, but all of which together shall
constitute one and the same instrument. This Agreement and any signed
agreement or instrument entered into in connection with this Agreement, and
any amendments or waivers hereto or thereto, to the extent signed and
delivered by means of a facsimile machine or by e-mail delivery of a ".pdf"
format data file, shall be treated in all manner and respects as an original
agreement or instrument and shall be considered to have the same binding
legal effect as if it were the original signed version thereof delivered in
person. No Party or to any such agreement or instrument shall raise the use
of a facsimile machine or e-mail delivery of a ".pdf" format data file to
deliver a signature to this Agreement or any amendment or waiver hereto or any
agreement or instrument entered into in connection with this Agreement or the
fact that any signature or agreement or instrument was transmitted or
communicated through the use of a facsimile machine or e-mail delivery of a
".pdf" format data file as a defense to the formation of a contract and each
Party forever waives any such defense.

10.11.  Captions; Articles and Sections.

  



  

The captions contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and
are not part of this Agreement. Unless otherwise indicated, all references to
particular Articles or Sections shall mean and refer to the referenced
Articles and Sections of this Agreement.

  



  

10.12.  Interpretations.

  



  

Neither this Agreement nor any uncertainty or ambiguity herein shall be
construed or resolved against any Party, whether under any rule of
construction or otherwise. No Party shall be considered the draftsman. The
Parties acknowledge and agree that this Agreement has been
reviewed, negotiated, and accepted by all Parties and their attorneys and,
unless otherwise defined herein, the words used shall be construed and
interpreted according to their ordinary meaning so as fairly to accomplish the
purposes and intentions of all Parties.

  



  

10.13.  Enforcement of Agreement.

  



  

The Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any
of the provisions of this Agreement was not performed in accordance with
its specific terms or was otherwise breached and that money damages would be
both incalculable and an insufficient remedy for any breach of this
Agreement. It is accordingly agreed that the Parties shall be entitled,
without the requirement of posting bond, to an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof in any court of the United States or any state having
jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at law or in equity. Each of the Parties waives any defense in any
action for specific performance that a remedy at law would be adequate.

  



  

10.14.  Severability.

  



  

Any term or provision of this Agreement which is invalid or unenforceable in
any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction, be ineffective to the
extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without rendering invalid or
unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this Agreement or
affecting the validity or enforceability of any of the terms or provisions of
this Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If any provision of this Agreement
is so broad as to be unenforceable, the provision shall be interpreted to be
only so broad as is enforceable.
