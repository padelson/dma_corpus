                               PURCHASE AGREEMENT

         THIS PURCHASE AGREEMENT, dated July 6, 2005 (this "Agreement"), is made
among NCOP Capital Resource, LLC, a newly formed Nevada limited liability
company and a wholly owned, indirect subsidiary of NCO Group, Inc.
("Purchaser"), Risk Management Alternatives Parent Corp., a Delaware corporation
("Parent"), and the Subsidiaries, as defined in Annex A hereto. Parent and the
Subsidiaries are referred to herein sometimes individually as a "Seller Party"
and collectively as the "Seller Parties." Each Seller Party and Purchaser, are
referred to herein sometimes individually as a "Party" and collectively as the
"Parties."

                                    RECITALS

         WHEREAS, following the execution of this Agreement, the Seller Parties
(other than the Foreign Subsidiaries) will file a voluntary petition for relief
under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court
for the District of Ohio, Youngstown Division (the "Bankruptcy Court"); each
Seller Party (other than the Foreign Subsidiaries) contemplates continuing to
operate its business as a debtor-in-possession;

         WHEREAS, Purchaser desires to purchase certain assets and business
operations of Seller Parties as set forth below and assume certain liabilities
from Seller Parties in connection therewith, and Seller Parties desire to sell,
convey, assign and transfer to Purchaser certain of their respective assets
together with certain specified liabilities relating thereto pursuant to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, including receipt of an order approving
such sale under Sections 105, 363, 365 and 1146 of the Bankruptcy Code;

         WHEREAS, Purchaser is a wholly owned, indirect subsidiary of NCO Group,
Inc., a Pennsylvania corporation ("NCO"), and NCO has executed and delivered the
NCO Guarantee in connection with Purchaser's Obligations hereunder, which NCO
Guarantee the Seller Parties are relying upon in connection with their execution
of this Agreement;

         WHEREAS, to partially finance the acquisition described herein, NCO has
entered into a financing arrangement with one of the Seller Party's current
creditors, CFSC Capital Corp. XXIV ("CFSC") (or an affiliate thereof), and, in
consideration for the benefits anticipated to inure to CFSC (or an affiliate
thereof) as a result of such arrangement with NCO (or an affiliate thereof),
CFSC is willing to forego a substantial portion of the claim that it would
otherwise have against such Seller Party as a result of the consummation of the
transactions described herein (such settlement by CFSC representing a
substantial economic value to the Seller Parties and their other creditors); and

         WHEREAS, as part of the transactions described herein, Purchaser (or,
if directed by Equifax Credit Information Services LLC ("Equifax"), an Affiliate
of Purchaser) shall assume the NEX Lease (as defined herein) and the RMA
Holdings Guaranty (as defined herein), and, in consideration for the benefits
anticipated to inure to Equifax as a result of such assumption, Equifax is
willing to transfer its membership interest in RMA Holdings LLC ("RMA Holdings")
to Parent (such transfer by Equifax representing a substantial economic value to
the Seller Parties and their creditors).

         NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants, and agreements set forth herein, and
intending to be legally bound, the Parties hereto agree as follows:

                                   ARTICLE I
                                  DEFINED TERMS

         1.1 Definitions. Capitalized terms used in this Agreement shall have
the meanings set forth in Annex B hereto.

         1.2 Certain Rules of Construction.

                  (a) Any term defined herein in the singular form shall have a
comparable meaning when used in the plural form, and vice versa.

                  (b) When used herein, unless the context requires otherwise,
the words "hereof," "herein" and "hereunder" and words of similar import shall
refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this
Agreement.

                  (c) References to Preambles, Articles, Sections, Schedules,
Exhibits and other subdivisions refer to the Preambles, Articles, Sections,
Schedules, Exhibits and other subdivisions of this Agreement, unless otherwise
expressly provided.

                  (d) When used herein, the word "includes" and "including" and
their syntactical variants mean "includes, but is not limited to" and
"including, without limitation," and corresponding syntactical variant
expressions.

                  (e) Unless the context requires otherwise, derivative forms of
any term defined herein shall have a comparable meaning to that of such term.

                                   ARTICLE II
                           PURCHASE AND SALE OF ASSETS

         2.1 Acquired and Excluded Assets.

                  (a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, at
the Closing, the Seller Parties shall sell, assign, transfer, convey and deliver
to Purchaser, free and clear of all Liens other than Permitted Liens, and
Purchaser shall purchase and accept from the Seller Parties, free and clear of
all Liens other than Permitted Liens, all of such Seller Parties' right, title
and interest in and to all of the Seller Parties' assets and properties
(including the assets and properties listed in Schedule 2.1(a)(1) and the
Assigned Contracts and Leases set forth in Schedule 2.1(b)), wherever located,
whether real, personal or mixed, and whether a Tangible Property or Intangible
Property (the "Acquired Assets"), other than the assets and properties listed on
Schedule 2.1(a)(2) (the "Excluded Assets"). The Parties expressly agree and
understand that the Seller Parties shall not sell, assign, transfer, convey or
deliver to Purchaser any of the Excluded Assets.

                  (b) Schedule 2.1(b) sets forth a list of Contracts that
Purchaser wishes to assume and the applicable Seller Party wishes to assign to
Purchaser at Closing ("Assigned Contracts and Leases"); provided, however,
Purchaser may add or remove Contracts (other than the (i) KERP Letters, (ii)


                                       2
<PAGE>

agreements described in items 4 and 5 of Section 5.5(d) of the Seller Disclosure
Letter, (iii) NEX Lease, (iv) RMA Holdings Guaranty and (v) Cunningham
Agreement, none of which can be removed) from the list of Assigned Contracts and
Leases on Schedule 2.1(b) until a date which is the earlier of (A) three (3)
days before the date of the Auction or (B) five (5) days before the date of the
hearing to consider the Sale Order ("Contract Commitment Date").

                  (c) If after the Contract Commitment Date, but prior to the
Closing, any Party becomes aware of any Contract that is not an Assigned
Contract and Lease and does not appear on the list of Other Contracts (an
"Undisclosed Contract"), the discovering Party shall within two (2) Business
Days notify the other Parties of such Undisclosed Contract, and Purchaser may
elect, no later than two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing, to include such
Undisclosed Contract as an Assigned Contract and Lease. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, and subject to the Bankruptcy Code, if any Undisclosed Contract is
entered into after the date of the Bidding Procedures Order and such Undisclosed
Contract contains language allowing the applicable Seller Party to assign the
contract to Purchaser, then such Undisclosed Contract may be assigned without
the entry of a Bankruptcy Court order.

         2.2 Assumed and Excluded Liabilities. Subject to the terms and
conditions set forth herein, at the Closing, Purchaser shall assume from the
Seller Parties, and thereafter pay, perform, or discharge in accordance with
their terms, the liabilities set forth on Schedule 2.2. The liabilities to be
assumed pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be referred to herein as the
"Assumed Liabilities" and all other liabilities and Obligations of the Seller
Parties shall be referred to herein as the "Excluded Liabilities."
Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, Purchaser
is not assuming or agreeing to pay, satisfy, discharge or perform, and shall not
be deemed by virtue of the execution and delivery of this Agreement or any
document delivered at the Closing pursuant to this Agreement, or as a result of
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, to have
assumed, or to have agreed to pay, satisfy, discharge or perform, any liability,
Obligation or indebtedness of any Seller Party, whether primary or secondary,
direct or indirect, other than the Assumed Liabilities. Seller Parties shall
retain all of the Excluded Liabilities. Without limiting the foregoing, the
Seller Parties shall be responsible for paying any and all Cure-Amounts
necessary to assume and assign the Assigned Contracts and Leases to Purchaser.

         2.3 Purchase Price.

                  (a) In consideration for the transfer of the Acquired
Business, Purchaser shall pay an amount equal to $118,800,000 (the "Base
Amount") plus or minus any adjustments to the Base Amount made pursuant to this
Agreement (such amount, together with the Assumed Liabilities, the "Purchase
Price"). The Base Amount, as adjusted, shall be payable by Purchaser as follows:
(i) within one (1) Business Day after the Bidding Procedures Order has been
entered, provided such Bidding Procedure Order shall not have been, and shall
not then remain, stayed, Purchaser shall pay an amount equal to $7,500,000 (the
"Deposit Amount") by wire transfer of immediately available funds into an escrow
account (the "Escrow Account") pursuant to an escrow agreement to be entered
into by Purchaser and Parent in connection therewith and substantially in the
form of Exhibit 2.3 attached hereto (the "Escrow Agreement"); (ii) on the
Closing Date, Purchaser and Parent shall cause $2,500,000 (plus any interest



                                       3
<PAGE>



accrued on the Deposit Amount) from the Escrow Account to be remitted in
immediately available funds to Parent, or as otherwise directed by Parent (as
agent for both Parent and the Subsidiaries); and (iii) on the Closing Date,
Purchaser shall pay by wire transfer of immediately available funds to Parent,
or as otherwise directed by Parent (as agent for both Parent and the
Subsidiaries) (A) the remainder of the Base Amount (i.e., the Base Amount less
the Deposit Amount (and any interest accrued on the Deposit Amount)), (B) plus
or minus the Estimated WC Adjustment in accordance with the provisions set forth
in Section 2.4(b)(ii) hereof, (C) minus the Estimated Revenue Adjustment Amount,
if any, and (D) minus the Portfolio Collections Amount, if any (the aggregate
result of the foregoing, the "Closing Payment").

                  (b) Prior to the Closing Date, the Deposit Amount shall be
retained in the Escrow Account in accordance with the terms of this Agreement
and the Escrow Agreement. After the Closing, $5,000,000 of the Deposit Amount
(the "Post-Closing Escrow Amount") shall be retained in the Escrow Account in
accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement. After the adjustments, if
any, pursuant to Sections 2.4(b), 2.4(c) and 2.4(d) are final in accordance with
the terms herein, $4,000,000 of the Post-Closing Escrow Amount (the "PPA
Amount"), or, if any amounts are due Purchaser pursuant to any of Sections
2.4(b), 2.4(c) or 2.4(d), then $4,000,000 less any such amounts paid Purchaser,
shall be released to the Seller Parties in accordance with the terms of the
Escrow Agreement. After the application of the foregoing sentence, the remaining
$1,000,000 of the Post-Closing Escrow Amount (the "Indemnity Amount") shall be
retained in the Escrow Account until the date that is six (6) months following
the Closing Date. After the date that is six (6) months following the Closing
Date, Indemnity Amount will be released to the Seller Parties in accordance with
the terms of the Escrow Agreement.

         2.4 Purchase Price Adjustments.

                  (a) Portfolio Collections Adjustment. In the event the Closing
Date shall be on or after August 1, 2005, the Purchase Price shall be reduced,
dollar for dollar, for all portfolio collections received in respect of the
Accounts by any Seller Parties on or after August 1, 2005, net of (i) related
servicing fees charged by any Seller Parties pursuant to agreements set forth on
Schedule 2.4(a) to the Seller Disclosure Letter and consistent with past
practice and (ii) other administrative costs incurred consistent with past
practice (such result, the "Portfolio Collections Amount"). Any reduction to the
Purchase Price in accordance with this Section 2.4(a) shall be made, to the
extent then determinable, at the Closing as an adjustment to the Closing
Payment, or to the extent not determinable as of the Closing, promptly following
the determination thereof, with such payments paid by the Seller Parties to
Purchaser. In connection with the foregoing, the books and records of the Seller
Parties shall be closed as of July 31, 2005 in a manner consistent with past
practice.

                  (b) Working Capital Adjustment.

                           (i) Prior to Closing, Parent shall prepare and
deliver to Purchaser an estimated statement of the Working Capital as of the
Closing Date (the "Pre-Closing Statement"). The Pre-Closing Statement shall be
prepared by Seller Parties in good faith.

                           (ii) Based upon the Pre-Closing Statement, the amount
paid to the Seller Parties at Closing shall be: (A) decreased, dollar for
dollar, by the amount by which Working Capital in the Pre-Closing Statement
("Estimated WC") is less than the Minimum WC, or (B) increased, dollar for
dollar, by the amount by which the Estimated WC is more than the Minimum WC (the
adjustment provided for by clauses (A) and (B) is referred to as the "Estimated
WC Adjustment"). The "Minimum WC" shall equal Ten Million One Hundred Forty
Three Thousand Dollars ($10,143,000).

                                       4
<PAGE>

                           (iii) Within sixty (60) Business Days after Closing,
Parent shall prepare and deliver to Purchaser a statement (the "Closing
Statement") of Working Capital as of the Closing Date. The Closing Statement
shall be prepared by Parent in good faith.

                           (iv) After receipt of the Closing Statement,
Purchaser (including its advisors), shall have ten (10) Business Days to review
it together with the work papers used in the preparation thereof. Unless
Purchaser delivers written notice to Parent on or prior to the tenth Business
Day after Purchaser's receipt of the Closing Statement stating that it has
objections thereto, Purchaser shall be deemed to have accepted and agreed to the
Closing Statement. If, however, Purchaser notifies Parent of objections to the
Closing Statement on or prior to the tenth Business Day after Purchaser's
receipt of the Closing Statement, Purchaser and Parent shall, within twenty (20)
Business Days (or such longer period as may be agreed in writing) following such
notice (the "Resolution Period"), attempt in good faith to resolve their
differences with respect to such objections, and any resolution by them as to
any disputed amounts shall, subject to the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code, be
final, binding and conclusive.

                           (v) If Purchaser and Parent are unable to resolve any
such disputed items within the Resolution Period, then such Parties shall submit
the remaining disputed items (and only those items) for determination and
resolution to (x) FTI Consulting Inc. or (y) in the event FTI Consulting Inc. is
no longer in the financial analysis business at such time, a mutually acceptable
consulting firm with expertise in financial analysis. If FTI Consulting Inc. is
no longer in the financial analysis business at such relevant time and Purchaser
and Parent are unable to agree on the choice of a consulting firm with expertise
in financial analysis, they will select a nationally or regionally recognized
consulting firm with expertise in financial analysis by lot after each of
Purchaser and Parent have submitted two proposed firms, and then excluded one
firm selected by the other. FTI Consulting Inc. (or any other firm selected
pursuant to the foregoing) shall be referred to herein as the "Arbiter." The
Arbiter shall be instructed to determine the disputed items and report to
Purchaser and Parent within thirty (30) days after such submission. Upon
determination by the Arbiter of the disputed items, its report shall be final,
binding and conclusive on the Parties with respect to such matter. The fees and
expenses of the Arbiter shall be allocated between Purchaser and Parent based on
the percentage which the portion of the contested amount not awarded to each
Party bears to the amount actually contested by such Party. For example, if
Parent claims Working Capital is $1,000 greater than the amount determined by
Purchaser, and Purchaser contests only $500 of the amount claimed by Parent, and
if the Arbiter ultimately resolves the dispute by awarding the Seller Parties
$300 of the $500 contested, then the costs and expenses of the Arbiter will be
allocated 60% (i.e., 300 / 500) to Purchaser and 40% (i.e., 200 / 500) to
Parent.

         5.18 Seller Parties' Obligations. All amounts due to clients of Parent
or any of the Subsidiaries for collections made by the Seller Parties as of the
date hereof have either been remitted to the proper clients or have been
deposited in escrow accounts ("Client Trust Accounts") maintained by Parent or a
Subsidiary, the rights of Parent and the Subsidiaries, as applicable in respect
of which Client Trust Accounts are being transferred to Purchaser on the date
hereof.

         5.19 Client Trust Accounts Sufficient. The cash assets held in Client
Trust Accounts are sufficient to satisfy the customer accounts payable and as of
the Closing Date all of Seller Parties' customers will have been paid in full or
the cash assets held in Client Trust Accounts will be sufficient to satisfy all
customer accounts payable as of the Closing Date.

         5.20 True Copies. The copies of the agreements attached as schedules to
this Agreement or listed on such schedules (and previously delivered or made
available to Purchaser) are accurate and complete, in all material respects, and
are not missing any amendments or waivers in respect thereof.

         5.21 Taxes. Parent and the Subsidiaries have timely paid all state and
local property Taxes required to be paid by it under applicable Law. Except as
set forth in Section 5.21 of the Seller Disclosure Letter (i) there are no Liens
for Taxes upon any of the Acquired Assets, including the Foreign Subsidiaries'
assets, and (ii) none of Parent nor the Subsidiaries are a foreign person (other
than the Foreign Subsidiaries) within the meaning of Section 1445 of the Code.

         5.22 No Knowledge of Breach. None of Parent or the Subsidiaries has
knowledge of any breach by Purchaser of its representations and warranties
herein.

         5.23 Affiliate Transactions. Section 5.23 of the Seller Disclosure
Letter lists and fully describes each Contract, transaction or series of
transactions pursuant to which Parent or any of the Subsidiaries is, or, at any
time during the previous five years has been, a party or otherwise bound with
any Affiliate of any stockholder or Parent, excluding intercompany Contracts or
transactions (a "Seller Affiliate Transaction"). Each Seller Affiliate
Transaction (i) has been entered into the normal and ordinary course of business
and pursuant to the reasonable requirements thereof, and (ii) is based upon fair
and reasonable terms no less favorable to Parent or the Subsidiaries than it
could have obtained in a comparable arm's-length transaction with an
unaffiliated Person.

         5.24 Portfolio of Accounts.

                  (a) The CD provided to Purchaser prior to the date hereof
contains, as of June 30, 2005, an accurate and complete list of Seller Parties'
Accounts and the status of each Account, except with respect to ordinary course
of business delays in reporting. The Accounts to be transferred hereunder
constitute all of the Accounts.

                  (b) To the Knowledge of Parent or the Subsidiaries, the CD
provided to Purchaser prior to the date hereof accurately reflects, in all
material respects, all payment activities (or other reductions in value) on the
Accounts during the period from July 1, 2004 through June 30, 2005, except with
respect to ordinary course of business delays in reporting.

                  (c) From the period commencing on March 1, 2005, with respect
to Accounts owned as of March 1, 2005, the Seller Parties have not sold any such
Accounts, have not settled any such Accounts outside of the ordinary course of
business, have operated in the ordinary course with respect to such Accounts and
have made appropriate adjustments in the data base in which entries on such
Accounts are made in the ordinary and normal course of its business, consistent
with its past practices.

                  (d) Except as set forth in Section 5.24 of the Seller
Disclosure Letter, the Seller Parties (i) have good and valid title to each
Account and corresponding Account Documents and are the sole owner thereof, (ii)

Accounts and Account Documents to Purchaser, free and clear of any Liens.

                  (e) Seller Parties have no knowledge of any defect with
respect to the legality, validity or binding nature of the Accounts; provided,
however, that no representation, warranty or covenant is made herein as to the
collectability or enforceability of any particular Account or Accounts.

                  (f) Seller Parties have instructed all servicers of the
Accounts to not settle amounts owed with respect to the Accounts below

                                   ARTICLE VI
                   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PURCHASER

         Knowing that the Seller Parties are relying thereon, Purchaser
represents and warrants to the Seller Parties as follows:

         6.1 Organization. Purchaser is a limited liability company that is duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of its
jurisdiction of formation. Purchaser possesses the full limited liability
company power and authority to own its assets, conduct its business as and where
such business is presently conducted, and enter into this Agreement.

         6.2 Agreement. The execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement by Purchaser, (i) have been duly authorized by all necessary limited
liability company actions by its sole member; (ii) do not constitute a violation
of or default under its organization documents; (iii) do not constitute a
default or breach (immediately or after the giving of notice, passage of time or
both) under any Contract to which Purchaser is a party or by which it is bound;
(iv) do not constitute a violation of any Law or Judgment that is applicable to
it or to its businesses or Assets, or to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; and (v) does not require the Consent of any Person. This Agreement
constitutes the valid and legally binding agreement of Purchaser, enforceable
against it in accordance with its terms.

         6.3 Brokers' and Finders' Fees. Purchaser has not incurred and will not
incur, directly or indirectly, any liability for brokerage or finders' fees or
agents' commissions or any similar charges in connection with this Agreement or
any transaction contemplated hereby.

         6.4 Available Funds. NCO has or has available to it, and will make
available to Purchaser, all funds necessary to satisfy all of Purchaser's
obligations under this Agreement. In particular, to finance its purchase of the
Accounts, NCO has entered into a financing arrangement with CFSC (or an
affiliate thereof), and Purchaser has no reason to believe that such financing
will not be provided on the Closing Date.

                                       24
<PAGE>

         6.5 No Knowledge of Breach.

Purchaser has no knowledge of any breach by the Seller Parties of their
representations and warranties herein.

                                   ARTICLE VII
       SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, COVENANTS AND AGREEMENTS.

         7.1 Survival. Subject to the other provisions of this Section 7.1, none
of the representations, warranties, agreements and covenants set forth in this
Agreement or in any agreement, document, instrument, certificate or other item
furnished by any Party pursuant hereto or thereto or in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall survive the Closing Date.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the representations and warranties set forth in
Section 5.19 hereof (collectively, the "Sufficiency of Trusts Rep") shall
survive for six (6) months following the Closing Date and those covenants and
agreements to be performed subsequent to the Closing Date shall survive the
Closing in accordance with their terms. The Sufficiency of Trusts Rep and those
covenants and agreements to be performed subsequent to the Closing will continue
to survive if an Indemnity Notice or a Claim Notice (as applicable) shall have
been given in good faith based on facts reasonably expected to establish a valid
claim under Article VIII on or prior to the date on which such Sufficiency of
Trusts Rep, covenant or agreement would have otherwise terminated in accordance
with the terms of the preceding sentence, until the related claim for
indemnification has been satisfied or otherwise resolved as provided in Article
VIII. Any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement made by any
Party that was made by such Party fraudulently shall indefinitely survive the
Closing. The right to indemnification based upon such representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements shall not be affected by any investigation
conducted with respect to, or any knowledge acquired (or capable of being
acquired) at any time, whether before or after the execution and delivery of
this Agreement or the Closing Date, with respect to the accuracy or inaccuracy
of or compliance with any such representation, warranty, covenant or agreement.

         7.2 Interpretation of Representations and Warranties. Each
representation, warranty, covenant and agreement contained herein is independent
of all other representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained
herein and must be independently and separately complied with and satisfied.

                                  ARTICLE VIII
                                 INDEMNIFICATION

         8.1 Seller Parties' Indemnification. Seller Parties shall, solely out
of the Escrow Account (except as otherwise expressly provided in Article II
above with respect to certain purchase price adjustments), indemnify and hold
harmless Purchaser, NCO, each of their respective Affiliates and each of their
respective shareholders, directors, officers, employees, agents, successors and
assigns (collectively, the "Purchaser Group"), from and against all
Indemnifiable Losses incurred by any of them resulting from, related to, or
arising out of any breach of the Sufficiency of Trusts Rep or non-fulfillment of
any agreement or covenant to be performed subsequent to the Closing Date by any
of the Seller Parties under this Agreement or any agreement, document,
instrument, certificate or other item furnished to Purchaser or its Affiliates
pursuant hereto or thereto or in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.

                                       25
<PAGE>

         8.2 Purchaser's Indemnification. Purchaser shall indemnify and hold
harmless the Seller Parties, each of their respective Affiliates and each of
their respective directors, officers, employees, agents, successors and assigns,
from and against all Indemnifiable Losses incurred by any of them resulting
from, related to, or arising out of any non-fulfillment of any agreement or
covenant to be performed subsequent to the Closing Date by Purchaser under this
Agreement or any agreement, document, instrument, certificate or other item
furnished to any Seller Party or its Affiliates pursuant hereto or thereto or in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

         8.3 Payment; Procedure for Indemnification.

                  (a) In the event that the Person seeking indemnification under
this Article VIII (the "Indemnified Party") shall suffer an Indemnifiable Loss,
he, she or it shall, promptly after acquiring actual knowledge of any such
Indemnifiable Loss, give written notice to the party from whom indemnification
under this Article VIII is sought (the "Indemnifying Party") of the amount of
the Indemnifiable Loss, together with reasonably sufficient information to
enable the Indemnifying Party to determine the accuracy and nature of the
claimed Indemnifiable Loss (the "Indemnity Notice"). The failure of any
Indemnified Party to promptly give the Indemnifying Party the Indemnity Notice
shall not release the Indemnifying Party of liability under this Article VIII
unless the failure to give such notice materially and adversely prejudices such
Indemnifying Party. Within ten (10) days after the receipt by the Indemnifying
Party of the Indemnity Notice, the Indemnifying Party shall either (i) pay (in
immediately available funds) to the Indemnified Party an amount equal to the
Indemnifiable Loss or (ii) object to such claim, in which case the Indemnifying
Party shall give written notice to the Indemnified Party of such objection
together with the reasons therefor, it being understood that the failure of the
Indemnifying Party to so object shall preclude the Indemnifying Party from
asserting any claim, defense or counterclaim relating to the Indemnifying
Party's failure to pay any Indemnifiable Loss. If the Indemnifying Party fails
to object as aforesaid, then the Indemnifying Party shall conclusively be deemed
to be obligated to pay the amount of the Indemnifiable Loss to the Indemnified
Party within the ten (10) day period after the Indemnifying Party's receipt of
the Indemnity Notice. The Indemnifying Party's objection shall not relieve the
Indemnifying Party from its obligations under this Article VIII. If there shall
be a dispute as to the amount or manner of indemnification under this Article
VIII, the Indemnifying and Indemnified Party shall seek to resolve such dispute
through negotiations and, if such dispute is not resolved within twenty (20)
days following the receipt of such written objection notice by the Indemnified
Party, the Indemnified Party may pursue whatever legal remedies may be available
for recovery of the damages claimed from any Indemnifying Party. If any
Indemnifying Party fails to pay all or part of any indemnification obligation
when due, then such Indemnifying Party shall also be obligated to pay to the
applicable Indemnified Party interest compounded monthly on the unpaid amount
for each day during which the obligation remains unpaid at an annual rate equal
to the prime rate of interest as reported in The Wall Street Journal from time
to time. If the Indemnifying Party disputes its liability for any Indemnifiable
Loss asserted by the Indemnified Party, and the Indemnifying Party is the
prevailing party in any Proceeding initiated to resolve such dispute, then the
Indemnified Party shall promptly pay all of the reasonable attorneys' fees and
expenses incurred by the Indemnifying Party in connection with such dispute or
such Proceeding.

                                       26
<PAGE>

                  (b) In the event the facts giving rise to the claim for
indemnification under this Article VIII shall involve any action, claim or
demand by any third party against the Indemnified Party, the Indemnified Party,
within the earlier of, as applicable, fifteen (15) days after receiving notice
of the filing of a lawsuit or sixty (60) days after receiving notice of the
existence of a claim or demand giving rise to the claim for indemnification,
shall send written notice of such claim to the Indemnifying Party (the "Claim
Notice"). The failure of the Indemnified Party to give the Indemnifying Party
the Claim Notice shall not release the Indemnifying Party of liability under
this Article VIII unless the failure to give such notice materially and
adversely prejudices such Indemnifying Party. The Indemnifying Party shall be
entitled to defend such claim in the name of the Indemnified Party at the
Indemnifying Party's own expense and through counsel (reasonably acceptable to
the Indemnified Party) of its own choosing. The Indemnifying Party shall give
the Indemnified Party notice in writing within ten (10) days after receiving the
Claim Notice from the Indemnified Party in the event of litigation, or otherwise
within thirty (30) days, of its intent to do so. The Indemnified Party may
elect, by notice in writing to the Indemnifying Party, to continue to
participate through its own counsel, at its own expense, but the Indemnifying
Party shall have the right to control the defense of the claim or the
litigation. Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this Agreement, the
party controlling the defense of the claim or the litigation shall not settle
any such claim or litigation without the written consent of the other party;
provided, that if such proposed settlement contains terms that are reasonable
under the circumstances, then the other party shall not withhold or delay the
giving of such consent.

         8.4 Limitation on Liabilities. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, an Indemnifying Party shall not have any liability to
an Indemnified Party in respect of any claim for indemnification for the breach
of any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained herein
unless a claim with respect thereto is delivered to the Indemnifying Party prior
to the termination of the survival period for such representation, warranty,
covenant or other agreement set forth in Article VII hereof.

         8.5 Limitation on Indemnification Amount. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in this Article VIII, no Person that would otherwise be
entitled to be an Indemnified Party under this Article VIII shall be entitled to
indemnification pursuant to this Article VIII, unless and until the aggregate
amount of such Person's Indemnifiable Loss with respect to an individual matter
exceeds $50,000 or with respect to all matters exceeds $250,000 (the "Threshold
Amount"). If and when the aggregate amount of such Person's Indemnifiable Loss
exceeds the Threshold Amount, such Person shall be entitled to be indemnified
for the full amount of such Indemnifiable Loss, without regard to the Threshold
Amount. Further, except as otherwise expressly provided in Article II above with
respect to certain purchase price adjustments, the maximum aggregate amount of
indemnification that the Purchaser Group may recover under this Article VIII
shall in no event exceed the remaining funds in the Escrow Account and recourse
for such amount shall be limited solely to offsets against the Escrow Account in
accordance with this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement (it being understood
that any portion of the indemnification claims of the Purchaser Group against
any or all of the Seller Parties that remain unsatisfied after application of
the funds in the Escrow Account shall be deemed forever waived, discharged and
released).

                                       27

         8.6 Exclusive Remedies. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this
Agreement, the indemnification rights of the Parties under this Article VIII are
the exclusive rights and remedies of the Parties with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, at law or in equity or otherwise.

                                   ARTICLE IX
                                    COVENANTS

         9.1 Access.

                  (a) Between the date hereof and the Closing, Parent and the
Subsidiaries shall: (i) give Purchaser and its authorized representatives
reasonable access, during regular business hours and upon reasonable advance
notice, to senior management employees, the Acquired Assets, and such books and
records of such entity, as are reasonably necessary to allow Purchaser and its
representatives to make such inspections as they may reasonably require relating
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the consummation thereof;
(ii) preserve in all material respects all books and records relating to the
operation or ownership of the Acquired Assets and any other material information
related to the Acquired Business and the Acquired Assets on or before the
Closing Date consistent with such entities' ordinary course of business; (iii)
cause officers of each entity to furnish Purchaser and its representatives with
such financial and operating data and other information with respect to such
entity, to the extent prepared by such entity in the ordinary course of
business, as Purchaser may from time to time reasonably request relating to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the consummation thereof; (iv)
give Purchaser and its authorized representatives access to senior management
employees of each Seller Party to discuss the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the consummation thereof; and (v) give Purchaser and its
authorized representatives access to third parties who have entered into
Contracts with the Seller Parties to enable Purchaser to negotiate with such
third parties prior to Purchaser making a final decision in accordance with the
terms herein as to whether or not it should assume such Contracts.

                  (b) On and after the Closing Date, Purchaser will afford
promptly to Parent and its counsel, financial advisers and other agents
reasonable access during normal business hours to its properties, books and
records, employees, auditors and counsel to the extent necessary for financial
reporting and accounting matters, employee benefits matters, the preparation and
filing of any Tax Returns, reports or forms, the defense of any Tax audit, claim
or assessment and other matters relating to the winding-up of any Seller Party's
estate, or to permit Parent to determine any matter relating to the rights and
obligations of any Seller Party hereunder or any other reasonable business
purpose related to the Excluded Assets or Excluded Liabilities; provided,
however, that any such access by Parent shall not unreasonably interfere with
the conduct of the business of Purchaser. Purchaser shall preserve and maintain
the books and records acquired at Closing for a period of three years after the
Closing Date.

         9.2 Conduct and Preservation of the Acquired Assets. Except (i) as
provided in this Agreement, (ii) consented to by Purchaser, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed or (iii) approved by the Bankruptcy
Court, during the period from the date hereof to the Closing, the Seller Parties
shall use their Commercially Reasonable Efforts to cause the Acquired Business
to be conducted in the ordinary course of business consistent with its practice,
including with respect to the operation and maintenance of the Acquired Assets,
and shall use its Commercially Reasonable Efforts to (A) preserve the present
business operations, organization and goodwill of the Acquired Business; (B)
preserve, maintain, and protect the assets, rights, and properties of the
Acquired Business and the Acquired Assets; (C) comply in all material respects
with all post-petition contractual and other obligations applicable to the
operation of the Acquired Business and the Acquired Assets; and (D) comply in
all material respects with applicable Laws, insofar as they relate to the
Acquire Business or the Acquired Assets.

as (w) set forth on Schedule 9.3, (x) otherwise provided in this Agreement, (y)
otherwise required in order for any Seller Party to comply with its duties and
responsibilities as a debtor in possession under the Bankruptcy Code, or (z)

directly or indirectly, any assets relating to or forming part of the Acquired

                           (iii) Seller Parties' obligation to pay the Break-Up
Fee and the Expense Reimbursement Fee shall be subject to the Bidding Procedures
Order.

                  (e) Nonsolicitation of Alternative Transactions. During the

with, (iii) respond to any request for information or due diligence inquiry of,
(iv) make the management and employees of the Acquired Business available to, or
(v) enter into any agreement or consummate any transaction with any third party
relating to an Alternative Transaction. During the Solicitation Period, the
Seller Parties and their respective Affiliates and representatives shall be
permitted, in the manner and to the extent permitted by the Bidding Procedures
Order, to (i) solicit inquiries, proposals, offers or bids from, (ii) negotiate
or discuss with, (iii) respond to any request for information or due diligence
inquiry of, and (iv) make their respective management and employees available
to, any third party in connection with the submission or proposed submission of

assist the purchase of all or substantially all of the Acquired Assets,
provided, however, that Parent and the Subsidiaries may only seek Bankruptcy
Court approval of a definitive agreement with the Winning Bidder made and
accepted in accordance with the Bidding Procedures Order. Without limiting and
subject to the foregoing, the Seller Parties and their respective Affiliates and
representatives shall be permitted to supply information relating to the
Acquired Business and Acquired Assets during the Solicitation Period only to
prospective purchasers that have executed in accordance with the Bidding
Procedures Order a confidentiality agreement.

         9.8 Advice of Changes. Prior to the Closing, each Party shall advise
the other in writing with respect to any matter arising after the date of this
Agreement of which that Party obtains knowledge and which, if existing or
occurring on or prior to the date of this Agreement, would have been required to
be set forth in this Agreement, including any of the Schedules hereto. Parent
and the Subsidiaries, as applicable, shall, from time to time prior to the
Closing, promptly supplement or amend the Schedules to this Agreement with
respect to (i) any non-material matter that existed as of the date of this
Agreement and should have been set forth in any of the Schedules hereto, (ii)
any non-material matter hereafter arising which, if existing as of the date of
this Agreement, would have been required to be set forth in any of the Schedules
hereto in order to make any representation or warranty set forth in this
Agreement true and correct as of such date and (iii) any matter requiring
disclosure as a result of Purchaser's additions or subtractions to Schedule
2.1(b) pursuant to the terms herein. Purchaser shall promptly notify Parent and
the Subsidiaries of (A) any breach by Parent or any Subsidiary of any
representation or warranty of such entity, or (B) any other event, fact,
condition or circumstance that would excuse Purchaser from the timely
performance of its obligations hereunder, if any such information becomes aware
to Purchaser prior to the Closing.

         9.9 Confidentiality. Each Party hereto acknowledges that the other
Parties have legitimate and continuing proprietary interests in the protection
of their confidential information and that the Parties have invested substantial
sums and will continue to invest substantial sums to develop, maintain and
protect such confidential information. Prior to and after the Closing, each
Party agrees not to disclose, furnish or make accessible to anyone or use for
its own benefit (other than as contemplated by this Agreement) any trade secrets

                                       34
<PAGE>

or other confidential or proprietary information of another Party relating to
such Party and/or their respective businesses including information obtained by
or revealed to such Party during any investigations, negotiations or review
relating to this Agreement and any other document contemplated hereby or thereby
or any past or future actions taken in connection with, pursuant to, in
accordance with, or under this Agreement, including any business plans,
marketing plans, financial information, strategies, systems, programs and
methods, provided that such protected information shall not include (i)
information required to be disclosed by law, legal or judicial process
(including a court order, subpoena or order of a Governmental Body) or the rules
of any stock exchange or quotation system, subject to prior consultation with
the other Party to the extent reasonably practicable; (ii) information that is
or becomes available to the receiving Party on a non-confidential basis from a
source other than the other Parties and not obtained in violation of this
Agreement; (iii) information that is independently developed by the receiving
party without reference to or use of any information obtained in connection with
this Agreement; and (iv) information known to the public or otherwise in the
public domain without violation of this Section 9.9, provided, further, that
this Section 9.9 shall not in any way limit the disclosure of information by
Parent, the Subsidiaries, NCO or Purchaser (a) to the extent reasonably required
in connection with the commencement and prosecution of the Seller Parties'
Chapter 11 Cases or (b) regarding Parent, the Subsidiaries and the Acquired
Business (i) to other bidders or potential bidders to the extent specifically
permitted by this Agreement or (ii) following the termination of this Agreement.

         9.10 Employment Matters.

                  (a) Employment Offers. Purchaser, in conjunction with Parent,
shall be permitted to meet with and interview all senior management of Parent
and the Subsidiaries. Purchaser shall offer employment to all employees of
Parent or the Subsidiaries, as of the Closing Date, in connection with the
purchase of the Acquired Business, with each such offer being contingent on
completion of the Closing and subject to Purchaser's ability to terminate the
employment of any Transferred Employee (as defined below) at any time following
the Closing Date. Purchaser shall not and shall not permit any of its Affiliates
to, prior to the last day of the Auction, solicit any employees of Parent or the
Subsidiaries other than (i) with the prior written permission of Parent or (ii)
in accordance with a general plan for the recruitment of employees agreed with
Parent and the Subsidiaries. Each employee of Parent or the Subsidiaries who
accepts Purchaser's offer of employment as of the Closing shall be referred to
herein as a "Transferred Employee." Parent shall, or shall cause the applicable
Subsidiary to, terminate all Transferred Employees as of the Closing Date. In
addition to any severance obligations under the terms of the KERP or under any
other Contract specified in Schedule 5.5(d) of the Seller Disclosure Letter
between any employee and a Seller Party, Purchaser shall pay severance in an
amount determined under the terms of the Purchaser's severance pay guidelines
and procedures to any employee of Parent or the Subsidiaries who does not become
a Transferred Employee and to any Transferred Employee whose employment is
terminated without cause (as defined in Purchaser's employment guidelines and
procedures) on or prior to the first anniversary of the Closing Date.

                  (b) Compensation and Benefit Plans. Effective as of the
Closing Date, Purchaser will offer to all Transferred Employees compensation
packages and benefit plans equivalent to those offered to similarly situated
employees of Purchaser, except that all benefit plans shall immediately credit
service for Transferred Employees and their eligible dependents as set forth in
Section 9.10(c) regardless of whether such service crediting terms would apply

                                       35
<PAGE>

to similarly situated employees of Purchaser. Purchaser shall assume the
vacation and sick pay accruals of all employees of Parent and the Subsidiaries
to the extent accrued on the Final Closing Statement and shall permit each
Transferred Employee to use such accrued vacation and sick leave following the
Closing in accordance with the terms of Purchaser's vacation and sick pay
policies, and, if such Transferred Employee is terminated without cause (as
defined in Purchaser's employment guidelines and procedures)on or prior to the
first anniversary of the Closing Date, pay to each Transferred Employee the
amount of accrued vacation and sick pay not so used. As soon as the Final
Closing Statement is prepared, Purchaser shall pay to RMA Management Services,
Inc. the amount of any vacation and sick pay accruals for any employee of Parent
or the Subsidiaries who does not become a Transferred Employee to the extent
such amount is accrued on the Final Closing Statement.

                  (c) Credited Service. Effective as of the Closing Date,
Purchaser, for purposes of its benefit plans and other employee benefits, agrees
to immediately recognize all service of the Transferred Employees and their
eligible dependents with the Seller Parties (to the same extent as the Seller
Parties so recognized as of the Closing Date) for the purpose of determining
eligibility, entitlement and vesting, including but not limited to, Purchaser's
401(k) plan, severance and vacation policies.

                  (d) Health Plans. Subject to the terms of the KERP, Purchaser
shall, effective as of the Closing Date, provide Transferred Employees and their
eligible dependents with coverage under group health plans which is the same as
provided to similarly situated employees of Purchaser, except that such group
health plans shall immediately credit service for Transferred Employees and
their eligible dependents as set forth in Section 9.10(c) regardless of whether
such service crediting terms would apply to similarly situated employees of
Purchaser.

                  (e) Reimbursement. Within five (5) Business Days after receipt
of an invoice from any Seller Party, Purchaser shall reimburse such Seller Party
for (i) the health and dental benefits incurred on or prior to the Closing Date
and actually paid by such Seller Party on or after the Closing Date under the
terms of the Seller Parties' health and dental plans in a total amount not to
exceed the amount accrued for such health and dental benefits on the Pre-Closing
Statement (as the same may be adjusted by the Final Closing Statement) and (ii)
the cost of the monthly premium to retain in effect the stop-loss insurance
coverage associated with the Seller Parties' health and dental plans for the 12
months following the month in which the Closing Date occurs in a total amount
not to exceed $550,000 (it being agreed that, to the extent such insurance
coverage is not obtained and therefore any portion of the $550,000 is not used
as contemplated by the foregoing, then, in addition to the amounts received
under subsection (i) hereof, the Seller Parties shall be entitled to receive
such available portion to cover the health and dental benefits actually paid by
any Seller Party under the terms of the Seller Parties' health and dental
plans).

                  (f) COBRA. Purchaser shall be solely responsible for complying
with the requirements of COBRA for any individual who is an "M&A qualified
beneficiary" as defined in Q&A-4 of Treas. Reg. ss. 54.4980B-9 in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

                                       36
<PAGE>

                  (g) 401(k). Effective as of the Closing Date, Purchaser shall
either (i) assume the sponsorship of and all assets and liabilities associated
with Seller Parties' 401(k) Plan or (ii) terminate such 401(k) Plan. Effective
as of the Closing Date, Purchaser shall also assume all costs and expenses of
such termination and fully indemnify and hold harmless such Plan's Trustees with
respect to Purchaser's acts or inactions in connection with terminating the
401(k) Plan. Effective as of the Closing Date, Purchaser shall also fully
indemnify and hold harmless such Plan's current and former fiduciaries who are
or were officers, directors, or employees of Seller Parties for any liabilities
incurred by said fiduciaries as a result of any action that Purchaser takes or
fails to take in connection with the termination of the 401(k) Plan. The Parties
agree to work together in a reasonable manner to accomplish the foregoing.

                  (h) KERP. Purchaser acknowledges that RMA Management Services,
Inc. has implemented a Key Employee Retention Plan (as such shall be modified as
described below, the "KERP") in order to provide certain employees with an
incentive to remain committed to the business of the Seller Parties, both before
and after the Closing. Each participant under the KERP (a "KERP Participant")
has previously executed a letter agreement (individually, a "KERP Letter" and,
collectively, the "KERP Letters") wherein such KERP Participant's benefits under
the KERP are particularly described. Purchaser has previously been provided the
forms of the KERP Letters in addition to a current listing (pursuant to Section
5.4 of the Seller Disclosure Letter) of the KERP Participants. For the benefit
of the KERP Participants, Purchaser agrees and acknowledges that the KERP
Letters shall be on the list of Assigned Contracts and Leases on Schedule 2.1(b)
and Purchaser shall assume and discharge all liabilities (such liabilities to be
Assumed Liabilities hereunder) arising under the KERP, irrespective of whether
any particular KERP Participant is a Transferred Employee. Purchaser agrees
that, prior to the Closing Date, RMA Management Services, Inc. shall execute and
deliver a supplemental letter to each KERP Participant in order to effectuate a
number of clarifications and modifications to the KERP and the KERP Letters, as
follows: (i) first, the letter shall state that Purchaser agrees and
acknowledges that the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall be deemed a "Sale" under the KERP Letters and shall therefore
entitle the KERP Participants to receive the retention bonuses and, to the
extent applicable, the health, welfare and severance benefits described in the
KERP Letters and, in furtherance thereof, Purchaser shall assume and discharge
all liabilities (such liabilities to be Assumed Liabilities hereunder) arising
under the KERP irrespective of whether any particular KERP Participant is a
Transferred Employee; (ii) second, the letter shall state that, after the
Closing, any resignation of a KERP Participant as a result of such KERP
Participant's refusal to relocate to a location that is either outside of a
fifty (50) mile radius of, or more than a one-hour commute from, such KERP
Participant's residential address shall, for purposes of the KERP Letters, be
considered an involuntary termination without "Cause" (as defined in the KERP
Letters); (iii) third, the letter shall state that, for the avoidance of doubt,
each KERP Participant eligible for salary continuance, and to the extent
applicable health and welfare benefits, under the KERP shall receive such salary
continuance and health and welfare benefits if such KERP Participant chooses to
separate from employment after the Closing because he or she did not retain
after the Closing both (x) the same or similar position level and (y) the same
or similar duties; and (iv) fourth, the letter shall state that, for purposes of
continuation coverage under COBRA, the COBRA event shall be deemed to occur on
the last day of the salary continuance period.

                                       37
<PAGE>

                  (i) Other Liabilities. Purchaser agrees that, prior to the
Closing Date, Parent, Holdings and Dennis Cunningham shall execute the Third
Amendment and Acknowledgment to Senior Management Agreement (the "Third
Amendment"), substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit 9.10(i). The
Cunningham Agreement shall be on the list of Assigned Contracts and Leases on
Schedule 2.1(b) and Purchaser shall assume and discharge all liabilities arising
thereunder (such liabilities to be Assumed Liabilities hereunder). Further, for
the twelve-month period following the termination of his employment, Dennis
Cunningham shall receive health and welfare benefits enjoyed by similarly
situated employees of Purchaser (only to the extent, however, of the accrual on
the Final Closing Statement with respect to the employer's share of the cost to
provide such health and welfare benefits).

                  (j) FSAs. Effective as of the Closing Date, Purchaser shall
assume the administration and termination of the Risk Management Alternatives
Holdings, Inc. Flexible Benefit Plan subject to the Final Closing Statement
providing an adequate accrual for all employee contributions thereto through the
Closing Date.

         9.11 WARN Act.

                  (a) Purchaser shall assume all obligations and liabilities for
the provision of notice or payment in lieu of notice or any applicable penalties
under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (the "WARN Act") or
any similar state or local law arising as a result of the consummation of the
transactions described herein.

                  (b) Purchaser shall not, at any time prior to ninety (90) days
after the Closing Date, effectuate a "plant closing" or "mass layoff" as those
terms are defined in the WARN Act affecting the current employees of any Seller
Party without complying fully with WARN Act.

         9.12 2004 Audited Financial Statements. Prior to the Closing, Parent
shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to obtain and deliver to Purchaser the
following audited consolidated financial statements of Parent and the
Subsidiaries: a balance sheet as of the fiscal year ended December 31, 2004 and
the related statement of income for the fiscal year than ended, and notes
thereto.

         9.13 Guidelines and Procedures.

As soon as practicable after the date hereof, Purchaser shall provide Parent
with a true, correct and complete copy (or, if unwritten, a summary thereof) of
the severance pay guidelines and procedures referenced in Section 9.10 above,
together with a true definition of "cause" as currently defined in the
employment guidelines and procedures referenced in Section 9.10 above.

         9.14 Additional Matters and Further Assurances.

                  (a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Agreement, each Party shall use its Commercially Reasonable Efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable, consistent with applicable laws, to consummate
and make effective in the most expeditious manner practicable the transactions
contemplated hereby, including satisfying the conditions to consummation of such
transactions.

<PAGE>

                  (b) In addition to the provisions of this Agreement, from time
to time after the Closing Date, the Seller Parties and Purchaser will use
Commercially Reasonable Efforts to execute and deliver such other instruments of
conveyance, transfer or assumption, as the case may be, and take such other
actions as may be reasonably requested to implement more effectively, the
conveyance, transfer and operation, as applicable, of the Acquired Assets and
Acquired Business to or by Purchaser (including the assumption by Purchaser of
the Assumed Liabilities).

                                   TERMINATION

         10.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated and the transactions
contemplated hereby abandoned at any time prior to the Closing in the following
manner:

                  (a) by mutual written consent of Parent and Purchaser;

                  (b) by either Parent or Purchaser (provided that such Party
(and in the case of Parent, including each Subsidiary) is not then in material
breach of any provision of this Agreement), upon written notice to the other
Parties, if the Closing shall not have occurred on or before 11:59 p.m.,
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania time, by October 7, 2005;

                  (c) (i) by Seller Parties (x) contemporaneously with the entry
of an order of the Bankruptcy Court approving an Alternative Transaction, or (y)
if the Alternative Transaction is being consummated through a plan of
reorganization or liquidation, at any time concurrently with or prior to the
substantial consummation (as that term is defined in the Bankruptcy Code) of
such plan of reorganization or liquidation, or (ii) by Purchaser upon the
consummation of any Alternative Transaction;

                  (d) by Purchaser, upon written notice to the other Parties, if
there shall have been a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement set forth in this Agreement on the part of a Seller Party, which
breach gives rise to Purchaser's right not to close and is incapable of cure or,
if capable of cure, shall not have been cured within ten (10) days following
receipt by the breaching Party of written notice of such breach;

                  (e) by Purchaser or the Seller Parties (i) if the Bidding
Procedures Order is not entered on or before the Outside Bidding Procedures
Order Date, or (ii) if the Bankruptcy Court enters an order (a "Non-Conforming
Bidding Procedures Order") with respect to the bidding procedures for the sale
of all or a substantial portion of the Acquired Assets (including any break-up
fee and/or expense reimbursement provisions), which order does not meet in any
material respect the terms of the Break-Up Fee, Expense Reimbursement Fee or the
bid procedures as contemplated by Section 9.7 hereof or the Bidding Procedures
Motion, unless the circumstances described in clause (i) or (ii) were due to the
failure of the party seeking to terminate this Agreement to perform in any
material respect its obligations under this Agreement required to be performed
by it at or prior to the Outside Bidding Procedures Order Date; provided,
however, that any termination right under subsection 10.1(e)(i) must be
exercised on or before the first Business Day after the Outside Bidding

must be exercised on or before the conclusion of the hearing at which the

<PAGE>

                  (f) by Parent, upon written notice to Purchaser, if there
shall have been a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
set forth in this Agreement on the part of Purchaser, which breach gives rise to
Parent's right not to close and is incapable of cure or, if capable of cure,
shall not have been cured within ten (10) days following receipt by Purchaser of
written notice of such breach;

                  (g) by Purchaser or the Seller Parties (i) if the Sale Order
is not entered on or before the Outside Sale Order Date or (ii) if the
Bankruptcy Court enters an order (a "Non-Conforming Sale Order") approving the
sale of all or any substantial portion of the Acquired Assets to Purchaser,
which sale order does not satisfy in any material respect the definition of Sale
Order set forth herein, unless the circumstances described in clause (i) or (ii)
were due to failure of the party seeking to terminate this Agreement to perform
in any material respect its obligations under this Agreement required to be
performed by it at or prior to the Outside Sale Order Date; provided, however,
that any termination right under subsection 10.1(g)(i) must be exercised on or
before the third Business Day after the Outside Sale Order Date, and any
termination right under subsection 10.1(g)(ii) must be exercised on or before
the third Business Day after the entry of the Non-Conforming Sale Order by the
Bankruptcy Court;

                  (h) by Purchaser, if the Bankruptcy Court converts the Seller
Parties' Chapter 11 Cases to a case under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code,
appoints a Chapter 11 trustee or dismisses the Seller Parties' Chapter 11 Cases;
or

                  (i) by Purchaser, if the Seller Parties (other than the
Foreign Subsidiaries) file a proposed plan of reorganization or liquidation in
the Seller Parties' Chapter 11 Cases which does not provide for the consummation
with Purchaser of the transactions set forth herein in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement.

         10.2 Procedure and Effect of Termination. Except as set forth in this
paragraph, upon any termination of this Agreement, all rights and obligations of
the Parties hereunder shall terminate without any liability or obligation of any
Party to any other Party, provided that Sections 9.7(d), 9.9, this Section 10.2,
and Article XI shall survive such termination. In the event that this Agreement
is terminated pursuant to Section 10.1(f) above, the Deposit Amount (or an
amount equal to the Deposit Amount if such termination occurs prior to the
Purchaser's funding of the Deposit Amount as contemplated herein) and any
interest accrued thereon shall be paid to Parent and the Subsidiaries in
accordance with the Escrow Agreement (or, if such termination occurs prior to
the Purchasers' funding of the Deposit Amount, within five (5) Business Days
after such termination). In the event this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
any subsection of Section 10.1 other than subsection (f), the Deposit Amount and
any interest accrued thereon shall be paid to Purchaser in accordance with the
Escrow Agreement. The Break-Up Fee and the Expense Reimbursement Fee shall in
all events be payable under the circumstances and in accordance with the timing
set forth in Section 9.7(d). Any amounts paid to a Party under Section 9.7(d) or
this Section 10.2, including the Break-Up Fee, Expense Reimbursement Fee and the
Deposit Amount (or an amount equal to the Deposit Amount if such termination

                                       40
<PAGE>

occurs prior to the Purchaser's funding of the Deposit Amount as contemplated
herein), shall constitute liquidated damages, and no Party shall have any
further liability or obligation as a result of such termination. The Parties
acknowledge and agree that if this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section
10.1, the actual damages incurred will be difficult, if not impossible, to
ascertain and accordingly, the Parties have provided for the liquidated damages
provided above. It is further agreed that this provision shall not be construed
as a penalty, but as a bona fide attempt to establish an agreed measure of
damages which Seller and the Subsidiaries or Purchaser, as the case may be, will
suffer as a result of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to such
Sections.

                                   ARTICLE XI

the Parties hereto and consented to in writing by the Bank Agent. Except as
otherwise expressly set forth herein, no failure or delay by any Party hereto in
exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder (and no course of dealing
between or among any of the parties) shall operate as a waiver of any such
right, power or privilege. No waiver of any default on any one occasion shall
constitute a waiver of any subsequent or other default.

jurisdiction on the courts referred to above, and irrevocably and
unconditionally waives any objection to the venue of such courts, and further
irrevocably and unconditionally waives and agrees not to plead or claim in any
such court that any lawsuit, action or other Proceeding brought in any such

service of process upon him, her or it by mailing or delivering such service to
the address set forth in Section 11.1 hereof.

         11.10 Rules of Construction. The Parties hereto agree that they have
been represented by counsel during the negotiation and execution of this
Agreement and, therefore, waive the application of any law, regulation, holding
or rule of construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other
document will be construed against the Party drafting such agreement or
document.

shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties and their
successors and assigns. Neither this Agreement, nor the rights to acquire the
Acquired Assets, nor any of the rights, interests, or obligations hereunder

the other Parties provided that no such written consent of any other Party shall
be required for Purchaser to (i) assign or delegate any of its rights and

of any equity interests or securities of any Party (whether such holder is a
limited or general partner, member, stockholder or otherwise), nor any Affiliate
of any Party, nor any representative of each of the Parties and their respective
Affiliates, shall have any right, liability or obligation arising under this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

calculation of Working Capital shall take into account the same components
(i.e., line items) of, and adjustments to, the working capital reflected by the
April WC Amount. Further to the preceding sentence, except as otherwise provided
in the footnotes to the Working Capital Schedule, any such calculation of
Working Capital shall be determined in accordance with the same accounting
methods, policies, practices and procedures, with consistent classifications,
judgments and estimation methodology, as were used in the preparation of the
April WC Amount (with GAAP applied in a manner consistent with GAAP applied to
the consolidated balance sheet of Parent and the Subsidiaries as of December 31,
2004). The Parties agree that the purpose of determining Working Capital
hereunder is to measure changes in working capital without the introduction
(except as otherwise provided in the footnotes to the Working Capital Schedule)
of different accounting methods, policies, practices, procedures,
classifications, judgments or estimation methodologies from those used in the
preparation of the April WC Amount. At Closing, the KERP accrual will consist of
the aggregate amount of (i) the "Retention Bonus Payments" payable under the
KERP, (ii) the employer taxes attributable to such payments and (iii) the
maximum amount of the employer's share of the cost to provide the health and
welfare benefits provided under the KERP. In addition, at Closing, the accounts
receivable balance will be reduced by any known refunds, discounts, rights of
setoff or assignments affecting such accounts receivable.
