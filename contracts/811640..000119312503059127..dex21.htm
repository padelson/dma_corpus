ARTICLE 2



EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK

OF THE COMPANY AND MERGER SUB 



2.01 _Effect on Shares of Capital Stock_

 



(a) _Common Shares of the Company_. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any Common
Shares, the Company or Merger Sub, each Common Share that is issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than (i) Dissenting
Shares, (ii) those Common Shares to be canceled pursuant to _Section 2.01(b)_
and (iii) those Common Shares (the " _Rollover Shares_ "; each of which is
listed on the _Rollover Conversion Schedule_ attached hereto) to be
contributed to Melita in exchange for equity interests of Melita (the "
_Rollover_ ") (it being acknowledged that no party hereto makes any
representation and warranty regarding the tax treatment of the Rollover) shall
be canceled and extinguished and converted into the right to receive $12.00
in cash (the " _Merger Consideration_ "), payable to the holder thereof,
without interest or dividends thereon, less any applicable withholding of
taxes, in the manner provided in _Section 2.03_. All such Common Shares, when
so converted, shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
canceled and each holder of a certificate or certificates representing any
such Common Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto,
except the right to receive the consideration specified in the preceding
sentence.



(b) _Cancellation of Certain Common Shares_. As of the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any
Common Shares, the Company or Merger Sub, each Common Share that is owned by
the Company or any wholly owned subsidiary as treasury stock or otherwise or
owned by Merger Sub or Melita or any of their respective affiliates
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be canceled and
shall cease to exist, and no cash or other consideration shall be delivered
or deliverable in exchange therefor; provided, however, that existing
employees of the Company (who were not otherwise affiliates of Merger Sub or
Melita prior to the date hereof) shall not be deemed affiliates of Merger Sub
or Melita for purposes of this _Section 1.04(b)_ by operation of any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the " _Transactions_ ") or
pursuant to any employment or consulting arrangement entered into by such
persons with Merger Sub or Melita in connection with the Merger or this
Agreement.



(c) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. As of the Effective Time, each share of
common stock, par value $.01 per share, of Merger Sub (" _Merger Sub Common
Stock_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part  



 

3  of the holders of Merger Sub Common Stock, the Company or Merger Sub, be
converted into one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of
common stock, par value $.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation ("
_Surviving Corporation Common Stock_ "). Each certificate that, immediately
prior to the Effective Time, represented issued and outstanding shares of
Merger Sub Common Stock shall, from and after the Effective Time,
automatically and without the necessity of presenting the same for exchange,
represent the shares of the Surviving Corporation capital stock into which
such shares have been converted pursuant to the terms hereof; provided,
however, that the record holder thereof shall receive, upon surrender of any
such certificate, a certificate representing the shares of Surviving
Corporation Common Stock into which the shares of Merger Sub Common
Stock formerly represented thereby shall have been converted pursuant to the
terms hereof.



(d) _Rollover Shares_. As of the Effective Time, each Rollover Share shall, by
virtue of a contribution agreement (the " _Contribution Agreement_ ") entered
into on or prior to the Closing Date, by and among Melita and each holder of
Rollover Shares, be converted into and become the number of validly issued,
fully paid and non-assessable shares of such class of common stock of Melita
(the " _Rollover Share Exchange Consideration_ ") equal to (i) the Merger
Consideration divided by (ii) the fair market value per share of such class of
Melita common shares into which the Rollover Shares are to be converted.
Subject to the terms and conditions of the Contribution Agreement, each
certificate that, immediately prior to the Effective Time, represented
Rollover Shares shall, from and after the Effective Time, automatically and
without the necessity of presenting the same for exchange, represent
the shares of Melita into which such shares have been converted pursuant to
the terms of the Contribution Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
record holder thereof shall receive, upon surrender of any such certificate, a
certificate representing the shares of Melita capital stock into which the
Rollover Shares formerly represented thereby shall have been converted
pursuant to the terms of the Contribution Agreement.



(e) _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, any Common Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and held by a holder (a " _Dissenting Stockholder_ ") who has
not voted in favor of the Merger or consented thereto in writing and who has
properly demanded appraisal for such Common Shares in accordance with the
DGCL (" _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into a right to receive
the Merger Consideration at the Effective Time in accordance with _Section
2.01(a)_ hereof, but shall represent and become the right to receive such
consideration as may be determined to be due to such Dissenting Stockholder
pursuant to the laws of the State of Delaware, unless and until such holder
fails to perfect or withdraws or otherwise loses such holders right to
appraisal and payment under the DGCL. If, after the Effective Time, such
holder fails to perfect or withdraws or otherwise loses such holders right to
appraisal, such former Dissenting Shares held by such holder shall be treated
as if they had been converted as of the Effective Time into a right to
receive, upon surrender as provided above, the Merger Consideration, without
any interest or dividends thereon, in accordance with _Section 2.01(a)_. The
Company shall give Merger Sub prompt notice of any demands received by the
Company for appraisal of Common Shares, withdrawals of such demands and any
other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company, and
Merger Sub shall have the right to direct all negotiations and proceedings
with respect to such demands. The Company shall not, except with the prior
written consent of Merger Sub, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or
delayed, make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any
such demands.



2.02 _Options; Stock Plans_  



(a) For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Option_ " means each
outstanding unexercised option to purchase Common Shares, whether or not then
vested or fully exercisable, granted on or prior to the date hereof to any
current or former employee or director of the Company or any  



 

4  subsidiary of the Company or any other person under any stock option plan or
similar plan of the Company or in connection with any employment, consulting
or other agreement or other arrangement approved by the Company Board with
the Company or any subsidiary of the Company on or prior to the date hereof
(including, without limitation, under the Companys Amended and Restated 1986
Stock Plan, as amended, the Companys Amended and Restated 1988 Non-Employee
Director Stock Option Plan (the " _Non-Employee Director Plan_ "), the
Companys 1994 Stock Plan, the Companys 1996 Stock Plan, as amended, the
Companys 2000 Stock Option Plan, as amended, and the Companys 2001 Stock
Option Plan) (collectively, the " _Stock Plans_ ").



(b) As part of the Transactions, the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to ensure that (i) immediately prior to the Effective Time,
each outstanding Option granted under the Stock Plans held by those holders
of record listed on the _Option Schedule_ attached hereto under the heading
"Cash-Pay Options" (the " _Cash-Pay Options_ ") shall become
immediately vested and exercisable in full and (ii) at the Effective Time,
all Options (other than Rollover Options) shall be canceled, in each case, in
accordance with and pursuant to the terms of the Stock Plans under which such
Options were granted. In consideration of such cancellation, each holder of a
Cash-Pay Option canceled in accordance with this _Section 2.02(b)_ will be
entitled to receive in settlement of such Cash-Pay Option as promptly as
practicable following the Effective Time, but in no event later than 10
business days after the Effective Time, a cash payment from the Payment Fund
(as defined in _Section 2.03_ ), subject to any required withholding of taxes,
equal to the product of (i) the total number of Common Shares otherwise
issuable upon exercise of such Cash-Pay Option and (ii) the excess, if any, of
the Merger Consideration per Common Share less the applicable exercise price
per Common Share otherwise issuable upon exercise of such Cash-Pay
Option (the " _Cash-Pay Option Consideration_ "); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that with respect to any person subject to Section 16(a) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the " _Exchange Act_ "), any such amount
shall be paid as soon as practicable after the first date payment can be made
without liability to such person under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act. For
the avoidance of doubt, the unvested portion of the Options granted under
the Non-Employee Director Plan as of the Effective Time shall be canceled
without payment of any consideration and without any further liability to the
Company or the Surviving Corporation and shall not be accelerated, and the
holders of Options granted under the Non-Employee Director Plan shall be
entitled to the Cash-Pay Option Consideration pursuant to this _Section
2.02(b)_ only to the extent of the vested portion of such Options. In
addition, the Company Board will fully accelerate the vesting schedule of the
Options issued under the Companys 2001 Stock Option Plan.



(c) The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to cause each holder of an
Option issued pursuant to the Non-Employee Director Plan to execute a written
acknowledgment of such holder that (i) the payment of the Cash-Pay Option
Consideration, if any, will satisfy in full the Companys obligation to such
person pursuant to such Option and (ii) subject to the payment of the Cash-Pay
Option Consideration, if any, such Option held by such holder shall, without
any action on the part of the Company or the holder, be deemed terminated,
canceled, void and of no further force and effect as between the Company and
the holder and neither party shall have any further rights or obligations with
respect thereto and (iii) that the unvested portion of any Option issued
pursuant to the Non-Employee Director Plan held by such holder shall be
canceled without payment of any consideration and without any further
liability to the Company or the Surviving Corporation. Such written
acknowledgment shall be substantially in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit
2.02(c)_.



(d) At the Effective Time, each outstanding Option (each, a " _Rollover
Option_ "; each of which is listed on the _Rollover Option Conversion
Schedule_ attached hereto) as to which the holder thereof has executed and
delivered to Melita a conversion agreement (a " _Conversion Agreement_ ")
shall be converted pursuant to the terms of such Conversion Agreement (the "
_Rollover Option Consideration_ "). Each Conversion Agreement shall provide
for, among other things, that the option to be issued by Melita  



 

5  will have an "embedded value" (determined by calculating the difference
between the exercise price of such option to be issued by Melita and
the value of the securities covered by such option to be issued by Melita (on
a fully vested basis, unless otherwise agreed to by Melita and the holder of
such Rollover Option) at the Effective Time) equal to (i) the product of (A)
the total number of Common Shares otherwise issuable upon exercise of such
Rollover Option and (B) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration per
Common Share less the applicable exercise price per Common Share otherwise
issuable upon exercise of such Rollover Option, minus (ii) the value of any
other consideration granted to such Rollover Option holder in connection with
the granting of such options to be issued by Melita.



(e) In the event the holder of an Option does not, prior to the Effective
Time, either (i) have his or her applicable Cash-Pay Options canceled in
exchange for the right to receive Cash-Pay Option Consideration in accordance
with the terms specified in _Section 2.02(b)_ or (ii) execute and deliver to
the Company a Conversion Agreement, such Option shall be assumed by Melita
and be adjusted to instead be exercisable for equity securities of Melita to
the extent of, and in accordance with, the terms of the applicable Options and
Stock Plans in effect immediately prior to the date hereof.



(f) With respect to the Companys 1991 Employee Stock Purchase Plan,
as amended (the " _Purchase Plan_ "), the Company shall (i) take all actions
thereunder to terminate all outstanding options under the Purchase Plan (each,
a " _Purchase Plan Cash Option_ " and collectively, the " _Purchase Plan Cash
Options_ ") at the close of business on the day immediately prior to the
Effective Time and (ii) in consideration for such termination, provide each of
the participants thereunder, in lieu of Common Shares that would have
otherwise been issuable upon the exercise of the outstanding Purchase Plan
Cash Options, both the amount of the refund to which the participant is
entitled pursuant to Article 15 of the Purchase Plan upon the termination of
such plan and a cash payment from the Payment Fund, subject to any required
withholding of taxes, equal to the product of (A) the total number of Common
Shares the participant would have otherwise been issued upon the exercise of
the Purchase Plan Cash Options (determined with reference only to the first
business day of the applicable Payment Period (as defined in the Purchase
Plan)) and (B) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the
applicable Option Price (as defined in the Purchase Plan);  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that with respect to any person subject to Section 16(a) of the
Exchange Act, any such amount shall be paid as soon as practicable after the
first date payment can be made without liability to such person under Section
16(b) of the Exchange Act.



(g) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to take all actions (including, if appropriate, amending the terms of
the relevant Stock Plans or the Purchase Plan or amending or waiving relevant
agreements providing for vesting conditions on Common Shares or Options
therefor) that are necessary to give effect to the transactions contemplated
by this _Section 2.02_.



(h) Except as otherwise provided herein or agreed to in writing by Merger Sub
and the Company or as may be necessary to administer Options
remaining outstanding following the Effective Time, the Stock Plans and the
Purchase Plan shall terminate effective as of the Effective Time and no
participant in the Stock Plans or the Purchase Plan shall thereafter be
granted any rights thereunder to acquire any equity securities of the
Company, the Surviving Corporation, Melita or any subsidiary of any of the
foregoing.



(i) The Company covenants that prior to the Effective Time it will take all
actions necessary under that certain SEC no-action letter, dated January
12, 1999, to Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom, to provide that the
cancellation and cash-out and conversion of Cash-Pay Options and the Purchase
Plan Cash Options and the adjustment of the Rollover Options, pursuant to this
_Section 2.02_ , will qualify for exemption under Rule 16b-3(d) or (e), as
applicable, under the Exchange Act.



2.03 _Payment for Common Shares and Options in the Merger_



 

6 (a) Prior to the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall appoint a commercial bank or
trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as exchange and
paying agent, registrar and transfer agent (the " _Agent_ ") for the purpose
of (i) exchanging certain certificates representing, immediately prior to the
Effective Time, Common Shares (other than Rollover Shares) for the aggregate
Merger Consideration, (ii) making payment of the aggregate Cash-Pay Option
Consideration in exchange for the cancellation of all Cash-Pay Options and
(iii) making payment of the aggregate Purchase Plan Cash Option Consideration
in exchange for the cancellation of the Purchase Plan Cash Options. Subject to
the Companys obligations to deposit cash in the Payment Fund described in
this _Section 2.03(a)_ , at or prior to the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall
deposit, or Merger Sub shall otherwise take all steps necessary to cause to be
deposited, in trust with the Agent for the benefit of the holders of Common
Shares (other than Rollover Shares), Cash-Pay Options and Purchase Plan
Cash Options, as the case may be, cash in an aggregate amount equal to the
sum of (i) the product of (A) the number of Common Shares issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and entitled to receive
the Merger Consideration in accordance with _Section 2.01(a)_ and (B) the
Merger Consideration and (ii) the amount necessary for the payment in full of
the Cash-Pay Option Consideration and the Purchase Plan Cash Option
Consideration (such aggregate amount described in (i) and (ii) being
hereinafter referred to as the " _Payment Fund_ "). At or prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall deposit, or the Company shall otherwise take
all steps necessary to cause to be deposited, in trust for the benefit of the
holders of Common Shares (other than Rollover Shares), Cash Pay Options and
Purchase Plan Cash Options, as the case may be, cash in an aggregate amount
(subject to the following sentence) of not less than $16 million with the
Agent for deposit into the Payment Fund (the " _Company Cash Deposit_ "),
which deposit shall be used solely and exclusively for purposes of paying the
consideration specified in _Section 2.02_ , and shall not be used to satisfy
any other obligations of the Company or any of its subsidiaries. Without
limiting the Companys obligations set forth in the preceding sentence, the
Company shall, as of the Effective Time, have sufficient unrestricted domestic
cash on hand to pay any unpaid Expenses contemplated by _Section 3.28_
(including, without limitation, those incurred or which may be incurred by the
Financial Advisor and counsel to the Company (including Expenses incurred in
connection with any litigation with respect to, arising from or related to
the Transactions) and the cost of the tail insurance policy referred to in
_Section 5.07(d)_ ) and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to deposit
all other available domestic cash of the Company (taking into account the
reasonable short-term working capital needs of the Company) with the Agent for
deposit into the Payment Fund. For purposes of determining the aggregate
amount of cash to be deposited by Merger Sub pursuant to this
_Section 2.03(a)_ , Merger Sub shall assume that no holder of Common Shares
will perfect their right to appraisal of their Common Shares under the DGCL.
The Agent shall, pursuant to instructions provided by Merger Sub, make the
payments provided for in  _Section 2.01_ and _Section 2.02_ of this Agreement
out of the Payment Fund (it being understood that any and all interest earned
on funds made available to the Agent pursuant to this Agreement shall be
turned over to the party depositing such funds with the Agent). The Payment
Fund shall not be used for any other purpose except as provided in this
Agreement.



(b) Promptly after the Effective Time, but in no event later than 10 business
days after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause
the Agent to mail to each record holder of certificates (the " _Certificates_
") that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented Common Shares
(excluding Rollover Shares) (i) a notice of the effectiveness of the Merger,
(ii) a form letter of transmittal which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon
proper delivery of the Certificates to the Agent and (iii) instructions for
use in surrendering such Certificates and receiving the Merger Consideration
in respect thereof.



(c) Upon surrender to the Agent of a Certificate, together with such letter of
transmittal duly executed and completed in accordance with the instructions
thereto, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive, within
10 business days after such surrender, in exchange therefor, in the case of
Common Shares (other than Rollover Shares and Common Shares to be canceled
pursuant  



 

7  to _Section 2.01(b)_ ), cash in an amount equal to the product of (i) the
number of Common Shares formerly represented by such Certificate and (ii)
the Merger Consideration, which amounts shall be paid by Agent by check or
wire transfer in accordance with the instructions provided by such holder. No
interest or dividends will be paid or accrued on the consideration payable
upon the surrender of any Certificate. If the consideration provided for
herein is to be delivered in the name of a person other than the person in
whose name the Certificate surrendered is registered, it shall be a condition
of such delivery that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly
endorsed or otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the person
requesting such delivery shall pay any transfer or other taxes required by
reason of such delivery to a person other than the registered holder of the
Certificate, or that such person shall establish to the satisfaction of the
Surviving Corporation that such tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until
surrendered in accordance with the provisions of this _Section 2.03_ , each
Certificate (other than Certificates representing Dissenting Shares or Common
Shares to be canceled pursuant to _Section 2.01(b)_ ) shall represent, for all
purposes, in the case of Certificates representing Common Shares (other than
Rollover Shares and Common Shares to be canceled pursuant to _Section
2.01(b)_ ), only the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the Merger
Consideration multiplied by the number of Common Shares formerly evidenced by
such Certificate without any interest or dividends thereon.



(d) The consideration issued upon the surrender of Certificates in accordance
with this Agreement shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction
of all rights pertaining to such Common Shares formerly represented thereby.
After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer
books of the Surviving Corporation of any Common Shares that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation, they shall
be canceled and exchanged as provided in this _Article 2_.



(e) Any portion of the Payment Fund (including any amounts that may be payable
to the former stockholders of the Company in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement) which remains unclaimed by the former stockholders of the Company
upon the 180th day immediately following the Closing Date shall be returned
to the Surviving Corporation, upon demand, and any former stockholders of the
Company who have not theretofore complied with this _Article 2_ shall, subject
to _Section 2.03(f)_ , thereafter look to the Surviving Corporation only as
general unsecured creditors thereof for payment of any Merger Consideration,
without any interest or dividends thereon, that may be payable in respect of
each Common Share held by such stockholder. Following the Closing, the Agent
shall retain the right to invest and reinvest the Payment Fund on behalf of
the Surviving Corporation in securities listed or guaranteed by the United
States government or certificates of deposit of commercial banks that have, or
are members of a group of commercial banks that has, consolidated total assets
of not less than $500,000,000 and the Surviving Corporation shall receive the
interest earned thereon.



(f) None of Merger Sub, the Company or Agent shall be liable to a holder of
Certificates or any other person in respect of any cash delivered to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar law. If any Certificates shall not have been surrendered upon the
seventh anniversary of the Closing Date (or immediately prior to such earlier
date on which any Merger Consideration, dividends (whether in cash, stock or
property) or other distributions with respect to Common Shares in respect of
such Certificate would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
Governmental Authority (as defined in  _Section 3.06(b)_ ) any such shares,
cash, dividends or distributions in respect of such Certificate shall, to the
extent permitted by applicable law, become the property of the Surviving
Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interests of any person
previously entitled thereto.



(g) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit (in form and substance acceptable to the
Surviving Corporation) of that fact by the person (who shall be the record
owner of such Certificate) claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such
person of a bond in such  



 

8  amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct as indemnity against any
claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Agent
will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the
Merger Consideration deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this
Agreement.



(h) Each of the Agent, the Surviving Corporation and Melita shall be entitled
to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any holder
of Common Shares, Options or Purchase Plan Cash Options pursuant to this
Agreement such amounts as may be required to be deducted or withheld with
respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
as amended (the " _Code_ "), or any applicable provision of state, local or
foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld and
paid over to the appropriate taxing authority by Agent, the Surviving
Corporation or Melita, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the person to whom such amounts would
otherwise have been paid.



ARTICLE 3



REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY



Except as set forth in the Companys SEC Reports (as defined below) filed on
or after January 1, 2002 (regardless of whether any representation
or warranty in this Article 3 is expressly qualified by a reference to such
SEC Reports) or in the disclosure schedule delivered by the Company to Merger
Sub and Melita prior to the execution of this Agreement (the " _Company
Disclosure Schedule_ ") (it being agreed that any disclosure set forth on any
particular Section of the Company Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed

formation, as the case may be, and has the requisite power and authority to

Agreement or to consummate the Transactions in accordance with the terms
hereof. As used in this Agreement, " _Excluded Matters_ " means any one or
more of the following effects, events or changes: (a) general changes in
economic conditions or changes in the software industry generally which do
not have a materially disproportionate effect on the Company and its
subsidiaries taken as a whole, (b) a change in the market price or trading
volume of the Common Shares, in and of itself, or any change in the financial
markets generally, (c) the effect of any change arising in connection with

3.03 _Capitalization_.



(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 30,000,000 Common

outstanding obligations of the Company or any of its subsidiaries to
repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any shares of capital stock of, or

Agreement and the Merger by the holders of a majority of the outstanding
Common Shares entitled to vote thereon, to consummate the Transactions
pursuant to the DGCL. The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
consummation of the Merger and the other Transactions have been duly and
validly authorized by all necessary corporate action and no other corporate
proceedings on the part of the Company are necessary to authorize the
Companys execution and delivery of this Agreement or to consummate the
Transactions (other than the adoption of this Agreement and the Merger by
the holders of a majority of the outstanding Common Shares entitled to vote
thereon and the filing or recordation of appropriate merger documents as
required by the DGCL). This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and

give rise to a loss of any benefit to which the Company or any subsidiary of
the Company is entitled under any provision of any contract, instrument,
permit, concession, franchise, license, loan or credit agreement, note, bond,
mortgage, indenture, lease or other property agreement, partnership or joint
venture agreement or other legally binding agreement, whether oral or

any subsidiary of the Company, except in the case of clauses (ii), (iii) and
(iv) of this _Section 3.06(a)_ , to the extent that any such conflict,
violation, breach, default, right, loss or Lien would not, individually or in
the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect.



(b) The execution and delivery by the Company of this Agreement does not,
and the performance of this Agreement and the consummation by the Company of
the Transactions will not, require any consent, approval, authorization or
permit of, or filing with or notification to, any domestic (federal, state or
local) or foreign government or governmental, regulatory or administrative
authority, agency, commission, board, bureau, court of instrumentality or
arbitrator of any kind (" _Governmental Authority_ "), except (i) for

_Section 2.02_ and _Section 2.03_ with respect to the Stock Plans and the
Purchase Plan and (iii) where the failure to obtain such consents, approvals,
authorizations or permits, or to make such filings or notifications, would
not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse
Effect.

documents (the " _SEC Reports_ ") with the Securities and Exchange Commission
(the " _SEC_ ") required to be filed by it pursuant to the federal securities

ARTICLE 4



REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF MERGER SUB AND MELITA



Except as set forth in the disclosure schedule delivered by Merger Sub and
Melita to the Company prior to the execution of this Agreement (the "
_Purchaser Disclosure Schedule_ ") (it being agreed that any disclosure set
forth on any particular schedule of the Purchaser Disclosure Schedule shall be
deemed disclosed in another schedule of the Purchase Disclosure Schedule
if disclosure with respect to the particular schedule is sufficient to make
reasonably clear the relevance of the disclosure to such other schedule), each
of Merger Sub and Melita jointly and severally represent and warrant to the
Company that: 



4.01 _Organization and Qualification_. Each of Merger Sub and Melita is a
corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing (to the
extent such concept is relevant in such jurisdiction) under the laws of its
jurisdiction of formation and has the requisite power and authority to carry
on its business as now being conducted, except where the failure to be in
good standing would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Purchaser
Material Adverse Effect (as defined below). Each of Merger Sub and Melita is
duly qualified or licensed as a foreign corporation to do business, and is in
good standing, in each jurisdiction where the nature of its business makes
such qualification or licensing necessary, except where the failure to be so
qualified or licensed and in good standing would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect. As used in this
Agreement, the term " _Purchaser Material Adverse Effect_ " means any effect,
event or change that prevents or materially delays, or is reasonably likely
to prevent or materially delay, the ability of Melita, Merger Sub and Melita
Inc. to perform in all material respects their obligations under this
Agreement or to consummate the Transactions in accordance with the terms
hereof.



4.02 _Charter Documents and Bylaws_. Melita has heretofore made available to
the Company a complete and correct copy of the amended and restated articles
of association of Melita in full force and effect as of the date hereof.
Melita is not in violation of any of the provisions of its amended and
restated articles of association. Melita has heretofore made available to the
Company a complete and correct copy of the certificate of incorporation and
the bylaws (or equivalent organizational documents) of each subsidiary of
Melita in full force and effect as of the date hereof. No subsidiary of
Melita is in violation of any of the provisions of its certificate of
incorporation or bylaws (or equivalent organizational documents).



4.03 _Authority Relative to this Agreement_. Each of Merger Sub and Melita
has the requisite corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this
Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder and to consummate the
Transactions. The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
consummation of the Merger and the other Transactions have been duly and
validly authorized by all necessary corporate action and no other corporate
proceedings on the part of Merger Sub or Melita are necessary to authorize
their execution and delivery of this Agreement or to consummate the
Transactions (other than the filing and recordation of appropriate merger
documents as required by the DGCL). This Agreement has been duly and validly
executed and delivered by each of Merger Sub and Melita, and (assuming
this Agreement constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the Company)
constitutes the valid and binding obligations of each of Merger Sub and
Melita, enforceable against them in accordance  



 

24  with its respective terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws relating to creditors
rights generally and to general principles of equity.



4.04  _Purchaser Subsidiaries_. _Section 4.04_ of the Purchaser Disclosure
Schedule contains a correct and complete list of each subsidiary of Melita and
the jurisdiction in which each such subsidiary is incorporated or organized.
_Section 4.04_ of the Purchaser Disclosure Schedule sets forth for each
subsidiary of Melita the holder or holders of its capital stock, each of which
is either Melita or one of its subsidiaries. Except for the capital stock of
its subsidiaries, Melita does not own, directly or indirectly, any capital
stock or other ownership interest in any Person. No subsidiary of Melita owns,
directly or indirectly, any capital stock or other ownership interest in any
Person, except for the capital stock and/or other ownership interest in
another wholly-owned subsidiary of Melita.



4.05 _No Violation; Required Filings and Consents_.



(a) The execution and delivery by each of Merger Sub and Melita of this
Agreement does not, and the performance of this Agreement and the consummation
by each of Merger Sub and Melita of the Transactions will not, (i) violate any
provision of Melitas amended and restated articles of association or violate
any provision of the certificate of incorporation or bylaws (or equivalent
organizational documents) of any subsidiary of Melita (including Merger Sub),
(ii) to the knowledge of Merger Sub and Melita, assuming that all consents,
approvals, authorizations and other actions described in _Section 4.05(b)_
have been obtained and all filings and obligations described in _Section
4.05(b)_ have been made or complied with, violate any Law applicable to
Melita or any of its subsidiaries or by which any asset of Melita or any of
its subsidiaries is bound or affected, (iii) to the knowledge of Merger Sub
and Melita, result in any breach of or constitute a default (or an event that
with notice or lapse of time or both would become a default) under, or give to
others any right of termination, amendment, acceleration or cancellation of,
or require any payment under, or give rise to a loss of any benefit to which
Melita or any subsidiary of Melita is entitled under any provision of any
Contract applicable to any of them or their respective properties or assets or
(iv) to the knowledge of Merger Sub and Melita, result in the creation or
imposition of a Lien on any asset of Melita or any of its subsidiaries,
except in the case of clauses (ii), (iii) and (iv) of this _Section 4.05(a)_ ,
to the extent that any such conflict, violation, breach, default, right, loss
or Lien would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Purchaser
Material Adverse Effect.



(b) The execution and delivery by each of Merger Sub and Melita of this
Agreement does not, and the performance of this Agreement and the consummation
by each of Merger Sub and Melita of the Transactions will not, require any
consent, approval, authorization or permit of, or filing with or notification
to, any Governmental Authority, except (i) for applicable requirements, if
any, of the Exchange Act, the Securities Act, Nasdaq, the HSR Act and the
rules and regulations thereunder, any required consent, approval,
authorization, permit, filing or notification pursuant to applicable foreign
merger control or competition laws and regulations and filing and recordation
of appropriate documents for the Merger as required by the DGCL and (ii)
where the failure to obtain such consents, approvals, authorizations or
permits, or to make such filings or notifications, would not, individually or
in the aggregate, have a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect. 



4.06 _Litigation_. As of the date hereof, there is no suit, claim, action,
proceeding or investigation pending or, to Melitas knowledge, threatened
against Melita or any of its subsidiaries, at law or in equity, that,
individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have
a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect. Neither Melita nor any of its
subsidiaries is subject to any outstanding order, writ, injunction or decree
that, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a
Purchaser Material Adverse Effect.



 

25 4.07 _Balance Sheet_. The balance sheet of Melita Inc., Melitas indirect
wholly-owned subsidiary, as of August 31, 2003 previously delivered to the
Financial Advisor (the " _Melita Inc. Balance Sheet_ ") has been prepared in
all material respects in accordance with United States generally accepted
accounting principles as in effect as of the date of such balance sheet
applied on a consistent basis (except as otherwise stated in such balance
sheet) and fairly presents, in all material respects, the financial position
of Melita Inc. as at August 31, 2003 (subject to the absence of footnotes and
to normal and recurring year-end adjustments, none of which, individually or
in the aggregate, has had or could reasonably be expected to have a Purchaser
Material Adverse Effect). Since August 31, 2003, Melita Inc. has not had, and
since such date Melita Inc. has not incurred, any liabilities or obligations
of any nature (whether accrued, absolute, contingent, determinable or
otherwise), except liabilities set forth on the face of the Melita Inc.
Balance Sheet, liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business and
consistent with past practice, liabilities incurred in connection with the
Transactions and liabilities that have not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Purchaser Material
Adverse Effect.

Company copies of the equity commitment letters pursuant to which Melita shall
obtain the funds necessary, together with the funds to be made available by
the Company pursuant to  _Section 2.03(a)_ , to pay the aggregate Merger
Consideration, Cash Pay Option Consideration and the Purchase Plan Cash Option
Consideration payable as of the Effective Time, together with all of Melitas
fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Transactions. For the
avoidance of doubt, it shall not be a condition to Closing for Melita to
obtain such funds, and the Company shall be entitled to pursue any and all
remedies available at law or in equity if Melita breaches this Agreement on
account of Melitas failure to obtain such funds on or before the Closing
Date.

based upon arrangements made by, or on behalf of, Melita or any of its
subsidiaries.

Merger Sub to the Company for inclusion in the Proxy Statement to be filed by
the Company with the SEC and to be sent to the stockholders of the Company in
connection with the Stockholders Meeting will, at the time it is sent to the
stockholders of the Company or at the time of the Company Stockholders
Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading.

In entering into this Agreement, Melita and Merger Sub have not been induced
by, or relied upon, any representations, warranties or statements by the

warranties and statements in _Article 3_ above, and Melita and Merger Sub:



(a) acknowledge that, other than as set forth in this Agreement, the Company

directors, officers, employees, affiliates, agents or representatives makes
any representation or warranty, either express or implied, as to the accuracy
or completeness of any of the information provided or made available to Melita
or Merger Sub or their agents or representatives; and



(b) agree that if the Transactions are consummated, to the fullest
extent permitted by Law (except with respect to fraud), that none of the
Company, its subsidiaries or any of their respective directors, officers,
employees, affiliates, agents or representatives shall have any liability or

liabilities or amounts that are paid in settlement of, or otherwise incurred
(" _Losses_ ") (but only to the extent such Losses are not otherwise covered
by insurance and paid), in connection with any claim, action, suit, demand,
proceeding or investigation (a " _Claim_ "), to which any Indemnified Party

Corporation). In the event of any such Claim, the Surviving Corporation shall
have the right to assume the defense thereof and the Surviving Corporation

different defenses exist for the Surviving  



 

33  Corporation and the Indemnified Party, the Indemnified Party may retain
counsel reasonably satisfactory to him or her and the Surviving Corporation

be represented by a separate firm of attorneys (plus local counsel) to the

Corporation shall be liable for the fees and expenses of such separate firm
of attorneys (plus local counsel), (ii) the Surviving Corporation and the
Indemnified Parties will cooperate in the defense of any such matter and (iii)
the Surviving Corporation shall not be liable for any settlement effected
without its prior written consent, which consent will not be unreasonably

indemnification of such Indemnified Party in the manner contemplated hereby is
prohibited by applicable law.



(d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall procure a "tail" directors
and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance policy
with terms and conditions reasonably satisfactory to the Company Board, so
long as the cost thereof does not exceed the amount set forth in _Section

competitive quotes for such insurance coverage in an effort to reduce the cost
thereof.

Surviving Corporation and its successors and assigns. From and after the
Closing, Melita hereby guarantees the payment and performance of the Surviving
Corporations obligations in this _Section 5.07_. The provisions of this
_Section 5.07_ are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other
rights to indemnification that the Indemnified Parties, their heirs and
personal representatives may have by contract or otherwise.

assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not
be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties
and assets to any Person, then, and in each case, as a condition to such
consolidation, merger, transfer or conveyance, proper provision shall be made
so that the successors and assigns of Melita or the Surviving Corporation
shall assume and agree to perform the obligations set forth in this _Section
5.07_.

cause the Merger Sub to perform its obligations under this Agreement.



8.03 _No Survival_. The representations, warranties and agreements made in

of this Agreement in accordance with _Article 7_ hereof. Notwithstanding the

hereto at any time before or after approval of this Agreement by the
stockholders of the Company; provided, however, that after any such approval,

be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties and
their respective successors and assigns.

thereof.

convenience of reference only and are not intended to be part of or to affect
the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.



 

44 8.10 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more

which shall constitute one and the same agreement, and any one of which may be
delivered by facsimile.



8.11 _Certain Definitions_. As used in this Agreement:



(a) the term " _affiliate_ ," as applied to any person, shall mean any other
person directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by, or under common
control with, that person. For the purposes of this definition, "control"
(including, with correlative meanings, the terms "controlling," "controlled
by" and "under common control with"), as applied to any person, means the
possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to direct or cause the
direction of the management and policies of that person, whether through the
ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise; 



(b) the term " _knowledge_ ," of any person which is not an individual means
(i) with respect to the Company, the actual knowledge of such persons
President and Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice
President of Worldwide Sales and Marketing and Vice President and General
Counsel and (ii) with respect to Melita and Merger Sub, the actual knowledge
of such Persons President and Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer;



(c) the term " _Person_ " or " _person_ " shall include individuals,
corporations, partnerships, trusts, other entities and groups (which term
shall include a "group" as such term is defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the
Exchange Act); and



(d) the term " _subsidiary_ " or " _subsidiaries_ " means, with respect to any
Person, any corporation, partnership, joint venture or other legal entity of
which such Person (either alone or through or together with any other
subsidiary), owns, directly or indirectly, more than 50% of the stock or other
equity or beneficial interests, the holders of which are generally entitled
to vote for the election of the board of directors or other governing body of
such corporation or other legal entity.



8.12 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were
not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any court of the United
States or any state having jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other
remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.



8.13 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, a party may
(a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other
acts of the other party, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and
warranties of the other party contained in this Agreement or in any document
delivered pursuant to this Agreement or (c) subject to the proviso in
_Section 8.04_ , waive compliance by the other party with any of the
agreements or conditions contained in this Agreement. Any agreement on the
part of a party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set
forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. The failure
of any party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this
Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such rights.

person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies.



8.15 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or
public policy, unless the effects of such invalidity,  



 

45  illegality or unenforceability would prevent the parties from realizing the
major portion of the economic benefits of the Merger that they
currently anticipate obtaining therefrom, all other conditions and provisions
of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect. Upon
such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith
to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as
closely as possible to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law in an
acceptable manner to the end that the Transactions are fulfilled to the
extent possible.



8.16  _Submission to Jurisdiction_. Each of the parties hereto submits to the
exclusive jurisdiction of any state or federal court sitting in New York, New
York in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement
and agrees that all claims in respect of the action or proceeding may be
heard and determined in any such court. Each of the parties hereto also agrees
not to bring any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this
Agreement in any other court. Each of the parties hereto waives any defense
of inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any action or proceeding so
brought and waives any bond, surety, or other security that might be required
of any other Party with respect thereto. Any party hereto may make service on
any other Party by sending or delivering a copy of the process to the party to
be served at the address and in the manner provided for the giving of notices
in _Section 8.07_ above. Nothing in this _Section 8.16_ , however, shall
affect the right of any party to serve legal process in any other manner
permitted by law or at equity. Each party hereto agrees that a final judgment
in any action or proceeding so brought shall be conclusive and may be enforced
by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law or at equity.
