herein:

  



  

2.3(b)(i) Subject to Section 2.4, Section 2.7, and Section 2.9, each Security
Holder holding Company Stock who has properly executed and timely delivered
to Parent a Letter of Transmittal, a Certificate and any other documentation
required pursuant to Section 2.9 with respect to such Company Stock shall be

Company Stock, the Per Share Merger Consideration and, at the applicable
times, his, her or its pro rata portion of the Escrow Amount, the amount of
the Stockholder Representatives Working Capital Claim, Excess Cash, and the

2.3(b)(ii) Subject to Section 2.4, Section 2.7, and Section 2.9, each share
of Company Stock designated by a Security Holder on such Security Holders
Letter of Transmittal for conversion into the right to receive the Per Share

rata portion of the Escrow Amount, the amount of the Stockholder
Representatives Working Capital Claim, Excess Cash, and the Capital
Expenditure Excess Payment, if any, shall thereafter cease to be outstanding
and shall be automatically cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist,
and each holder of a Certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented any shares of any class of Company Stock shall thereafter cease
to have any rights with respect to such shares of Company Stock.

  



  

2.3(c) _Cancellation of Shares_. Each share of Company Stock that is owned by
the Company or any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Company
or, if any, by Parent, Merger Sub or any other direct or indirect wholly
owned subsidiary of Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time, and in
each case not held on behalf of third parties, shall be automatically
cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be
delivered in exchange therefor.

  



  

2.3(d) _Conversion of Merger Sub Common Stock_. Each share of common stock,
par value $0.001 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one (1) validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.001 per
share, of the Surviving Corporation.

  



  

2.3(e) _Cancellation of Treasury Securities_. Each of the Securities held in
the treasury of the Company, if any, immediately prior to the Closing Date
shall be canceled and extinguished and no payment shall be made with respect
thereto.

  



  

2.4. _Appraisal Shares_.

  



  

2.4(a) Not less than twenty (20) days prior to the stockholder meeting
described in Section 7.1(d) of this Agreement, the Company shall notify its
stockholders that appraisal rights are available for any or all of the shares
of Company Stock, and shall include in such

  



        
   

  



  

notice a copy of Section 262 of the DGCL (such notice, the " _Appraisal
Notice_ ").  The Appraisal Notice shall be sent to each stockholder of the
Company who was, on the record date for notice of the stockholder meeting, a
holder of shares of Company Stock for which appraisal rights are available.
Each stockholder electing to demand the appraisal of such stockholders
shares shall deliver to the Company, before the taking of the vote on the
Merger, a written demand for appraisal of such stockholders shares of
Company Stock.  Such demand will be sufficient if it reasonably informs the
Company of the identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends
thereby to demand the appraisal of such stockholders shares of Company
Stock. A proxy or vote against the Merger shall not constitute such a demand.
Within ten (10) days after the effective date of the Merger, the Surviving
Corporation shall notify each stockholder who has complied with Section
262(d)(1) of the DGCL and has not voted in favor of or consented to the
Merger of the date that the Merger became effective.

  



  

2.4(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, but only
to the extent required by the DGCL, each share of Company Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who
has not voted in favor of or consented (in writing) to the Merger and who is
entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal for such shares pursuant
to, and who complies in all respects with, the applicable provisions of
Section 262 of the DGCL (collectively, the " _Appraisal Shares_ ") shall not
be converted into the right to receive Per Share Merger Consideration or a
pro rata portion of the amount of the Stockholder Representatives Working
Capital Claim, Excess Cash or the Capital Expenditure Excess Payment, but
instead such holder shall be entitled to payment for such shares in
accordance with the applicable provisions of the DGCL.

  



  

2.4(c) At the Effective Time, such Appraisal Shares shall cease to be
outstanding and shall be automatically cancelled and retired and shall cease
to exist, and such holder shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive the appraised value of such Appraisal
Shares in accordance with the applicable provisions of the DGCL. If, however,
such holder withdraws such holders demand for appraisal or fails to perfect
or otherwise loses such holders right of appraisal, in any case, pursuant to
the DGCL, then such holders shares of Company Stock shall be treated as
having been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the
Per Share Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.3(b) without any
interest thereon.

  



  

2.4(d) The Company shall provide Parent with (i) prompt written notice of all
demands for appraisal of shares of Company Stock that are received by the
Company and (ii) the opportunity to participate in and direct all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to all such demands. The Company
shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with
respect to, settle or offer to settle, or otherwise negotiate any such
demands.

  



  

2.5. _Treatment of Company Stock Options and Company Warrants_.

  



  

2.5(a) Not later than immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Board of
Directors of the Company or the compensation committee thereof, as
applicable, shall adopt all resolutions, take all actions and obtain all
consents necessary to effect the actions described in this Section 2.5:

  



        
   

  



  

2.5(a)(i) All outstanding Company Stock Options heretofore granted under any
Company Stock Plans shall be required to be fully exercised at least one (1)
day prior to the Closing Date or shall be cancelled. The Company shall
permit the holders of any outstanding Company Stock Options to pay
the exercise price of such Company Stock Options by means of a promissory
note with an interest rate per annum of at least forty-one hundredths of one
percent (0.41%), dated at least one (1) day prior to the Closing Date,
payable to the Company on demand at the Effective Time.  Immediately upon
receipt of payment of the exercise price of such Company Stock Options, the
Company shall issue certificates evidencing the shares of Company Stock
issued to the holders of such Company Stock Options.

  



  

2.5(a)(ii) All outstanding Company Warrants shall be required to be fully
exercised at least one (1) day prior to the Closing Date or shall be
cancelled. The Company shall permit the holder of any outstanding Company
Warrants to pay the exercise price of such Company Warrants by means of a
promissory note with an interest rate per annum of at least forty-one
hundredths of one percent (0.41%), dated at least one (1) day prior to the
Closing Date, payable to the Company on demand at the Effective Time.
Immediately upon receipt of payment of the exercise price of such Company
Warrants, the Company shall issue certificates evidencing the shares of
Company Stock issued to the holder of such Company Warrants.

  



  

2.5(b) All Company Stock Plans shall terminate, and all rights under any
provision of any other plan, program or arrangement providing for the
issuance or grant of any other interest with respect to the capital stock or
other equity interests of the Company or the Company Subsidiary shall be
canceled, effective as of the Effective Time, without any liability on
the part of the Company or the Company Subsidiary.

  



  

2.5(c) No Person shall have any right under the Company Stock Plans or under
any other plan, program, agreement or arrangement with respect to equity
interests of the Company or the Company Subsidiary at and after the Effective
Time.

  



  

2.5(d) The Company shall cooperate with Parent, and keep Parent fully
informed, with respect to all resolutions, actions and consents that the
Company intends to adopt, take and obtain in connection with the matters
described in this Section 2.5.  Without limitation, the Company shall provide
Parent with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on all such
resolutions and consents.

  



  

2.6. _Withholding of Taxes_. To the extent the Company, the Surviving
Corporation, the Paying Agent, the Escrow Agent or Parent is required or
entitled to deduct and withhold (including back-up withhold) from the Merger
Consideration amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any
Security Holder with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or
any provision of any other Tax law, including with respect to any amounts
distributed from the Escrow Account, the amounts so withheld shall be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to a Security Holder
in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Company,
the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be.

  



        
   

  



  

2.7. _Escrow Account_.

  



  

2.7(a) At or prior to the Closing Date, the parties shall establish an escrow
account (the " _Escrow Account_ ") pursuant to that certain escrow agreement
dated as of even date herewith, by and among Parent, Stockholder
Representatives and the Escrow Agent, and in substantially the form attached
hereto as _Exhibit F-1_ (the " _Escrow Agreement_ "). Simultaneously with the
Merger and at the Effective Time, Parent shall deliver to Bank of America,
N.A. as the escrow agent under the Escrow Agreement (the " _Escrow Agent_ ")
cash or other readily available funds constituting a portion of the Merger
Consideration in the aggregate amount of Eleven Million Six Hundred Twenty-
Five Thousand Dollars ($11,625,000.00) (the " _Escrow Amount_ ").  The
Escrow Amount shall be held in escrow for a period of eighteen (18) months
following the Closing Date or, if later, until any timely indemnification
claims pursuant to Section 10.6 have been fully and finally resolved (the "
_Escrow Period_ "), and shall be released from escrow pursuant to the terms
of the Escrow Agreement.

  



  

2.7(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no
Security Holder shall receive any portion of the Escrow Amount unless and
until permitted under the terms of the Escrow Agreement, except in either or
both of the following circumstances:

  



  

2.7(b)(i) Upon the delivery by ComVest to Parent of an irrevocable letter of
credit satisfying the requirements set forth in the Escrow Agreement, subject
to Parents approval of such letter of credit (which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), Parent and Stockholder
Representatives shall direct the Escrow Agent to release from the Escrow
Account to ComVest the Per Share Escrow Amount for each of the shares of
Company Stock owned by ComVest immediately prior to the Merger. The letter of
credit delivered pursuant to this Section 2.7(b)(i) shall be subject in all
respects to the terms of the Escrow Agreement; or

  



  

2.7(b)(ii) Each Security Holder that has delivered a duly executed and
completed Securities Purchase and Lock-Up Agreement substantially in the
forms attached hereto as _Exhibit E-1_ through _Exhibit E-4_, as
applicable, shall be permitted, in its sole discretion, on a one time and
irrevocable basis pursuant to a written notice that must be delivered to
Parent not later than the Closing Date, to exchange some or all of such
Security Holders shares of Parent Stock (which shares may be selected in the
sole discretion of such Security Holder so that, for example, shares with a
longer holding period may be used for this purpose) for an amount from the
Escrow Account equal to the dollar value of the shares of Parent Stock being
exchanged; provided, however, that such amount shall not exceed such Security
Holders allocable portion of the Merger Consideration then held in the
Escrow Account. In such case, each share of Parent Stock offered for
placement in the Escrow Account in exchange for such Security Holders
allocable portion of the Merger Consideration (or a portion thereof) shall be
valued at the same price per share of Parent Stock paid by such Security
Holder under such Security Holders Securities Purchase and Lock-Up
Agreement, which price per share shall be the Parent Stock Price. Any
increase or decrease in the trading price of Parent Stock after the
determination of the Parent Stock Price shall have no effect on the Parent
Stock Price or the value of the shares of Parent Stock for any purpose,
including any calculation of the contribution of any party for payments from
the Escrow Account pursuant to Section 10.6, and shall not obligate any
Security Holder to deliver additional shares of Parent Stock or cash into the
Escrow Account, nor obligate the Escrow Agent to deliver more cash to any
Security Holder.  Any shares

  



        
   

  



  

of Parent Stock exchanged pursuant to this Section 2.7(b)(ii) shall
be subject in all respects to the terms of the Escrow Agreement.

  



  

2.8. _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall designate, and
enter into an agreement with Bank of America, or such other bank or trust
company as the parties may agree to in writing, to act as paying agent in the
Merger (the " _Paying Agent_ "), which agreement shall provide that Parent
shall deposit with the Paying Agent as of the Effective Time, for the benefit
of Security Holders, cash sufficient to effect the payment of the Aggregate
Closing Consideration to which Security Holders are entitled pursuant to
Section 2.1.

  



  

2.9. _Payment Procedures_.

  



  

2.9(a) Promptly after the execution of this Agreement, the Company (or the
Paying Agent, at the Companys direction) shall mail or shall cause to be
mailed to each Security Holder: (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to any
certificate or certificates evidencing any shares of Company Stock (the "
_Certificates_ ") shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the
Paying Agent and shall be in such a form and have such other provisions as
Parent may reasonably specify) (the " _Letter of Transmittal_ "); and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of each Certificate in
exchange for the product of the Per Share Merger Consideration multiplied by
the number of shares of Company Stock evidenced by such Certificate, all as

Company shall (A) make a final determination, on a basis consistent with the
past practices of the Company, of the Adjusted Negative Net Working Capital
of the Company as of June 30, 2010 (the " _Pre-Working Capital Date Adjusted
Negative Net Working Capital_ "), and (B) send the Companys calculation of
the Pre-Working Capital Date Adjusted Negative Net Working Capital to Parent
together with supporting documents, including (1) a balance sheet of the
Company as of June 30, 2010 and (2) supporting schedules and work papers

Capital, and the Supporting Materials delivered in connection therewith, will
be true, correct and complete in all material respects as of the Working
Capital Date and will be consistent with the past practices of the Company,
after taking into account that such Pre-Working Capital Date
Adjusted Negative Net Working Capital, and the Supporting Materials delivered

business in the Ordinary Course of Business.

Capital Escrow Account for the aggregate amount by which the Working Capital
Date Adjusted Negative Net Working Capital exceeds the Pre-Working Capital

Capital Claim, as applicable, has been satisfied (" _Excess Cash_ ") within
five (5) days after the satisfaction of the Parent Working Capital Claim or
the Stockholder Representatives Working Capital Claim from the Working
Capital Escrow Account, as applicable.

  



  

3.3(b)(ii) Within fifteen (15) days after the Working Capital Date, Parent
shall (A) make a final determination, on a basis consistent with the past
practices of the

  



        
   

  



  

Company, of the Adjusted Negative Net Working Capital of the Company as of
the Working Capital Date (the " _Working Capital Date Adjusted Negative Net
Working Capital_ "); and (B) send Parents calculation of the Working

for a determination of the Working Capital True-Up, Excess Cash, the Parent
Working Capital Claim, and the Stockholder Representatives Working Capital

the parties on such date. Immediately thereafter, Stockholder
Representatives and Parent shall deliver an executed notice of the Parent
Working Capital Claim or the Stockholder Representatives Working Capital
Claim, as applicable, to the Working Capital Escrow Agent for disposition of
the Parent Working Capital Claim or the Stockholder Representatives Working
Capital Claim, as applicable, in conformance with the Arbitrators Decision.

Parent contemplated in the Financing Commitment Letter not being made

7.4(b) Parent and Merger Sub hereby covenant and agree that, during the
period from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time, unless
otherwise contemplated by this Agreement or as otherwise consented to
in writing by the Company, Parent and Merger Sub will:

  



  

7.4(b)(i) at the reasonable request of the Company, obtain pre-clearance
certificates and file such instruments and documents as are necessary to
permit the Merger;

  



  

7.4(b)(ii) advise the Company of any event the occurrence or non-occurrence
of which, so far as Parent or Merger Sub can reasonably foresee, could cause
a breach of a representation or warranty or covenant or agreement of Parent
or Merger Sub contained herein or would reasonably be expected to have a
Parent Material Adverse Effect or would reasonably be expected to have a
material adverse effect on the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to perform
their respective obligations under this Agreement; and

  



  

7.4(b)(iii) use their commercially reasonable efforts, and shall cause their
respective directors and officers to use their commercially reasonable
efforts, to take all appropriate action and to do all things reasonably
necessary, to obtain approval of (A) the execution, delivery and performance
of this Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub, (B) the Merger, and (C) any other
transactions contemplated hereby.

  



  

7.4(c) _Financing Commitment_.

  



  

7.4(c)(i) Parent and Merger Sub will notify the Company promptly if, at any
time prior to the Effective Time, (A) the Financing Commitment shall expire
or be terminated for any reason and not be replaced within ten (10) business
days in accordance with Section 7.4(c)(ii) below or, (B) any financing source
that is a party to the Financing Commitment notifies Parent or Merger Sub in
writing that such source no longer intends to provide financing to Parent or
Merger Sub on the terms set forth therein and is not replaced with another
financing source willing to provide such financing within ten (10) business
days, unless Parent reasonably determines that the amount of financing to be
provided by such financing source is not necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Parent and Merger Sub shall not,
and shall not permit any of their Subsidiaries or Affiliates to, without the
prior written consent of the Company, take any action or enter into any
transaction, including, without limitation, any merger, acquisition, joint
venture, disposition, lease, contract or debt or equity financing that Parent
reasonably expects to impair, delay or prevent Parents or Merger Subs
obtaining of the financing contemplated by the Financing Commitment in an
amount sufficient to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall amend or alter, or agree to
amend or alter, the Financing Commitment in any manner that

  



        
   

  



  

would impair, delay or prevent the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby without the prior written consent of the Company.

  



  

7.4(c)(ii) If the Financing Commitment shall be terminated or modified in a
manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub for any reason, Parent and Merger Sub
shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, and will provide
the Company with a copy of, a new financing commitment that provides for an
amount sufficient to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, funding conditions no less favorable in any material respect than
those included in the Financing Commitment as originally issued, and other
terms and conditions the aggregate effect of which is not materially adverse
to the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby in comparison with those terms and conditions contained
in the Financing Commitment as originally issued. Parent and Merger Sub
shall accept any such new commitment letter satisfying the requirements of
the immediately preceding sentence (or, if more than one such commitment
letter becomes available, any one of such commitment letters in Parents
discretion).

  



  

7.5. _Access and Information_. The Company shall provide Parent, Merger Sub
and their officers, directors, employees, agents, counsel, accountants,
financial advisors, consultants and other representatives (collectively, the
" _Parent Representatives_ "), with all reasonable access, upon reasonable
prior notice, to all officers, employees, accountants, customers and
suppliers of the Company and, with respect to the Company and its officers,
employees and accountants, to their assets, properties, Contracts, books,
records and all such other information and data concerning the business and
operations of the Company as Parent, Merger Sub or any of the Parent
Representatives reasonably may request in connection with such investigation.

  



  

7.6. _Letters of Transmittal_. The Company shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain from each Security Holder and deliver to Parent,
on or before the Closing Date, (a) a fully completed and duly executed Letter
of Transmittal and (b) copies of all Certificates evidencing all shares of
Company Stock held by such Security Holder; and the Company agrees to use its
commercially reasonable efforts to deliver originals of all such Certificates
to Parent within two (2) business days following Closing.

  



  

7.7. _Consideration Distribution Chart_. The Company shall provide to Parent
and Merger Sub, not later than two (2) business days prior to Closing, a

received or given in connection with any proceeding by a private party, in
each case, regarding any of the transactions contemplated hereby, (iii)
permit the other party to review any communication given by it to the DOJ,

this Agreement shall require, or be construed to require, Parent to proffer
to, or agree to, sell, divest, lease, license, transfer, dispose of or
otherwise encumber or hold separate, before or after the Effective Time, any
assets, licenses, operations, rights, product lines, businesses or interest
therein of the Company or Parent or any of their Affiliates (or to consent to
any sale, divestiture, lease, license, transfer, disposition or other
encumbrance by the Company or any of its Affiliates of any of its assets,
licenses, operations, rights, product lines, businesses or interest therein
or to any agreement by the Company to take any of the foregoing actions) or
to agree to any changes to (including, without limitation, through a
licensing arrangement) or restriction on, or other impairment of the ability
of the Company or Parent or any of their Affiliates to own or operate, any
such assets, licenses, operations, rights, product lines, businesses or
interest therein or Parents ability to vote, transfer, receive dividends or
otherwise exercise full ownership rights with respect to the stock of the
Surviving Corporation. With regard to any Governmental Entity or any

written consent, shall discuss or commit to any divestiture or consent
decree, discuss or commit to alter their businesses or commercial practices
in any way, or otherwise take or commit to take any action that would limit
Parents freedom of action with respect to the Company and its
Affiliates after the Effective Time, Parents ability to retain any assets,
licenses, operations, rights, product lines, businesses or interest therein
of the Company and its Affiliates or Parents ability to receive the full

consent described in Section 8.1(e)(i) above, such party shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts, and shall take any such actions reasonably
requested by the other party hereto, to minimize any adverse effect upon the
Company, Parent and Merger Sub and their respective businesses resulting, or

8.2(c) Parent shall take all actions required so that eligible Continuing
Business Employees shall receive credit for purposes of participation,
vesting and benefit accrual purposes (but not to the extent crediting such
service would result in duplication of benefits) under any employee benefit
plans, programs or arrangements sponsored by Parent or an Affiliate of Parent
to the extent credited under an analogous plan, program or arrangement of the
Company Group as of the Closing Date. To the extent that Parent or an
Affiliate of Parent modifies any coverage or benefit plans under which the
Continuing Business Employees participate, Parent shall (or shall cause such
Affiliate to) waive any applicable waiting period, pre-existing conditions or
actively-at-work requirements and shall give such Continuing Business
Employees credit under the new coverage or benefit plans for deductibles, co-
payments and out-of-pocket payments that have been paid during the plan year
in which the Closing occurs.

  



  

8.2(d) Subject to the consummation of the Merger, on or before the later of
(i) the date that is one hundred twenty-two (122) calendar days after the
Effective Time and (ii) April 1, 2011, Parent or an Affiliate of Parent shall
take all actions necessary to permit the Continuing Business Employees to
participate in Parents or such Affiliates (as applicable) 401(k) profit
sharing plan. On that same date, the Company shall cause the active
participation by the Continuing Business Employees in the Companys 401(k)
profit sharing plan (the " _Company 401(k) Plan_") to cease. If and to the
extent permitted by Section 401(k) of the Code and the regulations thereunder
and the terms of the Company 401(k) Plan, Continuing Business Employees who
have account balances under the Company 401(k) Plan will be eligible to
receive distributions from, or to rollover, their accounts in the Company
401(k) Plan into Parents or such Affiliates, as applicable, 401(k) profit
sharing plan, or, subject to their elections, into one or more individual
retirement accounts.

  



  

8.2(e) No Continuing Business Employee or any dependent or beneficiary

8.4. _Confidentiality; Public Announcements_. From the date hereof through
the Effective Time, the parties hereto agree not to make public any of the
terms of this Agreement, the Merger, all other transactions contemplated
hereunder and all other Exhibits executed in connection herewith, unless
otherwise required by law, regulation, rule, judicial Order or a directive
from the SEC or the New York Stock Exchange or unless in connection with an
alleged or actual violation of the terms of Section 5 or Section 6 of the
Employment Agreements and/or the terms of the Non-Competition Agreements.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties hereto agree that (a) Parent shall
publicly announce its entry into this Agreement through a press release
issued after the close of the trading markets on the date hereof and a Form
8-K filed with the SEC; (b) a draft of the press release and the Form 8-K
shall be provided for the Companys review prior to the issuance and filing
thereof; (c) after the issuance of the press release, the Company shall be
permitted to communicate with its customers, employees and suppliers

Agreement and/or the transactions contemplated hereby, including but not
limited to the Merger.

  



  

8.5. _Tail Insurance_. If deemed advisable or necessary by Parent to protect
Parent and Merger Sub, at Parents sole cost and expense, the Company and the
Voting Stockholders shall cooperate with Parent in obtaining a Discontinued
Products and Operations Coverage policy covering professional liability and
products and completed operations liability, as well as general liability
exposure, to cover claims based on any services rendered or products provided
by the Company prior to or on the Closing Date but that are reported or made
on or subsequent to the Closing Date, with such policy to provide coverage
consistent with the Companys current policies, but with the limits of such
policy being no less than Two Million Dollars ($2,000,000.00) in coverage per
occurrence and Four Million Dollars ($4,000,000.00) in coverage in the
aggregate (" _Tail Insurance_ "). The Company and each Voting
Stockholder acknowledges that (i) Parent and Merger Sub make no
representation or warranty as to whether Tail Insurance is required to cover
claims against the Company based on any services rendered or products
provided by the Company prior to or on the Closing Date; and (ii) the Company
and the Voting Stockholders are responsible for making their own
determination as to whether, in the absence of Tail Insurance, any such
claims against the Company will be covered by the pre-existing policies of
the Company. In addition, Parent shall obtain, and the Company shall
cooperate with Parent in obtaining, at Parents expense, employment
practices, professional liability, and directors and officers liability
insurance coverage to cover the six (6) years subsequent to the Closing Date,
with such policy to provide coverage consistent with the Companys current
policies. Evidence of such insurance is attached hereto as _Schedule 8.5_.

  



  

8.6. _Tax Treatment_. The parties to this Agreement agree that they will
treat the Merger as a purchase of Company Stock: (a) for federal and state
income Tax purposes and (b) for sales and use, transfer and any other Tax
purposes, unless otherwise required by Law.

Closing Date.  The Surviving Corporation shall provide Stockholder
Representatives with a draft copy of any such income, franchise or privilege
Tax Returns showing a Tax liability (before application of estimated Tax

days prior to the due date thereof, shall permit Stockholder Representatives
to review and comment on such Tax Returns prior to filing, and shall make
such revisions to such Tax Returns reasonably requested, on a timely basis,

or cause to be filed such Tax Returns. For purposes of this Section
8.7(a)(i), in the case of any Taxes that are imposed on a periodic basis and
are payable for a Tax period that includes (but does not end on) the Closing
Date, the portion of such Tax that relates to the portion of such Tax period
ending on the Closing Date shall (A) in the case of any Taxes other than
Taxes based upon or related to income, wages or receipts, be deemed to be the
amount of such Taxes for the entire Tax period multiplied by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the number of days in the Tax period ending on and
including the Closing Date, and the denominator of which is the number of
days in the entire Tax period, and (B) in the case of any Taxes based upon or
related to income, wages or receipts, be deemed equal to the amount that
would be payable if the relevant Tax period ended on the Closing Date, using
the "closing of the books" method of accounting. Any credits relating to a Tax
period that begins before and ends after the Closing Date shall be taken into
account as though the relevant Tax period ended on the Closing Date.

  



  

8.7(a)(ii) The Surviving Corporation shall prepare or cause to be prepared,

income and franchise Tax Return(s) for the Company Group (or any member
thereof) for the fiscal year or portion thereof in which the Closing occurs
(" _Final Tax Return_ "), on or before March 15, 2011. The Surviving
Corporation shall provide Stockholder Representatives with a draft copy of
such income, franchise or privilege Tax Returns showing a Tax liability
(before application of estimated Tax payments) of Ten Thousand Dollars
($10,000.00) or more at least fifteen (15) days prior to the due date
thereof, shall permit Stockholder Representative to review and comment on
such Tax Returns (including but not limited to the Final Tax Return described
in the preceding sentence) prior to filing, and shall make such revisions to
such Tax Returns reasonably requested, on a timely basis, by Stockholder
Representatives. The Surviving Corporation shall then file or cause to be
filed such Tax Returns.

  



  

8.7(a)(iii) Parent shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to
be filed, at Parents cost and expense, any Tax Returns for the Company for
all periods beginning after the Closing Date.

  



  

8.7(a)(iv) Stockholder Representatives and the Company agree to cooperate
with Parents Tax Department in its compliance with all SEC and IRS

reporting requirements, including the identification, quantification, and
documentation of all Tax reserves in accordance with FIN 48 and Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 5 (" _FAS 5_ ") financial reporting
guidance, and "Reportable Transactions," as defined in Treasury Regulations

possession, including positions taken and anticipated likelihood of success.

  



  

8.7(a)(v) On or prior to the fifth (5th) business day after the date of this
Agreement, the Company shall request from the IRS one or more IRS Letters
147C, dated no earlier than the date of this Agreement, validating
the Companys employer identification number and the Company Subsidiarys
employer identification number. The Company shall deliver such request and
such IRS Letters 147C to Parent promptly upon submission and receipt.

  



  

8.7(a)(vi) The Company Group (and each member thereof) shall: (i) timely file
or caused to be timely filed all Tax Returns required to be filed by any of
its members on or before the Closing Date and all such Tax Returns shall be
prepared in a manner consistent with past practice to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, (ii) timely pay all Taxes required to be paid on or before
the Closing Date; and (iii) promptly notify Parent of any income, franchise
or similar Tax Claim, investigation or audit pending against or with respect
to any member of the Company Group in respect of any Tax liability or matter
(or any significant developments with respect to ongoing Tax matters).

  



  

8.7(a)(vii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,

sales, use, value added, registration stamp, recording, documentary,
conveyancing, franchise, property, transfer, gains and similar Taxes, levies,
charges and fees (collectively, " _Transfer Taxes_ ") arising from the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

8.7(b) _Cooperation on Tax Matters_.

  



  

8.7(b)(i) Parent and the Company shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent
reasonably requested by the other party, in connection with the filing of Tax
Returns pursuant to this Section 8.7 and any audit, appeal, litigation or
other proceeding with respect to Taxes. Neither the Company nor Stockholder
Representatives shall settle any such audit, appeal, litigation or other
proceeding or any Tax assessment or proposed Tax assessment resulting from
any of such proceedings without the prior written consent of Parent
which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. The
parties cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the other partys
reasonable request) the provision of records and information, to the extent
the Company and Stockholder Representatives have not already turned over such
records and information to Parent pursuant to Section 8.7(c), which are
reasonably relevant to any such audit, appeal, litigation or other proceeding
and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide
additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder.
 The Company and Stockholder Representatives agree to provide Parent
upon Closing with all books, records, correspondence, and agreements with
respect to Tax

  



        
   

  



  

matters pertinent to the Company relating to any taxable period before
Closing (including any extensions thereof) as to which the statute of
limitations has not expired and warrant that no such books, records,
correspondence or agreements have been transferred, destroyed or discarded
and that the Company and Stockholder Representatives have abided by all
record retention agreements, if any, entered into with any taxing authority.

  



  

8.7(b)(ii) Parent and Stockholder Representatives further agree, upon
request, to use their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any
certificate or other document from any governmental authority or any other
Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that
could be imposed (including, but not limited to, with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby).

  



  

8.7(c) On or prior to the Closing Date, the Company and Stockholder

thereof in the possession of the Company memorializing the purchase of Assets
(and other documentation of any type memorializing the incurrence and payment
of any and all Taxes on the purchase of such Assets) in connection with the
purchase by the Company or Stockholder Representatives, as the case may be,
of all Assets used in the Companys operations.

  



  

8.7(d) On or prior to the Closing Date, the Company and Stockholder
Representatives shall provide to Parent (or leave at the premises at 4850
Joule Street, Unit A-1, Reno, Nevada 89502) the following information with
respect to the Company Group, as of the most recent practicable date: (i)
the original and adjusted tax basis of each member of the Company Group in

terminated any and all of the Tax sharing, allocation, indemnification, or
similar Contracts in effect on the Closing Date with respect to or involving
any member of the Company Group.

holding corporation" under Section 897 of the Code, and containing all such
other information as is required to comply with the requirements of such
Section for purposes of satisfying Parents obligations under Treasury
Regulations Section 1.1445-2(c)(3).

his heirs, successors, assigns or designees, in either case, as such may be
designated from time to time upon notice given to the Company, Parent and
Merger Sub. The Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall be entitled to rely
conclusively upon any action or inaction by Stockholder Representatives as
being fully authorized and approved by and irrevocably binding upon all
Security Holders who have executed a Letter of Transmittal notwithstanding
any assertion by any such Security Holder to the contrary, it being the
purpose and intent of this Section 8.8 that Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company shall be entitled to treat Stockholder Representatives as if such
persons were the sole selling stockholders of all of the Securities. All
notices to be sent to Security Holders pursuant to this Agreement may be
addressed to Stockholder Representatives, and any notice so sent in

attorneys-in-fact and agents, with full power of substitution to act in the
name, place and stead of such Security Holder in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement and to act on behalf of such Security Holder in any amendment

costs of defending against the Third Party Claim (including reasonable
attorneys fees and expenses).

  



  

10.6(e) Parent and/or the Surviving Corporation shall be specifically
permitted to make any payment that is a pre-requisite to challenging any
proceeding brought by any Governmental Entity without causing Parent or the
Surviving Corporation to surrender or waive any right with respect to the
indemnification provisions set forth in this Section 10.6 as a result of
making such payment, but the making of such payment shall not entitle Parent
and/or the Surviving Corporation to indemnification under Section 10.6 unless
all of the applicable requirements are satisfied as to such payment.

  



  

10.6(f) The occurrence of the Closing shall not constitute a waiver by Parent

Agreement, except as to any matter with respect to which a written claim
shall have been made or action at law or in equity shall have been commenced
before such date, in which event survival shall continue (but only with
respect to, and to the extent of, such claim until such claim shall have been
finally resolved). Any claim shall be deemed to be withdrawn (if it has not
been previously satisfied, settled or withdrawn) and any liability of the
indemnifying party in respect thereof shall absolutely terminate (and no new
claim may be made in respect of the facts giving rise to such withdrawn
claim) unless a written claim in respect thereof, providing specific details
thereof (including the amount of such claim, if known) of sufficient
specificity to permit the claim to be reasonably evaluated, has been
delivered as required hereunder on or before the end of the eighteen (18)
month term of the Escrow Agreement, and for this purpose such legal
proceedings shall be deemed to have commenced when first issued, filed or
served.

shall be liable only for the amount of such Losses in excess of the first One
Million Dollars ($1,000,000.00) of the aggregate amount of such Losses.

  



  

10.6(g)(iv) _Calculation of Losses_.

  



  

10.6(g)(iv)(A) Any calculation of Losses for purposes of this Section 10.6
shall be net of (i) the difference between (a) any monies received by
Parent or the Surviving Corporation pursuant to indemnification obligations
of third parties, and (b) any costs or expenses incurred by Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, as applicable, in bringing indemnification claims
against, and collecting indemnification payments from, such third parties;

be construed to be of such gender or number as the circumstances require.
Unless otherwise expressly provided, the word "including" does not limit the
preceding words or terms.

  



  

12.3. _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
determined to be invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule
of law or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this
Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the
economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not
affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such
determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal
or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good
faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the
parties hereto as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that
the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent possible.

the exhibits and schedules) constitutes the entire agreement of the parties
and supersedes all prior agreements and undertakings, both written and oral,
between the parties hereto, or any of them, with respect to the
subject matter hereof; provided, however, that nothing in this Agreement,
no investigation by Parent or Merger Sub and no knowledge obtainable by
Parent or Merger Sub as a result of such investigation shall preclude any
remedy for fraud or limit any right of Parent or Merger Sub with respect to
any breach of, inaccuracy in or default under any representation, warranty or
covenant in this Agreement or the exhibits or schedules attached hereto. This
Agreement may not be amended except by a written agreement executed by the
party to be charged with the amendment.

reason of this Agreement.

  



  

12.8. _Waiver; Remedies Cumulative_. No failure or delay on the part of
any party hereto in the exercise of any right hereunder shall impair such
right or be construed to be a waiver of, or acquiescence in, any breach of

partial exercise of any such right preclude other or further exercise thereof
or of any other right. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, (a)
no claim or right arising out of this Agreement or the documents referred to
