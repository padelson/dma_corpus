of doubt, "accounts receivable trade" are the positions actually shown in the

of the necessary value adjustments has been applied to these positions.
Provisions (Ruckstellungen) for taxation and deferred tax assets and/or
liabilities must not be included in the Net Working Capital. Provisions and/or

that has been declared mandatory for the financial year by the IASB, provided

reviewed by the current auditor of the Company (KPMG AG
Wirtschaftsprufungsgesellschaft (Deutschland)). The auditor must be released
from its obligations of confidentiality towards the Company vis-a-vis the
Seller and the Guarantor so that the Seller and the Guarantor can have
discussions with the auditor at any time after the Effective Date and before
the audit is completed. The Company shall submit to the Parties the audited
and certified Effective Date Accounts and the reviewed Purchase Price
Calculation together with the audit report and the report on the review of the
Purchase Price Calculation (together the "Audit Report") after the Company's
auditor has finalized the Audit Report. To the extent that the Parties agree
on the Effective Date Accounts and the Purchase Price Calculation within 2
(two) weeks after receipt of the audited and certified Effective Date Accounts
and the reviewed Purchase Price Calculation by the Parties, the Effective Date
Accounts and the Purchase Price Calculation become binding upon the
corresponding notification to the Parties.

  

  

In case no agreement is reached, another auditing company (the "Expert") will
be nominated within further two weeks upon request of either Party to
determine the relevant items still in dispute by way of a binding written
expert opinion pursuant to sections 317 et seq. of the German Civil Code
(Burgerliches Gesetzbuch, "BGB") (the "Expert Opinion") within 1 (one) month
from the acceptance of the mandate; however, the relevant items determined by
the Expert may not be above or below the figures determined by the Parties.
The accounting and valuation principles and methods for calculation set forth
under this Agreement shall be binding upon the Expert. In addition, the Expert
must be retained to make all necessary amendments to the audited Effective
Date Accounts. If the Parties do not reach agreement on the appointment of the
Expert within 1 (one) week from the request of either Party, this auditing
company will be chosen by the managing director of the Chamber of Certified
Public

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

\- 10 -  

  

 

 

 

   
 

Accountants (Vorstand der Wirtschaftspruferkammer) in Berlin/Germany, upon
request of either Party. The Expert must give both Parties comprehensive
opportunity to explain their position and inform them about the individual
procedural steps. The proceedings start on the day on which one Party has
received the request by the other Party to co-operate in retaining an expert.
The language of the proceedings is German. The Expert Opinion must be prepared
in German and reasoned in writing. The review of the content by a court
(section 319 BGB mutatis mutandis) is excluded. Each Party shall bear its own
costs and the costs and fees of its advisors. All fees, costs and expenses of
the Expert shall be advanced by the Parties in equal parts. The Expert shall
decide upon the allocation of its costs, fees and expenses in accordance with
section 91 et seq. of the German Code of Civil Procedure (Zivilprozessordnung,
"ZPO"). The relevant items determined by the Expert and the Effective Date
Accounts resulting from this procedure become binding upon delivery of the
Expert Opinion to the Parties.

  

  

The Effective Date Accounts resulting from the procedure described in this
Clause 4.1 or as agreed upon by the Parties are referred to as the "Final
Effective Date Accounts". The Purchase Price Calculation resulting from the
procedure or as agreed upon by the Parties, as described in this Clause 4.1,
is referred to as the "Final Purchase Price Calculation".

Items 6 and 7 of the table in Clause 3.3: For purposes of calculating the
Final Purchase Price the Net Working Capital as of the Effective Date shall be
calculated in accordance with the principles contained in the definition of
Net Working Capital set forth in Clause 3.3. The amount by which the Net
Working Capital of the Target Companies as of the Effective Date falls short
of or exceeds the amount of the Preliminary Net Working Capital (the "Net
Working Capital Difference") does not lead to an adjustment of the Preliminary
Purchase Price under Items 6 and 7 of the table in Clause 3.3 as far as the
Net Working Capital Difference is limited according to the following
provisions (the "Net Working Capital Limitation"):

   
---|---

If the Net Working Capital Difference exceeds the amount of EUR 8,600,000.00
(in words: Euro eight million six hundred thousand) the Net Working Capital

(d)

  |  

Item 10 of the table in Clause 3.3: For purposes of calculating the Final

the same account numbers).

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

4.3

  |  

If the Final Purchase Price exceeds or falls below the Preliminary Purchase
Price the Preliminary Purchase Price is increased or reduced by the amount of
the difference (the "Balance Amount I"). In case no agreement is reached
between the Parties over the Balance Amount I, Clause 4.1 para 3 applies
mutatis mutandis.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

4.4

  |  

In case of an increase in the Preliminary Purchase Price, the Buyer must pay
to the Seller the Balance Amount within 2 (two) weeks after the Final

entirety pursuant to Clause 4.1; interest must be paid on the Balance Amount I
as of the Effective Date at a rate of 3 % p.a. by the Buyer. In case of a
reduction of the Preliminary Purchase Price, the Seller must pay to the Buyer

Accounts or the Balance Amount I have become binding in their entirety
pursuant to Clause 4.1 but in any event, not prior to the Effective Date;

that (i) the provisions resulted in a reduction of Cash of the Target
Companies within 12 (twelve) months from the Effective Date and/or (ii) the
individual value adjustments resulted in a respective lower income of Cash of
the Target Companies within 12 (twelve) months from the Effective Date.
Notwithstanding the aforementioned sentence, the annual financial accounts of
the Target Companies for financial years after the Effective Date shall be
audited by the then current auditor of the Target Companies. KPMG AG
Wirtschaftsprufungsgesellschaft must be given access to all information, books
and records of the Target Companies as may be reasonably required to issue the
Certificate. The costs of KPMG AG Wirtschaftsprufungsgesellschaft for the
preparation and issuance of the Certificate shall be borne by the Seller and
the Buyer in equal parts.

  

  

The Cash Relevance Of Provisions And Individual Value Adjustments shall be
treated as not proven (gilt als nicht bewiesen) as far as the Buyer caused the
Cash Relevance Of Provisions And Individual Value Adjustments by intentionally
taking measures contrary to the diligence of a prudent businessman (Sorgfalt
eines ordentlichen Kaufmanns) or contrary to good faith (Treu und Glauben),
including, but not limited to, by selling receivables below value or by
payments on provisions which are not due within the period of 12 (twelve)
months from the Effective Date or by agreeing with the respective creditors on
an acceleration of the maturity dates of such payments.

  

  

As far as the Buyer cannot prove the Cash Relevance Of Provisions And
Individual Value Adjustments in due time the Buyer must pay to the Seller

  

  

    

  |  

(a)

  |  

the amount by which the provisions did not result in a reduction of Cash of
the Target Companies within 12 (twelve) months from the Effective Date and

months from the Effective Date

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

(the sum of (a) and (b) the "Balance Amount II"); interest must be paid on the
Balance Amount II as of the Effective Date at a rate of 3 % p.a. In case no
agreement is reached between the Parties over the Balance Amount II, Clause
4.1 para 3 applies mutatis mutandis.

  

  

    

4.6

  |  

Payments by the Seller to the Buyer or a third party specified by the Buyer,
including the Company, resulting on the basis of other provisions in this
Agreement will be treated as a reduction of the Purchase Price without the

The Parties agree that the Profit and Loss Transfer Agreement shall be
performed for the shortened financial year of the Company (Rumpfgeschaftsjahr)
for the period beginning on 1 April 2010 and ending on 31 December 2010 and
that the Company therefore undertakes to fulfill its obligation to transfer to
the Seller (as parent of the fiscal unity, Organtrager) its profit as of 31
December 2010 in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Profit and
Loss Transfer Agreement and on the basis of the audited and certified
(geprufte und mit dem uneingeschrankten Bestatigungs­vermerk versehene) annual

from 1 April 2010 through 31 December 2010 and notes (Anhang) in accordance
with the German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch, "HGB") and German
Generally Accounting Principles ("German GAAP") and, to the extent that HGB
and German GAAP provided no guidance, consistent with Accounting Practice In
The Preceding Years (the "German Effective Date Accounts"). The amount to be
transferred under the Profit and Loss Transfer Agreement is hereinafter
referred to as the "Profit and Loss Transfer Amount" or the "Final Profit and
Loss Transfer Amount". The termination of the Profit and Loss Transfer
Agreement according to Clause 5.1 remains unaffected. The Buyer must instruct
the managing directors of the Company to prepare, within 45 (forty five) Bank
Working Days from the Effective Date, the German Effective Date Accounts which
shall be audited by the current auditor of the Company (KPMG AG
Wirtschaftsprufungsgesellschaft (Deutschland)). The audited German Effective
Date Accounts shall then be submitted to the Parties.

  |  

The Company undertakes to make a preliminary payment to the Seller under the
Profit and Loss Transfer Agreement in the amount of

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

EUR 9,184,466.00

  

  

(in words: Euro nine million one hundred eighty four thousand four hundred
sixty six)

  

  

    

  |  

(the "Preliminary Profit and Loss Transfer Amount").

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

The Preliminary Profit and Loss Transfer Amount is due and payable on 3
January 2011, however not before the principal amount of the Buyer Loan (as
defined below) has been credited (gutgeschrieben) to the bank account of the
Company.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

     |  

The Preliminary Profit and Loss Transfer Amount will in return be deducted
from the Preliminary Purchase Price according to Clause 3.3.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

To enable the Company to fulfill its obligation to pay the Preliminary Profit
and Loss Transfer Amount, the Buyer undertakes to pay to the Company a loan
according to the terms and conditions set out in the loan agreement a draft of
which contained in Annex 5.3 in the amount of EUR 9,184,466.00 (the "Buyer
Loan"). The payment of the principal amount of the Buyer Loan by the Buyer to
the Company is due and payable on 3 January 2011.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

The Buyer will not be entitled to claim any damages under this Agreement if
the Buyer Loan was not in a sufficient amount, in particular to claim any
damages under Clause 6.1.8 if insolvency proceedings are initiated or

estate of the Company.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

5.4

  |  

Immediately after the German Effective Date Accounts of the Company have been
audited the Seller and the Company will determine the Final Profit and Loss
Transfer Amount on the basis of the German Effective Date Accounts. The amount
by which the Final Profit and Loss Transfer Amount exceeds or falls below the
Preliminary Profit and Loss Transfer Amount is hereinafter referred to as the
"Settlement Amount".

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

5.5

  |  

In case the Final Profit and Loss Transfer Amount exceeds the Preliminary
Profit and Loss Transfer Amount, the Company must pay to the Seller the
Settlement Amount (including interests accruing at an interest rate of 3 %
p.a. from 1 January 2011 on) within 2 (two) weeks after the audited German
Effective Date Accounts have been received by the Company. In case the Final
Profit and Loss Transfer Amount falls below the Preliminary Profit and Loss
Transfer Amount, the Seller must pay to the Company the Settlement Amount
(including interests accruing at an interest rate of 3 % p.a. from 1 January
2011 on) within 2 (two) weeks after the audited German Effective Date Accounts
have been received by the Seller. The payment obligation of the Seller shall
be treated as a loan by the Company to the Seller. The Buyer will procure that
the Company has available sufficient cash to fulfill its obligation to pay to
the Seller the Settlement Amount. Clause 4.2(d) remains unaffected. If it
turns out that the Final Profit and Loss Transfer Amount was for whatever
reasons not correctly calculated leading to an additional payment by the
Company to the Seller ("Additional Payment") or to a repayment (or even a loss
compensation) by the Seller to the Company ("Repayment") then the Seller will
indemnify the Buyer for the Additional Payment or the Buyer will indemnify the
Seller for the Repayment, as the case may be, provided however that the
Additional Payment or the Repayment has not been already included in the Final
Purchase Price Calculation. The obligations under the preceding sentence shall
remain valid until the Buyer sells the shares in the Company to a third party,
however, at least for a period of three years after the Signing Date.

7.1

  |  

The Warranties are given as per the Signing Date except for the Warranties
contained in Clauses 6.3.1 and 6.3.2 which are given as per the respective
balance sheet date (Bilanzstichtag).

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

7.2

  |  

The Seller is not liable for the incorrectness of its Warranties if one of the
following persons actually knows the facts (the "Buyer's Knowledge"), which
lead to the incorrectness of one or more Warranties: Terrence Mahoney, Michael
St. Lawrence, Dennis Loughran, Robert Daigle, Paul Middleton, Brett Kilhenny,
Ani Shere, Anita Jain, Bettina Van de Keere, Erdal Harmanci, Frank Bolle,
Gerard Gatineau, Jim Kelly, Joe Chun, Luc De Busscher, Luc Van Eenaeme, Ron
Pelletier, Tim Creegan and Kristin Gansbeke. One of the aforementioned persons
is deemed to have knowledge of all documents, data and information (i)
contained in this Agreement or any of its Annexes, (ii) made accessible to the
Buyer preceding this Agreement in writing (including any written management
presentation or fact books) and/or (iii) made accessible to the Buyer
preceding this Agreement in the data room (including the QandA-log), which data
room documents, data, and information are listed in the data room index

the Parties does not occur within three weeks after the notary public has
issued to the respective Party or its respective legal counsel to the address
provided in Clause 14.2 and 14.3 a written request to receive the respective
CD-ROM Bundle then the notary public is entitled to destroy the respective CD-
ROM Bundle. During the deposition period each Party may at any time upon
written request and agreement with the notary public inspect (einsehen) the
content of the CD-ROM Bundle and take print-out or copies thereof.

  

  

    

7.3

  |  

The Seller is also liable for the incorrectness or incompleteness of its
Warranties even if the relevant incorrectness or incompleteness is not its
fault. To the extent to which the Seller's knowledge or best knowledge is
decisively relevant to the Warranties, it is only liable if at least one of
the following persons has actual knowledge of the underlying facts (the
"Seller's Best Knowledge" or the "Seller's Knowledge"), which lead to the
incorrectness of the respective Warranty, whereas other principles of the
attribution of knowledge and the principles of the liability for failure to

  |  

LEGAL CONSEQUENCES IN CASE OF INCORRECT WARRANTIES

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

8.1

  |  

If one or more Warranties are incorrect and liability is not excluded pursuant
to Clause 7 the Buyer must inform the Seller and the Guarantor about the
possible existence of a claim pursuant to this Agreement without undue delay
after acquiring knowledge of the essential facts giving rise to the claim. A
breach of this duty of information leads to an exclusion of the Seller's and
the Guarantor\'s liability if, but only to the extent such breach results in
an increase of damages or affects the ability of the Seller or the Guarantor
to avoid or mitigate the damages of the Buyer or the Company.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

8.2

  |  

To the extent to which the Seller or its advisors under a professional duty of
confidentiality consider necessary for the assessment of the merits of the
claim, the Buyer must reason the claim asserted and support it with available
documentation within three weeks after the first notification. At the latest
four weeks after the first notification, the Seller will inform the Buyer
about whether it acknowledges or disputes the claim asserted; to the extent
that it acknowledges the claim asserted, it will also notify the Buyer of
whether and by when it will create the situation which would exist if the
relevant Warranty or Warranties were correct (restitution in kind,
Naturalrestitution). If

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

(a) the Seller does not inform the Buyer within the agreed four-week time-
limit or

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

\- 23 -  

  

 

 

 

   
 


 

  

    

  |  

(b)

  |  

whilst acknowledging the claim asserted nevertheless (i) refuses restitution
in kind, (ii) fail to make restitution in kind properly or in time or (iii)
restitution in kind is impossible or is insufficient to compensate the Buyer
pursuant to section 251 para. 1 BGB,

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

the Buyer can exclusively demand damages in money.

  

  

    

8.3

  |  

Claims by the Buyer pursuant to this Clause 8 only exist to the extent to
which no actually recoverable claims exist against third parties, in
particular against insurance companies. As long as the Buyer pursues claims
against third parties, the limitation period set forth in Clause 8.7 shall be
suspended (gehemmt) if the Buyer can prove his active pursuit of the claims to
the Seller and the Guarantor. The principles on the calculation of damage,
loss mitigation and loss-offsetting (Schadensberechnung, Schadensminderung und
Vorteilsausgleich) pursuant to sections 249 et seq. BGB apply to all claims by
the Buyer pursuant to this Agreement.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

8.4

  |  

The Buyer is not entitled to any payment claim under any provision of this
Agreement to the extent that the facts and circumstances that justify such
payment claim have already been taken into account under another payment claim
of the Buyer that has been fulfilled by the Seller or the Guarantor, in
particular as an adjustment of the Purchase Price according to Clause 4 (no
double-dipping).

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

8.5

  |  

The Buyer is not entitled to demand damages in money pursuant to this Clause 8
if and to the extent the relevant claim is reflected as a liability
(Verbindlichkeit), covered by a provision (Ruckstellung) and/or taken into
account by individual value adjustments (Einzelwertberichtigung) in the Final
Effective Date Accounts.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

8.6

  |  

The Buyer is entitled to demand damages pursuant to this Clause 8 only to the
extent that the sum of all claims exceeds EUR 1,000,000.00 (in words: Euro one
million) in which case the Buyer shall be entitled to claim only the exceeding
amount of damages (allowable deduction - Freibetrag) (the "Basket"). In the
calculation of the sum of the claims, individual claims are only taken into
consideration if and to the extent that they exceed EUR 20,000.00 (in words:
Euro twenty thousand) (de minimis). The Seller\'s total liability for claims
pursuant to Clauses 5 to 8 is restricted to a maximum amount of 25% of the
Final Purchase Price; however, to the extent that the claims are based on the
breach of Warranties in Clauses 6.1.2, 6.1.3 and 6.6.3, the maximum liability
amount is 100 % of the Final Purchase Price (the "Cap"). In no event the
liability of the Seller under this Agreement shall exceed the Final Purchase
Price.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

8.7

  |  

Except as otherwise set forth in Clause 8.3, the Buyer's claims pursuant to
this Clause 8 for the breach of Warranty

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

(a)

  |  

in Clauses 6.1.2, 6.1.3 and 6.6.3 become statute-barred 5 (five) years after
the Effective Date,

\- 24 -  

  

 

 

 

   
 


 

  

    

  |  

(b)

  |  

in Clause 6.7.1(iii) become statute barred 12 (twelve) months after the
Effective Date, and

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

(c)

  |  

all other Buyer\'s claims pursuant to this Clause 8 become statute-barred 18
(eighteen) months after the Effective Date.

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

The claims become statute-barred irrespective of the Buyer\'s Knowledge of the
claim. Section 215 BGB does not apply.

  

  

    

8.8

  |  

The Buyer must ensure that the Seller and the Guarantor are informed as soon
as reasonably possible if third parties assert or threaten claims against the
Buyer or the Companies that might lead to a liability of the Seller pursuant
to this Clause 8 (the "Liability-Relevant Third Party Claims"). Clause 8.1
Sentence 2 applies mutatis mutandis. The Buyer must in addition ensure that
all available documents and information required for the assessment whether
there are valid grounds for the asserted or threatened Liability-Relevant
Third Party Claims are made available to the Seller, the Guarantor and their
advisors bound to professional secrecy. The Buyer must give the Seller and the
Guarantor the chance to take over the defense of any Liability-Relevant Third
Party Claim at their own costs and expenses. The Buyer must in particular
ensure that no declarations are made or settlements concluded to end any
proceedings which the Seller or the Guarantor is taking over the defense
without the prior consent of the Seller and the Guarantor. Notwithstanding any
provision contained herein to the contrary, the Seller and the Guarantor shall
not have the right to assume control of such defense if such claim (i) seeks
non-monetary relief (nicht auf Zahlung gerichtete Anspruche, z.B.
Erfullungsanspruche, Unterlassungs­anspruche, einstweilige Verfugungen etc.),
(ii) involves criminal allegations and/or (iii) involves a claim against or by
a Key Customer or Key Supplier; regarding any claim involving non-monetary
relief and/or against or by a Key Customer and/or Key Supplier the Buyer shall
take any and all measures and actions reasonably necessary to give the Seller
the opportunity to participate in the respective lawsuit, in particular to
include the Seller into the respective lawsuit by way of third party
intervention (Nebenintervention), third-party notice (Streitverkundung) or
similar instruments under applicable law, and, to the extent required to
enable the intervention, third party notice or similar instrument, assign the
relevant claim the Buyer might have against the Seller and/or the Guarantor
under this Clause 8 (Regressanspruch) to the respective Target Company which
is involved in the lawsuit.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

8.9

  |  

The Buyer is only entitled to claims and rights due to incorrectness of the
Warranties to the extent to which they are expressly provided for in this
Agreement. Otherwise, all other rights and claims of the Buyer of whatever
nature, in particular further-reaching claims due to defects or equalisation
claims, claims pursuant to section 280 BGB which would in earlier case-law
have been understood as claims out of culpa in contrahendo or positive breach
of contract, rights of rescission for the lack of important characteristics,
and claims arising from Section 313 BGB, are excluded to the extent permitted
by statute. The exclusion of liability also applies to claims of the Buyer
under this Agreement for a reduction of the Purchase Price, damages for an
interruption of business, internal costs or fixed overhead costs,
reimbursement for wasted expenditure, compensation for loss of profit or
reduction in value due to loss of income, compensation for consequential loss,
claims because the Purchase Price was calculated on the wrong

\- 25 -  

  

 

 

 

   
 

basis or because the loss should have been calculated taking into
consideration the Buyer\'s valuation method, as well as to any tax
consequences of payments by the Seller after recourse on the basis of this
Agreement. The exclusion of liability pursuant to this Clause 8.9 does not
apply to claims based upon willful deceit (arglistige Tauschung) and
intentional misconduct (vorsatzliches Handeln) which shall remain unaffected.
The exclusion of liability pursuant to this Clause 8.9 also applies to the
extent to which Warranties are given exclusively as of the Signing Date become
incorrect after the conclusion of this Agreement. Clauses 9 and 10 remain
unaffected.

  

  

    

8.10

  |  

If, contrary to the intent of the Parties, the provisions of this Agreement
restricting the Seller's or the Guarantor\'s liability are considered invalid,
the Buyer hereby waives the assertion of claims which extend beyond the
content or time boundaries of these provisions, irrespective of their
validity.

12.

---|---

consummation of this Transaction. If the Parties discover that this assumption
is not correct the Buyer will without undue delay and with the assistance of
the Seller initiate and perform all necessary steps and actions required for

13.

  |  

CONFIDENTIALITY AND PROVIDING INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTIES

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

13.1

  |  

The Curamik Group Companies must, without limitation in time, keep secret any
confidential matters of the Target Companies. Confidential matters of the

interest in secrecy and in relation to which no statutory disclosure

---|--- 
 

  

  

    

13.2

  |  

The Parties must keep secret the contents of this Agreement to the extent that
no statutory or regulatory disclosure obligations exist or the respective
other Party has not consented to the disclosure. The Parties must also keep
secret any information they have received about each other and about the
enterprises affiliated with the respective other Party as defined in section
15 AktG since they have started talks about the acquisition of the Shares, to
the extent that such information is not known or available to the public, or
the respective other Party has not consented to the disclosure of the
information. To the extent the Buyer is obliged under any statutory or
regulatory provision (including but not limited to the financial reporting
requirements as described in Clause 11.5) to disclose confidential

RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFER

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

Claims out of or in connection with this Agreement can only be transferred
with the prior consent of the respective other Party. Consent is not required
with regard to transfers from the Buyer to enterprises affiliated with it as
defined in section 15 AktG if the transferring Party remains liable for its
obligations under this Agreement.

  

  

    

16.

COSTS AND TRANSFER TAXES

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

The costs of notarisation, as well as the other transfer costs resulting from
the conclusion and implementation of this Agreement and any transfer Taxes
(Verkehrssteuern) in particular any possible real estate transfer taxes, must
be borne by the Buyer. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the costs and fees
relating to the registration of the transfer of the Curamik IP in all
jurisdictions where such property is registered must be borne by the Seller.
The costs arising in connection with a possible notification of the
acquisition project to the competent merger control authority, including the
costs charged by the competent merger control authority, must be borne by the
Buyer. The costs of an expert opinion that may become necessary under Clause
4.1 must be borne by the Parties in proportion to the result of such opinion;
to the extent that the auditing firm preparing the expert opinion requests
advance payments towards costs, the Parties are mutually obliged to bear these
in equal parts. For the remainder, each Party must bear its own costs,
including the costs of its advisors. For the avoidance of doubt, the transfer
Taxes shall not include any Taxes resulting from the capital gain
(Veraußerungsgewinn) of the Seller or any other Taxes payable by the Seller
due to the sale and transfer of the Shares by the Seller to the Buyer; the
claims of the Buyer under the provisions set forth in Annex 9 remain
unaffected.

FINAL PROVISIONS

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

17.1

  |  

The Guarantor shall be jointly and severally liable (gesamtschuldnerisch
haftbar) within the meaning of Section 421 German Civil Code for any and all
payment obligations of the Seller of any kind (Anspruche auf Zahlung in Geld
gleich welcher Art) arising out of and/or in connection with this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated thereunder including the indemnification
obligations hereunder and the obligation of the Company for repayment of the
Buyer Loan to the Buyer in case the Buyer or the Seller have withdrawn from
this Agreement. In no event the liability of the Guarantor under this
Agreement shall exceed the liability of the Seller which according to Clause
8.6 shall in no event exceed the Final Purchase Price, and in case of a
withdrawal from this Agreement the Preliminary Purchase Price. All information
and participation rights of the Seller against the Buyer under this Agreement
as well as all obligations of the Buyer hereto apply towards the Guarantor
mutatis mutandis (regardless of whether or not this Agreement expressly
provides for such rights and obligations vis-a-vis the Guarantor).

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

17.2

  |  

This Agreement (including the Annexes, which are an integral part of this
Agreement) contains the entire agreement reached between the Parties on the
subject of this Agreement. There are no side agreements.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

17.3

  |  

Amendments and supplements to this Agreement as well as the waiver of any
rights under this Agreement must be in writing in order to be valid unless
notarisation is required. This also applies to any amendment to, or
cancellation of, this written form clause.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

17.4

  |  

All disputes arising in connection with this Agreement or its validity shall
be finally settled in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the German
Institution of Arbitration e.V. (DIS) which are in force at the relevant time
without recourse to the ordinary courts of law. The place of arbitration is
Munich. The arbitral tribunal consists of 3 (three) arbitrators. The
substantive law of Germany is applicable to the dispute and this Agreement is
to be interpreted exclusively consistent with German law and usage of
terminology. This includes, without limitation, the legal concepts and terms
contained in this Agreement, the English translations of which may not be
identical with the original German terms in their respective legal
understanding. Where a German term has been inserted in quotation marks and/or
italics, such term alone (and not the English term to which it relates) shall
be authoritative for the interpretation of the respective provision. The
language of the arbitration proceedings is English, provided, however, that
written evidence may be submitted in either the English or German language.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

17.5

  |  

Any days other than Saturdays, Sundays and bank holidays in Frankfurt am Main,
Germany are referred to in this Agreement as "Bank Working Days", each a "Bank
Working Day".

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

17.6

  |  

Should a provision of this Agreement or a provision later on included in this
Agreement be or become null and void as a whole or in part, or should a gap in
this Agreement become evident, this does not affect the validity of the
remaining provisions. Instead of the null and void provision, or in order to
fill the gap, such valid and practicable regulation must be agreed that in
legal and economic terms

   
---|--- 
 

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

\- 33 -  

  

 

 

 

   
 

comes closest to what the Parties intended or would have intended in
accordance with the purpose of this Agreement if they had considered the point
when entering into this Agreement. If the nullity of a provision is due to a
degree of performance or time (period or deadline) laid down in this
provision, then the provision is deemed to be agreed with a legally
permissible degree that comes closest to the original degree.

  

  

The notary instructed the persons appearing:

  

  

    

*

  |  

about the liability for additional contributions; section 26 German Act on
Limited Liabilities Companies (Gesetz betreffend die Gesellschaften mit
beschrankter Haftung "GmbHG") and subsidiary payments (section 3 GmbHG);

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

*

  |  

about the contingent liability for the non-payment of contributions (section
22, 24 GmbHG) and for prohibited disbursements (section 31 para 3 GmbHG);

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

*

  |  

about the liability for any shortfall in the share capital at the Company\'s
registration (section 9 GmbHG);

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

*

  |  

that, if under the Company\'s Articles of Association the transfer of the
Shares is subject to the Company\'s or the shareholders\' consent, it is
provisionally invalid until the consent is granted (section 15 para 5 GmbHG);

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

*

  |  

that pursuant to section 16 GmbHG in the case of a change to the group of
shareholders or the amount of their shares only such person is considered a
shareholder by the GmbH who is entered as such in the list of shareholders
registered with the commercial register, and about the risk that acts done by
a buyer in his capacity as shareholder may be invalid if he has not yet been
entered in the list of shareholders;

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

*

  |  

that the notary can file a list of shareholders reflecting the acquisition of
the Shares by the Buyer with the commercial register only upon the transfer of
the Shares becoming effective; the notary is asked by the Parties to file the
new list of shareholders with the commercial register of the Company without
undue delay after the Effective Date;

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

*

  |  

about the legal consequences of a list of shareholders being incorrect, in
particular the possibility and pre-conditions of an acquisition of shares in
good faith from a non-shareholder entered in the list of shareholders, but
also about the risk that a third party may acquire shares in good faith from
the Seller as long as it is still entered in the list of shareholders, and
about the importance of checking the correctness and completeness of the list
of shareholders at regular intervals;

   
---|--- 
 

  

  


 

  

  


 

  

  

    

*

  |  

that it will be checked whether real estate transfer tax arises;

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

*

  |  

that the Parties are jointly and severally liable for any real estate transfer
tax, and for the costs of notarisation of this Agreement.

TAX AND OTHER PUBLIC LEVIES

  

  

    

1.

  |  

The general definitions in this Agreement also apply to this Annex 9.
References to Clauses refer to Clauses in this Annex 9 unless explicitly
stated otherwise.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

2.

  |  

The Target Companies have submitted all domestic and foreign Tax returns,
declarations and statements that are due by the Effective Date, taking into
consideration all time-limit extensions granted, whether express or implied,
or will do so by the Effective Date. The Target Companies have paid, or
retained and paid over, all Taxes that are due by the Effective Date, in each
case in time and in full, or will do so by the Effective Date. For Taxes not
yet due by the Effective Date for periods up until the Effective Date, the
Final Effective Date Accounts must show corresponding liabilities or
sufficient provisions. This also applies to the Taxes which fall due by the
Effective Date for the Tax assessment period (Veranlagungszeitraum) in which
the Effective Date falls.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

3.

  |  

The Seller shall indemnify and hold harmless the Buyer or - at the election of
the Buyer - the respective Target Company from and against any Taxes
(including Taxes resulting from this indemnity) and shall compensate
disadvantages out of Tax assessments and/or liabilities for Taxes (the "Tax
Disadvantages") including an amount payable pursuant to Clause 2 as follows:

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(a)

  |  

Any (i) Taxes unpaid and attributable to any Tax assessment period or part
thereof ending prior to or on the Effective Date and (ii) withholding Taxes on
constructive dividends occurred prior to the Effective Date, (in each case (i)
and (ii) irrespective of when such Taxes become due and payable) asserted
against the Target Companies and/or any Taxes for which any Target Company is
and/or will be held liable under law or under an agreement or resulting from
any act, omission or occurrences prior to or on the Effective Date, including
any Taxes resulting from the invalidity or non-recognition of the Profit and
Loss Transfer Agreement and the Tax consolidation (steuerliche Organschaft) or
the termination of the Profit and Loss Transfer Agreement and of the Tax
consolidation effective as of the end of the business year 2010 of the Company
(expiry of 31 December 2010, 24:00 hours).

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(b)

  |  

The Tax assessment does not result from changes to the Tax treatment by the
Target Companies after the Effective Date (including changes to the valuation
entries, transfer prices or their documentation, or in the exercise of Tax
rights of choice including an election of the Buyer under Sec. 338 Internal
Revenue Code), from legal transactions after the Effective Date (including an
election of the Buyer under Sec. 338 Internal Revenue Code) which lead to a
subsequent or retroactive Tax assessment relating to assessment periods ending
prior to or on the Effective Date unless required under mandatory law or
regulation, by official statements of any Tax authority, or as a consequence
of any Tax audit of the Company and/or its Subsidiaries. Restructurings of the
Target Companies or other

   
---|--- 
 

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

   
 

transactions/measures with retroactive Tax effects (mit steuerlicher
Ruckwirkung) for the Tax assessment periods until 31 December 2010 are subject
to prior consent of the Seller and the Guarantor.

  

  

    

(c)

  |  

To the extent to which the Tax Disadvantage in one Tax assessment period or
part thereof is compensated by corresponding lower liabilities of the Target
Company in the subsequent Tax assessment periods, there will be no
compensation. This is universally applicable to all types of Taxes, in
particular also for reductions of the corporate income Tax burden due to
higher trade Taxes, reductions in value added Tax after the Effective Date in
connection with a higher assessment before the Effective Date and advantages
out of the alteration of Tax rates. In the calculation of the corresponding
lower Tax liabilities in particular for corporate income Tax (including
solidarity surcharge) and trade Tax purposes, a lump sum Tax rate (pauschaler
Steuersatz) of 30% shall be applied (except for value added Tax (Umsatzsteuer)
liabilities which shall be calculated at the applicable Tax rate) and
unaccrued interest (Abzinsung) will be deducted from these at 5 (five) % per
year for any period up to 5 (five) years, or, for any period longer than 5
(five) years or if the period of unaccrued interest is uncertain, as a lump
sum of 30 (thirty) %.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

(d)

  |  

The Buyer is entitled to demand payment pursuant to this Annex 9 only if the
sum of all claims for indemnification of Tax liabilities exceeds EUR 20,000.00
(in words: Euro twenty thousand) in which case the Buyer shall be entitled to
claim the entire amount of claims for indemnifications of Tax liabilities
(Freigrenze) (the "Tax Basket").

   
---|---|--- 
 

  

  

The Seller shall not be responsible for Taxes resulting from any failure of
the Buyer to comply with any of its obligations under this Annex 9 to the
extent such failure results in an increase of Seller's liability under this
Annex 9 or affects the ability of the Seller to avoid or mitigate the damages
incurred by the Buyer or the Target Companies.

  

  

    

4.

  |  

The compensation for Tax Disadvantages pursuant to this Annex 9 is paid to the
Buyer or, if the Buyer so desires, to the respective Target Company. The
payment is due 5 (five) Bank Working Days before the Target Companies\' Tax
debt falls due, but at the earliest 5 (five) Bank Working Days after
notification by the Buyer about the precise amount payable and the date on
which it is due, to which a copy of the Tax assessment notice is attached. The
Buyer agrees to provide the Seller such additional relevant data with respect
to the amount payable and the Tax assessment as the Seller may reasonably
request and as specified in reasonable detail in a written request of Seller.
Payments to be made by Seller to the Buyer or the Target Companies under this
Annex 9 shall become due and payable irrespective whether the Tax assessment
is preliminary or final. Any differences between a preliminary Tax assessment
and a final Tax assessment shall be compensated at the date when the
respective Tax assessment becomes non-appealable (bestandskraftiger, nicht
unter dem Vorbehalt der Nachprufung stehender Bescheid).

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

If and to the extent the Buyer or the Target Companies have a claim for
indemnification of Taxes against a third party the Buyer shall assign or
procure that the respective Target Company assigns the claim against the third
party to the Seller after and to the extent the Seller has indemnified the
Buyer for such Taxes.

   
---|---

Clauses 7 and 8 of the Agreement shall not apply.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

6.

  |  

The Buyer\'s claims pursuant to this Annex 9 become statute-barred - to the
extent to which they are based on a Tax assessment notice, Tax liability
notice (Haftungsbescheid) or declaratory assessment notice
(Feststellungsbescheid) - in each case 3 (three) months after such notice
becomes final (materiell und formell bestandskraftiger, nicht unter dem
Vorbehalt der Nachprufung stehender Bescheid).

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

7.

  |

lead to claims against the Seller, attaching copies of the relevant Tax
assessment notices;

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(d)

  |  

at the request and expense of the Seller, the respective Target Company lodges
reasonable appeals against subsequent Tax demand notices and conducts legal
disputes in accordance with the Seller's reasonable instructions, unless this
would involve material disadvantages for the Target Company, and will not

withheld or delayed for Taxes which can give rise to a claim against the
Seller under this Annex 9;

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(e)

  |

(f)

  |

documents as the Seller may reasonably request and as specified in reasonable
detail in a written request of Seller which in the Seller's view are relevant

with Tax authorities, and

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(g)

  |

this Annex 9 have become statute-barred, or before the expiry of the Tax
obligation to keep records.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

8.

  |  

The Seller and the Guarantor shall ensure all information which is relevant to

---|--- 
 

  

  

    

9.

  |  

The Buyer takes responsibility for the following payments to the Seller and
for informing it without undue delay about the facts and circumstances
connected with them:

(a)

  |  

If a Target Company receives Tax reimbursements (Steuererstattungen) for
periods up until the Effective Datewhich are not taken into account in the
Final Effective Dates Accounts, the Buyer must make a compensation payment to
the Seller in the amount of such Tax reimbursements that thereby accrue to the

(b)

  |  

The Buyer undertakes to refund the Seller for the cash value of all future Tax
reductions (Steuervorteile) other than tax reimbursements (Steuererstattungen)
that occur to the Company or the Buyer after the Effective Date to the extent
that such Tax reductions originate from a Tax of the Company relating to
periods up until the Effective Date in respect of which the Seller´s Taxes
increase as a result of the Tax consolidation with the Company. In the
calculation of the corresponding Tax reductions, a lump sum Tax rate
(pauschaler Steuersatz) of 30% shall be applied (except for value added Tax
(Umsatzsteuer) which shall be calculated at the applicable Tax rate) and
unaccrued interest (Abzinsung) will be deducted from these at 5 (five) % per
year for any period up to 5 (five) years, or, for any period longer than 5
(five) years or if the period of unaccrued interest is uncertain, as a lump
sum of 30 (thirty) %. The Seller is entitled to demand refund of the cash
value of Tax reductions

   
---|--- 
 

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

   
 

pursuant to this Clause 9 (b) only if the sum of all Tax reductions exceeds
EUR 20,000.00 (in words: Euro twenty thousand) in which case the Seller shall
be entitled to claim the entire amount of Tax reductions received.

(15) Bank Working Day after the Buyer or the Target Company received the Tax
reimbursements.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

10.

  |  

The Buyer shall not be responsible for Taxes resulting from any failure of the
Seller to comply with any of its obligations under this Annex 9 to the extent
such failure results in an increase of damages or affects the ability of the
Buyer to avoid or mitigate the damages of the Seller.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

  |  

If the Buyer fails to comply with any of its obligations under this Annex 9
and such failure results in an increase of Tax liabilities for the periods up
until the Effective Date payable by Seller as a result of the tax
consolidation (ertragsteuerliche Organschaft) between Seller and the Company
and related to the taxable income of the Company, the Buyer shall, in
addition, compensate the Seller for all Tax Disadvantages relating to periods
up until the Effective Date that would not have existed but for such failure
so that the Seller is in the same position as it would have been in if the
Buyer had duly and properly fulfilled its obligations under this Annex 9; the
Seller shall avoid and/or mitigate any increase of such Tax liability caused
by the Buyer\'s breach of its duties pursuant.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

11.

  |

information of Seller by the Buyer and vice versa in relation to this Annex 9
can be sent by telefax or e-mail. Section 14.1 of this Agreement does not

Gebuhren) or equivalent Taxes and social security contributions under the laws
of any other jurisdiction imposed by any governmental or administrative
authority (also referred to as the "Tax Authority") or owed due to
