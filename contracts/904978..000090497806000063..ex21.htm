further action on the  part of the holders of any Shares, Company Stock
Options, Warrants or any shares  of capital stock of MergerCo:


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  (a) _Capital  Stock of MergerCo_.  Each  share of common stock, par
value $0.001 per share, of MergerCo issued and  outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be converted into  and  become 1 share of Class
D Common Stock of the Surviving  Corporation.

 

 

(b) _Common  Stock, Warrants and Company Stock Options Owned by Company
Subsidiaries,  Acquiror or MergerCo_.  Each  Share, Warrant and Company
Stock Option that is held by any Subsidiary of the  Company, and each Share,
Warrant and Company Stock Option that is held by  Acquiror, MergerCo or any
Affiliate of Acquiror or MergerCo, shall automatically  be cancelled and
retired and shall cease to exist, and no cash or other  consideration shall
be delivered or deliverable in exchange  therefor.

 

 

(c) _Conversion  of Common Stock_.  Except  for shares of Common Stock that
are subject to _Sections  3.1(b)_ ,  _3.1(d)_   or  _3.1(e)_   each

Except  for Company Stock Options and Warrants that are subject to _Section

from  the  Company cash in an amount equal to the product of (i) the number
of Shares  for which such Company Stock Option or Warrant, as applicable, is
exercisable  and (ii) the excess of the Per Share Merger Consideration over
the per  share exercise price of such Company Stock Option or Warrant, as
applicable,  less any applicable Taxes deducted or withheld pursuant to

Stock that are subject to _Sections  3.1(b)_ ,  _3.1(d)_   or  _3.1(e)_

paid from  the Payment Fund as contemplated hereby, Acquiror shall promptly
replace or  restore the portion of the Payment Fund lost through investments
or other events  so as to ensure that the Payment Fund is, at all times,

Corporation shall cause the  Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record

therefor.

 

 

(d) _Payment  by Paying Agent_.  Upon  the surrender of a Certificate for

Stock held by such holder and (B) the Per Share Merger  Consideration, (ii)
in the case of Preferred Stock, the consideration described  in _Section 
3.1(g)_ and  (iii) in the case of Warrants, the consideration described in

this _Section 3.2_,  any  Certificate (other than Certificates representing
Shares described in  _Sections 3.1(b)_  and  _(d)_   and any  Dissenting
Shares) shall be deemed, at any time after the Effective Time, to  represent

to holders of Company Stock Options the amounts set forth in  _Section
3.1(f)_.

cancelled and exchanged as provided in this _Article III_.  Until 
surrendered in accordance with the provisions of this _Section 3.2_,  each 
Certificate (other than Certificates representing any Shares described in 
_Sections  3.1(b)_   and  _(d)_   and any  Dissenting Shares) shall
represent for all purposes only the right to receive  the consideration
described in _Section 3.1_  applicable thereto, without any interest thereon,

(h) _Transfers  of Ownership_.  In the  event of a transfer of ownership of

respect  thereto is presented to the Paying Agent or Acquiror, as applicable,
properly  endorsed and accompanied by all documents required to evidence and
effect such  transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock transfer
taxes have been  paid.

 

 

(i) _Lost,  Stolen and Destroyed Certificates_.  If any  Certificate shall
have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an  affidavit of that
fact by the holder thereof, the Paying Agent or Acquiror,  as  applicable,
shall pay in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate  the
relevant portion of the Total Merger Payment payable in respect thereof 
pursuant to this _Section 3.2_  for  Shares represented thereby; _provided_
,  _however_ ,  that  the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent may, in
their discretion, require  the delivery of a satisfactory indemnity.

 

 

(j) _Termination  of Payment Fund_.  Any  portion of the Payment Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of the  Shares or Warrants for 6 months
after the Effective Time shall be delivered  to  the Surviving Corporation
on demand. Any holders of Shares or Warrants prior  to  the Merger who have
not exchanged all of their Shares or Warrants, as  applicable, in accordance
with _Articles II_  and  _III_   prior to  that time shall thereafter look
only to


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  Surviving Corporation and only as general creditors thereof with respect
to  any  portion of the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof,
without  interest.

 

 

(k) _No  Liability_.  None of  the Paying Agent, Acquiror, MergerCo or the
Surviving Corporation shall be  liable to any holder of a Certificate for any
amount properly delivered to  a  public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or  similar law.

 

 

(l) _Withholding  Rights_.  Each of  Acquiror, the Surviving Corporation
and the Paying Agent shall be entitled  to  deduct and withhold from any
consideration otherwise payable to any Person  pursuant to this Agreement
such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold  with respect to the
making of such payment under the Code, or any provision  of  applicable Tax
Law. To the extent that such amounts are so withheld or paid  over  to or
deposited with the relevant Governmental Authority by Acquiror, the 
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, such withheld amounts shall be 
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
applicable  Person in respect to which such deduction and withholding was
made.

 

 

Section  3.3 _Stockholder  Representative_.

 

 

(a) Immediately  upon obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, each
Stockholder shall be  deemed to have consented to the appointment of

as  Stockholder Representative except to the extent that such action or

(a) Since  December 31, 2005, the Company and its Subsidiaries have conducted
their  business in the ordinary course consistent with past practice, and
neither  the  Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has:

 

 

(i) declared,  set aside, made or paid any dividends or other distributions
(whether in cash,  stock, property or otherwise) with respect to any of its
capital stock, except  for dividends, distributions or other payments made by
any direct or indirect  wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company to any other

Preferred Stock with respect  to  the Preferred Stock as required pursuant
to the terms of the Certificate of  Designations;

Section  4.8 _Compliance  with Law; Permits_.

 

 

(a) Each  of  the Company and its Subsidiaries is in compliance in all
material respects  with  all applicable Laws. Since January 1, 2004, none of

Subsidiaries has not complied in any  material respect with any Law
applicable to the Company or any of its  Subsidiaries.  

 

(b) (i)  Each  of the Company and its Subsidiaries is in possession of all
Permits granted  by  any health care regulatory agency or other Governmental
Authority (including  any  Governmental Authority having jurisdiction over
the accreditation,  certification, licensing, evaluation or operation of any
of the facilities  or  services of the Company) required for

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  provision of health care services by the Company or its Subsidiaries
and/or  the  reimbursement of health care costs relating thereto ("
_Health  Care Licenses_ ")  necessary for the Company and its Subsidiaries
to operate the businesses  conducted by the Company and its Subsidiaries as
currently conducted (the  " _Company  Health Care Licenses_ "). 
_Schedule  4.8(b) of the Disclosure Schedules_   sets  forth a true and
correct list of the Company Health Care Licenses. All Company  Health Care
Licenses (x) are valid and in full force and effect, and (y) are  in  good

in  compliance with applicable Laws. The Company is not party or subject to
any  judgment, order, decree, injunction, ruling or assessment (" _Order_
")  or  Action with respect to any Company Health Care License. The Company
has not  received notice of any Order or Action pending or recommended by
any  Governmental Authority (or, in the case of accreditation, any
accreditation  body) having jurisdiction over any Company Health Care License
to revoke,  withdraw, suspend, limit, restrict or impair any Company Health
Care License.  No  event has occurred which, with or without the giving of
notice, the passage  of  time, or both, would (A) constitute grounds for a
material violation or order  with respect to any Company Health Care License;
(B) be reasonably likely to  result in the revocation, withdrawal or
suspension of any Company Health Care  License; (C) result in any material
fines, penalties or sanctions against the  Company; (D) give rise to any
material obligation on the part of the Company  to  undertake, or to bear
all or any portion of the cost or, any remedial action  of  any nature
(other than the cure of deficiencies in the ordinary course of  business); or
(E) result in the imposition of any Encumbrance against the  Company or any
of its properties under any Company Health Care License, and  the  Company
has received no notice of any of the foregoing.

 

 

(ii) Each  of  the Company and its Subsidiaries is in possession of all
Permits, other than  Health Care Licenses, necessary for each of the Company
and its Subsidiaries  to  own, lease and operate its properties and to carry
on its business as currently  conducted, except where the failure to have, or
the suspension or cancellation  of, any of such Permits would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably  be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect.

 

 

Section  4.9 _Litigation_.  There  is no Action by or against the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries pending or,  to  the Knowledge of the Company,
threatened that would reasonably be expected  to  result in losses, costs
and expenses to the Company and its Subsidiaries in  excess of $500,000 or
limit or restrict in any material respect the operation  of  the business of
the Company and its Subsidiaries as presently  conducted.

"))  and  all bonus, stock option, stock purchase, restricted stock,
incentive, deferred  compensation, retiree medical or life insurance,
supplemental retirement,  severance or other benefit plans, programs or
arrangements, that are maintained,  contributed to or sponsored by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries for the  benefit of any current or former

or under which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries  has or is reasonably
expected to have any present or future liability (directly  or indirectly),
(ii) a list of all material employment,


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

19

pursuant to which  the  Company or any of its Subsidiaries currently has any
obligation with respect  to  any current or former employee, officer or
director of the Company or any of  its  Subsidiaries and (iii) a list of all
Employee Merger Payments, and the type  and  amount of the Employee Merger
Payments with respect to each recipient or  potential recipient of an
Employee Merger Payment (collectively, the  " _Employee  Plans_ ").  The 
Company has made available to Acquiror, with respect to each Employee Plan, 
a  true and complete copy of (where applicable) each Employee Plan, all
current  summary plan descriptions, the three most recently filed Form 5500s,
the most  recent determination or opinion letter from the IRS, all material
correspondence  to or from any Governmental Authority received in the last
three years, all  discrimination tests for the most recent three plan years,
and all material  written agreements and contracts currently in effect,
including (without  limitation) administrative service agreements, group

accordance with  its terms and the requirements of applicable Law, including
ERISA and the Code,  (ii) each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has

Employee Plan and is not  in  any material respect in default under or in
violation of any Employee Plan  and  (iii) no Action (other than claims for
benefits in the ordinary course) is  pending or threatened in writing with
respect to any Employee Plan and, to  the  Knowledge of the Company, no
facts or conditions exist that would reasonably  be  expected to result in
such an Action. Neither the Company nor any of its  Subsidiaries is subject
to any material liability or penalty under Sections  4975  through 4980B of
the Code or Title I of ERISA. The Company and its Subsidiaries  have complied
in all material respects with all applicable health care  continuation
requirements in Section 4980B of the Code and in ERISA. No  "Prohibited
Transaction," within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code or  Sections 406
or 407 of ERISA and not otherwise exempt under Section 408 of  ERISA, has
occurred with respect to any Benefit Plan that would reasonably  be 
expected to result in a material liability for the Company or its 
Subsidiaries.

 

 

(c) Each  Employee Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a)
of the  Code  has received a determination or opinion letter from the IRS
that it is so  qualified and each related trust that is intended to be exempt
from federal  income taxation under Section 501(a) of the Code has received
a  determination or opinion letter from the IRS that it is so exempt and, to
the  Knowledge of the Company, no fact or event has occurred since the date
of such  letter or letters from the IRS that would reasonably be expected to
result  in  the loss of the qualified status of any such Employee Plan or
the exempt status  of any such trust.

 

 

(d) None  of  the Employee Plans is a multiemployer plan (within the meaning
of Section 3(37)  or 4001(a)(3) of ERISA) or a single employer plan (within
the meaning of Section  4001(a)(15) of ERISA) for which the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries would  reasonably  be expected to incur liability under
Section 4063 or 4064 of ERISA, including  any liability that could be imposed
if the Company were to fully or partially  withdraw from such Employee Plan.
 

 

(e) Neither  the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any
contract, agreement  or  arrangement that could, directly or in combination
with other events, including  the

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

20  

 

 

 

 

 

 

transactions  contemplated by this Agreement, result, separately or in the
aggregate, in  the  payment, acceleration or enhancement of any benefit to
any current or former  employee or director that would be considered an
"excess parachute payment"  within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code.

 

 

(f) No  Employee Plan provides or reflects or represents any liability to
provide  welfare benefits (including, without limitation, death or medical
benefits),  whether or not insured, with respect to any former or current
employee, or  any  spouse or dependent of any such employee, beyond the
employee\'s retirement  or  other termination of employment with the Company
and its Subsidiaries other  than  (i) coverage mandated by Part 6 of Title I
of ERISA or Section 4980B of the  Code  or (ii) long-term disability
benefits that have been fully provided for by  insurance under a Benefit Plan
that constitutes an "employee welfare benefit  plan" within the meaning of
Section (3)(1) of ERISA.

 

 

(g) Except  for benefits determined pursuant to the terms of the Supplemental
Executive  Retirement Plan specifically identified on _Section  4.10(g) of
the Disclosure Schedules_   (the  " _SERP_ "),  the  Company and its
Subsidiaries have no liability or contingent liability under  a 
"nonqualified deferred compensation plan," as defined in Code Section 
409A(d)(1). The Company has established a grantor trust (the " _Rabbi  Trust_
")  to  hold assets for the payment of benefits under the SERP. Except in
the event  of  the Company\'s insolvency, all assets of the Rabbi Trust may
only be used for  the  payment of benefits under the SERP. All contributions
for benefits earned under  the SERP have been made in full to the Rabbi
Trust. No participant or  beneficiary of the SERP may become entitled to any
benefit under the SERP in  excess of the assets of the Rabbi Trust
attributable to such participant or  beneficiary, and the aggregate benefits
of all participants and beneficiaries  under the SERP do not exceed the
assets of the Rabbi Trust.

 

 

Section  4.11 _Labor  and Employment Matters_.

 

 

(a) Neither  the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any labor
or collective  bargaining contract that pertains to employees of the Company

organization has filed  a  petition with the National Labor Relations Board
or any other Governmental  Authority seeking certification as the collective
bargaining representative  of  any employee of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. There are no pending,  or  to the Knowledge of the Company,
threatened Actions concerning labor or  employment Law matters with respect
to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,  including but not limited to any
(i) strike, lockout, material slowdown or  material work stoppage with
respect to any employees of the Company or any  of  its Subsidiaries, (ii)
material unfair labor practice charge, grievance or  complaint filed or
pending against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,  or  (iii) material
Action in which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is alleged  to  have
violated any Laws relating to employment, equal opportunity,  discrimination,
harassment, retaliation, immigration, wages, hours, benefits,  collective
bargaining, the payment of social security and similar taxes and/or  privacy
rights of employees.  

 

(b) Neither  the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is subject to, nor, to
the Knowledge  of  the Company, is there any reasonable expectation that the
Company or any  of its  Subsidiaries will be subject to, any material
liability with respect to any  misclassification of any

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21  

 

 

 

 

 

 

person  as  (i) an independent contractor rather than as an employee, or
with respect to  any  employee leased from another employer, or (ii) an
employee exempt from state  or  federal overtime regulations.

 

 

(c) Since  January 1, 2004, neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has

Retraining  Notification Act (the " _WARN  Act_ ")  or any  similar state,
local or foreign Law) affecting any site of employment or one  or  more
facilities or operating units within any site of employment or facility  of 
the Company or any Subsidiary or (ii) a "mass layoff" (as defined in the 
WARN Act (or any similar state, local or foreign Law)) affecting any site of 
employment or facility of the Company or any Subsidiary, except in each case 
that all material liabilities under the WARN Act have been  satisfied.

 

 

Section  4.12 _Insurance_.  _Schedule  4.12 of the Disclosure Schedules_  
sets  forth a true and complete list of all material insurance policies in
force  with  respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries. All such policies
are in full  force  and effect and, to the Knowledge of the Company, no
event has occurred that  would, by the terms of the policy, reasonably be
expected to give any insurance  carrier a right to terminate any such policy
prior to its  expiration.

 

 

(b) _Schedule  4.12(b) of the Disclosure Schedules_ sets  forth a true and
complete list, in all material respects, of all claim activity  from June 30,

Real  Property. The Company or its Subsidiaries have good and marketable fee
simple  title to each parcel of Owned Real Property, free and clear of all
Encumbrances,  other than Permitted Encumbrances. There are no leases,
subleases, licenses,  concessions, or other agreements that are material to

(b) _Schedule  4.13(b) of the Disclosure Schedules_   contains  a true,
complete and correct list of (i) the street addresses for each parcel  of 
Leased Real Property and (ii) the identity of the lessor, lessee and current 
occupant (if different from lessee) of each such parcel of Leased Real
Property.  Each Leased Real Property is free and clear of all Encumbrances,
other than  Permitted Encumbrances and any such exceptions that would not,
individually  or  in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect.  Each  lease and sublease

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22  

 

 

 

 

 

 

relating  to the Leased Real Property is legal, valid, binding, enforceable
and in full  force and effect in all material respects. To the Knowledge of
the Company,  the  Company and its Subsidiaries are not in default in any
material respect under  any such lease or sublease and there exists no event
of default or event,  occurrence, condition or act which, with the giving of
notice or lapse of time,  would become a default under any such lease or
sublease beyond any applicable  notice or cure period. The Company and its
Subsidiaries have made available  to  Acquiror true, correct and complete

its Subsidiaries, and shall furnish Acquiror with  such financial, operating
and other data and information as Acquiror may  reasonably request;
_provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that  any such access or furnishing of
information shall be conducted at Acquiror\'s  expense, during normal
business hours, under the supervision of the Company\'s  personnel and in
such a manner as not unreasonably to interfere with the normal  operations of
the Company and its Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding anything to  the  contrary
in this Agreement, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries  shall be
required to disclose any information to Acquiror or its Representatives  if
such  disclosure would, in the Company\'s sole discretion, (i) jeopardize
any  attorney-client or other legal privilege or (ii) contravene any
applicable  Laws,  fiduciary duty or binding agreement entered into prior to
the date  hereof. 

 

(b) In  order  to facilitate the resolution of any claims made against or
incurred by the  Stockholders (as they relate to the Company and its
Subsidiaries), for a period  of 7 years after the Closing or, if shorter, the
applicable period specified  in  the Company\'s document retention policy
from time to time, the Company shall  (i)  retain the books and records
relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries  relating to periods prior to
the Closing and (ii) afford the Representatives  of  the Stockholder
Representative reasonable access (including the right to  make,  at the
applicable Stockholder\'s expense, photocopies), during normal business 
hours, to such books and records; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that  the
Company shall notify the Stockholder Representative in writing at least  30 
days in advance of destroying any such books and records prior to the
seventh  anniversary of the Closing Date in order to provide the
Stockholder  Representative and its Representatives the opportunity to copy
such books  and  records in accordance with this _Section  6.2(b)_.

 

 

Section  6.3 _Stockholder  Approval_.  The  Company shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to deliver to Acquiror,  promptly following
the execution and delivery of this Agreement and in  accordance with the
DGCL, the Certificate of Incorporation, the Certificate  of  Designations
and the Bylaws, (i) a written consent of the Stockholders holding  at least
80% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (measured by both  voting 
rights and including 100% of the outstanding shares of Class D Common Stock) 
approving the adoption of this 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

32  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Agreement  and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the COD
Amendment; (ii)  a  written consent of the holders of 100% of the
outstanding shares of Preferred  Stock approving the adoption of this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated  hereby, including the COD
Amendment, and a waiver by the holders of 100% of  the  outstanding shares
of Preferred Stock of appraisal rights under Section 262  of  the DGCL; and
(iii) a written waiver of appraisal rights under Section 262  of  the DGCL
by the holders of 100% of the outstanding shares of Class B Common  Stock.
Promptly following the execution and delivery of this Agreement and  the 
delivery of the consents described in the prior sentence, the Company shall 
(x)  file the COD Amendment with the Secretary of State of Delaware in
accordance  with the DGCL and (y) comply with the requirements of Sections
228 and 262  of  the DGCL.

 

 

Section  6.4 _Notification  of Certain Matters_.  Each  party hereto shall
give written notice to the other parties hereto promptly  upon  becoming
aware of (i) any occurrence, or failure to occur, of any event, which 
occurrence or failure to occur has caused or is reasonably likely to cause 
any  of its representations or warranties in this Agreement to be untrue or 
inaccurate in any material respect as of the Closing Date and (ii) any
material  failure by it to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or
agreement  to  be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder; _provided_ , 
that  the delivery of any notice pursuant to this _Section  6.4_   shall
in  no event (a) limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder
to  the  other parties hereto upon receiving such notice or (b) survive or
have any  effect following the Closing.

 

 

Section  6.5 _No  Solicitation_.  If this  Agreement is terminated prior
to the Effective Time, neither Acquiror nor its  Affiliates will, prior to
December 13, 2007, directly or indirectly,  without the prior written consent
of the Company, solicit (other than a  solicitation by general advertisement)
any person who is an employee of the  Company, at the date hereof or at any
time hereafter that precedes such  termination, to terminate his or her
employment with the Company.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Acquiror
nor its Affiliates shall be  precluded from hiring an employee of the Company
who has been terminated by  the  Company prior to commencement of employment
discussions between such party  and  such employee, _provided_   that 
such hiring is consistent with such employee\'s contractual obligations to
the  Company. Further, Acquiror shall be permitted to utilize general
newspaper  advertising and recruiters so long as the Company\'s employees are
not identified  to the recruiters and are not otherwise specifically targeted
by such  advertising or recruiters. Acquiror agrees that any remedy at law
for any breach  by Acquiror of this _Section  6.5_   would be  inadequate,
and that the Company would be entitled to injunctive relief in  such  a
case. If it is ever held that this restriction on Acquiror is too onerous 
and  is not necessary for the protection of the Company, Acquiror agrees that
any  court of competent jurisdiction may impose such lesser restrictions that
such  court may consider to be necessary or appropriate properly to protect
the  Company.

 

 

Section  6.6 _Takeover  Statutes_.  If any  state takeover statute or
similar Law shall be or become applicable to the  transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, each of the Company, Acquiror  and  MergerCo and their
respective Boards of Directors shall grant such approvals  and  shall take
such actions as are reasonably necessary so that the transactions 
contemplated hereby may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the
terms  contemplated hereby and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the
effects  of  such statute or Law on the transactions contemplated hereby.

Section  6.7 _Employee  Benefits_.

 

 

(a) Acquiror  shall provide, or cause to be provided, to the employees of the
Company and  its  Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time (the " _Affected 
Employees_ "),  for a  period of 1 year following the Effective Time,
compensation and employee  benefits that in the aggregate are comparable to
either (i) those currently  provided by the Company and its Subsidiaries to
their employees and as disclosed  to the Acquiror prior to the date hereof
(but without regard to equity-based  compensation, non-qualified deferred
compensation and change of control benefits  provided by the Company and its
Subsidiaries) or (ii) subject to the terms  of  any applicable collective
bargaining agreement, those provided to similarly  situated employees of
Acquiror and its Affiliates, **** and  Acquiror shall cause to be provided to
any Affected Employee who is  involuntarily terminated (other than for cause
or poor performance) during  such  1-year period following the Effective
Time severance benefits comparable in  the  aggregate to those currently
provided by the Company and its Subsidiaries to  similarly situated
employees.

 

 

(b) Acquiror  shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, honor all
unused vacation,  holiday, sickness and personal days accrued as of the
Closing Date by the  employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries under the
policies and practices  of the Company and its Subsidiaries. In the event of
any change within the  1-year period following the Closing Date in the
welfare benefits provided to  any  employee of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries under any plan, Acquiror  shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, (i) waive all limitations  as  to preexisting conditions,
exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation  and coverage
requirements applicable to the Affected Employees and their covered 
dependents under such plan (except to the extent that such conditions, 
exclusions or waiting periods would apply under the Company\'s or such 
Subsidiary\'s then existing plans absent any change in such welfare coverage 
plan) and (ii) provide each Affected Employee and his or her covered
dependents  with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid prior to any
such change  in  coverage in satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-
pocket requirements  under such new or changed plan. Acquiror shall, or shall
cause the Surviving  Corporation to, provide each Affected Employee with
credit for all service  with  the Company and its Affiliates under each
employee benefit plan, policy, program  or arrangement in which such Affected
Employee is eligible to participate,  except to the extent that such credit
would result in a duplication of benefits  with respect to the same period of
services. 

 

(c) Nothing  in this Agreement shall be deemed to constitute an amendment to
any employee  benefit plan of the Company, Acquiror or any of their
Affiliates.

 

 

Section  6.8 _Confidentiality_.  Any  information provided to Acquiror or
its Representatives pursuant to this  Agreement shall be held by Acquiror and
its Representatives in accordance  with,  and shall be subject to the terms
of, the Confidentiality Agreement dated  June  13, 2006 by and between
Acquiror and the Company (the " _Confidentiality  Agreement_ "). 

 

 

Section  6.9 _Consents  and Filings; Further Assurances_.

 

 

(a) Each  of  the parties hereto shall use his, her or its commercially
reasonable efforts  to  take, or cause to be taken, or do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary,  proper or advisable under applicable Law to
obtain all regulatory approvals  and  to cause the transactions

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

34  

 

 

 

 

 

 

contemplated  hereby to be completed in accordance with the terms hereof as
promptly as  practicable and shall cooperate fully with each other party and
their respective  Representatives in connection with any steps required to be
taken as a part  of  their respective obligations under this Agreement,
including without  limitation:

 

 

(i) Promptly  upon execution and delivery of this Agreement, each of
Acquiror, MergerCo and  the Company shall prepare and file as promptly as
possible, or cause to be  prepared and filed, with the appropriate
Governmental Authority, notification  with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement pursuant to  the  HSR Act, supply all
information required by such Governmental Authority in  connection with the
HSR Act notification and cooperate with each other in  responding to any such
request. Each of the parties shall cooperate with each  other in promptly
filing any other necessary applications, reports or other  documents with any
Governmental Authority having jurisdiction with respect  to  this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby, and in seeking  necessary
consultation with and prompt favorable action by such Governmental 
Authority.

 

 

(ii) Notwithstanding  anything herein to the contrary, each of Acquiror and
MergerCo agrees to use  its  commercially reasonable efforts and to take any
and all steps necessary to  avoid  or eliminate each and every impediment
under any antitrust, competition or  trade  regulation Law that may be
asserted by any United States or non-United States  governmental antitrust
authority or any other party so as to enable the parties  hereto to
expeditiously  consummate the transactions contemplated hereby no later than
the Termination  Date. In addition, Acquiror shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to  defend through litigation on the merits any claim
asserted in court by any  party  in order to avoid entry of, or to have
vacated or terminated, any decree, order  or judgment (whether temporary,
preliminary or permanent) that would prevent  the  Closing from occurring by
the Termination Date. In the event any claim, action,  suit, investigation,
or other proceeding by any Governmental Authority or other  Person is
commenced which questions the validity or legality of the transactions 
contemplated hereby or seeks damages in connection therewith, the parties
agree  to cooperate and use commercially reasonable efforts to defend against
such  claim, action, suit, investigation, or other proceeding and, if an
injunction  or  other order is issued in any such action, suit or other
proceeding, to use  commercially reasonable efforts to have such injunction
or other order lifted,  and to cooperate reasonably regarding any other
impediment to the consummation  of the transactions contemplated hereby.  

 

(b) The  Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all
consents,  waivers and approvals under any Material Contract or lease with
respect to  any  Leased Real Property listed or required to be listed under
_Schedule  4.3(a)(iv) of the Disclosure Schedules_.

 

 

Section  6.10 _Public  Announcements_.  Prior  to the Closing Date, no
party hereto shall, without the prior approval of  the  other parties hereto
(which shall not be unreasonably withheld), issue any  press  release or
make any other public announcement concerning the transactions  contemplated
by this Agreement, except as and to the extent that any such  disclosing
party shall be so obligated by Law or the requirements of any  applicable
stock exchange, in which case the other parties hereto shall be  advised, and
the disclosing party shall use its

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

35  

 

 

 

 

 

 

reasonable  efforts to give the other parties advance opportunity to review
and comment  on  such release or announcement.

 

 

Section  6.11 _Directors\'  and Officers\' Indemnification._

 

 

(a) Acquiror  shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to,  indemnify, defend and hold harmless each person who is now,
or has been at  any  time prior to the date hereof or who becomes prior to
the Closing Date, an  officer or director of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (the " _D andO  Indemnified Parties_")  against any and all
losses, damages, liabilities, deficiencies, claims,  interests, awards,
judgments, penalties, costs and expenses (including  reasonable attorneys\'
fees, costs and other out-of-pocket expenses incurred  in  investigating,
preparing or defending the foregoing) arising out of or relating  to any
threatened or actual Action based in whole or in part on or arising  out  of
or relating in whole or in part to the fact that such person is or was a 
director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, whether 
pertaining to any matter existing or occurring at or prior to the Closing
Date  and whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after, the Closing Date
(the  " _D andO  Indemnified Liabilities_"),  including all DandO Indemnified
Liabilities based in whole or in part on, or  arising in whole or in part out
of, or relating to this Agreement or the  transactions contemplated hereby,
in each case to the full extent a corporation  is permitted under applicable
Law to indemnify its own directors or officers  (and Acquiror shall, or shall
cause the Surviving Corporation and its  Subsidiaries to, pay expenses in
advance of the final disposition of any such  Action to each DandO
Indemnified  Party). Without limiting the foregoing, in the event any such
Action is brought  against any DandO Indemnified Party (whether arising before
or after the  Closing Date), (i) the DandO Indemnified Party may retain
counsel  satisfactory to it and reasonably satisfactory to Acquiror, and
Acquiror shall,  or shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to, pay all fees  and expenses of such counsel for the DandO
Indemnified Party promptly as  statements therefor are received and (ii)
Acquiror, the Surviving  Corporation, its Subsidiaries and each DandO
Indemnified Party will use all  reasonable efforts to assist in the vigorous
defense of any such matter;  _provided_ ,  that  none of the Surviving
Corporation, any of its Subsidiaries or Acquiror shall  be  liable for any
settlement effected without its prior written consent. Any  DandO Indemnified
Party wishing to claim indemnification under this  _Section  6.11_  
shall  notify Acquiror upon learning of any such Action or investigation (but
the  failure so to notify shall not relieve a party from any liability which
it  may  have under this _Section  6.11,_   except  to the extent such
failure prejudices such party). The parties hereto agree  that  all rights
to indemnification hereunder, including provisions relating to  advances of
expenses incurred in defense of any such Action existing in favor  of  the
DandO Indemnified Parties with respect to matters occurring through the 
Closing Date, shall continue in full force and effect for a period of not
less  than 6 years from the Closing Date; _provided_ ,  _however_ , __
that  all  rights to indemnification in respect of any DandO Indemnified
Liabilities  asserted or made within such period shall continue until the
disposition of  such  DandO Indemnified Liabilities. 

 

(b) For  a  period of 6 years from the Closing Date, Acquiror shall cause
the Surviving  Corporation and its Subsidiaries to maintain, if available,
officers\' and  directors\' liability insurance and fiduciary insurance
covering the persons  who  are presently covered by their existing
officers\' and directors\' or fiduciary  liability insurance policies on
terms no less advantageous to such indemnified  parties than such existing
insurance; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that  Acquiror shall not be required
to pay more than 200% of the premium paid  by the  Company for

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

36  

 

 

 

 

 


 

such  existing officers\' and directors\' or fiduciary liability insurance
policies  during the year immediately preceding the date hereof, which
premium is set  forth on _Schedule  6.11(b) of the Disclosure Schedules_.

 

 

(c) From  and  after the Closing, Acquiror agrees that it will cause the
Surviving Corporation  to continue to indemnify and hold harmless each
present and former director  and  officer of the Company against any costs
or expenses (including reasonable  attorneys\' fees), judgments, fines,
losses, claims, damages or liabilities  incurred in connection with any
Action or investigation, whether civil,  criminal, administrative or
investigative, arising out of or pertaining to  matters existing or occurring
on or prior to the Closing, whether asserted  or  claimed prior to, on or
after the Closing, to the fullest extent that the  Company would have been
permitted under the DGCL and its certificate of  incorporation, bylaws or
other organizational documents in effect on the date  hereof to indemnify
such person (including the advancing of expenses as incurred  to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable Law); _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that 
the person to whom such expenses are advanced must provide an undertaking to 
the  Company (as appropriate) to repay such advances if it is ultimately
determined  by a court of competent jurisdiction (which determination shall
have become  final) that such person is not entitled to indemnification.

 

 

Section  6.12 _Financing_.

 

 

 

  (a) Acquiror  shall use commercially reasonable efforts to arrange and
consummate on or  before  the Outside Funding Date the Bank Financing and,
unless a high yield bond  offering in an amount at least equal to the amount
of the Bridge Financing  contemplated by the Commitment Letter (the "Bond
Financing") is consummated  on  or prior to the Outside Funding Date
(including by funding into escrow),  the  Bridge Financing, in each case
consistent with the provisions set forth in  this  _Section  6.12_   and
on  the terms and conditions described in the Commitment Letter, including
using  commercially reasonable efforts to (i) negotiate definitive agreements
with  respect to the Financing on the terms and conditions contained in the
Commitment  Letter on a timely basis, (ii) satisfy on a timely basis all
conditions  applicable to Acquiror in such definitive agreements that are
within the  control  of Acquiror and (iii) cooperate with the Company in
ensuring that the Offering  Document (as defined in the Commitment Letter) is
made available to the  Investment Bank (as defined in the Commitment Letter)
at least 21 days prior  to  the Outside Funding Date (or the earlier date
specified in Section 6.12(d),  as  applicable) and the Investment Bank is
afforded a marketing period of at  least  21 consecutive days prior to the
Outside Funding Date, all as contemplated  by  paragraph 9 of Exhibit D to
the Commitment Letter. Acquiror shall use its  commercially reasonable
efforts to comply with its obligations, and enforce  its  rights, under the
Commitment Letter. In the event that any portion of the  Financing becomes
unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated in  the  Commitment
Letter, Acquiror shall use its commercially reasonable efforts  to  obtain
any such portion from alternative sources as promptly as  practicable.

 

 

(b)   Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in the event that by
the  last  day of the Marketing Period (or by May 9, 2007, if the (1) CP
Satisfaction  Date  occurs after April 15, 2007 and on or before May 9, 2007
and (2) the 2006  Year-End Required Financial Statements are made available
to Aquiror on or  before March 31, 2007 (the conditions in (1) and (2) being,
collectively,  the  " _Pre-Funding  Condition_ "))  all  or any portion
of any Bond Financing has not been consummated, then Acquiror  shall cause
the proceeds of the Bridge Financing to be

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

37  

 

 

 

 

 


 

funded  no  later than (i) on the last day of the Marketing Period (or on
May 9, 2007,  if  the Pre-Funding Condition is satisfied) or (ii) 25 days
following the CP  Satisfaction Date, whichever is later (the period from the
CP Satisfaction  Date  to a date selected by the Acquiror that is no later
than 25 days thereafter  being the " _Bank  Syndication Period_ ")  . The 
later of (1) the last day of the Marketing Period (or if the Pre-Funding 
Condition is satisfied, May 9, 2007) and (2) the last day of the Bank 
Syndication Period is referred to herein as the " _Outside  Funding Date_
,"  provided that if the Commitment Letter expires or terminates prior to
such  date,  the Outside Funding Date shall be the last day on which the
Commitment Letter  remains in effect. The period from the CP Satisfaction
Date to the Outside  Funding Date is referred to herein as the " _Financing 
Period_."  " _Marketing  Period_ "  means  the first period of 25
consecutive days, ending not later than the Termination  Date, commencing on
the later to occur of (i) the satisfaction or waiver of  all  the conditions
set forth in Article VII (other than those conditions that,  by  their
terms, may only be satisfied at the Closing) (the date on which such 
conditions are first satisfied or waived being the _"CP  Satisfaction Date_
")  and  (ii) the receipt by Acquiror of the Required Financial Information
for such  Marketing Period; _provided_   that the  "Marketing Period" shall
not be deemed to have commenced or occurred if (A)  prior to the completion
of any such consecutive 25 day period, the Company\'s  independent
accountants shall have withdrawn their audit opinion with respect  to  any
financial statements contained in the Required Financial Information or 
(B)  such Required Financial Information shall not have remained sufficient
under  Rule 3-05 of Regulation S-X of the  rules  and regulations
promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (except  that this
clause (B) shall not apply after May 9, 2007 if the Pre-Funding  Condition is
satisfied). 

 

(c) The  Company shall assist and cooperate with Acquiror, __ and  shall 
use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause its Representatives to
assist  and cooperate with Acquiror, in connection with Acquiror\'s efforts
to obtain  the  proceeds of the Financing. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing,  the  Company shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to direct (to the extent  it reasonably can) its Representatives to
use their commercially reasonable  efforts to, at the request of Acquiror,
(i) provide, in accordance with the  terms of _Section  6.2_ ,  reasonably
required information relating to the Company to the financial  institution or
institutions providing the Financing, (ii) participate  in a reasonable
number of meetings, presentations, road shows, due diligence  sessions and
sessions with rating agencies, (iii) assist with the  preparation of
materials for rating agency presentations, offering documents,  private
placement memoranda and similar documents required in connection  with  the
Financing, (iv) obtain accountants\' consents, comfort letters, legal 
opinions, surveys and title insurance as reasonably requested by Acquiror 
and  (v)  execute and deliver customary certificates or other documents and
instruments  relating to guarantees, the pledge of collateral and other
matters ancillary  to  the Financing as may be reasonably requested by
Acquiror __ in  connection with the Financing; _provided_ ,  _however_ , 
that no  obligation of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under any such
certificate,  document or instrument shall be effective until the Closing and
none of the  Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to pay any
commitment  or  other fee or incur any other liability or expense in
connection with the  Financing.

 

 

(d) Notwithstanding  anything herein to the contrary, (i) if the CP
Satisfaction Date shall not  have  occurred on March 31, 2007 and the 2006
Year-End Required Financial Information  is delivered to Acquiror on or
before March 31, 2007, or (ii) if the CP  Satisfaction Date shall not have
occurred on May 31, 2007 and the March 2007  Required Financial Information
is delivered to Acquiror on or before May  31,  2007, in each case Acquiror
shall, in

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

38  

 

 

 

 

 

 

accordance  with the requirements of _Section  6.12(a)_ ,  deliver  to the
Investment Bank an Offering Document, no later than April 9, 2007 or  June 
1, 2007, as applicable.

 

 

Section  6.13 _Financial  Statements_.

 

 

(a) The  Company shall furnish Acquiror and its Financing sources not later
than December  31, 2006 with financial statements and financial data of the

Securities Act to consummate the offerings of debt  securities contemplated
by the Financing, with respect to the 3 years ended  December 31, 2005 and
the 9-month periods ended September 30, 2006 and 2005  (the  " _September

furnish Acquiror and its Financing sources with the  September 2006 Required
Financial Information as promptly as reasonably  practicable after December
1, 2006.

 

 

 

(b) The  Company shall furnish Acquiror and its Financing sources not later
than March  31, 2007 with financial statements and financial data of the type
required  by  Regulation S-X and Regulation S-K under the Securities Act,
and of the  type and form customarily included in private placements under

securities contemplated  by the Financing, with respect to the three years
ended December 31, 2006  (the  " _2006  Year-End Required Financial
Information_ ").  Notwithstanding the previous sentence, the Company shall
use its commercially  reasonable efforts to furnish Acquiror and its
Financing sources with the  2006  Year-End Required Financial Information as
promptly as reasonably practicable  after March 1, 2007.

 

 

(c) The  Company shall furnish Acquiror and its Financing sources not later
than May  31,  2007 with financial statements and financial data of the type
required by  Regulation S-X and Regulation S-K under the Securities Act, and
of the  type and form customarily included in private placements under Rule

March 31, 2007  and  2006 (the " _March  2007 Required Financial
Information_ ").  Notwithstanding the previous sentence, the Company shall
use its commercially  reasonable efforts to furnish Acquiror and its
Financing sources with the  March  2007 Required Financial Information as
promptly as reasonably practicable  after  May 10, 2007.

 

 

(d) For  purposes of this Agreement, " _Required  Financial Information_ " 
shall  mean: (i) with respect to any Marketing Period ending on or prior to
February  6,  2007, the September 2006 Required Financial Information, (ii)
with respect  to  any Marketing Period ending after February 6, 2007, but on
or before May  9,  2007, the 2006 Year-End Required Financial Information,
and (iii) with respect  to any Marketing Period ending after May 9, 2007, the
March 2007 Required  Financial Information, it being understood that for
purposes of this sentence,  the end of the Marketing Period shall be 25 days
after the CP Satisfaction  Date,  provided that if the Required Financial
Information for such Marketing Period,  as so determined, shall not have been
delivered on or before 25 days prior  to  the date on which a different
clause of this sentence (i.e. clause (ii) rather  than clause (i), or clause
(iii), rather than clause (ii), as applicable)  would  determine the
Required Financial

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

39  

 

 

 

 

 


 

Information,  the Required Financial Information shall be determined on the
basis of that  different clause, except that if that different clause is
clause (ii) of this  sentence and the 2006 Year-End Required Financial
Information is not delivered  at least 25 days prior to May 9, 2007, the
Required Financial Information shall  in any event be the March 2007 Required
Financial Information. Notwithstanding  the foregoing, if the Pre-Funding
Condition is satisfied, the Required Financial  Information shall be the 2006
Year-End Required Financial  Information.

 

 

Section  6.14 _Parachute  Payments_.  With  respect to each employee of
the Company who is, or would reasonably be expected  to be as of the Closing
Date, a "disqualified individual" (as defined in  Section 280G(c) of the
Code), the Company shall (i) obtain all  necessary waivers from any such
employee of the portion of any payments or  economic benefit that would
otherwise constitute a "parachute payment" (as  defined in Section 280G(b)(2)
of the Code), which portion would be exempt  from the definition of
"parachute payment" by reason of the exemption provided  under Section
280G(b)(5)(A)(ii) of the Code if the shareholder approval  required by such
Section were obtained, and (ii) use its commercially  reasonable efforts to

Company shall deliver to Acquiror duly executed certificates  representing

Section  6.17 _Transaction  Expense Tax Benefit Payments_

 

 

(a) Acquiror  shall pay to each Stockholder, holder of Warrants and holder of
Company Stock  Options an amount equal to (i) (A) the Current Transaction
Expense Tax Benefit  _divided_   by (B)  the Fully Diluted Shares, _times_
  (ii) the  aggregate number of shares of Common Stock, Warrants, Company
Stock Options  and  shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion on the
Closing Date of the  Preferred Stock outstanding on the Closing Date, in each
case, held by such  Person immediately prior to the Effective Time (the
applicable " _Stockholder  Benefit_ ")  within  10 days of the filing of
the federal income tax return of the Company for  the  taxable period of the
Company beginning on January 1, 2007 and ending on  the  Closing Date

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

40  

 

 

 

 

 

 

(the  " _Short  2007 Tax Year_ ").  The  Current Transaction Expense Tax
Benefit shall be considered paid and fully  satisfied by Acquiror when
Acquiror delivers by wire transfer of immediately  available funds (i) to the
Stockholder Representative, the aggregate Stockholder  Benefit payable to all
Wire Transfer Recipients (ii) to the Paying Agent, the  aggregate Stockholder
Benefit payable to all Stockholders and holders of  Warrants who are not Wire
Transfer Recipients and (iii) to the Company, the  aggregate Stockholder
Benefit payable to all holders of Company stock Options.  The Stockholder
Representative shall deliver, from the amount paid to it by  Acquiror, to
each Wire Transfer Recipient, such Wire Transfer Recipient\'s  applicable
Stockholder Benefit. The Paying Agent shall deliver, from the amount  paid to
it by Acquiror, to each Stockholder and holder of Warrants who is not  a 
Wire Transfer Recipient, such Person\'s applicable Stockholder Benefit. The 
Company shall deliver, from the amount paid to it by Acquiror, to each
holder  of  Company Stock Options, such Person\'s applicable Stockholder
Benefit net of  any  amount the Company is required to deduct and withhold
with respect to the making  of such payment under the Code, or any provision
of applicable Tax Law. The  " _Current  Transaction Expense Tax Benefit 
Amount_ _"_   shall equal the actual reduction, if any, in Taxes of the
Company for the Short  2007 Tax Year as a result of the current deduction for
such Tax year of the  (i)  the amount of any Employee Merger Payments, (ii)
any compensation attributable  to payment to the holders of Company Stock
Options and (iii) any unamortized  deferred financing fees on the books of
the Company as of the Closing Date  (collectively, the "Deductible 
Transaction Expenses"),  computing the reduction for the Short 2007 Tax Year
by comparing the Tax  liability of the Company without the deduction for the
Deductible Transaction  Expenses against the Tax liability of the Company
with the deduction for the  Deductible Transaction Expenses for Short 2007
Tax Year, in both cases after  taking into account all other expenses,
losses, net operating loss carryovers  and other Tax attributes of the
Company.  

 

(b) Acquiror  shall pay to each Stockholder, holder of Warrants and holder of
Company Stock  Options an amount equal to (i) (A) the Future Transaction
Expense Tax Benefit  divided  by (B)  the Fully Diluted Shares times  (ii)
the  aggregate number of shares of Common Stock, Warrants, Company Stock
Options  and  shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion on the Closing
Date of the  Preferred Stock outstanding on the Closing Date, in each case,
held by such  Person immediately prior to the Effective Time (the applicable
"Future  Stockholder Benefit")  within  10 days of receipt of such Future
Transaction Expense Tax Benefit. The Future  Transaction Expense Tax Benefit
shall be considered paid and fully satisfied  by  Acquiror when Acquiror
delivers by wire transfer of immediately available  funds  (i) to the
Stockholder Representative, the aggregate Future Stockholder Benefit  payable
to all Wire Transfer Recipients (ii) to the Paying Agent, the aggregate 
Future Stockholder Benefit payable to all Stockholders and holders of
Warrants  who are not Wire Transfer Recipients and (iii) to the Company, the
aggregate  Future Stockholder Benefit payable to all holders of Company stock
Options.  The  Stockholder Representative shall deliver, from the amount
paid to it by  Acquiror, to each Wire Transfer Recipient, such Wire Transfer
Recipient\'s  applicable Future Stockholder Benefit. The Paying Agent shall
deliver, from  the  amount paid to it by Acquiror, to each Stockholder and
holder of Warrants  who is  not a Wire Transfer Recipient, such Person\'s
applicable Future Stockholder  Benefit. The Company shall deliver, from the
amount paid to it by Acquiror,  to  each holder of Company Stock Options,
such Person\'s applicable Future  Stockholder Benefit net of any amount the
Company is required to deduct and  withhold with respect to the making of
such payment under the Code, or any  provision of applicable Tax Law. The
"Future  Transaction Expense Tax Benefit"  shall  equal the actual
reduction, if any, in Taxes 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

41  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  the  Company, Acquiror, or any Affiliate of Acquiror for any taxable
period of the  Company that begins after the Closing Date, or of Acquiror, or
any Affiliate  of  Acquiror, that includes or begins after the Closing Date
as a result of the  deduction of the Deductible Transaction Expenses
(including, for purposes of  this clause (b), any unamortized deferred
financing fees on the books of the  Company as of the Closing Date that were
not currently deductible in the Short  2007 Tax Year and that are amortized
in a later period) or the carryforward  of  net operating losses
attributable to such Deductible Transaction Expenses that  were not taken
into account in the Short 2007 Tax Year, computing the reduction  by
comparing the Tax liability of the Company, Acquiror, or any Affiliate of 
Acquiror, as the case may be, without the deduction for such Deductible 
Transaction Expenses against the Tax liability of the Company, Acquiror, or 
any  Affiliate of Acquiror, as the case may be, with the deduction for such 
Deductible Transaction Expenses for such taxable period, in all cases after 
taking into account all other expenses, losses, net operating loss
carryovers  and other Tax attributes of the Company, Acquiror, or any
Affiliate of  Acquiror, as the case may be, other than the Deductible
Transaction Expenses,  and shall be deemed received as of any date for the
payment of estimated Taxes  or as of the date of any refund of Taxes with
respect to which there has been  such an actual reduction in Taxes.

 

 

(c) With  respect to any Current Transaction Expense Tax Benefit or Future
Transaction  Expense Tax Benefit, at the time any such benefit is paid to the
Stockholders  in  accordance with _Section  6.17(a)_   and  _(b)_  
above  (or at such time as the Company determines that no such benefit is
payable),  the  Company shall provide the Stockholder Representative with
(i) a statement  setting forth sufficiently detailed information so as to
allow the Stockholder  Representative to determine whether the amount and
timing of such benefit is  correct (or, if the Company has determined that no
such benefit is currently  payable, sufficiently detailed information
supporting that determination) and  (ii) such additional information as is
reasonably requested by the Stockholder  Representative in making its
determination.

 

 

Section  6.18 _Preferred  Stock Redemption_.  Promptly  after the date of
this agreement, but in any event not later than December  31,  2006, the
Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to redeem all  outstanding
shares, if any, of its 13-1/2%  Redeemable Preferred Stock,  par  value
$0.01 per share, pursuant to Article 5 of the Certificate of Designations  of
such stock.

this Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not be enforced  in or  by
such courts.

 

 

Section  9.11 Disclosure  Generally.  Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in the _Disclosure  Schedules_   or in  this Agreement,
the information and disclosures contained in any _Disclosure  Schedule_  
shall be  deemed to be disclosed and incorporated by reference in any other
_Disclosure  Schedule_   as  though fully set forth in such _Disclosure 
Schedule_   for  which applicability of such information and disclosure is
reasonably apparent  on  its face. The fact that any item of information is
disclosed in any _Disclosure  Schedule_   shall  not be construed to mean
that such information is required to be disclosed  by  this Agreement. Such
information and the dollar thresholds set forth herein  shall not be used as
a basis for interpreting the terms "material" or "Material  Adverse Effect"
or other similar terms in this Agreement.

 

 

Section  9.12 _Personal  Liability_.  This  Agreement shall not create or
be deemed to create or permit any personal  liability or obligation on the
part of any direct or indirect stockholder of  the  Company or Acquiror or
any other Representative or investor of any party  hereto.

 

 

Section  9.13 _Assignment;  Successors_.  Neither  this Agreement nor any
of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall  be assigned by any
of the parties hereto without the prior written consent  of  the other
parties except that MergerCo may, without the obligation to obtain  the 
prior written consent of any other party, assign this Agreement or all or
any  part of its rights or obligations hereunder to 1 or more direct or
indirect  wholly-owned Subsidiaries of Acquiror (in all or any of which cases
Acquiror  shall remain responsible for the performance of all of its
obligations under  this Agreement). Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement
shall be binding  upon  and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and
their respective successors  or permitted assigns, heirs, legatees,
distributees, executors, administrators  and guardians.

 

 

Section  9.14 _Enforcement_.  The  parties agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event that any of  the  provisions of this Agreement were
not performed in accordance with their  specific terms or were otherwise
breached. Accordingly, each of the parties  shall be entitled to specific
performance of the terms hereof, including an  injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce  specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement in any New York State  or  federal court
sitting in the Borough of Manhattan in the City of New York (or,  if such
court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, in any appropriate New York  State
or federal court), this being in addition to any other remedy to which  they
are entitled at law or in equity. Each of the parties further hereby waives 
(a) any defense in any Action for specific performance that a remedy at law 
would be adequate and (b) any requirement under any law to post security as 
a prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief.

 

 

Section  9.15 _Severability_.  Whenever possible, each provision or portion
of any provision of this Agreement  shall be interpreted in such manner as to
be effective and valid under  applicable Law, but if any provision or portion
of any provision of this  Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any respect under  any applicable Law or rule in any

jurisdiction,  such invalidity, illegality or  unenforceability shall not
affect any other provision or portion of any  provision in such jurisdiction,
and this Agreement shall be reformed, construed  and enforced in such
jurisdiction as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable  provision or
portion of any provision had never been contained herein. 

 

 

Section  9.16 _Waiver  of Jury Trial_.  EACH OF  THE PARTIES TO THIS
AGREEMENT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO A TRIAL  BY  JURY IN ANY
ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO  THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

 

 

Section  9.17 _Counterparts_.  This  Agreement may be executed in two or
more counterparts, all of which shall be  considered one and the same
instrument and shall become effective when one  or  more counterparts have
been signed by each of the parties and delivered to  the  other parties.

 

 

Section  9.18 _Facsimile  Signature_.  This  Agreement may be executed by
facsimile signature and a facsimile signature  shall  constitute an original
for all purposes.

 

 

Section  9.19 _Time  of Essence_.  Time is  of the essence with regard to
all dates and time periods set forth or referred  to in this Agreement.

 

 

Section  9.20 _No  Consequential Damages_.  The  parties hereto expressly
acknowledge and agree that no party hereto shall have  any liability under
any provision of this Agreement for any punitive,  incidental, consequential,
special or indirect damages, including business  interruption, loss of future
revenue, profits or income, or loss of business  reputation or opportunity
relating to the breach or alleged breach of this  Agreement.

 

 

Section  9.21 _Disclaimer  of Implied Warranties_.

 

 

(a) Notwithstanding  any other provision of this Agreement, Acquiror and
MergerCo acknowledge and  agree that neither the Company nor any other Person
has made any representation  or warranty, express or implied, as to the
accuracy or completeness of any  information regarding the Company or its
Subsidiaries, except as expressly  set  forth in this Agreement, and neither
Acquiror nor MergerCo is relying on any  information concerning the Company
except as so expressly set forth in this  Agreement.

 

 

(b) In  connection with Acquiror\'s investigation of the Company, Acquiror
has received  certain estimates, projections and other forecasts regarding
the Company and  its  Subsidiaries. Acquiror acknowledges that there are
uncertainties inherent in  attempting to make such estimates, projections and
other forecasts, that  Acquiror is familiar with such uncertainties and that
Acquiror is taking full  responsibility for making its own evaluation of the
adequacy and accuracy of  all  estimates, projections and other forecasts so
furnished to it (including the  reasonableness of the assumptions underlying
such estimates, projections and  forecasts). Accordingly, the Company makes
no representation or warranty with  respect to such estimates, projections
and other forecasts (including the  reasonableness of the assumptions
underlying such estimates, projections and  forecasts).
