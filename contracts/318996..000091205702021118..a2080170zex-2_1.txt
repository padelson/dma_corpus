exchange for an amount equal to the Warrant Payout. Upon such  surrender, QSI
shall issue a non-interest bearing promissory note  (in a form reasonably
acceptable to Key) to each holder of a Cash  Out Warrant, which note shall be
in a principal amount equal to the  Warrant Payout, less any applicable
withholding obligations  (collectively, the "Warrant Notes"). Upon issuance

Redemption Notes to the holders of the shares  of QSI Preferred Stock, the
QSI Preferred Stock shall be redeemed,  cancelled, and cease to exist. The
aggregate principal amount of the  Redemption Notes shall equal the stated
value of the outstanding shares of  QSI Preferred Stock, plus accrued
dividends payable in accordance with  their respective certificates of
designation. On the Effective Date, QSI  shall pay the Redemption Notes in
cash to each holder of such Redemption  Notes. As soon as practicable after
the date of this Agreement, QSI shall  take all corporate action necessary to
redeem the QSI Preferred Stock on  the Effective Date as provided herein,
including, but not limited to, the  notice of redemption as required by the
QSI Articles of Incorporation.   2.9.4 CONVERSION OF QSI COMMON STOCK. On
the Effective Date and  without any action on the part of the holders
thereof, each of the issued  and outstanding shares of QSI Common Stock shall
automatically become and  be converted into the right to receive from Key the
Merger Consideration.   2.9.4.1 MERGER CONSIDERATION. The merger
consideration to be  received for each share of QSI Common Stock (the
"Merger  Consideration") will be that number of Key Shares equal to the 
result determined by (i) dividing the sum of the Purchase Price  plus the
Option/Warrant Strike Proceeds by the Key Share Price and  (ii) dividing the
result obtained in clause (i) by the Fully  Diluted QSI Shares Outstanding.
The aggregate Merger Consideration  to be received by each holder of QSI
Common Stock is equal to the  result obtained by (x) multiplying the Merger
Consideration by (y)  the number of shares of QSI Common Stock owned by such
holder of  QSI Common Stock. As of the Effective Date, this Agreement shall
be  amended to include as SCHEDULE 2.9.4.1 hereto the calculation of  the
Purchase Price. In the event of any split, combination or  reclassification
of Key Common Stock or the authorization of any  issuance of any other
securities in exchange or in substitution for  shares of Key Common Stock at
any time during the period from the  date of this Agreement to the Effective
Date, Key and QSI shall  make such adjustment to the Merger Consideration as
Key and QSI    12    shall mutually agree so as to preserve the economic
benefits that  the parties each reasonably expected on the date of this
Agreement  to receive as a result of the consummation of the Merger and the 
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   2.9.4.2 ESTIMATED
BALANCE SHEET. No later than one business  day before the Effective Date, QSI
shall have prepared and  delivered to Key a consolidated balance sheet of QSI
and the QSI  Subsidiaries estimated as of the Effective Date (the
"Estimated  Balance Sheet"), which balance sheet will be prepared, except
as  provided below, in accordance with generally accepted accounting 
principles, consistent with past practices, and which shall be in  the form
attached hereto as SCHEDULE 2.9.4.2. In connection with  its preparation of
the Estimated Balance Sheet, QSI shall consult  with and accept input from
Key in an effort to facilitate the  adjustment process and procedures in
Section 2.10 hereof. "Total  Liabilities" as reflected on the Estimated
Balance Sheet (and on  the Final Balance Sheet) shall (i) include, whether or
not in  accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, all of 
QSI\'s transaction costs associated with the Merger, including  without
limitation, finder\'s fees, whether identified on SCHEDULE  3.1.26 or
otherwise, accounting fees and attorneys\' fees (including  fees payable
pursuant to Section 5.3.11 hereof) and all expenses  related to the
foregoing, but (ii) exclude "Deferred Income Tax  Liability, net."   2.9.5
HOLDBACK. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section  2.9 to the
contrary, (i) 5% of the aggregate Merger Consideration issuable  to all of
the holders of QSI Common Stock on the Effective Date (the  "Escrowed
Shares"), and (ii) 5% of the aggregate amount of cash payable to  the holders
of the Option Notes and Warrant Notes (the "Escrowed Cash"),  shall be held
in escrow by Key pending calculation of the Final Merger  Consideration set
forth in Section 2.10 of this Agreement.   2.9.6 CONVERSION OF MERGER SUB
COMMON STOCK. On the Effective Date,  as a result of Merger, each issued and
outstanding share of Merger Sub  Common Stock shall be converted into one
share of common stock, par value  $.001 per share, of the Surviving
Corporation.   2.9.7 NO FRACTIONAL SHARES. If the number of Key Shares
issuable to  a holder of QSI Common Stock pursuant to this Section 2.9
results in a  fractional share, then the number of Key Shares issuable as the
Merger  Consideration to such holder of QSI Common Stock shall be rounded up
to  the next whole share.   2.10 PURCHASE PRICE ADJUSTMENT PAYMENT. Within
60 days after the Effective Date, Key shall cause to be prepared and
delivered to the QSI Representatives a consolidated balance sheet of the
Surviving Corporation as of the Effective Date (the "Final Balance Sheet"),
which balance sheet will be prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles (subject to the adjustments in Section 2.9.4.2)
consistent with past practices and consistent with the form attached hereto
as SCHEDULE 2.9.4.2. Key and the QSI Representatives shall jointly review the
Final Balance Sheet, and endeavor in good faith to resolve all
disagreements    13   regarding the entries thereon and reach a final
determination thereof within 15 days from the expiration of the 60-day
period. If the parties cannot agree on the entries to be placed on the Final
Balance Sheet, the dispute will be resolved by PriceWaterhouseCoopers, LLP,
or if such firm is unable or unwilling to serve in such capacity, by an
independent accounting firm mutually agreed to by the QSI Representatives and
Key, whose resolution shall be binding on and enforceable against the parties
hereto. Within 10 days of reaching the determination of the Final Balance
Sheet, Key shall re-calculate the Merger Consideration pursuant to this
Section 2.10. The final Merger Consideration to be received for each share of
QSI Common Stock (the "Final Merger Consideration") will be that number of
Key Shares equal to the result determined by (i) dividing the sum of the
Final Purchase Price plus the Option/Warrant Strike Proceeds by the Key Share
Price and (ii) dividing the result obtained in clause (i) by the Fully
Diluted QSI Shares Outstanding. Key shall also calculate the Final Effective
Price Per Share, the Final Option Spread, the Final Option Payout, the Final
Warrant Spread and the Final Warrant Payout. The aggregate Final Merger
Consideration to be received by each holder of the QSI Common Stock is equal
to the result obtained by (x) multiplying the Final Merger Consideration by
(y) the number of shares of QSI Common Stock owned by each holder of QSI
Common Stock giving effect to differences between the Final Option Payout and
the Option Payout and differences between the Final Warrant Payout and the
Warrant Payout. Upon calculation of the Final Merger Consideration,
the aggregate Final Merger Consideration for each holder of QSI Common Stock
will be compared to the holder\'s aggregate Merger Consideration. Any and all
adjustments necessary to reconcile any difference in amounts between the
aggregate Final Merger Consideration for a holder and such holder\'s
aggregate Merger Consideration shall be made in accordance with Sections
2.10.1 and 2.10.2 hereof. The Final Option Payout and the Final Warrant
Payout for each Note Holder will be compared to the Option Payout or Warrant
Payout received by such Note Holder. Any and all adjustments necessary to
reconcile any difference in amount shall be made in accordance with Sections
2.10.1 and 2.10.2 hereof.   2.10.1KEY ADJUSTMENT PAYMENT. If the aggregate
Final Merger  Consideration equals the aggregate Merger Consideration, (i)
the holders  of QSI Common Stock shall be entitled to receive from Key the
Escrowed  Shares in accordance with their pro rata ownership of QSI Common
Stock as  set forth on SCHEDULE 3.1.4 hereto, and (ii) the Note Holders shall
be  entitled to receive from Key the Escrowed Cash in accordance with each 
Note Holder\'s respective Option Note or Warrant Note, as the case may be. 
In addition to the foregoing, if the Final Merger Consideration is greater 
than the Merger Consideration, (i) each holder of QSI Common Stock shall  be
entitled to receive the difference between the holder\'s aggregate Final 
Merger Consideration and such holder\'s aggregate Merger Consideration 
already received and each Note Holder shall be entitled to receive the 
difference between the holder\'s Final Option Payout or Final Warrant  Payout
and such holder\'s Option Payout or Warrant Payout already received  (the
"Key Adjustment Payments"). The Key Adjustment Payments will include  first,
the Escrow Consideration and, second, at Key\'s Option, cash or a  number of
Key Shares equal to the additional amount necessary for Key to  satisfy the
Key Adjustment Payments divided by the Key Share Price.   2.10.2 QSI
ADJUSTMENT PAYMENT. If the aggregate Final Merger  Consideration is less than
the aggregate Merger Consideration and the  amount of such deficiency (the
amount of such deficiency being referred to  as the "QSI Adjustment Payment")
is less than the value of the Escrowed    14    Consideration, then Key
shall (i) deduct from the Escrowed Cash for each  Note Holder the difference
between the holder\'s Final Option Payout or  Final Warrant Payout and such
holder\'s Option Payout or Warrant Payout  already received; and (ii) deduct
from the Escrowed Shares the number of  Key Shares equal to the QSI
Adjustment Payment (less the amount of  Escrowed Cash deducted pursuant to
clause (i)) divided by the Key Share  Price. The holders of QSI Common Stock
and the Note Holders shall be  entitled to receive the balance, if any, of
the Escrow Consideration in  either cash or Key Shares based on the
difference between their aggregate  Final Merger Consideration and their
aggregate Merger Consideration. If  the amount of the QSI Adjustment Payment
is greater than the value of the  Escrowed Consideration, (the amount of such
deficiency being referred to  as the "QSI Deficiency"), then Key shall be
entitled to retain the Escrow  Consideration, and (ii) each holder of QSI
Common Stock shall pay to Key  the difference between their aggregate Final
Merger Consideration and  their aggregate Merger Consideration already
received (after giving credit  for the final Escrow Consideration applicable
to each holder of QSI Common  Stock) and each Note Holder shall pay to Key
the difference between the  holder\'s Final Option Payout or Final Warrant
Payout and such holder\'s  Option Payout or Warrant Payout already received
(after giving credit for  the final Escrow Consideration applicable to each
Note Holder). At the  option of the holders of the QSI Common Stock or the
Note Holders, such  holders may satisfy the QSI Deficiency by tendering Key
Shares equal to  the QSI Deficiency divided by the Key Share Price or
otherwise paying  cash.   2.11 SURRENDER OF QSI CERTIFICATES. Before the
Effective Date, Key will designate the Paying Agent and from time to time
will make or cause to be made available to the Paying Agent Key Shares in the
amounts and at the times necessary for the payment of the Merger
Consideration on surrender of Certificates. QSI shall use all reasonable
efforts to cause each holder of QSI Common Stock to surrender all the
Certificates to Key on the Effective Date. On the first business day
following the Effective Date, Key will cancel all the Certificates delivered
to it as of the Effective Date, and the holders of the QSI Common Stock
delivering such Certificates together with a completed and executed Letter of
Transmittal, in substantially the form attached hereto as EXHIBIT D, will
receive the Merger Consideration to which they are entitled, subject to
Section 2.9.5 hereof. Until any Certificate has been surrendered and replaced
pursuant to this Section 2.11, that Certificate will, for all purposes, be
deemed to evidence ownership of the Merger Consideration such holder of
QSI Common Stock is entitled to receive, subject to Section 2.9.5 hereof.  
2.11.1 CERTIFICATES NOT DELIVERED ON THE EFFECTIVE DATE. With  respect to the
Certificates not delivered on the Effective Date, as soon  as reasonably
practicable after the Effective Date, but in any event  within five days
following the Effective Date, the Paying Agent will mail  to each holder of
record of a Certificate set forth in SCHEDULE 3.1.4  hereto:   2.11.1.1
LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL. A letter of transmittal, which  will specify that
delivery will be effected, and risk of loss and  title to Certificates will
pass, only on delivery of Certificates to  the Paying Agent and will be in a
form and have such other  provisions as Key may specify; and     
15    2.11.1.2 INSTRUCTIONS FOR SURRENDER. Instructions for use in 
effecting the surrender of Certificates in exchange for the Merger 
Consideration.   2.11.2 LOST, STOLEN OR DESTROYED CERTIFICATES. If any
Certificates  shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of
an affidavit  of that fact by the person claiming such Certificates to be
lost, stolen  or destroyed, and delivery of such indemnity as Key may
reasonably  request, a Paying Agent will deliver in exchange for such lost,
stolen or  destroyed Certificates one or more certificates representing Key
Common  Stock deliverable in respect thereof, as determined in accordance
with the  terms hereof.   2.12 QSI TRANSFER BOOKS CLOSED. Upon the
Effective Date, the stock transfer books of QSI shall be closed, and no
transfer of any shares of capital stock of QSI shall thereafter be made or
consummated.   2.13 ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF MERGING CORPORATIONS BECOME
THOSE OF SURVIVING CORPORATION. The Merger shall have the effects set forth
in the TBCA, including Section 5 of the TBCA.   2.14 DISSENTING
SHAREHOLDERS. Key agrees that if the Merger becomes effective, it promptly
will pay to dissenting shareholders of QSI the amounts, if any, to which they
are entitled under the provisions of Sections 5.11 and 5.12 of the TBCA.  
2.15 FEDERAL INCOME TAX TREATMENT. The Merger is intended to qualify as
a tax-free reorganization described in ss.368(a) of the Code. The partieS
intend that this Agreement constitutes a "plan of reorganization" among QSI,
Key and Merger Sub within the meaning of Treas. Reg. ss. 1.368-2(g). NeitheR
Key nor QSI will take any action or permit any of their respective affiliates
to take any action that would result in the Merger failing to qualify as a
tax-free reorganization under ss. 368(a) of the Code.   2.16 CLOSING. The
Closing of the Merger shall be at the offices of Porter and Hedges, L.L.P., 700
Louisiana Street, Houston, Texas, 77002, on such date as mutually agreed by

knowledge of the events surrounding QSI\'s  alleged conduct in the Shaw
Litigation. QSI also will provide Porter  and Hedges, L.L.P. all internal
written materials in QSI\'s or its  counsel\'s possession that reasonably
relates to the allegations  concerning QSI made in the Shaw Litigation,
including any  information QSI has assembled pursuant to any internal
investigation  QSI has conducted with respect thereto. Porter and Hedges,
L.L.P. will  be instructed to submit a preliminary report to Key no later
than 14  calendar days after the date hereof. Key will have the opportunity 
to ask questions of Porter and Hedges, L.L.P. and the officers and  personnel
of QSI and any relevant QSI Subsidiary concerning Porter and  Hedges, L.L.P.\'s
initial findings. Porter and Hedges, L.L.P. will then  conduct any additional
investigation necessary to complete its  investigation and will deliver a
final report to Key on the day  before the Effective Date. The preliminary
report mentioned above  and the final report will be oral summaries of the
information that  Porter and Hedges, L.L.P. obtains or derives in the course of
its  investigation and will not include any specific information  concerning
QSI\'s pricing models or other information that would  reasonably be
considered confidential with respect to QSI\'s  competitors. Key will
maintain any information it receives through  Porter and Hedges, L.L.P.\'s
reports in strict confidence.   5.3.12 RELATED PARTY OBLIGATIONS. Before the
Effective Date, QSI  will collect in full all related party receivables and
advances to  employees, including those shown on SCHEDULE 3.1.27 hereto.  
5.4 ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS OF KEY.   5.4.1 REGISTRATION STATEMENT. Key will
take such steps as are  required to obtain the effectiveness under the
Securities Act of the  post-effective amendment to the Registration Statement
containing the  Prospectus and to deliver to QSI a sufficient number of
copies of the  Prospectus, so that QSI can deliver a copy of the Prospectus
to each of  the Selling QSI Shareholders in accordance with Section 5.3.10
hereof;  provided, however, that before filing such post-effective amendment,
Key  shall furnish to and afford each of the Selling QSI Shareholders a 
reasonable opportunity to review copies of such post-effective amendment  and
provided, further, that Key shall not file such post-effective  amendment if
Selling QSI Shareholders that in the aggregate hold in excess    37   
of 25% of the outstanding shares of QSI Common Stock before the Effective 
Date or, after the Effective Date, 25% of the Key Shares that may be sold 
under the Prospectus shall reasonably object.   5.4.2 LISTING OF KEY STOCK.
Key will take such steps as are required  to list on the New York Stock
Exchange the Key Shares to be issued  pursuant to this Agreement.   5.4.3
DELIVERY OF REPORTS. Key will promptly furnish to QSI copies  of all
communications from Key to its stockholders and all reports filed  by Key
with the SEC and the New York Stock Exchange.   5.4.4 RESALE OF KEY
SHARES.   5.4.4.1 REGISTRATION STATEMENT AND PROSPECTUS. Key will use  its
reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness of the  Registration
Statement and make the Prospectus available for use by  the Selling QSI
Shareholders for resale of their Key Shares received  in the Merger until the
restrictions imposed by Rule 145 under the  Securities Act no longer apply to
such Selling QSI Shareholders,  except for such periods that Key may require
the Selling QSI  Shareholders to refrain from effecting any public sales or 
distributions of the Key Shares under the Prospectus due to the  existence of
material, non-public information the disclosure of  which would be required
in the Prospectus in order to prevent such  Prospectus from containing any
untrue statement of material fact or  omitting to state any material fact
necessary to make the statements  therein not misleading. In connection with
its efforts to maintain  the effectiveness of the Registration Statement, Key
agrees to (i)  file with the SEC in a timely manner all reports and other
documents  required of Key under the Exchange Act; (ii) promptly use its 
reasonable efforts to prevent the issuance of any stop order or to  obtain
its withdrawal if such stop order should be issued; and (iii)  promptly
prepare and file with the SEC any amendments or supplements  to the
Registration Statement or Prospectus that may be required  under the
Securities Act or the rules and regulations thereunder so  that the
Registration Statement, at the time the post-effective  amendment thereto
containing the Prospectus becomes effective shall  not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state  a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make  the statements therein not misleading,
or so the Prospectus, on any  date that it is delivered in connection with
the sale of the Key  Shares, will not contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or  omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make
the  statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they 
were made, not misleading; provided, however, that before filing any  such
amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement or the  Prospectus, Key
shall furnish to and afford the Selling QSI  Shareholders a reasonable
opportunity to review copies thereof; and  provided, further, that Key shall
not file any such amendment or  supplement to the Registration Statement or
the Prospectus if any  Selling QSI Shareholder shall reasonably object. Key
agrees to take  such steps as are required under the Securities Act to cause
the  Prospectus, as of the Effective Date, to be available for use by the 
Selling QSI Shareholders for resale of their Key Shares received in   
38    the Merger and to continue to be available for a period of 22 
consecutive Trading Days immediately after the Effective Date. Key  agrees to
file such Prospectus on the Effective Date with the New  York Stock Exchange
under Rule 153 of the Securities Act and to  provide each Selling QSI
Shareholder at the sole expense of Key as  many copies of the Prospectus and
each amendment or supplement  thereto and any documents incorporated by
reference therein as such  Selling QSI Shareholder may reasonably request.
Key hereby consents  to the use of such Prospectus and each amendment or
supplement  thereto by each Selling QSI Shareholder and the agents, if any,
and  dealers (if any), in connection with the offering and sale of the  Key
Shares covered by such Prospectus and any amendment or  supplement
thereto.   5.4.4.2 INDEMNIFICATION AND CONTRIBUTION. Key will indemnify 
and hold harmless (i) each Selling QSI Shareholder; (ii) any person  that may
be deemed an "underwriter" for a Selling QSI Shareholder;  (iii) each person,
if any, who controls (within the meaning of  either Section 15 of the
Securities Act or Section 20 of the  Exchange Act) any Selling QSI
Shareholder or any such "underwriter"  (any of the persons referred to in
this clause (iii) being  hereinafter referred to as a "controlling person");
and (iv) the  respective officers, directors, partners, employees,
representatives  and agents of the Selling QSI Shareholders or any
controlling person  (any person referred to in clause (i), (ii), (iii) or
(iv) may  hereinafter be referred to as an "Indemnified QSI Shareholder"), 
from and against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities  and
judgments (including, without limitation, reasonable legal fees  and other
expenses reasonably incurred in connection with any suit,  action or
proceeding or any claim asserted) caused by any untrue  statement or alleged
untrue statement of a material fact contained  in the Registration Statement
or Prospectus, or any amendment or  supplement thereto, or caused by any
omission or alleged omission to  state therein a material fact required to be
stated therein or  necessary to make the statements therein not misleading,
except  insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities are caused
by  any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or 
omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with information  relating
to such Selling QSI Shareholder furnished to Key in writing  by such Selling
QSI Shareholder expressly for use in therein. Key  shall notify Indemnified
QSI Shareholders promptly of the  institution, threat or assertion of any
claim, proceeding (including  any governmental investigation) or litigation
in connection with the  matters addressed by this Agreement that involves Key
or such  Indemnified QSI Shareholder.   5.4.4.3 INDEMNIFICATION BY SELLING
QSI SHAREHOLDERS. Each  Selling QSI Shareholder agrees, severally and not
jointly, to  indemnify and hold harmless Key, its directors, officers and
each  person who controls Key within the meaning of either Section 15 of 
the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same  extent as
the foregoing indemnity from Key to each Selling QSI  Shareholder, but only
with reference to such losses, claims, damages  or liabilities which are
caused by any untrue statement or omission  or alleged untrue statement or
omission made in reliance upon and in  conformity with information relating
to such Selling QSI Shareholder    39    furnished to Key in writing by
such Selling QSI Shareholder  expressly for use in any Registration Statement
or Prospectus, or  any amendment or supplement thereto or any related
preliminary  prospectus.   5.4.4.4 INDEMNIFICATION PROCEDURES. If any suit,
action,  proceeding (including any governmental or regulatory
investigation),  claim or demand shall be brought or asserted against any
person in  respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to either
Section  5.4.4.2 or Section 5.4.4.3 hereof, such person (the "Indemnified 
Person") shall promptly notify the person or persons against whom  such
indemnity may be sought (each an "Indemnifying Person") in  writing, and such
Indemnifying Person, upon request of the  Indemnified Person, shall retain
counsel reasonably satisfactory to  the Indemnified Person to represent the
Indemnified Person and any  others entitled to indemnification pursuant to
this Section 5.4.4.4  that the Indemnifying Person may designate in such
proceeding and  shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel
related  to such proceeding. In any such proceeding, any Indemnified Person 
shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and  expenses of
such counsel shall be at the expense of such Indemnified  Person unless (i)
such Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified  Person shall have mutually
agreed to the contrary; (ii) such  Indemnifying Person has failed within a
reasonable time to retain  counsel reasonably satisfactory to such
Indemnified Person; or (iii)  the named parties in any such proceeding
(including any impleaded  parties) include an Indemnifying Person and an
Indemnified Person  and representation of both parties by the same counsel
would be  inappropriate due to a conflict of interests between them. It is 
understood that an Indemnifying Person shall not, in connection with  any
proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be  liable for
the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in  addition to any
local counsel) for all Indemnified Persons, and that  all such fees and
expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred.  Any such separate firm
for the Indemnified QSI Shareholders shall be  designated in writing by the
Indemnified QSI Shareholders holding a  majority of the Key Shares subject to
the Registration Statement and  the Prospectus, and any such separate firm
for Key, its directors,  respective officers and such control persons of Key
shall be  designated in writing by Key. The Indemnifying Person shall not
be  liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its 
written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a  final
judgment for the plaintiff, such Indemnifying Person agrees to  indemnify any
Indemnified Person from and against any loss or  liability by reason of such
settlement or judgment. No Indemnifying  Person shall, without the prior
written consent of the Indemnified  Person, effect any settlement of any
pending or threatened  proceeding in respect of which any Indemnified Person
is or could  have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder
by  such Indemnified Person, unless such settlement includes an 
unconditional release of such Indemnified Person from all liability  on
claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding.   5.4.4.5
CONTRIBUTION. If the indemnification provided for in  Section 5.4.4.2 hereof
and Section 5.4.4.3 hereof is unavailable to     40    an Indemnified
Person or insufficient in respect of any losses,  claims, damages or
liabilities referred to therein, then each  Indemnifying Person under such
paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying  such Indemnified Person thereunder, shall
contribute to the amount  paid or payable by such Indemnified Person as a
result of such  losses, claims, damages or liabilities in such proportion as
is  appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the Indemnifying Person  on
the one hand and the Indemnified Person on the other in  connection with the
statements or omissions that resulted in such  losses, claims, damages or
liabilities, as well as any other  relevant equitable considerations. The
relative fault of the parties  shall be determined by reference to, among
other things, whether the  untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material
fact or the  omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates
to  information supplied by Key or such Indemnified QSI Shareholder and  the
parties\' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and  opportunity
to correct or prevent such statement or omission.   Each of Key and each of
the Indemnified QSI Shareholders agree  that it would not be just and
equitable if contribution pursuant to  this Section 5.4.4.5 were determined
by pro rata allocation or by  any other method of allocation that does not
take account of the  equitable considerations referred to in the immediately
preceding  paragraph. The amount paid or payable by an Indemnified Person as
a  result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in  the
immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include,  subject to the
limitations set forth above, any legal or other  expenses incurred by such
Indemnified Person in connection with  investigating or defending any such
action or claim. Notwithstanding  the provisions of this Section 5.4.4.5, in
no event shall any  Indemnified QSI Shareholder be required to contribute any
amount in  excess of the amount by which the net proceeds received by such 
Indemnified QSI Shareholder from the sale of the Key Shares pursuant  to the
Registration Statement or Prospectus exceeds the amount of  damages that such
Indemnified QSI Shareholder would have otherwise  been required to pay by
reason of such untrue or alleged untrue  statement or omission or alleged
omission. No person guilty of  fraudulent misrepresentation (within the
meaning of Section 11(f) of  the Securities Act) shall be entitled to
contribution from any  person who was not guilty of such fraudulent
misrepresentation.   The remedies provided for in Sections 5.4.4.2 through
5.4.4.5  shall not limit any rights or remedies that may otherwise be 
available to any indemnified party under federal or state securities  laws,
which shall remain operative and in full force and effect  regardless of any
investigation made by or on behalf of any  Indemnified QSI Shareholder or by
or on behalf of Key, its officers  or directors or any other person
controlling Key.   5.4.4.6 THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARIES. The Indemnified QSI 
Shareholders are intended to be third party beneficiaries of the  provisions
of this Section 5.4.4, which may be enforced by such  Indemnified QSI
Shareholders. This Section 5.4.4 may not be amended  without the consent of
Selling QSI Shareholders holding a majority  of (i) the outstanding shares of
QSI common stock held by Selling    41     QSI Shareholders (before the
Effective Date) or (ii) the Key Shares  held by the Selling QSI Shareholders
(after the Effective Date).   5.4.5 ASSISTANCE IN BLOCK SALE TRANSACTIONS.
Key understands that  one or more Selling QSI Shareholders is contemplating a
"block sale" of  all or a portion of the Key Shares received by such Selling
QSI  Shareholder in the Merger. Key agrees to take commercially reasonable 
actions requested by the broker/dealer engaged by a Selling QSI  Shareholder
for this purpose, consistent with customary practice for  transactions of
this type.   5.4.6 ISSUANCES OF KEY COMMON STOCK. Key will not issue any
shares  of Key Common Stock during the 60 calendar day period beginning on
the  Effective Date except for (i) the issuance of Key Shares pursuant to
this  Agreement; (ii) the issuance of any options granted to employees or 
directors of Key; (iii) the issuance of any equity securities of Key in 
connection with the acquisition of the equity interest, businesses or  assets
of any unaffiliated entity; (iv) the issuance of equity securities  of Key in
exchange for outstanding securities of Key; and (v) the issuance  of equity
securities of Key upon the exercise of outstanding options,  warrants or
other securities convertible into or exchangeable for equity  securities of
Key.   5.5 SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION. The parties acknowledge and agree that
QSI shall have the continuing right until the Effective Date to provide Key
promptly with such additional supplemental information (collectively, the
"Supplemental Information"), in the form of (i) amendments to then existing
Schedules or (ii) additional Schedules, as would be necessary to make each of
those representations and warranties true and correct as of the Effective
Date; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that Key shall be entitled to use such
Supplemental Information so provided (i) in the calculation of the Liability
Threshold pursuant to clause (iii) of Section 6.2.1 and Section 7.1.9 hereof
to the extent such Supplemental Information pertains to representations or
warranties set forth in Sections 3.1.8.17, 3.1.8.18, 3.1.17 (including all
subparagraphs thereto) and 3.1.20 hereof, and (ii) to determine with respect
to all other representations and warranties if a material adverse effect has
occurred pursuant to clause (iii) of Section 6.2.1 hereof. QSI and Key
acknowledge that new contracts, permits and other matters which are permitted
by the terms of this Agreement and are entered into in the ordinary course of
business following the execution hereof shall not be included in calculating
the Liability Threshold.    ARTICLE 6   CONDITIONS PRECEDENT TO

SCHEDULE 3.1.8.11 hereto.    ARTICLE 7   TERMINATION AND ABANDONMENT  
7.1 TERMINATION. Anything contained in this Agreement to the
contrary notwithstanding, this Agreement may be terminated and the Merger
contemplated hereby abandoned at any time before the Effective Date:  
7.1.1 BY MUTUAL CONSENT. By mutual written consent of Key, Merger  Sub and
QSI.   7.1.2 BY KEY BECAUSE OF DISSENTING SHAREHOLDERS. By Key, if the 
holders of any shares of QSI Common Stock representing in excess of 0.5%  of
the issued and outstanding shares of QSI Common Stock elect to exercise  the
right to dissent under applicable provisions of Texas law in  connection with
the Merger contemplated by this Agreement.    47    7.1.3 BY QSI BECAUSE

BY KEY OR MERGER SUB, OR BY QSI BECAUSE OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.  By either Key
or Merger Sub, or by QSI, if any suit, action, or other  proceeding shall be
pending or threatened by the federal or a state  government before any court
or governmental agency, in which it is sought  to restrain, prohibit, or
otherwise affect the consummation of the  transactions contemplated
hereby.   7.1.8 BY KEY OR MERGER SUB, OR BY QSI, IF TRANSACTIONS NOT
EFFECTIVE  BY JULY 17, 2002. By either Key or Merger Sub, or by QSI, if the 
transactions contemplated hereby shall not have become effective on or 
before July 17, 2002; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that such date shall be extended 
but not beyond October 15, 2002, if Key is notified by the SEC that the 
post-effective amendment to the Registration Statement filed in connection 
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be reviewed or  if
there is any other delay in its effectiveness.   7.1.9 BY KEY OR MERGER SUB
BECAUSE OF MATERIAL DEVELOPMENTS. By Key  or Merger Sub if, one or more of
QSI\'s representations or warranties  contained in Sections 3.1.8.17,
3.1.8.18, 3.1.17 (including all  subparagraphs thereto), and 3.1.20 hereof
was not true as of the date  hereof or not true immediately before the
Effective Date, and all of such  untrue representations and warranties, in
the aggregate, would be  reasonably likely to result in costs, damages,
diminution in value,  expenses, losses or liabilities with respect to the
business, operations,  assets or liabilities of QSI and the QSI Subsidiaries
taken as a whole of  more than the Liability Threshold; PROVIDED THAT no
claims, costs,  damages, expenses, losses or liabilities shall be included in
the  calculation of the Liability Threshold to the extent such amounts are 
insured against without reservation of rights (but only to the extent 
collectable and less any deductibles or self insured retentions) or to the 
extent that the Estimated Balance Sheet (and Final Balance Sheet) includes  a
specific reserve with respect to such matter of this kind or nature. 
Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Section 7.1.9 or any other 
provision of this Agreement, for the purposes of calculating the Liability 
Threshold (i) the disclosures on SCHEDULE 3.1.17 and SCHEDULE 3.1.20
shall    48    not be taken into account in determining whether there
has been a breach  of the representations and warranties contained in
Sections 3.1.8.17,  3.1.8.18, 3.1.17 and 3.1.20 hereof, and (ii) plugging and
abandonment  costs with regard to the items set forth in such Schedules shall
be  included.   7.2 TERMINATION BY BOARD OF DIRECTORS. An election of Key,
Merger Sub or QSI terminate this Agreement and abandon the Merger as provided
in Section 7.1 hereof shall be exercised on behalf of Key, Merger Sub or QSI,
as the case may be, by its board of directors.   7.3 EFFECT OF TERMINATION.
In the event of the termination and abandonment of this Agreement pursuant to
and in accordance with the provisions of Section 7.1 hereof, this Agreement
shall become void and have no force or effect, without any liability on the
part of any party hereto (or the stockholders, general partner or controlling
persons or directors or officers of any party hereto). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, a termination of this Agreement shall not relieve any party hereto
from any liability for damages incurred as a result of a willful breach by
such party of its covenants and agreements hereunder occurring before such
termination. Each party hereto acknowledges and agrees that, in connection
with such termination, breaches of a representation or warranty hereunder by
the other party shall not give rise to liability for damages except in the
event of a breach of a representation or warranty resulting from a knowing
and intentional act involving actual fraud or an intent to mislead or
deceive. In addition, if there are one or more Potential Liabilities that
have been the subject of one or more Liability Notices (i) as to which Key
and QSI have been unable to determine are properly characterized as such or
as to which Key and QSI have been unable to agree as to the most reasonable,
cost-effective remedy in accordance with Section 8.3.1.2 hereof (each, a
"Disputed Potential Liability"); (ii) Key believes the Liability Threshold
has been exceeded; and (iii) QSI had previously withheld its permission for
Key to conduct testing with respect to the Disputed Potential Liabilities as
contemplated in Section 8.3.1.1 hereof, then Key\'s termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 6.2.1 or 7.1.9 hereof shall be
without liability to Key.   7.4 WAIVER OF CONDITIONS. Subject to the
requirements of any applicable law, any of the terms or conditions of this
Agreement may be waived at any time by the party that is entitled to the
benefit thereof, by action taken by its board of directors, the executive
committee of its board of directors or its chief executive officer or its
general partner. No waiver of a particular term or condition of this
Agreement shall constitute a waiver of any other term or condition.  
ARTICLE 8   ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS   8.1 EMPLOYMENT MATTERS. After the
Effective Date, Key, in its sole discretion, may take all actions necessary
or appropriate to (i) permit each individual who is an employee of QSI or any
QSI Subsidiary immediately before the Effective Date (a "QSI Employee") to
continue to participate from and after the Effective Date in an Employee
Plan, or (ii) terminate, freeze or merge any Employee Plan. Before the
Effective Date, upon written request from Key, QSI and each QSI Subsidiary
shall terminate, freeze or merge any identified Employee Plan maintained by
QSI or any QSI Subsidiary effective as of a date specified by Key before the
Effective Date; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that no Employee Plan shall be terminated
unless QSI agrees to such termination. If Key terminates or discontinues an
Employee Plan after the Effective Date or requests QSI or a QSI Subsidiary to
terminate an Employee Plan before the Effective Date, Key shall   
49   take all actions necessary or appropriate to permit the QSI
Employees participating in such Employee Plan to participate in the
comparable benefit plan, if any, maintained by Key or any of its affiliates
for similarly situated employees (the "Replacement Plans"); PROVIDED,
however, that if the Employee Plan that is so terminated or discontinued is a
group health plan, then Key shall cause each QSI Employee participating in
such group health plan and his or her eligible dependents (including, without
limitation, all such QSI Employee\'s dependents covered by such group health
plan as of the time such coverage ceases) to be covered under a Replacement
Plan that (i) provides medical and dental benefits to each such QSI Employee
and such eligible dependents effective immediately upon the cessation of
coverage of such individuals under such group health plan in accordance with
such plan\'s terms, and (ii) waives any preexisting condition restrictions to
the extent necessary to provide immediate coverage, if such waiver is
required under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. Key
and its affiliates shall recognize each QSI Employee\'s years of service and
level of seniority prior to the Effective Date with QSI and any QSI
Subsidiaries for purposes of eligibility and vesting under any Replacement
Plan that is a medical, dental or Code Section 401(k) Plan. In the event that
Key adopts a severance plan to address reduction in force implemented in
connection with the integration of the operations of Key and QSI, such
plan shall treat similarly situated employees of Key and QSI the same.
Further, if, on or after the Effective Date, Key terminates the employment of
any QSI Employee to whom QSI or any QSI Subsidiary is obligated to pay
severance benefits as identified on SCHEDULES 3.1.8.8, 3.1.8.11 or 3.1.19
hereto, and such obligation is not waived, Key, and not QSI, any QSI
Subsidiary or the QSI Shareholders, shall be responsible for the payment of
such severance benefits.   8.2 VOTING AND SUPPORT AGREEMENTS.
Contemporaneously with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, each of
the QSI Shareholders identified on SCHEDULE 8.2 hereto shall execute and
deliver the Voting and Support Agreements.   8.3 LIABILITY THRESHOLD.  
8.3.1.1 ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT. Key shall have the right, at its  sole
cost, risk and expense, to conduct or have conducted an Environmental 
Assessment of the properties and operations of QSI and each QSI  Subsidiary.
QSI agrees to provide Key (or its agents or contractors) with  reasonable
access as necessary to conduct the Environmental Assessment and  the
investigation. QSI shall have the right to require Key (or its agents  or
contractors) to conform to QSI\'s (or the operator\'s, if not QSI\'s)  safety
and industrial hygiene procedures in the conduct of the  Environmental
Assessment. During the Environmental Assessment, Key shall  not be permitted
to (i) conduct any soil, water or groundwater sampling or  subsurface testing
of any kind; or (ii) contact any governmental authority  regarding the
properties and operations of QSI or any QSI Subsidiary, in  either case
without first obtaining written permission from QSI, which  permission shall
be granted or denied within three days of receipt by QSI  of the written
request therefor, with respect to the specific sampling,  testing or contact
proposed by Key; provided, however, that Key may make  such contacts as may
be necessary to arrange to review and copy publicly  available agency records
relating to environmental conditions and  permitted operations at properties
owned, leased or operated by QSI or any  QSI Subsidiary.    50   
8.3.1.2 IDENTIFICATION AND CALCULATION8.3.1.3 . Key shall deliver to  QSI a
written notice as soon as practicable after receiving a report  identifying
any Potential Liability. Such notice (the "Liability Notice")  shall:   (i)
identify the property on which the Potential Liability  exists;   (ii) set
forth Key\'s estimate of the most cost-effective  remedy to cure the
Potential Liability; and   (iii) set forth Key\'s estimate of any liability
for damages to  third parties that could arise out of the Potential
Liability.   Key and QSI will negotiate in good faith to determine (a)
whether  each Potential Liability identified on the Liability Notice is 
properly characterized as such, (b) the cost of implementing the  remedy
determined in accordance with clause (ii) above, and (c) the  net present
value of any damages that could arise out of third party  claims identified
on the Liability Notice. The estimate of the most  cost-effective remedy
determined in accordance with clause (ii)  above shall include investigation
costs typically associated with  the proposed remedy, but shall not include
investigation costs  incurred by Key in the investigation pursuant to which
Key assembled  the information on the Liability Notice. In estimating the
amount of  the potential third party damages pursuant to clause (iii)
above,  Key and QSI shall consider both the magnitude of the Potential 
Liability and the likelihood of liability actually arising out of  the
Potential Liability. A Potential Liability identified on a  Liability Notice
shall not be included in the Liability Threshold to  the extent Key and QSI
agree in writing that it should not so be  included or to the extent it has
been corrected or remedied by QSI  to Key\'s satisfaction before the
Effective Date.   8.4 FURTHER ASSURANCES. From time to time, as and when
requested by any party hereto, any other party hereto shall execute and
deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, such documents and
instruments and shall take, or cause to be taken, such further or other
actions as may be reasonably necessary to effect the transactions
contemplated hereby.   8.5 INDEMNIFICATION; OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS
INSURANCE. Except to the extent Surviving Corporation is merged into Key or
its affiliates, the Surviving Corporation\'s articles of incorporation and
bylaws shall not be amended in a manner that adversely affects the rights of
any Indemnified Executive thereunder unless otherwise required by applicable
law. The Surviving Corporation shall maintain, for not less than three years
after the Effective Date, director\'s and officer\'s liability insurance
covering each Indemnified Executive on terms not materially less favorable
than the insurance maintained in effect by QSI on the date hereof in terms of
coverage (including without limitation types of claims, time period of
claims, exclusions and persons covered), amounts and deductibles; provided
that the costs of such insurance shall not exceed $100,000 or the covered
Indemnified Executive shall be responsible for payments in amounts in excess
of such $100,000, shall reduce the coverage limits to levels that will not
exceed the $100,000 premium, or may elect to terminate coverage. Each   
51   Indemnified Executive is intended to be a third party beneficiary of
this Section 8.5 and may specifically enforce its terms. This Section 8.5
shall not limit or otherwise adversely affect any rights any Indemnified
Executive may have under any agreement with QSI or under QSI\'s articles of
incorporation or bylaws.   8.6 PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENTS. Except as may be
required by applicable law, no party hereto shall make any public
announcements or otherwise communicate with any news media or any other
party, with respect to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated
hereby without prior consultation with the other parties as to the timing and
contents of any such announcement or communications as may be reasonable
under the circumstances; provided, however, that nothing contained herein
shall prevent any party from (i) promptly making all filings with
governmental authorities as may, in its judgment, be required or advisable in
connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement or
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or (ii) disclosing
the terms of this Agreement to such party\'s legal counsel, financial
advisors or accountants in furtherance of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.   ARTICLE 9   MISCELLANEOUS   9.1 SURVIVAL OF
REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND COVENANTS.   9.1.1 REPRESENTATIONS,
WARRANTIES AND COVENANTS OF KEY AND MERGER  SUB. The representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements made by Key  or Merger Sub shall not

terms requires performance after the Effective  Date.   9.1.2
REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND COVENANTS OF QSI. The  representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements made by QSI shall  not survive the

performance after the Effective Date.   9.2 ENTIRETY; AMENDMENTS. This
Agreement and each agreement executed contemporaneously herewith embodies the
entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof,
and all prior agreements between the parties with respect thereto are hereby
superseded in their entirety. This Agreement may not be amended except by an
instrument in writing signed by the parties hereto.   9.3 COUNTERPARTS. Any
number of counterparts of this Agreement may be executed and each such
