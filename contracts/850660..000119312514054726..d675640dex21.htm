shall have delivered to the Company, on or prior to the Closing Date a
completed letter of transmittal substantially in the form of Exhibit D hereto
("Letter of Transmittal"), an amount equal to the product of the number of
Outstanding Shares held by such Stockholder and the Closing Date Per Share
Merger Consideration, which amount shall be payable by wire transfer of
immediately available funds on the Closing Date to the account designated in
such Stockholders Letter of Transmittal.

 

(d) At the Closing, Parent shall pay to the Company, for the benefit of and
for payment to each Optionholder in accordance with this Article 2, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to one or more accounts designated by
the Company to Parent at least two Business Days prior to the Closing Date,
the aggregate amount of all In-the-Money Option Cancellation Payments.
Promptly (but in no event later than five Business Days) following the

 



17  Closing, Parent shall, with respect to each holder of an In-the-Money Option
who shall have delivered to the Company on or prior to the Closing Date a
completed Option Surrender Form relating to such Optionholders In-the-Money
Option, cause the Surviving Corporation to pay to each Optionholder, in
consideration of the cancellation of each In-the-Money Option held by such
Optionholder immediately prior to the Effective Time, the applicable In-the-
Money Option Cancellation Payment, less any required withholding Taxes and
without interest thereon. For the avoidance of doubt, the sum of (i) all In-
the-Money Option Cancellation Payments paid to holders of In-the-
Money Options and (ii) the Final Merger Consideration paid in the Merger to
holders of Company Common Stock shall not be greater than the Final Merger
Consideration.

 

(e) At the Closing, Parent shall pay, or cause the Company to pay, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds, the Estimated Unpaid Company
Transaction Expenses (other than the Non-Waived 280G Benefits Amount, if any)
to the applicable recipients thereof as set forth on the Pre-Closing
Statement.

 

(f) At the Closing, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds an amount equal to the Adjustment
Escrow Amount and the Additional Escrow Amount, in each case to be held in the
Adjustment Escrow Account and Additional Escrow Account, as applicable, in
accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement.

 

(g) At the Closing, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated in writing
by the Securityholders Representative at least two Business Days prior to the
Closing, the Securityholders Representative Expense Amount with the
Securityholders Representative. The Securityholders Representative Expense
Amount will be used to pay costs, fees and expenses incurred by or for the
benefit of the Securityholders on or after the Closing Date and shall be paid
or distributed at the direction of the Securityholders Representative as
provided in the Letter of Transmittal and/or Option Surrender Form.

(h) Any remaining cash unclaimed by holders of Outstanding Shares as of a
date which is immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise
escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority shall, to the
extent permitted by Applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving
Corporation free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously
entitled thereto.

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Surviving
Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the applicable
portion of the Final Merger Consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement, such amount as the Surviving Corporation is required to deduct and
withhold with respect to such payment under the Code or any other Applicable
Law, and if any such amounts are deducted and withheld, Parent shall, or shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, as the case may be, timely pay such
amounts to the appropriate Governmental Authority. To the extent that amounts
are so withheld and paid over, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of
which deduction and withholding was made. 

 



18 Section 2.06. _Post-Closing Merger Consideration Adjustment and Payments_.

 

(a) As promptly as practicable, but in no event later than sixty days
following the Closing, Parent shall in good faith prepare and deliver to the
Securityholders Representative a written statement (the "Closing Statement"),
based upon the books and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries, which
shall set forth Parents calculation of (i) Working Capital, which shall be
based exclusively on the facts and circumstances as they exist as of the close
of business on the day immediately preceding the Closing Date and shall
exclude the effects of any event, act, change in circumstance or
similar development arising or occurring thereafter (it being understood and
agreed that Working Capital shall be used to measure changes in Working
Capital and not as a form of indemnification and in furtherance of the
foregoing, to the extent Parent asserts there is a current liability under
this Section 2.06 that was not reflected in the calculation of the Target
Working Capital, the Target Working Capital shall be recalculated in
accordance with the definitions of Working Capital and Target Working Capital
and the methodology set forth on Exhibit B to reflect such current liability
to the extent such current liability is included in the calculation of Final
Working Capital), (ii) the adjustments to the Target Working Capital pursuant
to clause (i) above and the resultant adjustments to Estimated Working Capital
(which shall be recalculated to reflect such adjustments), (iii) Closing Date
Funded Indebtedness, (iv) Unpaid Company Transaction Expenses, (v) Closing
Date Cash and Cash Equivalents and (vi) the Final Merger Consideration based
upon such items. No actions taken by Parent on its own behalf or on behalf of
the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries, at or following the Closing
shall be given effect for purposes of determining the Closing Working Capital.

(b) If Parents calculation of the Adjustment Amount is positive, (i) Parent
shall immediately pay to the Securityholders Representative, for further
distribution to the Securityholders (to be paid to the Securityholders as if
such amount were being distributed pursuant to Section 2.06(e)(i)), such
positive Adjustment Amount (it being understood and agreed that such payment
shall not limit the rights of the Securityholders Representative pursuant to
this Section 2.06) and (ii) Parent and the Securityholders Representative
shall immediately deliver a joint instruction to the Escrow Agent instructing
the Escrow Agent to release the entire Adjustment Escrow Amount to the
Securityholders Representative, for further distribution to the
Securityholders (to be paid to the Securityholders as if such amount were
being distributed pursuant to Section 2.06(e)(i)). If Parents calculation of
the Adjustment Amount is negative but less than the Adjustment Escrow
Amount, Parent and the Securityholders Representative shall immediately
deliver a joint instruction to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent
to release to the Securityholder Representative, for further distribution to
the Securityholders (to be paid to the Securityholders as if such amount were
being distributed pursuant to Section 2.06(e)(i)), an amount equal to the
excess of the Adjustment Escrow Amount over Parents calculation of the
Adjustment Amount (it being understood and agreed that such payment shall not
limit the rights of the Securityholders Representative pursuant to this
Section 2.06).

 

(c) After receipt of the Closing Statement, the Securityholders
Representative and its Representatives shall have reasonable access to all
relevant books and records (including accountant work papers), accountants and
employees of the Surviving Corporation solely for the purpose of reviewing the
Closing Statement in accordance with this Agreement and to the extent
reasonably necessary to complete its review of the Closing Statement in a
manner not to interfere unreasonably with the conduct of Parents or the
Surviving Corporations business. If, within 60

 



19  days following the delivery of the Closing Statement, the Securityholders
Representative has not given Parent notice of its objection to any item in the
Closing Statement reasonably detailing the basis of such objection (an
"Objection Notice"), then the Closing Statement shall be deemed final and
binding on Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Securityholders
Representative (on behalf of all Securityholders). If the Securityholders
Representative delivers an Objection Notice, then Parent and the
Securityholders Representative shall consult in good faith to resolve the
disputed items set forth in the Objection Notice and, if any disputed items
have not been resolved within thirty days following delivery of such notice,
from and after such time either the Securityholders Representative or Parent
may submit the remaining disputed items to the New York, New York office of
Grant Thornton LLP or, if such firm is unable to serve in such capacity, to
such other nationally recognized independent accounting firm that is mutually
agreeable to the Securityholders Representative and Parent
(the "Accountant") or, if no such agreement can be reached, the
Securityholders Representative and Parent each shall, within 10 days thereof,
select a candidate for the Accountant and the two candidates so selected shall
promptly select a third nationally recognized independent accounting firm
which shall be appointed as the Accountant. The scope of the disputes to be
resolved by the Accountant shall be limited to fixing mathematical errors and
determining whether the items in dispute were determined in accordance with
the definitions of Working Capital and Target Working Capital and the
methodology set forth on Exhibit B without regard to materiality and the
Accountant is not to make any other determination and shall act as an
arbitrator and not as an expert. If any items in dispute are submitted to the
Accountant for resolution: (x) Parent and the Securityholders Representative
shall use their respective reasonable efforts to cause the Accountant
to resolve all remaining disagreements with respect to the Closing Statement
as soon as practicable but in any event shall direct the Accountant to render
a determination within 90 days after its retention; (y) Parent and the
Securityholders Representative shall furnish to the Accountant and each
other such work papers and other documents and information relating solely to
the disputed issues as the Accountant may request and are available to that
party (including, in the case of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or its
accountants), and shall be afforded the opportunity to present to the
Accountant any materials relating to the determination and to discuss the
determination with the Accountant, provided that copies of all such materials
are concurrently provided to the other party and that such discussions may
only occur in the presence (including by telephone) of the other party,
provided further that the Accountant shall consider only those items and
amounts which are identified as being in dispute; and (z) the determination
by the Accountant of the disputed items in the Closing Statement, as shall be
set forth in a notice delivered to both parties by the Accountant, shall be
binding and conclusive on the parties. In resolving any disputed item, the
Accountant may not assign a value to any item greater than the greatest value
for such item claimed by either party or less than the smallest value for such
item claimed by either party. The fees of the Accountant for such
determination shall be borne by Parent, on the one hand, and the
Securityholders, on the other hand, in proportion to the portion of the
aggregate amount in dispute that is finally resolved by the Accountant in a
manner adverse to such party. For example, if Parent claims the appropriate
adjustments are $1,000 less than the amount determined by the Securityholders
Representative, and the Securityholders Representative contests $500 of the
amount claimed by Parent, and if the Accountant ultimately resolves the
dispute by awarding Parent $300 of the $500 contested, then the costs and
expenses of the Accountant will be allocated 60% (i.e., 300/500) to the
Securityholders and 40% (i.e., 200/500) to Parent.

 



20 (d) The Closing Date Merger Consideration shall be adjusted as follows
(without duplication): (i)(A) increased by the amount, if any, by which the
Working Capital, as finally determined pursuant to Sections 2.06(a)-(d)
("Final Working Capital"), is greater than the Estimated Working Capital as
finally determined pursuant to Sections 2.06(a)-(d) or (B) reduced by the
amount, if any, by which the Final Working Capital is less than the Estimated
Working Capital as finally determined pursuant to Sections 2.06(a)-(d);
(ii)(A) reduced by the amount, if any, by which the Closing Date Funded
Indebtedness, as finally determined pursuant to Sections 2.06(a)-(d) ("Final
Funded Indebtedness") is greater than the Estimated Closing Date Funded
Indebtedness or (B) increased by the amount, if any, by which the Final
Funded Indebtedness is less than the Estimated Closing Date Funded
Indebtedness; (iii)(A) reduced by the amount, if any, by which the Unpaid
Company Transaction Expenses, as finally determined pursuant to Sections
2.06(a)-(d) ("Final Unpaid Company Transaction Expenses") are greater than the
Estimated Unpaid Company Transaction Expenses or (B) increased by the amount,
if any, by which the Final Unpaid Company Transaction Expenses are less than
the Estimated Unpaid Company Transaction Expenses; and/or (iv)(A) increased by
the amount, if any, by which the Closing Date Cash and Cash Equivalents, as
finally determined pursuant to Sections 2.06(a)-(d) ("Final Cash and Cash
Equivalents") are greater than the Estimated Cash and Cash Equivalents or (B)
reduced by the amount, if any, by which the Final Cash and Cash Equivalents
are less than the Estimated Cash and Cash Equivalents.

(e) No later than the second Business Day following the final determination of
the Adjustment Amount;

 

(i) if the Adjustment Amount is positive,

 

(A) Parent and the Securityholders Representative shall provide a joint
written instruction to the Escrow Agent to release the entire remaining
Adjustment Escrow Amount to the Stockholders and to the Surviving Corporation
(for distribution to the Optionholders) in accordance with their respective
Pro Rata Share and otherwise as provided in the Escrow Agreement; 

(B) with respect to each Stockholder who shall have delivered to the Company,
on or prior to such date, a completed Letter of Transmittal, Parent shall
pay, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay, an amount equal to the
product of the number of Outstanding Shares held by such Stockholder and the
Adjustment Amount Per Share, which amount shall be payable by wire transfer
of immediately available funds to the account designated in such Stockholders
Letter of Transmittal; and

 

(C) with respect to each holder of an In-the-Money Option who has delivered to
the Company, on or prior to such date, a completed Option Surrender Form,
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay to each such Optionholder
an amount equal to the product of the number shares of Company Common Stock
that were issuable if all of the In-the-Money Options held by such holder
were exercised in full and the Adjustment Amount Per Share, less any required
withholding Taxes and without interest thereon;

 



21 provided that any amounts previously paid by Parent pursuant to Section
2.06(b)(i) shall be credited against any amounts owed pursuant to this
Section 2.06(e)(i)(B) and Section 2.06(e)(i)(C) and Parent shall not have any
liability for any portion of the Adjustment Amount payable under 2.06(b)(i),
2.06(e)(i)(B) and 2.06(e)(i)(C) in excess of $10,000,000; or

(ii) if the Adjustment Amount is negative, then Parent and the
Securityholders Representative shall provide a joint written instruction to
the Escrow Agent to release the Adjustment Amount to be paid to the Surviving
Corporation solely and exclusively from the Adjustment Escrow Account (up to a
maximum amount equal to the then remaining Adjustment Escrow Amount and the
Securityholders shall not have any liability for any portion of the Adjustment
Amount in excess of the then remaining amount in the Adjustment Escrow
Account), and any portion of the Adjustment Escrow Amount remaining following
such payment to the Surviving Corporation shall be released to the
Stockholders and to the Surviving Corporation (for distribution to the
Optionholders) in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Share and
otherwise as provided in the Escrow Agreement; or

(iii) if the Adjustment Amount is zero, Parent and the
Securityholders Representative shall provide a joint written instruction to
the Escrow Agent to release the entire remaining Adjustment Escrow Amount to
the Stockholders and to the Surviving Corporation (for distribution to the
Optionholders) in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Share and
otherwise as provided in the Escrow Agreement.

(f) The Adjustment Amount shall be treated as an adjustment to the Closing
Date Merger Consideration for income tax purposes.

(g) From and after the Closing Date:

 

(i) with respect to each Stockholder who shall not have delivered to the
Company, on or prior to the Closing Date, a Letter of Transmittal, Parent
shall, promptly (but in no event later than five Business Days) following such
Stockholders delivery to the Company of a completed Letter of Transmittal,
pay, or cause the Surviving Corporation to pay, all amounts that would
previously have been payable with respect to such Outstanding Shares pursuant
to this Article 2 had such Letter of Transmittal been delivered on or prior to
the Closing Date; and

 

(ii) with respect to each holder of an In-the-Money Option who shall not have
delivered to the Company, on or prior to the Closing Date, an Option
Surrender Form, Parent shall, promptly (but in no event later than five
Business Days) following such holders delivery to the Surviving Corporation
of a completed Option Surrender Form, cause the Surviving Corporation to pay,
to such holder, all amounts that would previously have been payable with
respect to such In-the-Money Option pursuant to this Article 2 had such Option
Surrender

 



22  Form been delivered on or prior to the Closing Date, provided, however, that
if any holder of an In-the-Money Option has not delivered an Option Surrender
Form to the Surviving Corporation prior to the time set forth in Section
2.05(i), then the cash otherwise payable to the holder of such In-the-Money
Options shall become the property of Parent, free and clear of all claims and
interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 

Section 2.07. _Notices to Securityholders; Dissenting Shares_.

 

(a) The Company shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date
hereof, mail or deliver to (i) each Stockholder a letter from the Company (A)
providing such Stockholder with a brief information statement regarding the
Company and the transactions contemplated hereby, and (B) with respect to each
Stockholder, (I) providing the notification required by Section 228(e) of
Delaware Law with respect to the Written Consent and (II) providing notice in
the manner contemplated in Section 262 of Delaware Law of such holders right
to dissent to the Merger pursuant to Section 262 of Delaware Law, and (ii)
each Stockholder a Letter of Transmittal. The Company shall afford Parent a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon the documents described in
this Section 2.07(a) and shall consider in good faith Parents comments
thereto.

(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, any
share of Company Common Stock that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and that is held by a Stockholder who shall not have voted in
favor of the Merger or consented thereto in writing and who shall have
properly demanded appraisal for such share in accordance with Section 262 of
Delaware Law (collectively, the "Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted
into or represent the right to receive the Final Per Share Merger
Consideration, or any portion thereof, in respect of such Dissenting Share.
Such Stockholder shall instead be entitled to receive payment of the appraised
value of such share of Company Common Stock in accordance with the provisions
of Section 262 of Delaware Law, except that any Dissenting Share held by a
Stockholder who shall have failed to perfect or who effectively shall have
withdrawn or otherwise lost his, her or its rights to appraisal of such share
of Company Common Stock under such Section 262 of Delaware Law shall thereupon
be deemed to have been converted into and to have become exchangeable, as of
the Effective Time, for the right to receive, in the manner provided in
Section 2.05 and Section 2.06, the Final Per Share Merger Consideration,
without any interest thereon. The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of
any demands received by the Company for appraisal of shares, and Parent shall
have the right to direct all negotiations and proceedings with regard to such
demands. Except with the prior written consent of Parent, the Company shall
not make any payment with respect to, or offer to settle, or settle any such
demands.

(c) At the Effective Time, any holder of Dissenting Shares shall cease to
have any rights with respect thereto, except the rights provided in Section
262 of Delaware Law.

 

Section 2.08. _Closing of Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the Company
Common Stock and Series A Preferred Stock transfer books shall be closed and
no transfer of Company Common Stock or Series A Preferred Stock shall
thereafter be made. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without
any further action on the part of the Stockholders, the 

 



23  holders of Series A Preferred Stock, Parent, the Company or Merger
Subsidiary, (a) the Outstanding Shares shall be cancelled and extinguished and
shall represent only the right to receive its respective portion of the Final
Merger Consideration pursuant to this Article 2 and (b) the shares of Series A
Preferred Stock shall be cancelled and extinguished and shall represent only
the right to receive its respective portion of the Liquidation Preference
Amount pursuant to this Article 2. No dividends or other distributions with
respect to capital stock of the Surviving Corporation with a record date after
the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any of Outstanding Shares,
including Dissenting Shares, or representing shares of Series A Preferred
Stock.

Section 2.09. _Additional Escrow Amount_.

(a) From and after the Closing, the Additional Escrow Amount shall be used
solely to pay (x) any severance payable (including benefits provided) (if
any) under the applicable employment agreement (plus any interest accrued
thereon and to be accrued thereon pursuant to the terms of the applicable
employment agreements) to the Specified Employees, to which such Specified
Employee may become entitled pursuant to their respective employment
agreements, in the event any such Specified Employees employment with the
Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries is terminated within 180 days of the
Closing for any reason or (y) any payments for product development or
commissions of laser technology related to Visotek, Inc. described on Exhibit
E (Product Development or Commissions) hereto to the extent triggered by
Parent affirmatively terminating its efforts to develop such technology
within 180 days of the Closing for any reason ("Specified Payments"). Nothing
herein changes entitlements under applicable employment agreements, which
remain subject to all terms and conditions thereof.

(b) Upon receipt of reasonable evidence by the Securityholders Representative
that any Specified Employee has been terminated by the Surviving Corporation
or its Subsidiaries, within 10 days following termination of employment of any
Specified Employee, Parent and the Securityholders Representative shall
immediately deliver a joint instruction to the Escrow Agent instructing the
Escrow Agent to release to Parent from the Additional Escrow Account, the
amount equal to the severance payable (including benefits provided) (if any)
under the applicable employment agreement (plus any interest accrued thereon
and to be accrued thereon pursuant to the terms of the employment agreements)
(each, a "Specified Employee Payment"). If any terminated Specified Employee
is re-hired by Parent or its Affiliates at any time during the 180 day period
following the date of such termination, Parent shall provide prompt written
notice to the Securityholders Representative and such Specified Employee
Payment with respect to such employee shall be promptly (but in all cases
prior to the one year anniversary of the Closing) returned by Parent to the
Additional Escrow Account.

(c) Upon receipt of reasonable evidence by the Securityholders
Representative that any Specified Payment is payable, within 10 days following
the occurrence of any event giving rise to an obligation to make Specified
Payments, Parent and the Securityholders Representative shall immediately
deliver a joint instruction to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent
to release to Parent from the Additional Escrow Account, an amount equal to
any Specified Payments payable. If the product development for laser
technology described in Exhibit E is restarted by Parent or its affiliates at
any time during the 180 day period following the date of termination of
development, Parent shall provide prompt written notice to the
Securityholders 

 



24  Representative and amounts previously released to Parent from the Additional
Escrow Account relating to the specific product development shall be promptly
(but in all cases prior to the one year anniversary of the Closing) returned
by Parent to the Additional Escrow Account.

(d) On the one-year anniversary of the Closing, Parent and the
Securityholders Representative shall immediately deliver a joint instruction
to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to release to
Securityholders Representative from the Additional Escrow Account, an amount
equal to the remaining Additional Escrow Amount for further distribution to
the Securityholders (to be paid to the Securityholders as if such amount were
being distributed pursuant to Section 2.06(e)(i)).

 

Section 2.10. _Non-Core Real Estate_. The parties acknowledge and agree, if
the sales of certain real estate in Mexico identified on Section 2.10 of the
Company Disclosure Schedule ("Non-Core Real Estate") closes (a) prior to the
Closing, the Net Proceeds of such sales shall increase Closing Date Cash and
Cash Equivalents (even if such sale closes on the Closing Date), or (b)
following the Closing, Parent shall pay the Net Proceeds of such sales
(promptly following the closing of such sales) to the Securityholders
Representative for further distribution to the Securityholders (to be paid to
the Securityholders as if such amount were being distributed pursuant to
Section 2.06(e)(i)). The Company may elect in its sole discretion to
distribute the title to any Non-Core Real Estate to the Stockholders prior to
the Closing. For the purposes of this Agreement, "Net Proceeds" means the
gross proceeds from the sales of such Non-Core Real Estate, less any actual
out-of-pocket Taxes imposed on the Company or its Subsidiaries on such sale
and less any United States income Taxes (determined without reduction for net
operating losses, tax credits or similar offsets) on the distribution or
deemed distribution of the proceeds of such sale (with the proceeds of such
sale first being applied to repay the intercompany loan balance between
Victor Equipment Company (as the lender) and Victor Equipment de Mexico, S.A.
de C.V. (as the borrower) in the amount as of December 31, 2013 of $2,838,296
before any portion of such proceeds are distributed or deemed to be
distributed; provided that to the extent the intercompany loan balance is
reduced prior to such repayment, such proceeds shall be deemed to be applied
to repay the intercompany loan on a pro forma basis as if such reduction did
not occur), and less all actual, out-of-pocket direct selling expenses
related to such sales. From and after the Closing, subject to compliance with
Applicable Law, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and
its Subsidiaries to, use commercially reasonable efforts to pursue and
consummate a sale of Non-Core Real Estate on such terms as reasonably directed
by the Securityholders Representative; provided that (i) the Securityholders,
severally and not jointly, pro rata based on each Securityholders relative
number of Fully Diluted Shares, up to an aggregate amount equal to the Net
Proceeds of the sale of the Non-Core Real Estate, shall indemnify and hold
harmless Parent, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries from and
against any and all liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses,
interest, awards, judgments and penalties suffered or incurred by them arising
out of or resulting from the sale of such Non-Core Real Estate (other than to
the extent such losses arise from the willful misconduct of Parent, the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries) and (ii) such direction by the
Securityholders Representative does not interfere unreasonably with the
conduct of the business of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries.

Section 2.11. _Transfer Taxes_. All stamp, transfer, documentary, sales, use,
registration and other such taxes, levies and fees (including any penalties
and interest) incurred in connection

 



25  with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (collectively,
the "Transfer Taxes") shall be paid by Parent, and Parent shall, at its own
expense, procure any stock transfer stamps required by, and properly file on
a timely basis all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect
to, any Transfer Tax and provide to each of the Stockholders upon request
evidence of payment of all Transfer Taxes.

its reasonable best efforts to cause any of its directors and the directors of

Effective Time and to deliver to Parent written evidence of such resignations
at or prior to the Effective Time.

Section 4.16. _Employees and Employee Benefit Plans_.

 

(a) Section 4.16(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule contains a correct and
complete list identifying each material Employee Plan. For purposes of this
Agreement, "Employee Plan" means each "employee benefit plan," as defined in
Section 3(3) of ERISA, each employment, change of control, individual
consulting, severance, vacation, or similar Contract, plan or policy and each
other plan or arrangement (written or oral) providing for compensation,
bonuses, profit-sharing, stock purchase, stock option or other stock related
rights or other forms of incentive or deferred compensation, tax gross-
up, relocation, employee loan, vacation benefits, insurance (including any
self-insured arrangements), health or medical benefits, employee housing fund,
employee assistance program, disability or sick leave benefits, workers
compensation, supplemental unemployment benefits, severance benefits and
postemployment or retirement benefits (including compensation, pension,
health, medical or life insurance benefits) or other form of benefits, which
is maintained, administered or contributed to or required to be contributed
to by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and covers any current or former
employee, director or individual independent contractor or consultant of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or with respect to which the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries has any liability, contingent or otherwise. Section
4.16(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule separately identifies each Employee
Plan maintained outside of the United States (each, a "Foreign Plan"). True,
correct and complete copies of the Employee Plans (and, if applicable, any
related trust or funding agreements or insurance policies) and all amendments
thereto have been made available to Parent together with the most recent (i)
summary plan descriptions, (ii) annual report (Form 5500 including, if
applicable, Schedule B thereto) for the last three years and the most recent
actuarial report, if any, (iii) Internal Revenue Service determination letter
or opinion letter (if applicable), the most recent nondiscrimination tests
performed for each material Employee Plan and any other material
correspondence to or from the Internal Revenue Service, the Department of
Labor, the PBGC or any other Governmental Authority for the last three years,
(iv) tax return (Form 990) prepared in connection with any such plan or trust,
(v) written descriptions of all non-written Employee Plans, in each case, only
if applicable, and (vi) with respect to Foreign Plan, material items similar
in substance as items described in clauses (i) through (iv) (if applicable)
relating to any foreign Governmental Authority or foreign law.

 

(b) No liability under Title IV of ERISA has been incurred by the Company or
any ERISA Affiliate of the Company that has not been satisfied in full, and
no condition exists that presents a material risk to the Company or any ERISA
Affiliate of the Company of incurring any such liability, other than liability
for premiums due the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation ("PBGC") (which
premiums have been paid when due). No Employee Plan that is subject to Title
IV (a "Title IV Plan") or any trust established thereunder has failed to
satisfy the "minimum funding standards" (as defined in Section 302 of ERISA
and Section 412 of the Code), whether or not waived, as of the last day of the
most recent fiscal year of each Title IV

 



38  Plan ended prior to the date hereof. During the six (6) year period ending
on the date of this Agreement, none of the Company or its Subsidiaries or any
of their respective ERISA Affiliates: (i) has withdrawn from any pension plan
under circumstances resulting in a liability to the Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation; or (ii) has engaged in any transaction which would reasonably be
expected to give rise to any liability of the Company, its Subsidiaries or
any of their ERISA Affiliates under Section 4069 or Section 4212(c) of ERISA.

(c) Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate of the Company nor any
predecessor thereof sponsors, maintains or contributes to, or has in the past
sponsored, maintained or contributed to, any Employee Plan that is a
Multiemployer Plan or a "multiple employer plan" (within the meaning of
Section 413(c) of the Code).

(d) Each Employee Plan which is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a)
of the Code has received a favorable determination letter or opinion letter
that it is so qualified, or has pending or has time remaining in which to
file, an application for such determination from the Internal Revenue
Service (and the Company is not aware of any reason why any such
determination letter or opinion letter should be revoked or not be reissued)
and the trusts maintained thereunder are exempt from taxation under Section
501(a) of the Code, and, to the knowledge of the Company, nothing has
occurred with respect to the Employee Plans which could be reasonably expected
to cause the loss of such qualification or exemption or the imposition of any
material liability, penalty or tax under ERISA or the Code (including, but
not limited to, Sections 4972, 4975, 4976, 4977, 4979, 4980(B), 4980(E), or
5000 of the Code). Each Employee Plan has been operated and administered in
substantial compliance with its terms and with the requirements prescribed by
any and all statutes, orders, rules and regulations, including ERISA and the
Code, which are applicable to such Employee Plan. Except as has not had and
would not reasonably be expected to be, individually or in the aggregate,
material to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, there are no
pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened, claims or lawsuits
which have been asserted or instituted against or in respect of the Employee
Plans or the assets of any of the trusts under such plans.

(e) All employer and employee contributions, benefits and premiums required by
and due under the terms of each Employee Plan have been timely paid
materially in accordance with the terms of such Employee Plan and all
applicable laws or, to the extent not required to be made or paid on or before
the date hereof, are properly accrued, to the extent required by GAAP, on the
Companys financial statements. Each Foreign Plan required to be registered
has registered under Applicable Law and with applicable regulatory
authorities.

 

(f) Except as otherwise specifically so contemplated in this Agreement or as
set forth on Section 4.16(f) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, with respect
to each current or former employee or individual independent contractor or
consultant of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not, either alone
or together with any other event: (i) trigger or accelerate the time of
payment or funding (through a grantor trust or otherwise) of any compensation
or benefits payable to any such Person (or trigger any other material
obligation to any such Person), (ii) accelerate the vesting of any
compensation or benefits of any such Person (including any stock options or
other equity-based awards, any incentive compensation or any deferred
compensation entitlement); (iii) increase the amount or value of any benefit
or compensation otherwise payable or required

 



39  to be provided to any such Person or entitle any such Person to any
severance, bonus, retention or other benefits; or (iv) cause amounts payable
under the Employee Plans to fail to be deductible for U.S. federal income tax
purposes by virtue of Section 280G of the Code. No employee or individual
consultant or independent contractor is entitled to receive any gross-up or
additional payment by reason of the tax required by Section 409A or 4999 of
the Code being imposed upon such person.

(g) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liability in
respect of post-retirement health, medical or life insurance benefits for
retired, former or current employees or individual consultants or independent
contractors of the Company or its Subsidiaries, other than coverage mandated
by Section 4980B of the Code or other Applicable Law.

(h) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or subject
to, or is currently negotiating in connection with entering into, any
collective bargaining agreement, voluntary recognition agreement or other
labor agreement with any union, works council or labor organization. No union,
works council or labor organization represents any employees of the Company
or its Subsidiaries in such employees capacity as an employee of the Company
or its Subsidiaries. No union, works council, labor organization or group of
employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries has made a pending demand for
recognition or certification, and, to the knowledge of the Company, there are
no representation or certification proceedings or petitions seeking a
representation proceeding presently pending or threatened in writing to be
brought or filed with any labor relations tribunal or authority. To the
knowledge of the Company, there has not been any activity or proceeding of any
union, works council, labor organization or employee group to organize or
certify any such employees. In addition, there are no unfair labor practice
charges or complaints or other material grievance or legal proceeding against
Company or any of its Subsidiaries pending before the National Labor Relations
Board or before any other board in the non-United States jurisdiction, and
there are no labor strikes, lockouts, picketing, slowdowns, stoppages,
material grievances or material arbitrations actually pending or threatened
against or affecting the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

(i) The Company and its Subsidiaries have provided notice to, or engaged in
any consultation procedure with, any unions, works councils, labor
organizations or similar bodies, in each case, to the extent such notice or
consultation was required to have been made by Applicable Law or Contract
prior to the date hereof in connection with the execution of this Agreement. 

(j) Since the Company Balance Sheet Date, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has effectuated (i) a "plant closing" (as defined in the WARN
Act) affecting any site of employment or one or more facilities or operating
units within any site of employment or facility of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries; (ii) a "mass layoff" (as defined in the WARN Act); or (iii)
such other transaction, layoff, reduction in force or employment terminations
sufficient in number to trigger application of any similar state or local law.

 

(k) As of the date of this Agreement, neither the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is party to a legally-binding contract, plan or commitment to
(i) create any additional Employee Plan, or any plan, agreement or arrangement
that would be an Employee Plan if adopted, or (ii) to modify any existing
Employee Plan, except as required by Applicable Law or renewals or similar
actions in the ordinary course of business.

 



40 (l) To the Knowledge of the Company on the date hereof, each Employee Plan
that is subject to Section 409A of the Code is in compliance with, and has
been operated and administered in compliance with, Section 409A of the Code,
as applicable.

 

(m) With respect to each Foreign Plan that is a defined benefit pension plan,
the fair market value of the assets of each such Foreign Plan, at least
equals the accrued benefit obligations under such Foreign Plan, in each case
determined in accordance with GAAP. No current or former employee, director or
individual independent contractor or consultant of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries is entitled to participate in any Foreign Plan which is a
defined benefit pension plan, final salary plan or any death, disability or
retirement benefit calculated by reference to age, salary or length of service
and no current or former employee, director or individual independent
contractor or consultant of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has any
claim or right in respect of any benefits payable on early retirement or
redundancy under any Foreign Plan which is an occupational pension plan which
was transferred to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to the
Transfer Regulations during the five-year period ending on the date of this
Agreement. "Transfer Regulations" means all laws of any European Union member
state implementing or in accordance with the EU Council Directive 2001/23/EC
on the approximation of the laws of the member states relating to the
safeguarding of employees rights in the event of transfers of undertakings,
businesses or parts of undertakings or businesses.

(n) There has been no amendment to, written interpretation or announcement
(whether or not written) by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries relating
to, or change in employee participation or coverage under, an Employee Plan
which would increase materially the expense of maintaining such Employee Plan
above the level of the expense incurred in respect thereof for the fiscal
year ended December 31, 2012. There has been no termination of any material
Employee Plan since January 1, 2013.

 

(o) With respect to each Foreign Plan that is a "registered pension plan" as
defined in s. 248(1) of the Income Tax Act (Canada), each contribution made
to such plan is an "eligible contribution" as defined in the Income Tax Act
(Canada.) and no circumstances have occurred that would require or provide
grounds for an applicable regulatory authority to require a partial wind up
or termination of such plan pursuant to Applicable Law, there have been no
transfers of assets or liabilities to such plan from any other pension plan
(whether or not a Foreign Plan) that were subject to regulatory approval,
there have been no mergers of such plan, any application of surplus assets of
such plan to offset required employer contributions to such plan was permitted
by Applicable Law and the terms of such plan and associated funding
arrangements, there has been no withdrawal or transfer of assets from the
funding arrangements for such plan other than payments of benefits to eligible
beneficiaries, refunds to plan members of over-contributions, payments on
termination or transfer of employment of an individual employee and payment
of reasonable expenses all to the extent permitted by the plan, the associated
funding arrangement and Applicable Law. No such plan is a "multi-employer
pension plan" as defined under the Pension Benefits Act (Ontario) or a multi-
employer plan or multi-unit plan under applicable Canadian pension standards
legislation.

shall be directed to an executive officer of the Company.

 



52 (b) Nothing contained in this Section 6.02 shall, prior to the Effective Time,
require the Company or its Subsidiaries to take any action that would, based
on the advice of outside legal counsel, constitute a waiver of the attorney-

any of its Subsidiaries or violate confidentiality obligations owing to third
parties; provided, however, that if any information is withheld by the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to the foregoing, the Company shall inform
Parent as to the general nature of what is being withheld; and provided,
further, that the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i)
accommodate any request from Parent for access or information pursuant to this

the Exchange Act for registered offerings of equity securities and of the type
and form customarily included in a registration statement on Form S-3, or as
otherwise reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the Financing and
(B) as otherwise necessary to receive customary "comfort" (including "negative

sole cost and expense of Parent);

_provided_ , _however_ , that, (a) irrespective of the above, no obligation
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under any certificate, document or
instrument shall be effective until the Effective Time and none of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to take any action under any
certificate, document or instrument that is not contingent upon the Closing
or, in the case of a tender offer, the acceptance of the securities subject to
such offer, or that would be effective prior to the Effective Time, (b)
nothing herein shall require such cooperation to the extent it would interfere
unreasonably with the business or operations of the Company or its
Subsidiaries, (c) the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not be obligated to
provide (and Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall not disclose) any information
about the Company or its Subsidiaries that is material, non-public

client or similar privilege, or information that would violate confidentiality
obligations owing to third parties and (d) none of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries shall be required to issue any offering document. None of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to bear any cost or
expense or to pay any commitment or other similar fee or make any other

Effective Time. If the Effective Time does not occur, Parent shall indemnify
and hold harmless the Company, its Subsidiaries and

 



54  Affiliates and their respective Representatives from and against any and all
liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards,
judgments and penalties suffered or incurred by them in connection with the
Financing (other than to the extent such losses arise from the Willful Breach

Company or its Subsidiaries in connection with this Section 6.03,
including legal fees and expenses reasonably incurred. The Company hereby
consents to the use of its and its Subsidiaries logos in connection with the
Financing; provided that such logos shall be used solely in a manner that is
not intended to nor reasonably likely to harm, disparage or otherwise
adversely affect the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

(b) The Company will use reasonable best efforts to periodically update any
Required Information to be included in an offering document to be used in
connection with such Financing so that Parent may ensure that such Required
Information, taken as a whole, does not contain any untrue statement of
material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make
the statements contained therein not misleading.

 

(c) Parent and Merger Subsidiary acknowledge and agree that the obtaining of
the Financing, or any alternative financing, is not a condition to the

contemplated by this Agreement irrespective and independently of the
availability of the Financing or any alternative financing, subject to
fulfillment or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article 9.

any separate counsel retained by the Indemnified Person); provided, however,
that an Indemnified Person shall be permitted to participate in the defense
thereof at its own expense; and provided further, however, that Parent or the
Surviving Corporation shall not be liable for any settlement effected without
its written consent.

 



56 (c) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to continue in full force and
effect for a period of six years from the Effective Time the provisions in
existence in the Companys and its Subsidiaries Organizational Documents in
effect on the date of this Agreement regarding elimination of liability of
directors, indemnification and exculpation of officers, directors and
employees and advancement of expenses.

(d) For six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to provide officers and directors liability, fiduciary liability
and similar insurance (collectively, "DandO Insurance") in respect of acts or
omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time covering each Indemnified
Person covered as of the date of this Agreement by the Companys DandO Insurance
policies on terms with respect to coverage and amount no less favorable than
those of such policy in effect on the date of this Agreement, as well as
covering claims brought against each Indemnified Person under ERISA (or a six-
year prepaid "tail policy" providing coverage benefits and terms no less
favorable to the Indemnified Persons than the Companys current such policy
as well as covering claims brought against each Indemnified Person under
ERISA; for the avoidance of doubt, at the request of the Company, Parent shall
purchase such "tail policy" prior to the Effective Time, subject to the
approval of the Company of the insurance carrier and the terms of such policy
(such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), and,
in such case, Parent shall cause such policy to be in full force and effect
for its full term, and cause all obligations thereunder to be honored by the
Surviving Corporation); _provided_ that, in satisfying its obligation under
this Section 7.02(d), Parent shall not be obligated to a premium for
such "tail policy" in the aggregate in excess of 300% of the aggregate amount
per annum the Company paid in its last full fiscal year, which amount the
Company has disclosed to Parent prior to the date of this Agreement and
provided _further _ that, if the aggregate annual premiums of such insurance
coverage exceed such amount, Parent shall be obligated to obtain a policy with
the greatest coverage available, with respect to matters occurring prior to
the Effective Time, for a cost not exceeding such amount.

(e) If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns
(i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or the Surviving Corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, to the
extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall
assume the obligations set forth in this Section 7.02.

 

(f) Parent and the Company hereby acknowledge (on behalf of themselves and
their respective Affiliates) that the Indemnified Persons may have certain
rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and/or insurance provided
by current stockholders or other Affiliates of the Company ("Indemnitee
Affiliates") separate from the indemnification obligations of Parent and the
Surviving Corporation hereunder. The parties hereto hereby agree (i) that the
Surviving Corporation is the indemnitor of first resort (i.e., its obligations
to the Indemnified Persons under this Section 7.02 are primary and
any obligation of any Indemnitee Affiliate to advance expenses or to provide
indemnification for the same expenses or liabilities incurred by

 



57  the Indemnified Persons under this Section 7.02 are secondary), (ii) that
the Surviving Corporation shall be required to advance the full amount of
expenses incurred by the Indemnified Persons under this Section 7.02 and the
Surviving Corporation shall be liable for the full amount of all expenses,
judgments, penalties, fines and amounts paid in settlement to the extent
legally permitted, without regard to any rights the Indemnified Persons under
this Section 7.02 may have against any Indemnitee Affiliate, and (iii) that
the parties hereto (on behalf of themselves and their respective Affiliates)
irrevocably waive, relinquish and release the Indemnitee Affiliates from any
and all claims against the Indemnitee Affiliates for contribution, subrogation
or any other recovery of any kind in respect thereof.

 

(g) The rights of each Indemnified Person under this Section 7.02 shall be in
addition to any rights such Person may have under the Organizational
Documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or under Delaware Law or
any other Applicable Law or under any agreement of any Indemnified Person with
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. These rights shall
survive consummation of the Merger and are intended to benefit, and shall be
enforceable by, each Indemnified Person and by each Indemnitee Affiliate.

 

Section 7.03. _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) Parent agrees that, during the period commencing at the Effective Time and
ending on the first anniversary of the Effective Time, the employees of the
Company and its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time who remain employees of
the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries following the Effective
Time (the "Current Employees") will be provided with (i) base salary which is
no less favorable than the base salary provided by the Company and its
Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) subject to Section
7.03(b), bonus opportunities that are substantially comparable in the
aggregate to bonus opportunities provided by Parent and its Subsidiaries to
substantially similarly situated employees, and (iii) severance benefits that
are substantially comparable in the aggregate to those provided by
the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time and
which are described in Section 4.16(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule.
Parent agrees that, during the period commencing at the Effective Time and
ending on December 31, 2014 the Current Employees will be provided with the
same retirement and welfare benefits and perquisites (excluding equity and
equity based benefits) under the Companys Employee Plans provided by the
Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time. Parent
agrees that from January 1, 2015 through the first anniversary of the
Effective Time, the Current Employees will be provided with retirement and
welfare benefits and perquisites (excluding defined benefit pension, retiree
medical and life insurance, equity and equity based benefits) provided by
Parent to substantially similarly situated employees. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, terms of continued employment of any Current Employee subject to a
collective bargaining agreement shall be governed by the applicable collective
bargaining agreement.

(b) With respect to any employee benefit plan in which any Current Employee
first becomes eligible to participate, on or after the Effective Time (the
"New Company Plans"), Parent shall: (i) use reasonable best efforts to cause
its third-party insurance providers or third-party administrators to waive
all pre-existing conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to
participation and coverage requirements applicable to such Current Employee
under any New Company Plans which provide medical benefits and in which such
Current Employee

 



58  may be eligible to participate after the Effective Time, but only to the
extent waived or otherwise met under an analogous Employee Plan, and (ii)
recognize service of Current Employees accrued prior to the Effective Time
(to the extent such service was recognized by the Company and its Subsidiaries
under Employee Plans) as if such service were with Parent and its Subsidiaries
for purposes of eligibility to participate in and vesting credit (but not for
the purposes of benefit accruals) under any New Company Plan (other than any
defined benefit pension plan) in which such Current Employees may be eligible
to participate after the Effective Time (including for purposes
of severance); provided, however, that in no event shall any such credit be
given to the extent it would result in the duplication of benefits for the
same period of service. With respect to the Companys and its Subsidiaries
401(k) Employee Plans, to the extent the Company or its Subsidiaries has
funded any matching contributions prior to the Effective Time and any Company
Employee is terminated without cause at or following the Effective Time,
Parent shall cause any such terminated Company Employee to be fully vested in
such Company Employees 401(k) Employee Plan.

(c) No provision of this Section 7.03 (i) creates any third-party beneficiary
or other rights, including any rights of continued employment or rights to a
particular term of employment, for any employee of the Company or its
Subsidiaries (including any beneficiary or dependent thereof) other than
Parent, the Company and their respective successors and assigns, (ii)
constitutes an employment agreement or an amendment to or adoption of any
employee benefit plan of or by any member of Parent, the Company or
their Subsidiaries, or (iii) shall alter or limit the ability of Parent, the
Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries to amend, modify or terminate
any benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement at any time assumed,
established, sponsored or maintained by any of them in accordance with the
terms of such plan, program, agreement or arrangement and Applicable Law.

all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper and
advisable under Applicable Law to consummate in the most expeditious manner

and advisable filings, notices, petitions, statements, registrations,
submissions of information, applications and other documents, (ii) taking all
appropriate actions, and doing, or causing to be done, all things necessary,

the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including using its
reasonable best efforts to obtain and maintain all approvals, consents,

franchises, authorizations and other confirmations of all
Governmental Authorities or other third parties that are necessary, proper
and advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and to fulfill the conditions to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (iii) defending any actions, suits, claims, investigations or

the

 



59  transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including seeking to have any

extent reasonable with the other parties hereto in their efforts to comply
with their obligations under this Agreement. The parties acknowledge and agree
that no other filings under any applicable competition, merger control,
antitrust or similar law are required or advisable to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement other than (a) a filing of a
Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act and (b) a merger filing
with the Colombian Superintendency of Industry and Commerce.

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each of Parent and
the Company shall (a) make (or shall cause its ultimate parent entity as that
term is defined in the HSR Act to make) an appropriate filing of a
Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable (and in any event
within ten Business Days of the date of this Agreement) and (b) make a merger
filing with the Colombian Superintendency of Industry and Commerce as promptly
as practicable. Subject to Section 8.01(d), the parties shall supply as
promptly as practicable and advisable, any additional information and
documentary material that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act and to use
their reasonable best efforts to take all other actions necessary to cause
the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR
Act as soon as practicable. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, it is expressly understood and agreed that: (i) Parent shall not
have any obligation to litigate or contest any administrative or judicial
action or proceeding challenging any transaction contemplated by this
Agreement as violative of any Applicable Law, whether temporary,
preliminary, or permanent and (ii) Parent shall be under no obligation to
(and the Company shall not without the prior written consent of Parent)
discuss or make any proposals, execute or carry out agreements, or submit to
Orders providing for (A) the sale, license, or other disposition or holding
separate (through the establishment of a trust or otherwise) of any assets,
businesses, services, products or product lines of Parent or the Company (or
any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates), (B) behavioral
limitations, conduct restrictions, or commitments with respect to any assets,
businesses, services, products or product lines of Parent or the Company (or
any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates), (C) the creation,

obligations of Parent or the Company (or any of their respective Subsidiaries
or Affiliates), and/or (D) the holding separate of the shares of the Company
capital stock or any limitation or regulation on the ability of Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates to exercise full rights of ownership of the
shares of the Companys capital stock. Any actions taken by or at the request
of Parent (if any) in order to obtain any consents or authorizations from any
Governmental Authority or other Person shall not affect the Closing Date
Merger Consideration or the Final Merger Consideration (and such amounts shall
be calculated pro-forma as if such actions did not occur).

(c) Each of Parent and the Company shall promptly notify the other party of
any substantive communication it receives from any Governmental Authority
relating to the matters that are the subject of this Agreement and permit the
other party to review in advance any proposed substantive communication by
such party to any Governmental Authority and shall provide each other upon
request with copies of all correspondence, filings or communications between
them or any of their Representatives and any Governmental Authority relating
to the transactions that are the subject of this Agreement. The parties may,
as they deem advisable,

 



60  designate any sensitive materials provided to the other under this Section
8.01 as "outside counsel only." Such materials and the information contained
therein shall be given only to outside counsel of the recipient and will not
be disclosed by such outside counsel to employees, officers, or directors of
the recipient without the advance written consent of the party providing such
materials. In addition, to the extent reasonably practicable, all
discussions, telephone calls, and meetings with a Governmental Authority
regarding the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall include
representatives of both parties. The parties will consult and cooperate
with each other in connection with any analyses, appearances, presentations,
memoranda, briefs, arguments, and proposals made or submitted to any
Governmental Authority regarding the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 

(d) Except as provided herein, the parties understand and agree that Parent
and its external counsel shall have the right to determine, direct and
control the general strategy, methods and terms in connection with responding
to any review of, or any litigation by, or negotiations with, any antitrust
Governmental Authority relating to the transaction contemplated hereby and
will take the lead in all meetings, discussions and communications with any
Governmental Authority relating to obtaining antitrust approval for the
transactions contemplated hereby (unless the communications are in response to
a request by a Governmental Authority directed to the Company, in which case
the Company or its outside counsel may respond to such request after
consulting, to the extent practicable, with Parent or its outside counsel
first); provided that the Company and its counsel shall have been provided
the right to participate in all substantive meetings, conference calls or
similar communications with any antitrust Governmental Authority and consult
with Parent in respect of any such actions determined, directed and
controlled by Parent. Parent and its outside counsel shall consult with and
consider in good faith the views of the Company and its outside counsel with
respect to all such matters. For the avoidance of doubt, except as provided
herein, if there is a disagreement about the strategy, methods or terms in
connection with responding to any review of the transaction by any
Governmental Authority, Parents decisions shall control. In addition, the
Company and its outside counsel shall not discuss with or offer to any
Governmental Authority or agree to any divestiture, licensing, hold separate,
conduct, or other remedy related to the transaction or related to obtaining
antitrust clearance of the transaction without the advance written consent of
Parent or its outside counsel.

(e) The Company and Parent shall cooperate with one another in determining any
actions, consents, approvals or waivers required to be obtained from third
parties to any material Contracts, in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and in taking such actions and
seeking timely to obtain any such actions, consents, approvals or waivers.

Section 8.02. _Public Announcements_. Parent and the Company shall consult
with each other before issuing any press release, making any other public
statement or scheduling any press conference or conference call with investors
or analysts with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby and, except as may be required by Applicable Law or any listing
agreement with or rule of any national securities exchange or association,
shall not issue any such press release, make any such other public statement
or schedule any such press conference or conference call before such
consultation.

 



61 Section 8.03. _Further Assurances_. At and after the Effective Time, the
officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to
execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company or Merger
Subsidiary, any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to take
and do, in the name and on behalf of the Company or Merger Subsidiary, any
other actions and things to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in
the Surviving Corporation any and all right, title and interest in, to and
under any of the rights, properties or assets of the Company acquired or to
be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in connection
with, the Merger.

Section 8.04.  _Notices of Certain Events_. Each of the Company and Parent
shall promptly notify the other of:

(a) any notice or other communication from any unions, work councils, labor
organizations or similar bodies in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement;

 

(b) any action, suit, claim or proceeding commenced or, to the knowledge of
the parties, threatened against any party in connection with this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereunder;

(c) any inaccuracy of any representation or warranty contained in this
Agreement at any time during the term of this Agreement that could reasonably
be expected to give rise to a risk of termination set forth in Section
10.01(c)(i) or Section 10.01(d)(i), as the case may be; and

 

(d) any failure of that party to comply with or satisfy any covenant,
condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder that
could reasonably be expected to give rise to a right of termination set forth
in Section 10.01(c)(i) or Section 10.01(d)(i), as the case may be;

 

provided, however, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section
8.04 shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder
to the party receiving that notice.

TERMINATION

 

Section 10.01. _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated and the Merger
may be abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time (notwithstanding any
approval of this Agreement by the shareholders of the Company):

(a) by mutual written agreement of the Company and Parent;

(b) by either the Company or Parent, if:

 

(i) the Merger has not been consummated on or before September 30, 2014 (the
"End Date"), provided, however, that this Section 10.01(b)(i) shall not be
available to any party (A) whose Willful Breach of any provision of this
Agreement results in the failure of the Merger to be consummated on or before
the End Date, provided that in the event of a Willful Breach, from and after
the End Date, the non-Willful Breaching party shall have 60 days to commence a
legal proceeding for specific performance of this Agreement and (x) if such
legal proceeding is not commenced by the end of such 60 day period or (y)
there is a final and nonappealable judgment by a Governmental Authority of
competent jurisdiction denying a claim for specific performance by the non-
Willful Breaching party, the Willful Breaching party shall have the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Section
10.01(b)(i) notwithstanding this clause (A)) or (B) during the pendency of any
legal proceeding by the other party for specific performance of
this Agreement;

(ii) there is an Order in effect by a Governmental Authority of competent
jurisdiction that restrains, enjoins or otherwise prevents the consummation
of the Merger and such enjoinment shall have become final and nonappealable;
or

(c) by Parent, if: 

(i) a breach of any representation or warranty or failure to perform any
covenant or agreement on the part of the Company set forth in this Agreement
shall have occurred (A) that would cause the condition set forth in Section
9.02(a) or Section 9.02(b) not to be satisfied; and (B) such breach or failure
is not cured by the Company by the earlier of (x) the End Date or (y) thirty
calendar days following receipt by the Company of written notice of such
breach or failure provided that, at the time of the delivery of such written
notice, Parent shall not be in material breach of its obligations under this
Agreement; or

 



64 (d) by the Company if:

 

(i) a breach of any representation or warranty or failure to perform any
covenant or agreement on the part of Parent or Merger Subsidiary set forth in
this Agreement shall have occurred (A) that would cause the condition set
forth in Section 9.03(a) or Section 9.03(b) not to be satisfied; and (B) such
breach or failure is not cured by the earlier of (x) the End Date or (y)
thirty calendar days following receipt by the Company of written notice of
such breach or failure provided that, at the time of the delivery of such
written notice, the Company shall not be in material breach of
its obligations under this Agreement.

The party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 10.01
(other than pursuant to Section 10.01(a)) shall give notice of such
termination to the other party, including a description in reasonable detail
of the reasons for such termination, to the other party in accordance with
Section 11.01, specifying the provision or provisions hereof pursuant to
which such termination is effected.

Section 10.02. _Effect of Termination_. If this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to Section 10.01, this Agreement shall become void and of no effect
without liability of any party (or any shareholder, director, officer,
employee, agent, consultant or representative of such party) to the other
party hereto; provided that, if such termination shall result from (a) the
Willful Breach by any party of any representation or warranty, covenant or
agreement contained herein, or (b) in the case of Parent, the inability or
failure of Parent to make any of the payments contemplated by this Agreement
(including the payments contemplated by Article 2 and Parents fees and
expenses), in each case, except as otherwise provided in Section 10.03, such
party shall be fully liable for any and all liabilities and damages incurred
or suffered by the other party as a result of such breach. The provisions of
this Section 10.02, Section 6.02(b), Section 6.03(a) with respect to Parents
obligations of indemnification and expense reimbursement, Section 10.03 and
Article 11 shall survive any termination hereof pursuant to Section 10.01.

 

Section 10.03. _Parent Termination Fee_.

 

(a) In the event that this Agreement has been terminated by the Company or
Parent (i) pursuant to Section 10.01(b)(i) and the condition set forth in
Section 9.01(a) or Section 9.01(b)(i) has not been satisfied on or before the
End Date, or (ii) pursuant to Section 10.01(b)(ii) due to a final and non-
appealable Order enjoining, restraining or otherwise preventing consummation
of the Merger, in each case, under any Applicable Laws with respect to
antitrust, competition or merger controls, then within two (2) Business Days
following such termination, Parent shall pay to the Company an amount equal
to $45,000,000 (the "Parent Termination Fee"), provided, however, that if the
failure to consummate the Merger on or before the End Date is the result of a
material breach by the Company of its material obligations under Section 8.01
hereof that directly results in the failure of the condition set forth in
Section 9.01(a) or Section 9.01(b)(i) hereof to be satisfied and in the event
of any such material breach by the Company, Parent shall have given the
Company prompt written notice of such breach and the opportunity to cure such
breach, then no Parent Termination Fee shall be payable by Parent to the
Company. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, except in
the case of a Willful Breach of Section 8.01(b) of this Agreement by Parent
or Merger Subsidiary, if Parent

 



65  and Merger Subsidiary fail to complete the Closing as a result of the
failure to satisfy the condition set forth in Section 9.01(a) or Section
9.01(b)(i), then the Companys sole and exclusive remedy (whether in
contract, in tort, at law or otherwise) against Parent and Merger Subsidiary
for any breach, loss or damage shall be to terminate this Agreement and
receive payment of the Parent Termination Fee and neither Parent nor Merger
Subsidiary will have any liability or obligation to the Company relating to or
arising out of this Agreement or in respect of any other document or theory of
law or equity. The parties understand and agree that in no event shall Parent
be required to pay the Parent Termination Fee on more than one occasion. In
the event of a Willful Breach of Section 8.01(b) of this Agreement, in each
case by Parent or Merger Subsidiary, the Company shall have the right to sue
for damages which are in excess of the Parent Termination Fee (including
damages based on loss of the economic benefits of the transactions
contemplated hereby to the Companys Securityholders). In the event of any
Willful Breach by Parent or Merger Subsidiary of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein (other than Section 8.01),
Parent shall be fully liable for any and all liabilities and damages incurred
or suffered by the Company as a result of such breach, the amount of which
may be greater than the Parent Termination Fee.

(b) The parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this Section
10.03 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
and that, without these agreements, neither Parent nor the Company would have
entered into this Agreement; accordingly, if Parent fails to promptly pay
any amounts due pursuant to this Section 10.03 and, in order to obtain such
payment, the Company commences a suit which results in a judgment against
Parent for the amount of the Parent Termination Fee set forth in this Section
10.03, Parent shall pay the Companys reasonable costs and expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses of enforcement) in
connection with such suit, together with interest on the amounts owed at the
prime lending rate prevailing at such time, as published in the _Wall Street
Journal_ from the date such amounts were required to be paid until the date
actually received by the Company.

Agreement.

(a) Any provision of this Agreement may be amended or waived prior to the

signed, in the case of an amendment, by each party to this Agreement or, in
the case of a waiver, by each party against whom the waiver is to be
effective.

 



67 (b) No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power or
privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or
partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies
herein provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or
remedies provided by Applicable Law.

Section 11.04. _Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided herein, all costs and

Sections of the Company Disclosure Schedule in which the information
would otherwise be required to be included only to the extent that it is
reasonably apparent that such disclosure is applicable to such other Section.
Disclosure of any fact or item in any Section of the Company Disclosure
Schedule shall not be considered an admission by the disclosing party that
such item or fact (or any non-disclosed item or information of comparable or
greater significance) represents a material exception or fact, event or
circumstance or that such item has had or would reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company or Parent, as the case may be,
or that such item or fact will in fact exceed any applicable threshold
limitation set forth in the Agreement and shall not be construed as an
admission by the disclosing party of any non-compliance with, or violation
of, any third party rights (including but not limited to any Intellectual
Property rights) or any Applicable Law of any Governmental Authority, such
disclosures having been made solely for the purposes of creating exceptions
to the representations made herein or of disclosing any information required
to be disclosed under the Agreement.

(a) The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to

assigns, except as set forth in the immediately following sentence. Except as
(i) provided in Section 6.03(a), Section 7.02, Section 11.15, Section 11.16
and this Section 11.06, (ii) to the extent the Effective Time occurs, for the

Company to pursue damages (including damages based on loss of the economic
benefits of the transactions contemplated hereby to the Companys
Securityholders) in the event of Parents or Merger Subsidiarys Willful
Breach of this Agreement, no provision of this Agreement is intended

68 (b) No party may assign, delegate or otherwise transfer any of its rights or
obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of each
other party hereto.

Section 11.07. _Governing Law_. This Agreement, and all claims or causes of
action (whether in contract, in tort, at law or otherwise) that may be based
upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement or the negotiation, execution
or performance of this Agreement (including any claim or cause of action
based upon, arising out of or related to any representation or warranty made
in or in connection with this Agreement or as an inducement to enter this
Agreement) shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal
laws of the State of Delaware without giving effect to any choice of law
principles that would require or permit the application of the laws of another
jurisdiction

 

Section 11.08. _Jurisdiction_. The parties hereto agree that any suit, action
or proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any matter
arising out of or in connection with, this Agreement, or the transactions
contemplated hereby (whether in contract, in tort, at law or otherwise) shall
be exclusively brought in the Delaware Court of Chancery or, if such
court shall not have jurisdiction, any federal court sitting in Delaware, so
long as one of such courts shall have subject matter jurisdiction over such
suit, action or proceeding, and that any cause of action arising out of this
Agreement shall be deemed to have arisen from a transaction of business in
the State of Delaware, and each of the parties hereby irrevocably consents to
the jurisdiction of such courts (and of the appropriate appellate courts
therefrom) in any such suit, action or proceeding and irrevocably waives, to
the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection that it may now or
hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such suit, action or
proceeding in any such court or that any such suit, action or proceeding
brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Process
in any such suit, action or proceeding may be served on any party anywhere in
the world, whether within or without the jurisdiction of any such court.
Without limiting the foregoing, each party agrees that service of process on
such party as provided in Section 11.01 shall be deemed effective service of
process on such party. Any judgment of such Delaware court may be enforced
anywhere.

 

Section 11.09. _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY OR THEREBY (WHETHER IN CONTRACT, IN TORT, AT LAW OR OTHERWISE).

 

Section 11.10. _Counterparts; Effectiveness_. This Agreement may be signed in
any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same
effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument.
Delivery of a signed counterpart of a signature page of this Agreement by
facsimile or by PDF file (portable document format file) shall be
as effective as delivery of a manually signed counterpart of this Agreement.
This Agreement shall become effective when each party hereto shall have
received a counterpart hereof signed by all of the other parties hereto. Until
and unless each party has received a counterpart hereof signed by the other
party hereto, this Agreement shall have no effect and no party shall have any
right or obligation hereunder (whether by virtue of any other oral or written
agreement or other communication).

  



69 Section 11.11. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, including the schedules and
exhibits hereto and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire
agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter thereof and
supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both oral and written,
between the parties with respect to the subject matter thereof (other than
any agreements among the Securityholders, on the one hand, and the
Securityholders Representative, on the other hand).

 

Section 11.12. _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction
of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other
Governmental Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of
the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall
remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or
invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any
party. Upon such a determination, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as
closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions
contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest
extent possible.

 

Section 11.13. _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the obligations,
undertakings, covenants or agreements of the parties hereto were not performed
in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached and that
monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy. It
is accordingly agreed that the Company, on the one hand, and Parent, on the
other hand, shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement by the other party, and to enforce specifically the
terms and provisions of this Agreement by a decree of specific performance,
without the necessity of proving actual harm or posting a bond or other
security therefor, this being in addition to any other remedy to which such
party is entitled at law or in equity, and each party hereto agrees that it
will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance or other
equitable relief on the basis that any other party hereto has an adequate
remedy at law or that any award of specific performance or other equitable
remedy is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or in equity.
Without limitation of the foregoing, the parties hereto hereby further
acknowledge and agree that prior to the Closing, the Company shall be entitled
to seek specific performance to enforce specifically the terms and provisions
of, and to prevent or cure breaches of the covenants required to be performed
by Parent under this Agreement (including to cause Parent to consummate the
Merger and the Closing and to make the payments contemplated by this
Agreement, including Article 2) in addition to any other remedy to which the
Company is entitled at law or in equity, including the Companys right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Article 10 and seek money damages
(including damages based on loss of the economic benefits of the transactions
contemplated hereby to the Companys Securityholders); provided that the
Company shall not be able to seek specific enforcement of any of the
actions described in Section 8.01(d). In the event that the Company, on the
one hand, or Parent, on the other hand, brings a legal proceeding for specific
performance pursuant to this Section 11.13, and a court rules that the Company
or Parent, as applicable, breached any provision of this Agreement, then the
breaching party shall also pay the non-breaching partys reasonable costs and
expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) in connection
with all such legal proceedings to seek specific performance of the Companys
or Parent, as applicable, obligations under this Agreement and all legal
proceedings to collect such costs and expenses. Each of the parties hereto
further agrees that it shall not take any position in any legal

 



70  proceeding concerning this Agreement that is contrary to the terms of this
Section 11.13. For the avoidance of doubt, under no circumstance shall the
Company be entitled to receive both payment of the Parent Termination Fee and
the grant of specific performance.

Section 11.14. _The Securityholders  Representative_.

(a) The Securityholders Representative is hereby appointed, authorized and
empowered to act as a representative by and for the benefit of the

proceeding, (C) file any proofs of debt, claims and petitions as the
Securityholders Representative may deem advisable or necessary, and (D) file
and prosecute appeals from any decision, judgment or award rendered in any
such action, proceeding or investigation (it being understood that the

actions, and shall not have any liability for any failure to take any such
actions);

(vi) to refrain from enforcing any right of the Securityholders or any of them
and/or the Securityholders Representative arising out of or under or in any
manner relating to this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, or any other
agreement, instrument or document in connection with the foregoing; provided,
however, that no such failure to act on the part of the Securityholders
Representative, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or in the
Escrow Agreement, shall be deemed a waiver of any such right or interest by
the Securityholders Representative or by such Securityholders unless such
waiver is in writing signed by the waiving party or by the Securityholders
Representative;

 

(vii) to make, execute, acknowledge and deliver all such other agreements,
guarantees, orders, receipts, endorsements, notices, requests, instructions,
certificates, unit powers, letters and other writings, and, in general, to do
any and all things and to take any and all action that the Securityholders

thereto, and in exercising or failing to exercise all or any of the powers
conferred upon the Securityholders Representative hereunder (i) the
Securityholders Representative shall incur no responsibility whatsoever to
any Securityholders by reason of any error in judgment or other act or
omission performed or omitted hereunder or in connection with the Escrow
Agreement or any such other agreement, instrument or document, excepting only
responsibility for any act or failure to act which represents willful
misconduct and (ii) the Securityholders Representative shall be entitled to
rely on the advice of counsel, public accountants or other independent
experts experienced in the matter at issue, and any error in judgment or
other act or omission of the Securityholders Representative pursuant to such

a claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of, or related to this
Agreement may only be brought by the expressly named party to this Agreement
and then only with respect to the specific obligations set forth herein with

the extent of the specific obligations undertaken by such named party in this
Agreement), no present, former or future Affiliate, officer, director,
employee, incorporator, member, partner, stockholder, agent, attorney or other

liabilities of any party which is not otherwise expressly identified as a

Merger or in respect of any oral representations made or alleged to have been
made in connection herewith or therewith. The provisions of this Section
11.15 are intended to be for the benefit of, and enforceable by the

Section 11.16. _Legal Representation_. Parent, Merger Subsidiary and the
Company hereby agree, on their own behalf and on behalf of their directors,
members, partners, officers, employees and Affiliates, and each of their
successors and assigns (all such parties, the "Waiving Parties"), that Weil,
Gotshal and Manges LLP (or any successor) may represent (a) any or all of the
Securityholders (the "Seller Group") or any director, member, partner,
officer, employee or Affiliate of the Seller Group, or (b) the
Securityholders Representative, in each case in connection with any dispute,
litigation, claim, proceeding or obligation arising out of or relating to this
Agreement, including under any agreements contemplated by this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (any such representation, the
"Post-Closing Representation") notwithstanding its representation (or any
continued representation) of the Company and/or any of its Subsidiaries, and
each of Parent, Merger Subsidiary and the Company on behalf of itself and
the Waiving Parties hereby consents thereto and irrevocably waives (and will
not assert) any conflict of interest or any objection arising therefrom or
relating thereto. Parent, Merger Subsidiary and the Company acknowledge that
the foregoing provision applies whether or not Weil, Gotshal and Manges LLP
provides legal services to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries after the
Closing Date. Each of Parent, Merger Subsidiary and the Company, for itself
and the Waiving Parties, hereby irrevocably acknowledges and agrees that all
communications between or among the Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the
Closing, the Seller Group and their counsel, including Weil, Gotshal and Manges
LLP, made in connection with the negotiation, preparation, execution,
delivery and performance under, or any dispute or proceeding arising out of or
relating to, this Agreement, any agreements contemplated by this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, or any matter relating to
any of the foregoing, are privileged communications between the Seller Group
and such counsel (notwithstanding that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
participated or was provided such communications nor that the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries is also a client of such counsel) and from and after the
Closing neither Parent, Merger Subsidiary, the Company, any Subsidiary of the
Company, nor any Person purporting to act on behalf of or through Parent,
Merger Subsidiary or the Company or any of the Waiving Parties, will seek to
obtain the same by any process. From and after the Closing, each of Parent,
Merger Subsidiary and the Company, on behalf of itself and the Waiving
Parties, waives and will not assert any attorney-client privilege with
respect to any communication between Weil, Gotshal and Manges LLP and the
Company, its Subsidiaries or any Person in the Seller Group occurring prior to
the Closing in connection with this Agreement, any of the agreements
contemplated hereby, any of the transactions contemplated hereby or any Post-
Closing Representation.

 



74 Section 11.17. _Rights Cumulative_. Except as otherwise expressly limited by
this Agreement, all rights and remedies of each of the parties under this
Agreement will be cumulative, and the exercise of one or more rights or
remedies will not preclude the exercise of any other right or remedy available
under this Agreement or Applicable Law.
