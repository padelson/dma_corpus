ARTICLE 2 
THE MERGER

 



 

SECTION 2.01 _. The Merger. _(a) On the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement, at the Effective Time, Merger Subsidiary shall be
merged (the " **Merger** ") with and into the Company in accordance with
Delaware Law, whereupon the separate existence of Merger Subsidiary shall
cease, and the Company shall be the surviving corporation (the " **Surviving
Corporation** ").

 



 

(b) Subject to the provisions of Article 9, the closing of the Merger (the "
**Closing** ") shall take place in New York City at the offices of Davis Polk
and Wardwell LLP, 450 Lexington Avenue, New York, New York 10017 as soon as
possible, but in any event no later than two Business Days after the date the
conditions set forth in Article 9 (other than conditions that by their nature
are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or, to the
extent permissible, waiver of those conditions at the Closing) have been
satisfied or, to the extent permissible, waived by the party or parties
entitled to the benefit of such conditions, or at such other place or time as
Parent and the Company may mutually agree (the date on which the Closing
occurs, the " **Closing Date** ").

 



      
 

 



 

(c) At the Closing, the Company and Merger Subsidiary shall file a certificate
of merger with the Delaware Secretary of State and make all other filings or
recordings required by Delaware Law in connection with the Merger. The Merger
shall become effective at such time (the " **Effective Time** ") as such
certificate of merger is duly filed with the Delaware Secretary of State (or
at such later time as may be specified in such certificate of merger).

 



 

(d) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall possess
all the rights, powers, privileges and franchises and be subject to all of the
obligations, liabilities, restrictions and disabilities of the Company and
Merger Subsidiary, all as provided under Delaware Law.

 



 

SECTION 2.02. _Conversion of Shares. _At the Effective Time:

 



 

(a) Except as otherwise provided in Section 2.02(b), Section 2.02(c) or
Section 2.04, each Share outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the
Company, Merger Subsidiary or the holders of any securities of the Company or
Merger Subsidiary, be converted automatically into the right to receive (i)
$12.70 in cash, without interest (the " **Cash Consideration** "), and (ii)
one contractual contingent value right (a " **CVR** "), which shall represent
the right to receive one or more contingent payments upon the achievement of
certain milestones, subject to and in accordance with the terms and conditions
of the CVR Agreement (together with the Cash Consideration, the " **Merger
Consideration** "). As of the Effective Time, all such Shares shall no longer
be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease
to exist, and shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration to be paid in accordance with Section 2.03, without interest.

 



 

(b) Each Share held by the Company as treasury stock or owned by Parent or
Merger Subsidiary immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled,
and no payment shall be made with respect thereto.

 



 

(c) Each Share held by any Subsidiary of Parent (other than Merger Subsidiary)
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into such number of
shares of stock of the Surviving Corporation such that each such Subsidiary
owns the same percentage of the outstanding capital stock of the Surviving
Corporation immediately following the Effective Time as such Subsidiary owned
in the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 



 

(d) Each share of common stock of Merger Subsidiary outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one fully paid
and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation with the
same rights, powers and privileges as the shares so converted and shall
constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving

 



      
 

 



 

Corporation (except for any such shares resulting from the conversion of
Shares pursuant to Section 2.02(c)).

 



 

SECTION 2.03 _. Surrender and Payment. _(a) Prior to the Effective Time,
Parent shall appoint an agent (the " **Exchange Agent** ") reasonably
acceptable to the Company for the purpose of exchanging for the Merger
Consideration uncertificated Shares (the " **Uncertificated Shares** ").
Parent or one of its Affiliates shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited,
with the Exchange Agent, in trust for the benefit of holders of the Shares,
cash in U.S. dollars sufficient to pay the aggregate Cash Consideration to be
paid in respect of the Uncertificated Shares (it being understood and agreed,
for the avoidance of doubt, that Parent shall not be required to deposit any
funds related to any CVR with the Rights Agent unless and until such deposit
is required pursuant to the terms of the CVR Agreement). At or prior to the
Effective Time, Parent and the Rights Agent shall enter into the CVR
Agreement. Promptly after the Effective Time and in any event not later than
the second Business Day following the Closing Date, Parent shall send, or
shall cause the Exchange Agent to send, to each holder of Shares at the
Effective Time a customary letter of transmittal and instructions (which shall
specify that the delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall
pass, only upon proper transfer of the Uncertificated Shares to the Exchange
Agent) for use in such exchange.

 



 

(b) Each holder of Shares that have been converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration shall be entitled to receive, upon receipt by the
Exchange Agent of (i) a properly completed letter of transmittal and (ii) an
"agents message" (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Exchange
Agent may reasonably request), the Merger Consideration payable for each
Uncertificated Share. Until so surrendered or transferred, as the case may be,
each such Uncertificated Share shall represent after the Effective Time for
all purposes only the right to receive the Merger Consideration.

 



 

(c) If any portion of the Merger Consideration (including, for the avoidance
of doubt, payment in the form of or with respect to the CVRs) is to be paid to
a Person other than the Person in whose name the transferred Uncertificated
Share is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment that (i) such
Uncertificated Share shall be properly transferred and (ii) the Person
requesting such payment shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other
Taxes required as a result of such payment to a Person other than the
registered holder of such Uncertificated Share or establish to the
satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not
payable.

 



 

(d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of
transfers of Shares. If, after the Effective Time, Uncertificated Shares are
presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent, they shall be
canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration provided for, and in
accordance with the procedures set forth, in this Article 2.

 



      
 

 



 

(e) Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Exchange
Agent pursuant to Section 2.03(a) (and any interest or other income earned
thereon) that remains unclaimed by the holders of Shares one year after the
Effective Time shall be returned to Parent or one of its Affiliates, upon
demand, and any such holder who has not exchanged its Shares for the Merger
Consideration in accordance with this Section 2.03 prior to that time shall
thereafter look only to Parent for payment of the Merger Consideration in
respect of such Shares without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates shall be liable to any
holder of Shares for any amounts paid to a public official pursuant to
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. Any amounts remaining
unclaimed by holders of Shares immediately prior to the date when such amounts
would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority
shall become, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, the property of
Parent free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously
entitled thereto.

 



 

(f) Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Exchange
Agent pursuant to Section 2.03(a) to pay for Shares for which appraisal rights
have been perfected shall be returned to Parent or one of its Affiliates upon
demand.

 



 

SECTION 2.04 _. Dissenting Shares. _Notwithstanding Section 2.02, Shares that
are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by
a holder who has not voted in favor of the adoption of this Agreement or
consented thereto in writing and who has properly demanded appraisal for its
Shares in accordance with Section 262 of Delaware Law and who has otherwise
complied with all applicable provisions of Section 262 of Delaware law shall
not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, but shall
be entitled only to such rights as granted by Section 262 of Delaware Law,
unless and until such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses
the right to appraisal under Section 262 of Delaware Law. If, either before or
after the Effective Time, such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or loses the
right to appraisal under Section 262 of Delaware Law, such Shares shall
automatically be converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 2.02(a). The Company shall
give Parent prompt notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisal
of Shares, and Parent shall have the right to participate in all negotiations
and proceedings with respect to such demands. Except with the prior written
consent of Parent, the Company shall not make any payment with respect to, or
offer to settle or settle, any such demands.

 



 

SECTION 2.05. _Company Stock Options._

 



 

(a) The Company shall take all action necessary to cause each option to
purchase Shares outstanding under any Employee Plan (each, a " **Company
Stock**

 



       
 

 



 

 **Option** ") to be vested and exercisable at least 10 Business Days prior to
the Closing Date.

 



 

(b) At least 10 Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall
provide written notice to each holder of a Company Stock Option that such
holder shall, during the period beginning on the date of such notice and
ending two Business Days prior to the Closing Date (the " **Exercise Period**
"), have the right to exercise such Company Stock Option by providing the
Company with a notice of exercise and full payment of the applicable exercise
price using any method permitted by such Company Stock Option (other than by
delivery of a promissory note). Each Company Stock Option that remains
unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled at the
Effective Time without consideration therefor.

 



 

SECTION 2.06. _Company Restricted Shares_. (i) Each Share subject to vesting,
repurchase or other lapse restrictions that is outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time (each, a " **Restricted Share** ") shall be vested and
all restrictions thereon shall lapse and (ii) each such Restricted Share shall
be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance
with Section 2.02 of this Agreement, subject to the procedures, terms and
conditions applicable to Shares under this Agreement.

 



 

SECTION 2.07. _Company Warrants_. The Company shall take all action necessary
(including obtaining any necessary written consent from the holder(s) of the
Company Warrants) to cause, at the Effective Time, each outstanding
unexercised warrant to purchase Shares (each, a " **Company Warrant** "),
whether or not exercisable, to be canceled and converted into the right to
receive (subject to any applicable withholding Tax) (i) an amount in cash
equal to the product of (A) the excess, if any, of the Cash Consideration over
the applicable exercise price per Share of such Company Warrant _multiplied
by_ (B) the total number of Shares subject to such Company Warrant, and (ii)
(A) one CVR _multiplied by_ (B) the total number of Shares subject to such
Company Warrant.

 



 

SECTION 2.08 _. Adjustments. _If, during the period between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, the outstanding Shares shall be changed into
a different number of shares or a different class (including by reason of any
reclassification, recapitalization, stock split or combination, exchange or
readjustment of Shares, or stock dividend thereon with a record date during
such period, but excluding any change that results from any issuance of Shares
permitted by Section 6.01(c)), the Merger Consideration and any other amounts
payable pursuant to this Agreement shall be appropriately adjusted.

 



 

SECTION 2.09 _. Withholding Rights. _ Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement, each of the Exchange Agent, the Rights Agent, the Surviving
Corporation and Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Article 2

 



      
 

 



 

(including upon the issuance of, or payment with respect to, the CVRs) such
amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of
such payment under any provision of Tax law. If the Exchange Agent, the Rights
Agent, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, so withholds
amounts, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to such Person in respect of which the Exchange Agent, the
Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, made such deduction and
withholding.

SECTION 3.01 _. Certificate of Incorporation. _Subject to Section 7.03 hereof,

Subject to Section 11.05, except (i) as disclosed in any Company SEC Document

section and any disclosures therein that are predictive, cautionary or
forward-looking in nature) or (ii) as set forth in the Company Disclosure
Schedule, the Company represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Subsidiary
that:

duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the

 



      
 

 



 

laws of the State of Delaware and has the requisite corporate power and
authority to carry on its business as now conducted. The Company is duly
qualified to do business as a foreign corporation and is in good standing as a
foreign corporation in each jurisdiction in which the character of the
properties it owns, operates or leases or the nature of its activities makes
such qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified or
in good standing would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company has heretofore
made available to Parent true and complete copies of the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of the Company as currently in effect.

 



 

SECTION 4.02 _. Corporate Authorization. _(a) The Company has the requisite
corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and,
subject to receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, to perform its
obligations hereunder and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.
Except for the Company Stockholder Approval, the execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement have been duly authorized by all necessary
corporate action on the part of the Company. The affirmative vote of the
holders of a majority of the outstanding Shares (the " **Company Stockholder
Approval** ") is the only vote of the holders of any of the Companys capital
stock necessary in connection with the consummation of the Merger. This
Agreement constitutes a valid and binding agreement of the Company enforceable
against the Company in accordance with its terms (subject to applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and
other laws affecting creditors rights generally and general principles of
equity).

 



 

(b) At a meeting duly called and held, the board of directors of the Company
(the " **Board of Directors** ") has unanimously (i) approved and declared
advisable this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including
the Merger, and (ii) resolved, subject to Section 6.04(b), to recommend
adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders of the Company (such
recommendation, the " **Company Board Recommendation** ").

 



 

SECTION 4.03 _. Governmental Authorization. _The execution, delivery and
performance by the Company of this Agreement and the consummation by the
Company of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement require no action
by or in respect of, or filing with, any Governmental Authority other than (i)
the filing of a certificate of merger with respect to the Merger with the
Delaware Secretary of State, (ii) compliance with any applicable requirements
of the HSR Act, (iii) compliance with any applicable requirements of the 1933
Act, the 1934 Act and any other applicable U.S. state or federal securities
laws, (iv) compliance with any applicable rules and regulations of Nasdaq and
(v) any other actions, consents, approvals, authorizations, permits,
notifications or filings the failure of which to make or obtain would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

 



      
 

 



 

SECTION 4.04 _. Non-contravention. _Assuming the receipt of the Company
Stockholder Approval, the execution, delivery and performance by the Company
of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
do not and will not (i) contravene, conflict with, or result in any violation
or breach of any provision of the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of
the Company, (ii) assuming compliance with the matters referred to in Section
4.03, contravene, conflict with or result in a violation or breach of any
provision of any Applicable Law, (iii) assuming compliance with the matters
referred to in Section 4.03, require any consent or other action by any Person
under, constitute a default, or an event that, with or without notice or lapse
of time or both, would constitute a default, under, or cause or permit the
termination, cancellation, acceleration or other change of any right or
obligation or the loss of any benefit to which the Company is entitled under
any provision of any agreement or other instrument binding upon the Company or
any license, franchise, permit, certificate, approval or other similar
authorization affecting, or relating in any way to, the assets or business of
the Company or (iv) result in the creation or imposition of any Lien on any
asset of the Company, with only such exceptions, in the case of each of
clauses (ii) through (iv), as would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

SECTION 4.05 _. Capitalization._ (a) The authorized capital stock of the
Company consists of 120,000,000 Shares and 10,000,000 shares of preferred
stock, $0.001 par value per share. As of May 24, 2013, there were outstanding
(i) 24,414,171 Shares (of which an aggregate of 376,258 Shares were Restricted
Shares), (ii) no shares of preferred stock, (iii) Company Stock Options to
purchase an aggregate of 1,179,890 Shares (of which options to purchase an
aggregate of 548,372 Shares were exercisable) and (iv) Company Warrants to

stock of the Company have been, and all shares that may be issued pursuant to
any Company Security will be, when issued in accordance with the respective
terms thereof, duly authorized and validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable and free of preemptive rights. Section 4.05 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule contains a complete and correct list, as of May 24, 2013,
of each outstanding Company Stock Option and Company Warrant, including the
holder, date of grant, exercise price, vesting schedule and number of Shares
subject thereto. The exercise price of each Company Stock Option is not less
than the fair market value of a Share on the date of grant of such Company
Stock Option.

 



 

(b) There are no outstanding bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness of
the Company having the right to vote (or convertible into, or exchangeable
for, securities having the right to vote) on any matters on which stockholders
of the Company may vote. Except as set forth in this Section 4.05 and for
changes since May 24, 2013 resulting from the exercise of Company Stock
Options or Company Warrants outstanding on such date, there are no issued,
reserved for issuance or outstanding (i) shares of capital stock or other
voting securities of or ownership interests in the Company, (ii) securities of
the

 



      
 

 



 

Company convertible into or exchangeable for shares of capital stock or other
voting securities of or ownership interests in the Company, (iii) warrants,
calls, options or other rights to acquire from the Company, or other
obligation of the Company to issue, any capital stock or other voting
securities or ownership interests in or any securities convertible into or
exchangeable or exercisable for capital stock or other voting securities or
ownership interests in the Company or (iv) restricted shares, stock
appreciation rights, performance units, contingent value rights, "phantom"
stock or similar securities or rights that are derivative of, or provide
economic benefits based, directly or indirectly, on the value or price of, any
capital stock or voting securities of the Company (the items in clauses (i)
through (iv) being referred to collectively as the " **Company Securities**
"). There are no outstanding obligations of the Company to repurchase, redeem
or otherwise acquire any of the Company Securities. The Company is not a party
to any voting agreement with respect to the voting of any Company Securities.

 



 

SECTION 4.06 _. Subsidiaries_. The Company (i) does not own any capital stock
of, or any equity interest of any nature in, any other Person, and (ii) is not
a participant in any joint venture, partnership or similar arrangement.

 



 

SECTION 4.07 _. SEC Filings and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. _(a) The Company has
filed with or furnished to the SEC all reports, schedules, forms, statements,
prospectuses, registration statements and other documents required to be filed
or furnished by the Company (collectively, together with any exhibits and
schedules thereto and other information incorporated therein, the " **Company
SEC Documents** "). The Company has made available to Parent true and complete
copies of all material correspondence between the SEC and the Company,
including all comment letters from the staff of the SEC relating to the
Company SEC Documents containing unresolved comments and all written responses
of the Company thereto. To the knowledge of the Company, as of the date
hereof, no Company SEC Document is the subject of ongoing review, comment or
investigation by the SEC.

 



 

(b) As of its filing date (and as of the date of any amendment), each Company
SEC Document complied, and each Company SEC Document filed subsequent to the
date hereof (including the Company Proxy Statement) will comply, as to form in
all material respects with the applicable requirements of Nasdaq, the 1933
Act, the 1934 Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as the case may be.

 



 

(c) As of its filing date (or, if amended or superseded by a filing prior to
the date hereof, on the date of such filing), each Company SEC Document filed
pursuant to the 1934 Act did not, and each Company SEC Document filed
subsequent to the date hereof (including the Company Proxy Statement) will
not, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in the
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) Each Company SEC Document that is a registration statement, as amended or
supplemented, if applicable, filed pursuant to the 1933 Act, as of the date
such registration statement or amendment became effective, did not contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading.

 



 

(e) The Company has established and maintains disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15 under the 1934 Act). Such disclosure
controls and procedures are designed to ensure that material information
relating to the Company is made known to the Companys principal executive
officer and its principal financial officer by others within the Company,
particularly during the periods in which the periodic reports required under
the 1934 Act are being prepared. Such disclosure controls and procedures are
effective in timely alerting the Companys principal executive officer and
principal financial officer to material information required to be included in
the Companys periodic and current reports required under the 1934 Act. For
purposes of this Agreement, "principal executive officer" and "principal
financial officer" shall have the meanings given to such terms in the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

 



 

(f) The Company has established and maintains a system of internal controls
over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15 under the 1934 Act)
sufficient to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of the
Companys financial reporting and the preparation of Company financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. The Company has
disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation of internal controls prior to
the date hereof, to the Companys auditors and audit committee (i) any
significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of
internal controls which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the
Companys ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
information and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management or other employees who have a significant role in internal
controls. The Company has made available to Parent a summary of any such

Parent) is provided or made available to Parent, as the case may be, prior to
or substantially concurrently with the time it is provided or made available
to such Third Party; and

 



 

(ii) subject to compliance with Section 6.04(d), the Board of Directors may
make an Adverse Recommendation Change based on any fact, event, change in
circumstance, development or combination thereof that was not known by, or the
consequence of which was not reasonably foreseeable to, the Board of Directors
on or prior to the date hereof;

 



 

in each case referred to in the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) only if the
Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with outside
legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with
its fiduciary duties under Delaware Law.

 



 

In addition, nothing contained herein shall prevent the Board of Directors or
the Company from complying with Rule 14d-9 or 14e-2(a) under the 1934 Act with
regard to an Acquisition Proposal so long as any action taken or statement
made to so comply is consistent with this Section 6.04 or making any other
disclosure is required by Applicable Law; _provided_ that any such action
taken or statement made that relates to an Acquisition Proposal shall be
deemed to be an Adverse Recommendation Change unless the Board of Directors
reaffirms the Company Board Recommendation in such statement or in connection
with such action. It is understood and agreed that any factually accurate
public statement by the Company that merely describes the Companys receipt of
an Acquisition Proposal and the operation of this Agreement with respect
thereto and contains a "stop, look and listen" communication (including
pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act) shall not be
deemed to be an Adverse Recommendation Change.

 



 

(c) _Required Notices_. The Board of Directors shall not take any of the
actions referred to in Section 6.04(b)(i) unless the Company shall have
delivered to Parent a prior written notice advising Parent that it intends to
take such action, and, after taking such action, the Company shall continue to
advise Parent as

 



       
 

 



 

promptly as practicable of any material changes in the status or terms of any
discussions and negotiations with the Third Party. In addition, the Company
shall notify Parent promptly (but in no event later than 24 hours) after
receipt by the Company (or, to the knowledge of the Company, any of its
Representatives) of a _bona fide_ Acquisition Proposal, a notice that a Third
Party is considering making an Acquisition Proposal or any request for
information relating to the Company or for access to the business, properties,
assets, books or records of the Company by any Third Party that has made or is
seeking (to the knowledge of the Company) to make an Acquisition Proposal. The
Company shall provide such notice in writing and shall identify the Third
Party making, and the material terms and conditions of, any such Acquisition
Proposal, indication or request and, after taking such action, the Company
shall continue to advise Parent as promptly as practicable of any material
changes in the status or terms of any such Acquisition Proposal, indication or
request. Any material amendment to any Acquisition Proposal will be deemed to
be a new Acquisition Proposal for purposes of the Companys compliance with
this Section 6.04(c).

 



 

(d) " _Last Look_ ". Further, the Board of Directors shall not make an Adverse
Recommendation Change pursuant to Section 6.04(b)(ii) (or terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 10.01(d)(i)), unless (i) if such Adverse
Recommendation Change is to be taken in circumstances involving or relating to
an Acquisition Proposal, such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior
Proposal, (ii) the Company provides written notice to Parent at least four
days before taking such action of its intention to do so and containing (A) in
the case of any action intended to be taken in circumstances involving or
relating to an Acquisition Proposal, the material terms of such Acquisition
Proposal, including the most current version of the proposed agreement under
which such Acquisition Proposal is proposed to be consummated and the identity
of the Third Party making the Acquisition Proposal or (B) in the case of any
action intended to be taken in circumstances not involving or relating to an
Acquisition Proposal, a reasonably detailed description of the underlying
facts giving rise to, and the reasons for taking, such action and (iii) Parent
does not make, within four days after its receipt of that written
notification, an offer that (1) in the case of any action intended to be taken
in circumstances involving or relating to an Acquisition Proposal, is at least
as favorable to the stockholders of the Company as such Acquisition Proposal
(it being understood and agreed that any amendment to the financial terms or
other material terms of such Acquisition Proposal shall require a new written
notification from the Company and a new four-day period under this Section
6.04(d)) or (2) in the case of any action intended to be taken in
circumstances not involving or relating to an Acquisition Proposal, after
receipt of such offer, the Board of Directors does not determine in good
faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to take
such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Delaware
Law. The Company agrees that, during any applicable four-day period referred
to in this Section 6.04(d), the Company and its Representatives shall
negotiate in good faith with

 



      
 

 



 

Parent and its Representatives regarding any revisions proposed by Parent to
the terms of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

(e) _Definition of Superior Proposal_. For purposes of this Agreement, "
**Superior Proposal** " means a _bona fide_ written Acquisition Proposal not
solicited in contravention of this Section 6.04 (with all percentages in the
definition of "Acquisition Proposal" changed to 50%) on terms that the Board
of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with an outside
financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation and outside legal
counsel and taking into account all the terms and conditions of the
Acquisition Proposal, including any break-up fees, expense reimbursement
provisions and conditions to consummation, are more favorable from a financial
point of view to the Companys stockholders than as provided hereunder (taking
into account any proposal by Parent to amend the terms of this Agreement
pursuant to Section 6.04(d)), which the Board of Directors determines is
reasonably capable of being consummated.

 



 

(f) _Obligation of the Company to Terminate Existing Discussions_. The Company
shall, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its Representatives
to, cease immediately and cause to be terminated any and all existing
activities, discussions or negotiations, if any, with any Third Party and its
Representatives conducted prior to the date hereof with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause any
such Third Party (and its representatives) that has executed a confidentiality
agreement within the 24-month period prior to the date hereof and that is in
possession of confidential information heretofore furnished by or on behalf of
the Company (and all analyses and other materials prepared by or on behalf of
such Person that contains, reflects or analyzes that information) to return or
destroy all such information as promptly as practicable.

 



 

SECTION 6.05 _. Section 16 Matters. _Prior to the Company Stockholder Meeting,
the Company shall take all such steps as may be necessary or appropriate to
cause any dispositions of Shares (including derivative securities with respect
to such Shares) resulting from the consummation of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each director (including any
directors by deputization) or officer of the Company to be exempt under Rule
16b-3 promulgated under the 1934 Act, including any such actions specified in
the letter set forth in Section 6.05 of the Company Disclosure Schedule.
Based on the information provided by the Company to Parent, Parent
acknowledges and agrees that the Persons designated by the Company as
directors by deputization are directors of the Company for the purposes of
Section 16 of the 1934 Act.

 



 

SECTION 6.06 _. Stock Exchange Delisting; 1934 Act Deregistration. _ Prior to
the Effective Time, the Company shall cooperate with Parent and use its
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do or
cause to be done all things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its
part under

 



      
 

 



 

Applicable Law and rules and policies of Nasdaq to enable the delisting by the
Surviving Corporation of the Shares from Nasdaq and the deregistration of the
Shares under the 1934 Act as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time,
and in any event no more than ten days after the Closing Date.

 



 

SECTION 6.07 _. Takeover Statutes. _The Company shall, to the extent permitted
by Applicable Law, use its reasonable best efforts (a) to take all actions
necessary so that no "control share acquisition," "fair price," "moratorium"
or other antitakeover or similar statute or regulation becomes applicable to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (b) if any such
antitakeover or similar statute or regulation becomes applicable to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, to take all actions necessary so
that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated herein and otherwise to take
all such other actions as are reasonably necessary to eliminate or minimize
the effects of any such statute or regulation on the transactions contemplated
hereby.

COVENANTS OF PARENT

 



 

Parent agrees that:

 



 

SECTION 7.01 _. Obligations of Merger Subsidiary. _Parent shall take all
action necessary to cause Merger Subsidiary to perform its obligations under
this Agreement and to consummate the Merger on the terms and conditions set

make any investments other than in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

SECTION 7.02 _. Voting of Shares. _Parent shall vote (or cause to be voted)
all Shares beneficially owned by it or any of its Subsidiaries in favor of
adoption of this Agreement at the Company Stockholder Meeting.

 



 

SECTION 7.03 _. Director and Officer Liability._

 



 

(a) Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, and the
Surviving Corporation hereby agrees to, do the following:

 



 

(i) For six years after the Effective Time, indemnify and hold harmless the
present and former officers and directors of the Company (each, an "
**Indemnified Person** ") against any Costs incurred in connection with any
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, of whatever nature, in
respect of, arising out of or related to such Indemnified Persons service as
a director or officer of the Company in respect of acts or omissions occurring
at or prior to the Effective Time (including, for the

 



      
 

 



 

avoidance of doubt, in connection with the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby), whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware Law or any other
Applicable Law or provided under the Companys certificate of incorporation
and bylaws in effect on the date hereof; _provided_ that such indemnification
shall be subject to any limitation imposed from time to time under Applicable
Law;

 



 

(ii) For six years after the Effective Time, cause to be maintained in effect
provisions in the Surviving Corporations certificate of incorporation and
bylaws (or in such documents of any successor to the business of the Surviving
Corporation) regarding elimination of liability and indemnification of, and
advancement of expenses to, Indemnified Persons that are no less advantageous
to the intended beneficiaries than the corresponding provisions in existence
on the date of this Agreement (it being understood that if any claim is
asserted against any individual entitled to the protections of such provisions
within such six-year period, such provisions shall not be modified until the
final disposition of such claims); and

 



 

(iii) If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns
(A) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger,
(B) ceases to continue to exist for any reason or (C) transfers or conveys all
or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, to the extent necessary, ensure that the successors and
assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall
assume the obligations set forth in this Section 7.03.

 



 

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall, in consultation with
Parent, purchase a six-year extended reporting period endorsement with respect
to the Companys directors and officers insurance policies and fiduciary
liability insurance policies (collectively, " **D andO Insurance**") in place as
of the date hereof with respect to any claim related to any period of time at
or prior to the Effective Time (including in connection with this Agreement or
the transactions and actions contemplated hereby) with terms, conditions,
retentions and limits of liability that are at least as favorable as those
contained in the Companys DandO Insurance policies in effect as of the date
hereof; _provided_ that in no event shall the annual cost of such endorsement
exceed 250% of the Companys current annualized premium, which amount is set
forth in Section 7.03 of the Company Disclosure Schedule; and _provided_ ,
_further_ , that if the aggregate premiums of such insurance coverage exceed
such amount, the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain a policy
with the greatest coverage available, with respect to matters occurring prior
to the Effective Time, for a cost not exceeding such amount.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) The rights of each Indemnified Person under this Section 7.03 shall be in
addition to any other rights such Indemnified Person may have under the
certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Company, Delaware Law or any
other Applicable Law, any agreement of any Indemnified Person with the Company
or otherwise and are intended for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by,
such Indemnified Person and such Indemnified Persons heirs, executors or
similar representatives. The rights under this Section 7.03 shall survive
consummation of the Merger and shall not be amended in a manner that is
adverse to the Indemnified Persons without the consent of the Indemnified
Persons affected thereby.

 



 

SECTION 7.04. _Employee Matters_. (a) For a period of one year following the
Effective Time (or, if shorter, during the period of employment), Parent shall
provide to each employee of the Company as of the Effective Time who continues
employment with the Surviving Corporation or any of its Affiliates ("
**Continuing Employees** ") (i) base salary or base wages and cash target
bonus opportunity no less than the base salary or base wages and cash target
bonus opportunity provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to
the Effective Time and (ii) benefits that are comparable in the aggregate to
the benefits provided to similarly situated employees of AstraZeneca
Pharmaceuticals LP, an Affiliate of Parent, from time to time, subject to
applicable eligibility requirements.

 



 

(b) Following the Effective Time, Parent will, subject to Applicable Law, give
each Continuing Employee full credit for prior service with the Company for
purposes of vesting and eligibility to participate in all employee benefit
plans maintained by Parent or its Affiliates for which the Continuing Employee
is otherwise eligible to participate, and for purposes of determining the
amount of the company contribution under the AstraZeneca Retirement Plan
(AZRP) and the amount of the Continuing Employees accrued vacation, other
leave and severance benefits (but such service credit shall not be provided
for purposes of determining the benefit accrued under any plan or policy other
than vacation, leave, and severance); _provided_ that service of a Continuing
Employee prior to the Effective Time shall not be recognized for the purpose
of any entitlement to participate in, or receive benefits with respect to, any
retiree medical programs or other retiree welfare benefit programs maintained
by Parent or its Affiliates in which any Continuing Employee participates
after the Effective Time. In no event shall anything contained in this Section
7.04(b) result in any duplication of benefits for the same period of service.
In addition, Parent shall (A) waive, or cause to be waived, any limitations on
benefits relating to pre-existing conditions to the same extent such
limitations are waived under any comparable plan of the Company applicable to
such Continuing Employee prior to the Effective Time and (B) recognize, for
purposes of annual deductible and out-of-pocket limits under its medical and
dental plans, deductible and out-of-pocket expenses paid by Continuing
Employees in the calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall adopt all resolutions that
may be necessary to cause the Employee Plans set forth in Section 7.04(c) of
the Company Disclosure Schedule to terminate as of the date immediately
preceding the Closing Date. All resolutions, notices or other documents
issued, adopted or executed in connection with the implementation of this
Section 7.04(c) shall be subject to Parents prior review and approval, which
shall not be unreasonably withheld. For the avoidance of doubt, Parent shall
be responsible for implementing the plan termination (for example, liquidating
and distributing all assets remaining in the terminated plan after the
Effective Time).

 



 

(d) If, after the Effective Time and before the first anniversary of the
Effective Time, the employment of a Continuing Employee who is not a party to
an employment agreement that provides for severance benefits terminates, such
terminated Continuing Employee shall be eligible to receive severance benefits
pursuant to the terms and conditions of the AZ Separation Plan (including
satisfaction of the conditions for payment of severance under such plan). If
the employment of a Continuing Employee who is a party to an employment
agreement that provides for severance benefits terminates, such terminated
Continuing Employees right to severance benefits shall be as set forth in his
or her employment agreement.

 



 

(e) Subject to the obligations of Parent and its Affiliates under this Section
7.04, (i) neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates shall be obligated to
continue to employ any Continuing Employee for any period of time following
the Effective Time, (ii) Parent or its Affiliates may revise, amend or
terminate any Employee Plan or any other employee benefit plan, program or
policy in effect from time to time, (iii) nothing in this Agreement shall be
construed as an amendment of any Employee Plan, and (iv) no provision of this
Section 7.04 shall create any third-party beneficiary rights in any Service
Provider or former Service Provider (including any beneficiary or dependent of
such Service Provider or former Service Provider) in respect of continued
employment (or resumed employment) or any other matter.

Applicable Law.

restriction of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or
other Governmental Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the
remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be
affected, impaired or invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance
of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner
materially adverse to any party. Upon such a determination, the parties shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner
in order that the transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as

CONTINGENT VALUE RIGHTS

 



 

Section 2.01. _Holders of CVRs; Appointment of Rights Agent._

 



 

(a) As provided in the Merger Agreement, each Holder shall be entitled to one
CVR for each Share outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that is
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to the
Merger Agreement.

 



       
 

 



 

(b) Parent hereby appoints the Rights Agent to act as rights agent for Parent
in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, and
the Rights Agent hereby accepts such appointment.

 



 

Section 2.02. _Nontransferable._

 



 

CVRs may not be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged, encumbered or
transferred or disposed of in any other manner, in whole or in part, other
than pursuant to a Permitted Transfer.

 



 

Section 2.03. _No Certificate; Registration; Registration of Transfer; Change
of Address._

 



 

(a) CVRs shall not be evidenced by a certificate or other instrument.

 



 

(b) The Rights Agent shall keep a register (the " **CVR Register** ") for the
purposes of (i) identifying the Holders of CVRs and (ii) registering CVRs and
Permitted Transfers thereof.

 



 

(c) Subject to the restriction on transferability set forth in Section 2.02,
every request made to transfer a CVR must be in writing and accompanied by a
written instrument of transfer and other requested documentation in form
reasonably satisfactory to the Rights Agent, duly executed by the registered
Holder or Holders thereof, or by the duly appointed legal representative,
personal representative or survivor of such Holder or Holders, setting forth
in reasonable detail the circumstances relating to the transfer. Upon receipt
of such written notice, the Rights Agent shall, subject to its reasonable
determination that the transfer instrument is in proper form and the transfer
otherwise complies with the other terms and conditions of this Agreement,
register the transfer of the applicable CVRs in the CVR Register. All duly
transferred CVRs registered in the CVR Register shall be the valid obligations
of Parent, evidencing the same right, and entitling the transferee to the same
benefits and rights under this Agreement, as those held by the transferor. No
transfer of a CVR shall be valid until registered in the CVR Register, and any
transfer not duly registered in the CVR Register will be void _ab initio_. Any
transfer or assignment of CVRs shall be without charge (other than the cost of
any transfer tax) to the applicable Holder.

 



 

(d) A Holder may make a written request to the Rights Agent to change such
Holders address of record in the CVR Register. Such written request must be
duly executed by such Holder. Upon receipt of such written notice, the Rights
Agent shall promptly record the change of address in the CVR Register.

 



 

Section 2.04. _Payment Procedures._

 



 

(a) If (x) the Milestone #1 Regulatory Approval is attained at any time during
the First Milestone Period and (y) the Milestone # 1 Determination is received
on or before September 30, 2014, then on a date (the " **First Milestone
Payment Date** ") that is within 15 Business Days following the later of (x)
and (y), Parent shall deliver to the Rights Agent (i) a certificate (the "
**Milestone #1 Achievement Certificate** ") certifying

 



      
 

 



 

the date of the satisfaction of Milestone #1 and that the Holders are entitled
to receive the First Milestone Payment and (ii) cash in the aggregate amount
of the First Milestone Payment payable to the Holders.

 



 

(b) If (x) the Milestone #1 Regulatory Approval is not attained at any time
during the First Milestone Period or (y) the Milestone # 1 Determination is
not received on or before September 30, 2014 (or, if earlier, the FDA finally
determines not to grant a New Chemical Entity (NCE) exclusivity determination,
as defined in 21 CFR 314.108(b), of five years of exclusivity, with respect to
Epanova), then on or before the date that is 15 Business Days after the later
of (x) and (y), Parent shall deliver to the Rights Agent a certificate (the "
**Milestone #1 Non-Achievement Certificate** ") certifying that Milestone #1
has not occurred and that Parent has complied in all material respects with
its obligations under this Agreement.

 



 

(c) If Milestone #2 is attained at any time during the Second Milestone
Period, then on a date (the " **Second Milestone Payment Date** ") that is
within 15 Business Days following such event, Parent shall deliver to the
Rights Agent (i) a certificate (the " **Milestone #2 Achievement Certificate**
") certifying the date of the satisfaction of Milestone #2 and that the
Holders are entitled to receive the Second Milestone Payment and (ii) cash in
the aggregate amount of the Second Milestone Payment payable to the Holders.

 



 

(d) If Milestone #2 is not attained at any time during the Second Milestone
Period, then on or before the date that is 15 Business Days after the last day
of the Second Milestone Period, Parent shall deliver to the Rights Agent a
certificate (the " **Milestone #2 Non-Achievement Certificate** ") certifying
that Milestone #2 has not occurred and that Parent has complied in all
material respects with its obligations under this Agreement.

 



 

(e) If Milestone #3 is attained at any time during the Third Milestone Period,
then on a date (the " **Third Milestone Payment Date** ") that is within 30
days following such event, Parent shall deliver to the Rights Agent (i) a
certificate (the " **Milestone #3 Achievement Certificate** ") certifying the
date of the satisfaction of Milestone #3 and that the Holders are entitled to
receive the Third Milestone Payment and (ii) cash in the aggregate amount of
the Third Milestone Payment payable to the Holders.

 



 

(f) If Milestone #3 is not attained at any time during the Third Milestone
Period, then on or before the date that is 30 days after the last day of the
Third Milestone Period, Parent shall deliver to the Rights Agent a certificate
(the " **Milestone #3 Non-Achievement Certificate** ") certifying that
Milestone #3 has not occurred and that Parent has complied in all material
respects with its obligations under this Agreement. The Milestone #3 Non-
Achievement Certificate shall include the Net Sales Statement with respect to
the four consecutive calendar quarters ending at the end of the Third
Milestone Period.

 



 

(g) The Rights Agent shall promptly, and in no event later than 10 Business
Days after receipt, send each Holder at its address set forth in the CVR
Register a copy of

 



      
 

 



 

any certificate delivered by Parent pursuant to this Section 2.04. If in such
certificate Parent certifies that a Milestone Payment is payable to the
Holders, then, at the time the Rights Agent sends a copy of such certificate
to the Holders, the Rights Agent shall also pay the applicable Milestone
Payment to each of the Holders (the amount which each Holder is entitled to
receive, subject to Section 2.04(i), will be based on the applicable Milestone
Payment multiplied by the number of CVRs held by such Holder at the time of
such payment as reflected on the CVR Register) by check mailed to the address
of each Holder as set forth in the CVR Register as of the close of business on
the first Business Day prior to the applicable Milestone Payment Date.

 



 

(h) If the Rights Agent does not receive from the Acting Holders a written
objection to a Milestone Non-Achievement Certificate (including, in the case
of the Milestone #3 Non-Achievement Certificate, the timely delivery of a
Dispute Notice with respect to the final Net Sales Statement in accordance
with Section 4.04(b)(ii)) within 90 days of delivery by the Rights Agent of
such Milestone Non-Achievement Certificate to the Holders in accordance with
Section 2.04(g), the Holders shall be deemed to have accepted such Milestone
Non-Achievement Certificate and Parent and its Affiliates shall have no
further obligation with respect to the applicable Milestone Payment.

 



 

(i) Except to the extent any portion of any Milestone Payment is required to
be treated as imputed interest pursuant to Applicable Law, the Holders and the
parties hereto agree to treat the CVRs and all Milestone Payments for all Tax
purposes as additional consideration for the Shares, Restricted Shares and
Company Warrants pursuant to the Merger Agreement, and none of the Holders and
the parties hereto will take any position to the contrary on any Tax Return or
for other Tax purposes except as required by Applicable Law. The Company shall
report imputed interest on the CVRs pursuant to Section 483 of the Code.

 



 

(j) Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause to be deducted
and withheld, from each Milestone Payment otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement, such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect
to the making of such payment under any provision of Applicable Law relating
to Taxes. To the extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the Holder in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made. Prior to making any such tax withholdings or causing any such tax
withholdings to be made with respect to any Holder, the Rights Agent shall, to
the extent practicable, provide notice to the Holder of such potential
withholding and a reasonable opportunity for the Holder to provide any
necessary tax forms (including an IRS Form W-9 or an applicable IRS Form W-8)
in order to avoid or reduce such withholding amounts; _provided_ that the time
period for payment of a Milestone Payment by the Rights Agent set forth in
Section 2.04(g) shall be extended by a period equal to any delay caused by the
Holder providing such forms.

 



 

(k) Any portion of a Milestone Payment that remains undistributed to the
Holders six months after the applicable Milestone Payment Date shall be
delivered by the Rights Agent to Parent, upon demand, and any Holder shall
thereafter look only to Parent for payment of such Milestone Payment.

 



      
 

 



 

(l) If any Milestone Payment (or portion thereof) remains unclaimed by a
Holder two years after the applicable Milestone Payment Date (or immediately
prior to such earlier date on which such Milestone Payment would otherwise
escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Authority), any such
Milestone Payment (or portion thereof) shall, to the extent permitted by
Applicable Law, become the property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or
interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. Neither Parent nor the
Rights Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of a Milestone Payment
delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar legal requirement under Applicable Law.

 



 

Section 2.05. _No Voting, Dividends or Interest; No Equity or Ownership
Interest in Parent._

 



 

(a) CVRs shall not have any voting or dividend rights, and interest shall not
accrue on any amounts payable in respect of CVRs.

 



 

(b) CVRs shall not represent any equity or ownership interest in Parent, any
constituent company to the Merger or any of their respective Affiliates.

 



 

Section 2.06. _Ability to Abandon CVR._

 



 

A Holder may at any time, at such Holders option, abandon all of such
Holders remaining rights in a CVR by transferring such CVR to Parent without
consideration therefor. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to prohibit
Parent from offering to acquire CVRs for consideration in its sole discretion.

 



 

ARTICLE 3 
THE RIGHTS AGENT

 



 

Section 3.01. _Certain Duties and Responsibilities._

 



 

(a) The Rights Agent shall not have any liability for any actions taken or not
taken in connection with this Agreement, except to the extent such liability
arises as a result of the willful misconduct, bad faith or gross negligence of
the Rights Agent.

 



 

(b) The Acting Holders may direct the Rights Agent to act on behalf of the
Holders in enforcing any of their rights hereunder. The Rights Agent shall be

furnish the Rights Agent with reasonable security and indemnity for any costs
and expenses that may be incurred. All rights of action under this Agreement
may be enforced by the Rights Agent, any action, suit or proceeding instituted
by the Rights Agent shall be brought in its name as the Rights Agent and any
recovery in connection therewith shall be for the proportionate benefit of all
the Holders, as their respective rights or interests may appear.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 3.02. _Certain Rights of Rights Agent._

from acting upon any resolution, certificate, statement, instrument, opinion,
report, notice, request, direction, consent, order or other paper or document

presented by the proper party or parties.

 



 

(c) Whenever the Rights Agent shall deem it desirable that a matter be proved

misconduct on its part, rely upon an Officers Certificate.

 



 

(d) The Rights Agent may engage and consult with counsel of its selection and
the written advice or opinion of such counsel shall be full and complete

omitted by it hereunder in good faith and in reliance thereon.

connection with Rights Agents performance of its obligations under this
Agreement, including the reasonable costs and expenses of defending the Rights
Agent against any claims, charges, demands, actions or suits arising out of or
in connection with such performance, except to the extent such Loss shall have
been determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from the
Rights Agents gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct. Parents
obligations under this Section 3.02(g) to indemnify the Rights Agent shall
survive the resignation or removal of any Rights Agent and the termination of
this Agreement.

 



 

(h) In addition to the indemnification provided under Section 3.02(g), Parent
agrees (i) to pay the fees of the Rights Agent in connection with the Rights
Agents performance of its obligations hereunder, as agreed upon in writing by
the Rights Agent and Parent on or prior to the date of this Agreement, and
(ii) to reimburse the Rights Agent promptly upon demand for all reasonable and
documented out-of-pocket expenses, including all Taxes (other than income,
receipt, franchise or similar Taxes) and governmental charges, incurred by the
Rights Agent in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 3.03. _Resignation and Removal; Appointment of Successor._

 



 

(a) The Rights Agent may resign at any time by giving written notice thereof
to Parent and the Holders specifying a date when such resignation shall take
effect, which notice shall be sent at least 60 days prior to the date so
specified (or, if earlier, the appointment of the successor Rights Agent).

 



 

(b) Parent shall have the right to remove the Rights Agent at any time by a
Board Resolution specifying a date when such removal shall take effect. Notice
of such removal shall be given by Parent to the Rights Agent, which notice
shall be sent at least 60 days prior to the date so specified (or, if earlier,

(c) If the Rights Agent shall resign, be removed or become incapable of

Agent and each appointment of a successor Rights Agent by mailing written
notice of such event by first-class mail, postage prepaid, to the Holders as
their names and addresses appear in the CVR Register. Each notice shall
include the name and address of the successor Rights Agent. If Parent fails to
send such notice within 10 Business Days after acceptance of appointment by a
successor Rights Agent, the successor Rights Agent shall cause the notice to
be mailed at the expense of Parent.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 3.03, unless
consented to in writing by the Acting Holders, Parent shall not appoint as a
successor Rights Agent any Person that is not a stock transfer agent of

act, deed or conveyance, shall become vested with all the rights, powers,
trusts and duties of the Rights Agent; provided that upon the request of
Parent or the successor Rights Agent, such resigning or removed Rights Agent
shall execute and deliver an instrument transferring to such successor Rights
Agent all the rights, powers and trusts of such resigning or removed Rights
Agent.

 



      
 

 



 

ARTICLE 4 
COVENANTS

 



 

Section 4.01. _List of Holders._

Section 4.03. _Efforts._

 



 

(a) Unless this Agreement shall have earlier been terminated as provided
herein, until the end of the applicable Milestone Period, Parent shall, shall
cause its Affiliates to and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
cause its and their licensees (in the case of such Affiliates and licensees,
only to the extent such Persons are engaged in the development,
commercialization, manufacture, marketing, distribution or selling of Epanova
and/or the Rosuva FDC) to use their respective commercially reasonable efforts
consistent with those used by Persons in the pharmaceutical industry similar
in size to, and with similar resources as, AZ Parent (or, with respect to any
such licensee, Persons in the pharmaceutical industry similar in size to, and
with similar resources as, such licensee) and the general practices and
standards in the pharmaceutical industry, in each case, relating to the
development, commercialization, manufacture, marketing, distribution and
selling of similar products with similar economic potential, taking into
account all relevant factors including, as applicable, stage of development or
product life, mechanism of action, efficacy and safety relative to competitive
products in the marketplace, anticipated development cost (not including any
payments required to be made under this Agreement), material changes in
expected timelines, the anticipated prescription label, the nature of the
product, actual or anticipated regulatory approval process (not including the
cost and likelihood of obtaining any such regulatory approval), patient needs,
the nature and extent of market exclusivity (including patent coverage and
regulatory exclusivity), the clinical setting in which it is expected to be
used, competitiveness of the marketplace, other product candidates, competing
products, actual or projected profitability, payer reimbursement and other
conditions then prevailing from time to time, to achieve the Milestones. The
Holders acknowledge that (i) any determination by Parent to develop the Rosuva
FDC with rosuvastatin calcium shall not, in and of itself, constitute a
violation or breach of its obligations under this Section 4.03(a) and (ii)
Parent may otherwise engage in such development in accordance with its
obligations under this Section 4.03(a).

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Except as otherwise provided in Section 4.03(a), Parent and its Affiliates
shall have the right, in their sole and absolute discretion, to direct and
control the development, commercialization, manufacture, marketing,
distribution and selling of Epanova and the Rosuva FDC in all respects,
including the right to determine whether to test, develop or pursue, market,
make any regulatory filings or seek any regulatory approvals with respect to,
make any strategic product portfolio decisions affecting, or otherwise
advance, Epanova and the Rosuva FDC.

 



 

Section 4.04. _Net Sales Statement._

 



 

(a) _Delivery of Net Sales Statements_. On or before the date that is 30 days
after the last day of the first full calendar quarter following the occurrence
of both (i) the achievement of the Milestone #3 Regulatory Approvals and (ii)
the first commercial sale of Epanova or the Rosuva FDC by a Selling Entity,
Parent shall cause to be delivered to the Rights Agent (who shall promptly,
and in any event within five Business Days of receipt, deliver to each Holder
at the applicable address set forth in the CVR Register) (A) notice of the
occurrence of the first commercial sale of Epanova or the Rosuva FDC, as
applicable, and (B) a Net Sales Statement. Thereafter, on or before the date
that is 30 days after the last day of each subsequent calendar quarter, Parent
shall cause a Net Sales Statement to be delivered solely to the Rights Agent.
Upon the written request of any Holder, the Rights Agent shall promptly, and
in no event later than 10 Business Days after such request, send such Holder
at its address set forth in the CVR Register a copy of any Net Sales Statement
delivered by Parent to the Rights Agent pursuant to this Section 4.04(a).

 



 

(b) _Audit Rights and Dispute Resolution_.

 



 

(i) From and after the delivery of the first Net Sales Statement (and no more
than once during any period of four consecutive calendar quarters, except in
connection with the final Net Sales Statement), upon reasonable advance
written notice from the Acting Holders, Parent shall permit the Acting Holders
(and, if applicable, the Independent Accountant) to have access at reasonable
times during normal business hours to the books and records of Parent and its
Affiliates as may be reasonably necessary to evaluate and verify the accuracy
of the Net Sales calculations set forth in the most recently delivered Net
Sales Statement and the figures underlying such calculations to the extent
such Net Sales calculations (i) have not become conclusive and binding on the
Rights Agent and the Holders in accordance with Section 4.04(b)(ii) and (ii)
have not been previously audited by the Independent Accountant in accordance
with this Section 4.04(b); _provided_ that (x) the Acting Holders (and, if
applicable, the Independent Accountant) enter into customary confidentiality
agreements reasonably satisfactory to Parent with respect to the confidential
information of Parent or its Affiliates to be furnished pursuant to this
Section 4.04(b) and (y) such access does not unreasonably interfere with the
conduct of the business of Parent or any of its Affiliates.

 



 

(ii) In the event the Acting Holders dispute any calculation of Net Sales in
the most recently delivered Net Sales Statement, within 90 days after delivery
by Parent to the Rights Agent of such Net Sales Statement in accordance with
Section

 



       
 

 



 

4.04(a), the Acting Holders shall provide Parent with written notice (a "
**Dispute Notice** ") of such dispute in reasonable detail, together with
supporting documentation (the items so disputed, the " **Disputed Items** ").
If the Acting Holders fail to deliver a Dispute Notice within such 90-day
period, the calculations set forth in the applicable Net Sales Statement shall
become conclusive and binding on the Rights Agent and the Holders. If the
Acting Holders deliver a Dispute Notice within such 90-day period, all
calculations and items set forth in the applicable Net Sales Statement other
than the Disputed Items shall become conclusive and binding on the Rights
Agent and the Holders. The initiation of a review by the Acting Holders as
contemplated by this Section 4.04(b) shall not relieve Parent of its
obligation to pay any Milestone Payment for which notice of achievement has
been given.

 



 

(iii) For ten Business Days following the delivery of a Dispute Notice, Parent
and the Acting Holders shall attempt in good faith to resolve the Disputed
Items. To the extent the parties fail to resolve such Disputed Items within
such ten-Business Day period, the parties shall submit the unresolved Disputed
Items to the Independent Accountant for final determination (it being
understood that the Acting Holders shall only be permitted to submit any
unresolved Disputed Items to the Independent Accountant one time per calendar
year). The Independent Accountant shall deliver to Parent and the Acting
Holders, as promptly as practicable (and in any event within 30 days), a
report setting forth the Independent Accountants determination with respect
to each of such Disputed Items; _provided_ that the Independent Accountants
determination with respect to each Disputed Item shall be no more favorable to
Parent than as reflected in the applicable Net Sales Statement and no more
