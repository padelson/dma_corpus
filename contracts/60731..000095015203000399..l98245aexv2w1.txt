Affiliates commenced voluntary cases for reorganization (the "BANKRUPTCY CASES")
under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. Sections 101-1330 (the

approved procedures for the sale of, among other things, the LTV Tubular
Business (the "ASSET SALE PROCEDURES"). The Asset Sale Procedures provide for
the sale of the LTV Tubular Business, either alone or along with other business
units of Sellers and their Affiliates, in any case subject to Buyer's assumption
of the Assumed Liabilities and otherwise on the terms and conditions set forth

      D. Buyer desires to purchase the Acquired Assets and assume the Assumed
Liabilities from Sellers, and Sellers desire to sell the Acquired Assets to
Buyer and to have Buyer assume the Assumed Liabilities, all in the manner and
subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and in
accordance with sections 105, 363 and 365 and other applicable provisions of the
Bankruptcy Code.

      E. The Acquired Assets and Assumed Liabilities are assets and liabilities
of Sellers, which are to be purchased and assumed by Buyer pursuant to an order
of the Bankruptcy Court approving such sale pursuant to sections 105, 363 and
365 of the Bankruptcy Code, which order will include the authorization for the
assumption by Sellers and assignment to Buyer of certain executory contracts and
unexpired leases and liabilities thereunder under section 365 of the Bankruptcy
Code, all in the manner and subject to the terms and conditions set forth in
this Agreement and in accordance with other applicable provisions of the
Bankruptcy Code.

                                  CONSIDERATION

      3.1 Consideration. The aggregate consideration for the sale and transfer

      3.3 Estimated Working Capital. At least two Business Days prior to the
Closing, Sellers shall deliver to Buyer a certificate setting forth Sellers'
good faith estimated calculation (the "ESTIMATED WORKING CAPITAL") of Closing
Working Capital, with appropriate supporting documentation. If Estimated Working
Capital exceeds the Reference Balance (defined below), the Purchase Price shall
be increased by an amount equal to such excess. If the Reference Balance exceeds
Estimated Working Capital, the Purchase Price shall be decreased by an amount
equal to such excess.

      3.4 Purchase Price Adjustment.

            (a) As promptly as practicable, but no later than 45 days after the
      Closing Date, Buyer shall cause to be prepared and delivered to Parent the
      Closing Statement (as defined below) and a certificate based on such
      Closing Statement setting forth Buyer's calculation of Closing Working
      Capital. The closing statement (the "CLOSING STATEMENT") shall fairly
      present the Net Working Capital of the LTV Tubular Business as of the end
      of business on the Closing Date ("CLOSING WORKING CAPITAL"). "NET WORKING
      CAPITAL" means the working capital items of the LTV Tubular Business in
      the categories shown on the Reference Balance Sheet, reduced by the
      current liabilities of the LTV Tubular Business in the line items shown on
      the Reference Balance Sheet, in each case as determined in accordance with
      GAAP as further defined by those accounting principles set forth on
      Schedule 3.4(a), consistently applied between March 31, 2002 and the
      Closing Date (GAAP as so further defined, the "AGREED PRINCIPLES"). The
      preparation of the Closing Statement shall be solely for the purpose of
      determining changes in Net Working Capital since March 31, 2002 (the
      "BALANCE SHEET DATE"), based upon transactions and events occurring
      between the Balance Sheet Date and the Closing Date.

            (b) If Parent disagrees with Buyer's calculation of Closing Working
      Capital delivered pursuant to Section 3.4(a) , Parent may, within 15 days
      after delivery of the documents referred to in Section 3.4(a), deliver a
      notice to Buyer disagreeing with such calculation and setting forth
      Parent's calculation of such amount. Any such notice of disagreement shall
      specify those items or amounts as to which Parent disagrees, and Parent
      shall be deemed to have agreed with all other items and amounts contained
      in the Closing Statement and the calculation of Closing Working Capital
      delivered pursuant to Section 3.4(a).

            (c) If a notice of disagreement shall be duly delivered pursuant to
      Section 3.4(b), Buyer and Parent shall, during the 15 days following such
      delivery, use their best efforts to reach agreement on the disputed items
      or amounts in order to determine, as may be required, the amount of
      Closing Working Capital, which amount shall not be less than the amount
      thereof shown in Buyer's calculation delivered pursuant to Section 3.4(a)
      nor more than the amount thereof shown in Parent's calculation delivered
      pursuant to Section 3.4(b). If during such period, Buyer and Parent are
      unable to reach such agreement, they shall promptly thereafter cause
      Deloitte & Touche LLP (the "ACCOUNTING REFEREE") to review this Agreement
      and the disputed items or amounts for the purpose of calculating Closing
      Working Capital. In making such calculation, the Accounting Referee shall
      consider only those items or amounts in the Closing Statement


                                       10
<PAGE>
      with which Parent has disagreed, and Parent's calculation of such amounts.
      The Accounting Referee shall deliver to Buyer and Parent, as promptly as
      practicable (but in any case no later than 30 days from the date of
      engagement of the Accounting Referee), a report setting forth such
      calculation. Such report shall be final and binding upon Buyer and
      Sellers. The cost of such review and report shall be borne equally by
      Buyer and Parent.

            (d) Buyer and Parent shall, and shall cause their respective
      representatives to, cooperate and assist in the preparation of the Closing
      Statement and the calculation of Closing Working Capital and in the
      conduct of the reviews referred to in this Section 3.4, including, without
      limitation, the making available to the extent necessary of books,
      records, work papers and personnel.

            (e) Attached hereto as Schedule 3.4(e) is a balance sheet showing
      Net Working Capital as of March 31, 2002 (the "REFERENCE BALANCE SHEET").
      The parties acknowledge that the Reference Balance Sheet was prepared in
      accordance with the Agreed Principles.

            (f) If Final Working Capital exceeds Estimated Working Capital,
      Buyer shall pay to Sellers, in the manner and with interest as provided in
      Section 3.4(g), the amount of such excess and, if Estimated Working
      Capital exceeds Final Working Capital, Parent shall pay to Buyer, as an
      adjustment to the Purchase Price, in the manner and with interest as
      provided in Section 3.4(g), the amount of such excess. "FINAL WORKING
      CAPITAL" means Closing Working Capital (i) as shown in Buyer's calculation
      delivered pursuant to Section 3.4(a) if no notice of disagreement with
      respect thereto is duly delivered pursuant to Section 3.4(b); or (ii) if
      such a notice of disagreement is delivered, (A) as agreed by Buyer and
      Parent pursuant to Section 3.4(c) or (B) in the absence of such agreement,
      as shown in the Accounting Referee's calculation delivered pursuant to
      Section 3.4(c); provided, however, that in no event shall Final Working
      Capital be more than Sellers' calculation of Closing Working Capital
      delivered pursuant to Section 3.4(b) or less than Buyer's calculation of
      Closing Working Capital delivered pursuant to Section 3.4(a).

            (g) Any payment pursuant to Section 3.4(f) shall be made at a
      mutually convenient time and place within three Business Days after Final
      Working Capital has been determined. Such payment shall be made (i) if by
      Parent, first, in accordance with the terms of the Working Capital Escrow
      Agreement, and second, if the funds therein are insufficient, by delivery
      by a certified or official bank check or wire transfer, and (ii) if by
      Buyer, by delivery of a certified or official bank check or wire transfer,
      in any case, payable in immediately available funds to the other party or
      by causing such payments to be credited to such account of such other
      party as may be designated in writing by such other party. The amount of
      any payment to be made pursuant to this Section 3.4 shall bear interest
      from and including the Closing Date to but excluding the date of payment
      at a rate per annum equal to the rate of interest announced by JP Morgan
      Chase from time to time as its base rate in New York City in effect from
      time to time during the period from the Closing Date to the date of
      payment. Such interest shall be payable at the same


                                       11
<PAGE>
      time as the payment to which it relates and shall be calculated daily on
      the basis of a year of 365 days and the actual number of days elapsed.

                                    ARTICLE 4

                REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE SELLERS

      Sellers hereby jointly and severally represent and warrant to Buyer as
follows:

      5.1 Corporate Organization. Each Seller is duly organized and validly

of this Agreement and those Ancillary Agreements to which any of them is or will
be a party and the performance of each Seller of its obligations hereunder and
thereunder have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action by the
board of directors and stockholders of such Seller, and no other corporate
proceedings on the part of such Seller are necessary to authorize such
execution, delivery and performance. This Agreement has been, and each Ancillary
Agreement when executed on behalf of any Seller will have been, duly executed by
each Seller that is a party thereto and, subject to the Bankruptcy Court's entry
of the Sale Order, constitutes, and each Ancillary Agreement will when executed
on behalf of any Seller constitute, its valid and binding obligation,
enforceable against it in accordance with their respective terms.

      5.3 No Conflict or Violation. Subject to (a) the receipt of all Consents
set forth on Schedule 5.4, (b) the Bankruptcy Court's entry of the Sale Order
and (c) the receipt of the Antitrust Approval, the execution, delivery and
performance by each Seller of this Agreement and those Ancillary Agreements to
which it is or will be a party do not and will not (i) violate or conflict with
any provision of the certificate of incorporation or by-laws (or equivalent
organizational documents) (collectively, the "ORGANIZATIONAL DOCUMENTS") of any


                                       13
<PAGE>
Seller, (ii) violate any provision of law, regulation, rule or other legal
requirement of any Government ("LAW") or any order, judgment or decree of any
court or Government ("ORDER") applicable to any Seller, (iii) violate or result
in a breach of or constitute (with due notice or lapse of time or both) a

reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, or (iv) result in the
imposition of a material Lien, other than a Permitted Lien, upon or with respect
to any of the Acquired Assets. "MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT" means a state of facts,
event, change or effect with respect to the Acquired Assets, or the
enforceability of any Assigned Contract, that results in a material adverse
effect on the combined operations or value of the LTV Tubular Business taken as
a whole, but excluding any state of facts, event, change or effect caused by
events, changes or developments relating to (v) the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or the announcement thereof; (w) changes or conditions affecting
the industries of which the LTV Tubular Business is a part generally; (x)
changes in economic, regulatory or political conditions generally; (y) changes
resulting from, or from any motion, application, pleading or Order filed under
or in connection with, the Bankruptcy Cases; or (z) any act(s) of war or of
terrorism.

      5.4 Consents and Approvals. Except for the Bankruptcy Court's entry of the
Sale Order and the Antitrust Approval, Schedule 5.4 sets forth a true and
complete list of each material Consent, and each declaration to or filing or
registration with any Government, that is required in connection with the
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements by Sellers
or the performance by Sellers of their obligations hereunder or thereunder
(including all consents necessary to the transfer of the Material Contracts).

      5.5 Financial Statements. Prior to the date hereof, Sellers have provided
Buyer with the balance sheets of the LTV Tubular Business as of March 31, 2002
and December 31, 2001 and the income statements of the LTV Tubular Business for
the periods then ended, and the statement of LTV's investment and cash flow for
the year ended December 31, 2001 (the "FINANCIAL STATEMENTS"), together with the
report of Ernst & Young, LLP, independent certified public accountants ("E&Y")
on the Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2001. The Financial
Statements were prepared in accordance with United States GAAP, consistently
applied except, in the case of the income statement as of March 31, 2002 (the
"STUB PERIOD"), as set forth on Schedule 5.5. The Financial Statements fairly
present the financial condition, the results of operations, and the investments
and cash flow of the LTV Tubular Business in all material respects as at the
respective dates of and for the periods referred to in such Financial Statements
except, in the case of the Financial Statements for the Stub Period, for normal
year end adjustments and as might result from the exceptions set forth on
Schedule 5.5. No financial statements of any Person other than Sellers are
required by GAAP to be included in the financial statements of the LTV Tubular
Business.

      5.6 Compliance with Law. Except as set forth on Schedule 5.6 and as may
result from the Bankruptcy Cases, no Seller has violated any Law (other than
with respect to Environmental Law, as to which the only representations and
warranties made by Sellers are those contained in Section 5.12), nor is any such
entity in default with respect to any Order, applicable to the LTV Tubular
Business or any of its assets, properties or operations, other than


                                       14
<PAGE>
violations and defaults the consequences of which would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

      5.7 Litigation. Except as set forth on Schedules 5.7, 5.10, 5.11 or 5.12,
there are no Claims, suits, proceedings or investigations pending or, to the
Knowledge of Sellers, threatened, before any court or Government brought by or
against any Seller that, if adversely determined, could reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect or materially impair the ability of Sellers to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Other than the
Bankruptcy Cases, there is no material Order to which the LTV Tubular Business,
or any of the Acquired Assets, is subject and Sellers are not subject to any
material Order that relates to the LTV Tubular Business or any of the Acquired
Assets.

      5.8 Title and Ownership. Subject to the entry of the Sale Order, at the
Closing, Sellers will have good and marketable title to, or right by Contract to
use, the Acquired Assets, free and clear of all Liens other than Permitted
Liens.

      5.9 Material Contracts.

            (a) Schedule 5.9 sets forth a complete and correct list of each of
      the Assigned Contracts that:

                  (i) creates a right to lease, use or occupy real estate used
            in the LTV Tubular Business;

                  (ii) would reasonably be expected to require the payment of
            amounts in excess of $500,000 after the Closing Date;

                  (iii) has a remaining duration of more than one year (except
            those that are terminable at a Seller's option upon less than 90
            days' notice);

                  (iv) provides for the use, license, assignment, purchase or
            sale of material Intellectual Property; or

                  (v) the consequences of a default under or termination of such
            Assigned Contract would reasonably be expected to have a Material
            Adverse Effect (collectively, the "MATERIAL CONTRACTS").

            (b) Other than as set forth on Schedule 5.9, no Seller nor, to
      Sellers' Knowledge, any other party to any of the Material Contracts has
      commenced any action against any of the parties to such Material Contracts
      or given or received any written notice of any material default or
      violation under any Material Contract that was not withdrawn or dismissed,
      except only for those defaults that will be cured in accordance with the
      Sale Order (or that need not be cured under the Bankruptcy Code to permit
      the assumption and assignment of the Assigned Contracts). Each of the
      Material Contracts is, or will be at the Closing, valid, binding and in
      full force and effect against a Seller, except as such Material Contract
      may have been terminated in accordance with its terms or as otherwise set
      forth on Schedule 5.9.


                                       15
<PAGE>
      5.10 Intellectual Property. Schedule 1.1(l) sets forth a complete and
correct list of all material patents necessary to operate the LTV Tubular
Business as currently conducted and all registered trademarks used exclusively
in the LTV Tubular Business. One of the Sellers owns, individually or with
another Seller, all right, title and interest in and to, or has a valid and
enforceable license to use, all the Intellectual Property and not later than
five (5) Business Days prior to Closing Sellers shall provide buyer with a
schedule setting forth the owner of each piece of Intellectual Property for
which it is necessary to file notice of transfer with any Government. To
Sellers' Knowledge, the conduct of the LTV Tubular Business as currently
conducted does not conflict with or infringe upon any proprietary right of any
third party in any material respect. Except as set forth on Schedule 5.10, there
is no Claim pending or, to Sellers' Knowledge, threatened in writing, that (i)
alleges any such conflict or infringement with any third party's proprietary
rights or (ii) challenges any Seller's ownership or use of, or the validity or
enforceability of, any Intellectual Property. Except as set forth on Schedule
5.10, no Seller is under any obligation to pay royalties or other payments in
connection with any Contract to use the Intellectual Property or restricted from
assigning its rights respecting Intellectual Property.

      5.11 Permits. As of the date of this Agreement, Schedule 1.1(o) sets forth
a complete and correct list of all material Permits and all pending applications
therefor obtained by any Seller in connection with the LTV Tubular Business.
Except as set forth on Schedule 5.11 or as would not reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect, each such Permit is valid and in full force and
effect, and is not subject to any pending or, to Sellers' Knowledge, threatened
administrative or judicial proceeding to revoke, cancel, suspend or declare such
Permit invalid in any respect. Except as would not reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect, the Permits are and will on the Closing Date be
sufficient and adequate in all material respects to permit the continued lawful
conduct of the LTV Tubular Business in the manner now conducted and, to Sellers'
Knowledge, none of the operations of the LTV Tubular Business is being conducted
in a manner that violates any of the terms or conditions under which any Permit
was granted.

      5.12 Environmental Matters. To Sellers' Knowledge, except as set forth on
Schedule 5.12:

            (a) Since January 1, 2001, there has been no release, threatened
      release, spill, leak, discharge or emission of any Hazardous Materials to
      the air, surface water, groundwater or soil of the Real Property requiring
      corrective action under, or that is a violation of, any applicable
      Environmental Laws, except as would not reasonably be expected to have a
      Material Adverse Effect.

            (b) Sellers are in compliance with applicable Environmental Laws,
      except where such non-compliance would not reasonably be expected to have
      a Material Adverse Effect.

            (c) There is not currently in effect, and since January 1, 2001
      there has not been, any complaint, Order, directive, Claim, citation,
      notice, information request or investigation by any Government or any
      other Person with respect to any release, threatened release, spill, leak,
      discharge or emission of any Hazardous Materials to the air, surface
      water, groundwater or soil of the Real Property that is a violation or
      alleged


                                       16
<PAGE>
      violation of any applicable Environmental Laws, except where such matter
      would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

            (d) Sellers have in full force and effect all material environmental
      permits, licenses and other authorizations required to conduct their
      operations and are operating in material compliance thereunder, and to
      Sellers' Knowledge there is no reason (other than facts about Buyer) that
      would preclude Buyer from renewing or obtaining the reissuance in Buyer's
      name of such permits, licenses or other authorizations required by any
      Environmental Law to operate the Acquired Assets as currently operated by
      Sellers.

      5.13 Sufficiency of Acquired Assets. Except as set forth on Schedule 5.13,
the Acquired Assets constitute all of the assets currently used by Sellers to
operate the LTV Tubular Business as currently operated by Sellers.

      8.7 Additional Cure Costs. Sellers shall, on or prior to the Closing, cure
or make provision to cure any and all monetary defaults under the Assigned

the Bankruptcy Code, so that such Contracts may be assumed by Sellers and
assigned to Buyer in accordance with the provisions of section 365 of the
Bankruptcy Code.

      8.8 Inventory. The physical quantities at the various LTV Tubular Plants
will be verified through testing of the perpetual inventory records, on a

representation or warranty had that representation or warranty been made as of
the time of the occurrence of, or Sellers' discovery of, such fact or condition.
Should any fact or condition require any change to a Schedule, Sellers shall
promptly take any action required by and in accordance with Section 16.3. During
the same period, Sellers also shall promptly notify Buyer of the occurrence of
any breach of any covenant of Sellers in this Article 8.

                                   ARTICLE 9

      9.3 Adequate Assurances Regarding Assigned Contracts. With respect to each
Assigned Contract, to the extent requested by the Bankruptcy Court, Sellers or
the counterparty to such Contract, Buyer shall provide the Bankruptcy Court,
Sellers or such counterparty, as the case may be, adequate assurance of the
future performance of such Assigned Contract by Buyer.

      9.4 Cure of Defaults. Buyer shall, on or prior to the Closing, cure any
and all defaults under the Assigned Contracts that are required to be cured
under the Bankruptcy Code, so that such Contracts may be assumed by Sellers and

in excess of the Aggregate Cure Costs to cure such defaults.

period of not more than seven (7) years, Buyer shall provide to Sellers and
their attorneys, accountants and other representatives (after reasonable notice

include, without limitation, access to any computerized information systems that
contain data regarding the Acquired Assets. In addition, Buyer acknowledges that

August 30, 2002 at their first meeting, and will use commercially reasonable
efforts to enter into such collective bargaining agreements on or prior to
October 25, 2002.

                              ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

         10.1 Additional Environmental Investigation.

                  (a) Buyer has engaged MECX, LLC (the "ENVIRONMENTAL
         CONSULTANT"), pursuant to the terms of a letter agreement dated October
         1, 2002 (the "ASSESSMENT AGREEMENT"), to prepare a work plan for a
         Phase II environmental assessment of each LTV Tubular Plant (each, a
         "WORK PLAN") and, subject to the terms of this Section 10.1, to carry
         out an environmental site assessment pursuant to each such Work Plan
         and prepare a report of the findings arising therefrom for each LTV
         Tubular Plant. The Assessment Agreement shall not be amended or
         modified without Seller's consent. Buyer shall cause the Environmental
         Consultant to carry out all work pursuant to the terms of this Section
         10.1.

                  (b) Buyer has caused the Environmental Consultant to complete
         Work Plans for a Phase II evaluation for each LTV Tubular Plant and
         deliver copies thereof to Parent prior to the date hereof. Each Work
         Plan was prepared at Buyer's sole expense and specifies in reasonable
         detail all actions to be taken by the Environmental Consultant
         including, without limitation, the area of concern, the location at
         which soil and water samples are to be taken, the nature of the types
         of samples to be taken, the procedures to be followed in performing the
         sampling, the parameters for which sampling is to be performed and the
         frequency of sampling at each sampling location.

                  (c) Buyer and Parent shall jointly review all Work Plans and
         may, but shall not be required to, agree on any modification thereto.
         On or prior to October 21, 2002, Parent shall notify Buyer whether any
         Work Plan (with such modifications, if any, as have been agreed to) is
         unacceptable.

                  (d) At any time after the conditions contained in Sections
         13.2(d) and 13.3(c) have been satisfied or waived (the date of such
         satisfaction, the "SATISFACTION DATE"),

                                       22
<PAGE>
         Buyer may cause the Environmental Consultant to carry out a site
         assessment in accordance with each Work Plan (each, a "SITE
         ASSESSMENT"). Any such Site Assessment which Buyer elects to have
         conducted shall be limited solely to those activities described on the
         Work Plan; provided, however, that additional activities proposed by
         the Environmental Consultant may be added to the Site Assessment if (i)
         such additional activities will not delay delivery of the Environmental
         Report beyond January 10, 2003; (ii) such additional activities address
         potential Required Response Conditions disclosed by the Site
         Assessment; and (iii) Parent gives its consent, which shall not be
         unreasonably delayed or withheld. Each Site Assessment shall be
         conducted at Buyer's sole cost and expense. Buyer shall be responsible,
         at its sole cost and expense, for the management and disposal of any
         wastes generated by Environmental Consultant during any Site Assessment
         in compliance with all applicable laws and for restoring the condition
         of any part of any LTV Tubular Plant that is disturbed as a result of
         the Site Assessment. Parent shall permit the Environmental Consultant
         access to the LTV Tubular Facilities to carry out the Site Assessments
         and will use commercially reasonable efforts to facilitate Site
         Assessments (without interfering with normal plant operations). Parent
         (or its agents) shall be permitted to observe all aspects of each Site
         Assessment. The Environmental Consultant shall complete each Site
         Assessment and deliver a report to Buyer and to Parent (each, an
         "ENVIRONMENTAL REPORT") as promptly as practicable, and in any event on
         or prior to January 10, 2003; provided, however, that the due date for
         each Environmental Report shall be extended beyond January 10, 2003 by
         one (1) day for each day by which the Satisfaction Date is after
         October 28, 2002, up to a maximum of 44 days.

                  (e) Each Environmental Report shall identify those sets of
         circumstances and conditions, if any, that create a current affirmative
         obligation under applicable Environmental Laws to undertake some
         Response Action (each, a "REQUIRED RESPONSE CONDITION") and contain an
         estimate of the cost of the most cost-effective Response Action, if
         any, required under Environmental Laws to bring the Required Response
         Condition into compliance with standards applicable to industrial
         properties, assuming such LTV Tubular Plant remains in operation as a
         manufacturing facility (the "COST ESTIMATE"). In preparing each Cost
         Estimate, the Environmental Consultant shall (i) apply the most
         cost-effective standards applicable to industrial locations, including
         risk-based assessments, (ii) assume all required expenditures will be
         made at the latest time consistent with Environmental Laws, (iii)
         discount all future expenditures to take into account the time value of
         money using an 6% discount rate, and (iv) identify the specific cost
         (as opposed to a range of costs) that, in its professional judgment,
         represents for each Required Response Condition the median (50th
         percentile) statistical probability occurrence of the cost of
         remediation. The Cost Estimate for any LTV Tubular Plant covered by any
         Environmental Report not timely delivered shall be $0.

                  (f) If the sum of the Cost Estimates is less than $2.0
         million, Buyer and Parent shall have no further rights under this
         Section 10.1 and there shall be no Environmental Escrow Fund. If the
         sum of the Cost Estimates exceeds $2.0 million, then (i) at Closing
         Buyer shall place into escrow a portion of the Purchase Price equal to
         the sum of (x) fifty percent (50%) of that portion of the Cost
         Estimates that is greater than $2.0 million, but less than $6.0
         million, plus (y) one-hundred percent (100%) of that

                                       23
<PAGE>
         portion of the Cost Estimates that is greater than $6.0 million (the
         sum of these amounts being the "ENVIRONMENTAL ESCROW FUND"); (ii) Buyer
         and Seller shall have no further rights under this Section 10.1; and
         (iii) the provisions of Section 10.2 shall apply.

         10.2 Environmental Escrow. If Buyer is required to fund the
Environmental Escrow Fund at Closing, at Closing Buyer and Seller shall enter
into an escrow agreement having the following terms and conditions (the
"ENVIRONMENTAL ESCROW AGREEMENT"):

                  (a) The Environmental Escrow Fund shall be deposited by Buyer
         at the Closing.

                  (b) The Escrow Agent shall be authorized, upon delivery by
         Buyer of a proper certificate, to periodically release to Buyer from
         the Environmental Escrow Fund an amount equal to the Sellers' Portion
         of any Appropriate Environmental Expense. "SELLERS' PORTION" means (i)
         zero percent (0%) of the cumulative Appropriate Environmental Expenses
         up to $2.0 million; (ii) 50% of the cumulative Appropriate
         Environmental Expenses in excess of $2.0 million but not in excess of
         $6.0 million; and (iii) one-hundred percent (100%) of the excess of the
         cumulative Appropriate Environmental Expenses over $6.0 million, up to
         the full amount of the Environmental Escrow Fund. "APPROPRIATE
         ENVIRONMENTAL EXPENSE" means (x) costs actually incurred by Buyer to
         remediate a Required Response Condition into compliance with standards
         applicable to industrial properties and applying the most
         cost-effective remediation program consistent with applicable
         Environmental Laws and (y) (without duplication) the net present value
         (using a 6% annual discount rate) of costs to be incurred by Buyer to
         remediate a Required Response Condition where the most cost-effective
         means of remediation will require expenditures beyond the second
         anniversary of the Closing Date. Appropriate Environmental Expenses
         described in clause (y) of the definition thereof shall be calculated,
         and the Sellers' Portion thereof shall be withdrawn from the
         Environmental Escrow Fund, immediately prior to the second anniversary
         of the Closing Date.

                  (c) Upon the earlier to occur of (i) substantial completion of
         the remediation of all Required Response Conditions, or (ii) the second
         anniversary of Closing, all remaining funds in the Environmental Escrow
         Fund would be released to the Sellers.

                  (d) Terms and conditions not pertaining to the release of the
         Environmental Escrow Fund will be substantially similar to the terms
         and conditions of the Deposits Escrow Agreement; provided, however,
         that Buyer shall have the right to collaterally assign its rights in
         substantially the same manner as provided by Section 16.1.

                                      TAXES

         12.1 Taxes Related to Purchase of Assets. All state and local sales,
use, gross-receipts, transfer, gains, excise, value-added or other similar Taxes
in connection with the transfer of the Acquired Assets, and all recording and
filing fees that may be imposed by reason of the sale, transfer, assignment and
delivery of the Acquired Assets and that are not exempt under section 1146(c) of
the Bankruptcy Code (collectively, "TRANSACTION TAXES"), shall be paid by Buyer
on or prior to their due date.

         12.2 Proration of Real and Personal Property Taxes. All real and
personal property taxes and assessments on the Acquired Assets for any taxable
period commencing prior to the day immediately preceding the Closing Date (the
"ADJUSTMENT DATE") and ending after the Adjustment Date (a "STRADDLE PERIOD"), a
complete list of which has been attached by Sellers as Schedule 12.2, shall be
prorated between Buyer and Sellers as of the close of business on the Adjustment
Date based on the best information then available, with (a) Sellers being liable
for such Taxes attributable to any portion of a Straddle Period ending prior to
the Adjustment Date and (b) Buyer being liable for such Taxes attributable to
any portion of a Straddle Period beginning on or after the Adjustment Date.
Information available subsequent to the Adjustment Date that alters the amount
of Taxes due with respect to a Straddle Period will not be taken into account
and will not affect the amount of Taxes allocated to Sellers or Buyer. All such
prorations shall be allocated so that items relating to the portion of a
Straddle Period ending prior to the Adjustment Date shall be allocated to
Sellers based upon the number of days in the Straddle Period prior to the
Adjustment Date and items related to the portion of a Straddle Period beginning
on or after the Adjustment Date shall be allocated to Buyer based upon the
number of days in the Straddle Period from and after the Adjustment Date;
provided, however, that the parties shall allocate any real property Tax in
accordance with section 164(d) of the Code. The amount of all such prorations
that must be paid in order to convey the Acquired Assets to Buyer free and clear
of all Liens other than Permitted Liens shall be calculated and paid on the
Closing Date; all other prorations shall be calculated and paid as soon as
practicable thereafter.

         12.3 Cooperation on Tax Matters. Buyer and Sellers shall furnish or
cause to be furnished to each other, as promptly as practicable, such

for and proof of facts during any Tax audit, for the preparation for any Tax
protest, for the prosecution or defense of any suit or other proceeding relating
to Tax matters and for the answer to any governmental or regulatory inquiry
relating to Tax matters.

         12.4 Retention of Tax Records. After the Closing Date and until the
expiration of all statutes of limitation applicable to Sellers' liabilities for
Taxes, Buyer shall retain possession of all accounting, business, financial and
Tax records and information that (a) relate to the Acquired Assets and are in
existence on the Closing Date and (b) come into existence after the Closing Date
but relate to the Acquired Assets before the Closing Date, and Buyer shall give
Sellers notice and an opportunity to retain any such records in the event that
Buyer determines to destroy or dispose of them during such period. In addition,
from and after the Closing Date, Buyer shall provide to Sellers and their
attorneys, accountants and other representatives (after

                                       26

to the Acquired Assets as Sellers may reasonably deem necessary to (i) properly
prepare for, file, prove, answer, prosecute and defend any Tax Return, claim,
filing, tax audit, tax protest, suit, proceeding or answer or (ii) administer or
complete any cases under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code of or including
Sellers. Such access shall include, without limitation, access to any
computerized information systems that contain data regarding the Acquired
Assets.

hereof. Such allocation shall be solely for purposes of federal taxation.
Sellers and Buyer shall cooperate in filing with the Internal Revenue Service
their respective Forms 8594 as provided for in section 1060 of the Code and any
other form required to be filed with any Government on a basis consistent with
the Allocation, and Buyer and Sellers shall reflect the Allocation on any
relevant Tax Returns required to be filed as a result of the transactions
contemplated hereby.

<PAGE>
         such representations and warranties shall have been true and correct as

                  (a) This Agreement may be terminated at any time before
         Closing:

                      (i) by mutual consent of Parent and Buyer, given in
           accordance with Sections 16.8;

                      (ii) by Buyer, on any date that is after January 15, 2003
           (the "TERMINATION DATE"), if any condition contained in Section 13.1
           has not been satisfied or waived as of such time; provided, however,
           that Buyer shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement under
           this Section 14.2(a)(ii) if Buyer's failure to fulfill any of its
           obligations under this Agreement is the reason that the Closing has
           not occurred on or before said date;

                      (iii) by Buyer, on any date after October 25, 2002 and
           prior to November 2, 2002, if the condition contained in Section
           13.3(c) has not been satisfied; provided, however, that Buyer shall
           not have the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section
           14.2(a)(iii) if Buyer's failure to fulfill any of its

                                       29
<PAGE>
           obligations under Section 9.6 is the reason that satisfaction of such
           condition has not occurred;

                      (iv) By Buyer, at any time prior to January 10, 2003, if
           the sum of the Cost Estimates exceeds $20.0 million;

                      (v) by Parent, on any date that is after the Termination
           Date, if any condition contained in Section 13.1 has not been
           satisfied or waived as of such time; provided, however, that Parent
           shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement under this
           Section 14.2(a)(v) if Sellers' failure to fulfill any of their
           obligations under this Agreement is the reason that the Closing has
           not occurred on or before said date;

                      (vi) by Parent, on any date at any time after October 25,
           2002, if the condition contained in Section 13.2(d) has not been
           satisfied;

                      (vii) by Parent, at any time prior to October 21, 2002,
           automatically upon notice to Buyer as permitted by Section 10.1(c)
           that any Work Plan is unacceptable to Parent;

                      (viii) By Parent, at any time prior to January 10, 2003,
           if the sum of the Cost Estimates exceeds $10.0 million; or

                      (ix) by either Buyer or Parent, immediately upon an Order
           becoming final and non-appealable that declares this Agreement or any
           of the Ancillary Agreements invalid or unenforceable in any material
           respect or that prevents the consummation of the transactions
           contemplated hereby or thereby (a "TERMINATION ORDER"); provided,
           however, that neither Parent nor Buyer shall have the right to
           terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 14.2(a)(ix) if such
           party or any of its Affiliates has sought entry of, or has failed to
           use all commercially reasonable efforts to oppose entry of, such
           Termination Order.

                  (b) The Termination Date and the dates specified in each of
         Section 14.2(a)(iv) and Section 14.2(a)(viii) shall be extended by one
         (1) day for each day by which the Satisfaction Date is after October
         28, 2002, up to a maximum of 44 days.

                  (c) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section
         14.2(a), (i) the Deposits, together with any interest accrued thereon,
         shall be returned to Buyer, (ii) this Agreement shall become null and
         void and have no effect (other than this Article 14, Article 15,
         Article 16 and Article 17, which shall survive termination), and (iii)
         none of Sellers, Buyer or any of their respective Related Parties shall
         have any liability or obligation arising under or in connection with
         this Agreement.

         14.3 Effect of Failure of Sellers' Conditions to Closing. If, after the
Termination Date and before Closing (so long as Sellers' failure to fulfill any
of their obligations under this Agreement has not been the reason that the
Closing shall not have been consummated

                                       30
<PAGE>
on or before such date), any condition contained in Section 13.2(a), Section
13.2(b), Section 13.2(c) or Section 13.2(e) has not been satisfied or waived by
Parent, then:

                  (a) If the failure of the condition is due to Buyer's willful
         failure to perform its obligations hereunder, Parent shall have the
         right, subject to the waiver by Parent or satisfaction of the
         conditions contained in Section 13.1, to obtain an Order requiring
         Buyer to specifically perform all of its obligations under this
         Agreement.

                  (b) If the failure of the condition is due to any inaccuracy
         of any of Buyer's representations or warranties or to Buyer's failure
         to perform its obligations hereunder for any reason, then Parent may
         (i) terminate this Agreement; (ii) retain the Deposits, together with
         any interest accrued thereon, as agreed damages and without the
         necessity for proof of actual damages; and (iii) pursue any other
         remedies available to Sellers at Law and Seller shall be able to
         recover damages, if proven, provided, however, that in no event shall
         the amounts paid to Sellers pursuant to clauses (ii) and (iii) of this
         Section 14.3(b) exceed $13.0 million; provided, further, that Sellers
         shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section
         14.3(b) if Sellers' failure to fulfill any of its obligations under
         this Agreement has been the reason that the Closing has not been
         consummated on or before said date.

         14.4 Effect of Failure of Buyer's Conditions to Closing.

                  (a) Buyer may terminate this Agreement at any time after the
         Termination Date and before Closing if any condition contained in
         Section 13.3(a), Section 13.3(b), Section 13.3(d) or Section 13.3(e)
         has not been satisfied or waived as of such time; provided, however,
         that Buyer shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement under
         this Section 14.4(a) if Buyer's failure to fulfill any of its
         obligations under this Agreement has been the reason that the Closing
         has not been consummated on or before said date.

                  (b) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section
         14.4(a), (i) the Deposits, together with any interest accrued thereon,
         shall be returned to Buyer, (ii) Sellers shall reimburse Buyer for its
         actual, reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred in
         connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
         hereby, up to a maximum of $1.5 million, (iii) this Agreement shall
         become null and void and have no effect (other than this Article 14,
         Article 15, Article 16 and Article 17, which shall survive termination)
         and (iv) except as specifically provided in this Section 14.4(b), none
         of Sellers, Buyer or any of their respective Related Parties shall have
         any liability or obligation arising under or in connection with this
         Agreement.

         14.5 Termination on Alternative Transaction.

                  (a) This Agreement may be terminated at any time before
         Closing by either Buyer or Parent, upon Sellers' consummating any
         Alternative Transaction.

                  (b) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section
         14.5(a), (i) the Deposits, together with any interest accrued thereon,
         shall be returned to Buyer, (ii) Sellers shall pay Buyer a break-up fee
         equal to $2,200,000, (iii) this Agreement shall become null and void
         and of no effect (except for this Article 14, Article 15, Article 16

                                       31

         and Article 17, which shall survive termination), and (iv) except as
         provided in this Section 14.5(b), none of Buyer, Sellers or their
         respective Related Parties shall have any liability or obligation
         arising under or in connection with this Agreement.

                                 INDEMNIFICATION

         15.1 Indemnification by Buyer. Buyer shall indemnify, defend and hold
Sellers and their respective Affiliates and Related Persons (each, an
"INDEMNITEE") harmless from and against any and all losses, Claims, damages,
costs and expenses (including, without limitation, interest, penalties,
attorneys' and accountants' fees and investigation costs) (collectively,
"LOSSES") incurred by any Indemnitee as a result of, arising from or related to:

                  (a) the operation of the LTV Tubular Business or the ownership
         and use of the Acquired Assets from and after the Closing;

                  (b) any failure by Buyer to assume, pay, perform and discharge
         the Assumed Liabilities from and after the Closing;

                  (c) Buyer's or Buyer's Related Persons' or the Environmental
         Consultant's entry upon the Real Property in connection with their
         exercise of the right of access pursuant to Section 8.5, Section 10.1
         or any and all other activities undertaken by Buyer or Buyer's Related
         Persons or the Environmental Consultant on or with respect to any such
         Real Property;

                  (d) any inaccuracy of any representation or warranty made by
         Buyer in this Agreement or any of the Ancillary Agreements; and

                  (e) any breach of any covenant or undertaking of Buyer
         contained in this Agreement or any of the Ancillary Agreements.

         15.2 Third-Party Indemnification Procedures. An Indemnitee shall give
Buyer prompt written notice of any third-party claim that may give rise to a
claim for indemnification under this Article 15. Failure to give prompt notice
shall not affect the indemnification obligations hereunder in the absence of
actual prejudice. Buyer shall have the right to assume the defense of any such
claim through counsel of its own choosing, by so notifying the Indemnitee within
30 days of receipt of the Indemnitee's written notice; provided, however, that
Buyer's counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnitee. If an
Indemnitee desires to participate in any such defense assumed by Buyer, it may
do so at its sole cost and expense, and Buyer and its counsel shall give such
Indemnitee and its counsel reasonable access to the relevant records and
documents and employees of Buyer in connection therewith. If Buyer does not
assume any such defense, it shall be liable for all costs and expenses of
defending such claim incurred by any Indemnitee, including reasonable fees and
disbursements of counsel. Neither Buyer nor any Indemnitee shall settle,
compromise or offer to settle or compromise any claim or demand if such
settlement or compromise does not include an irrevocable and unconditional
release of all Sellers, their respective Affiliates and Related Parties and
Buyer for any Losses arising out of such claim or demand.

involvement in the drafting thereof.

         16.5 Expenses. Except as otherwise provided herein, each of the parties
hereto shall pay its own expenses in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, including, without limitation, any legal and

declared by any court or other judicial or administrative body to be null, void
or unenforceable, said provision shall survive to the extent it is not so
declared, and all of the other provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full
force and effect only if, after excluding the portion deemed to be
