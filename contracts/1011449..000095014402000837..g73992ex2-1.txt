                                   ARTICLE I

                                   THE MERGER

     SECTION 1.1.  The Merger.  Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of
this Agreement, and in accordance with the GBCC, at the Effective Time (as
hereinafter defined), Sub shall be merged with and into the Company. As a result
of the Merger, the separate corporate existence of Sub shall cease and the
Company shall continue as the surviving corporation following the Merger (the
"Surviving Corporation"). The corporate existence of the Company, with all its
purposes, rights, privileges, franchises, powers and objects, shall continue
unaffected and unimpaired by the Merger and, as the Surviving Corporation, it
shall be governed by the laws of the State of Georgia.

     SECTION 1.2.  Effective Time; Closing.  As promptly as reasonably
practicable (and in any event within five (5) business days) after the
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VI hereof, the
parties hereto shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing a certificate
of merger (the "Certificate of Merger"), with the Secretary of State of the
State of Georgia and by making all other filings or recordings required under
the GBCC in connection with the Merger, in such form as is required by, and
executed in accordance with, the relevant provisions of, the GBCC. The Merger
shall become effective at such time as the Certificate of Merger is duly filed
with the Secretary of State of the State of Georgia, or at such other time as
the parties hereto agree, which shall be specified in the Certificate of Merger
(the date and time the Merger becomes effective, the "Effective Time"). On the
date of such filing, a closing (the "Closing") shall be held at 10:00 a.m.,
Eastern Standard Time, at the offices of King & Spalding, 191 Peachtree Street,
Atlanta, Georgia 30303, or at such other time and location as the parties hereto
shall otherwise agree.

     SECTION 1.3.  Effect of the Merger.  At the Effective Time, the effect of
the Merger shall be as provided in the applicable provisions of the GBCC and
this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject
thereto, at the Effective Time all the property, rights, privileges, powers and
franchises of the Company and Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and
all debts, liabilities, obligations, restrictions, disabilities and duties of
the Company and Sub shall become the debts, liabilities, obligations,
restrictions, disabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

     SECTION 1.4.  Conversion of Company Common Stock.  At the Effective Time,
by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Sub, the Company
or the holders of any of the following securities:

          (a) Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding
     immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares canceled
     pursuant to Section 1.4(b) and Dissenting Shares (as hereinafter defined),
     if any) shall be canceled and, subject to Section 1.5, shall by virtue of
     the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof be
     converted automatically into the right to receive, upon surrender of the
     certificate that formerly evidenced such share of Company Common Stock in
     the manner provided in Section 1.7, (i) an amount in cash equal to Eight
     and 25/100 Dollars ($8.25) per share, without interest (the "Per Share Cash
     Merger Consideration"; the Per Share Cash Merger Consideration multiplied
     by the number of issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock at
     the Effective Time is referred to herein as the "Cash Merger
     Consideration") and (ii) one beneficial interest unit in the Liquidating
     Trust (a "Beneficial Interest"),

                                        2
<PAGE>

     having the rights and subject to the restrictions set forth in the Trust
     Agreement (as hereinafter defined) (the "Per Share Non-Cash Merger
     Consideration"; the Per Share Non-Cash Merger Consideration multiplied by
     the number of issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock at the
     Effective Time is referred to herein as the "Non-Cash Merger
     Consideration"; and the Cash Merger Consideration and the Non-Cash Merger
     Consideration is referred to herein as the "Common Stock Merger
     Consideration");

          (b) Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding
     immediately prior to the Effective Time that is owned by Holding, Parent or
     Sub and each share of Company Common Stock that is owned by the Company as
     treasury stock shall be canceled and retired and cease to exist and no
     payment or distribution shall be made with respect thereto;

          (c) At the Effective Time, all shares of the Company Common Stock
     converted pursuant to Section 1.4(a) shall no longer be outstanding and
     shall automatically be canceled and retired and cease to exist, and each
     holder of a certificate ("Certificate") representing any such shares of
     Company Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto,
     except the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration (as
     hereinafter defined) in accordance with Section 1.4(a); and

          (d) Each share of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of Sub
     issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
     converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable
     share of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of the Surviving
     Corporation and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital
     stock of the Surviving Corporation.

     SECTION 1.5.  Dissenting Shares.

     (a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, shares of
Company Common Stock that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and which are held by Company Shareholders who have properly
exercised dissenters' rights with respect to such shares of Company Common Stock
in accordance with Sections 14-2-1321 and 14-2-1323 of the GBCC (the "Dissenting
Shares") shall not be exchangeable for the right to receive the Per Share Cash
Merger Consideration and the Per Share Non-Cash Merger Consideration
(collectively, the "Per Share Merger Consideration") pursuant to Section 1.4(a),
and holders of such Dissenting Shares shall be entitled to receive payment of
the fair value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions of
Article 13 of the GBCC unless and until such holders fail to perfect or
effectively withdraw or otherwise lose their rights to demand payment under the
GBCC. If, after the Effective Time, any such holder fails to perfect or
effectively withdraws or loses such right, such Dissenting Shares shall
thereupon be deemed to have been converted into and have become exchangeable
for, as of the Effective Time, as described in Section 1.4(a), the right to
receive the Per Share Merger Consideration set forth in such provisions, without
any interest thereon.

     (b) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any demands for
payment for Dissenting Shares pursuant to Article 13 of the GBCC received by the
Company, withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments served pursuant
to the GBCC and received by the Company and (ii) the opportunity to direct all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for payment pursuant to
Article 13 of the GBCC. The Company shall not, except with the prior written
consent of Parent or as otherwise required by applicable law, make any payment
with respect to any such demands for payment or offer to settle or settle any
such demands.

     SECTION 1.6.  Stock Option Plans; Change of Control Payments.

     (a) The Company shall take all action necessary to ensure that, pursuant to
the Company's Stock Option and Incentive Award Plan (the "1996 Plan"), the
Non-employee Directors' Stock Option and Fee Plan (the "Directors' Plan"), the
Employee Stock Option Plan (the "1997 Plan", which together with the 1996 Plan
and the Directors' Plan, constitute the "Company Stock Option Plans"), all
outstanding options to acquire Company Stock (the "Company Options") shall be
exercisable in full immediately prior to the consummation of the Merger and all
Company Options that are not exercised prior to the consummation

                                        3
<PAGE>

of the Merger will be canceled as of the Effective Time in exchange for the
consideration described in Section 1.6(b).

     (b) In exchange for the cancellation of each such holder's Company Options
(regardless of exercise price), such holder shall be entitled to receive, as of
the Effective Time (subject to Section 1.7(b)) (i) an amount in cash (which may
be $.00) determined by multiplying (A) the excess, if any, of the Per Share Cash
Merger Consideration over the applicable exercise price per share of the Company
Options by (B) the number of shares of Company Common Stock such holder could
have purchased had such holder exercised such Company Options in full and
assuming the Company Options were fully vested (less any portion of such Company
Options previously exercised) immediately prior to the consummation of the
Merger (the "Cash Option Consideration"; the aggregate Cash Option Consideration
payable to all of the holders of Company Options is sometimes referred to herein
as the "Total Cash Option Consideration"), and (ii) if and with respect only to
the Company Options for which such holder shall be entitled to receive any Cash
Option Consideration greater than $.00 as a result of the foregoing clause, that
number of Beneficial Interests equal to that number of shares of Company Common
Stock such holder could have purchased had such holder exercised such Company
Options in full and assuming the Company Options were fully vested (less any
portion of such Company Options previously exercised) immediately prior to the
consummation of the Merger (the "Non-Cash Option Consideration" and together
with the Cash Option Consideration the "Option Consideration"), and each such
Company Option shall thereafter be canceled.

     (c) At the Closing, immediately following the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall pay to the officers of the Company identified in Section
1.6(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter (as hereinafter defined) the amounts set
forth therein (subject to adjustment as further set forth in Section 1.6(c) of
the Company Disclosure Letter), and (i) as a condition to the receipt of such
amounts at the Closing, each such officer shall release all claims against
Holding, Parent, Sub and the Surviving Corporation other than claims against
Holding, Parent, Sub and the Surviving Company for (A) obligations under each
Change of Control Agreement (as hereinafter defined) to provide such officers
with any continuing benefits required to be provided after the Effective Time,
(B) any rights as an Indemnified Party described in Section 5.7(a) hereof and
(C) any claim for a breach of the covenants set forth in Sections 5.7(b), 5.7(c)
or 5.7(d) hereof (each an "Officer Release"); and (ii) the Surviving Corporation
shall release all claims against such officers other than claims against such
officers for (A) fraud and (B) other claims related to or arising out of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. If any officer
refuses to sign the Officer Release applicable to his Change of Control
Agreement, then the determination of what, if any, amounts are due and payable
to such officer pursuant to his Change of Control Agreement will be determined
solely by the terms of his Change of Control Agreement.

     SECTION 1.7.  Surrender of Shares of Company Common Stock; Stock Transfer
Books.

     (a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a bank or trust
company to act as agent (the "Paying Agent") for (i) the holders of shares of
Company Common Stock reasonably acceptable to the Company to receive the funds
necessary to make the payments to such holders pursuant to Section 1.4(a)(i)
upon surrender of their Certificates and (ii) for the holders of Company Options
to receive the payment of any Cash Option Consideration provided for in Section
1.6(b) upon surrender and cancellation of the Company Options. Parent will, on
or prior to the Effective Time, deposit with the Paying Agent the Cash Merger
Consideration and Total Cash Option Consideration to be paid in respect of the
shares of Company Stock and Company Options, respectively (the "Fund"). The Fund
shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by Parent; provided that such
investments shall be in obligations of, or guaranteed by, the United States of
America or any agency thereof and backed by the full faith and credit of the
United States of America, in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or
better by Moody's Investor Services, Inc., or Standard and Poor's Corporation,
respectively, or in deposit accounts, certificates of deposit or banker's
acceptances of, or repurchase or reverse repurchase agreements with, or
Eurodollar time deposits purchased from, commercial banks with capital, surplus
and undivided profits aggregating in excess of US $100 million (based upon the
most recent financial statements of such bank which are then publicly
available). Any net profit resulting from, or interest or income produced by,
such

                                        4
<PAGE>

investments, shall be placed in the Fund and be payable to the Surviving
Corporation upon demand of non-disbursed funds pursuant to Section 1.7(d)
hereof. Parent shall promptly replace any monies lost through any investment
made pursuant to this Section 1.7(a) to the extent such loss results in the Fund
being equal to less than the amount initially deposited by Parent (after
adjustment for any payment to holders of shares of Company Common Stock and
Company Options pursuant hereto), and Parent shall in any event be liable for
the payment of the Cash Merger Consideration and Total Cash Option
Consideration, notwithstanding any losses in the Fund. The Fund shall not be
used for any purpose except as expressly provided in this Agreement. The Paying
Agent shall make the payments provided for in Sections 1.4 and 1.6(b).

     (b) Promptly after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
cause to be mailed to each person who was, at the Effective Time, a holder of
record of shares of Company Common Stock entitled to receive the Per Share
Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 1.4, a form of letter of transmittal
(which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title
to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to
the Paying Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates pursuant to such letter of transmittal. Upon surrender to the
Paying Agent of a Certificate, together with such letter of transmittal, duly
completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and
such other documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the
holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the
Per Share Merger Consideration for each share of Company Common Stock formerly
evidenced by such Certificate, and such Certificate shall then be canceled.
Until so surrendered, each such Certificate shall, at and after the Effective
Time, represent for all purposes, only the right to receive such Per Share
Merger Consideration. No interest shall accrue or be paid to any beneficial
owner of shares of Company Common Stock or any holder of any Certificate with
respect to the Per Share Merger Consideration payable upon the surrender of any
Certificate. If payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration is to be made to a
person other than the person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is
registered on the stock transfer books of the Company, it shall be a condition
of payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be endorsed in blank or to
the Paying Agent or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the person
requesting such payment shall have paid all transfer and other taxes required by
reason of the payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration to a person other
than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or shall have
established to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such taxes
either have been paid or are not applicable. If any Certificate shall have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, upon making of an affidavit of that fact by the
person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Surviving Corporation or Parent, the posting by such person of a
bond, in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation or Parent may
direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect
to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate the applicable Per Share Merger Consideration
such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to Section 1.4.

     (c) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to
pay the amount of Cash Option Consideration payable to each holder of a Company
Option pursuant to Section 1.6(b) as soon as reasonably practicable following
the Effective Time.

     (d) At any time following one hundred eighty (180) days after the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to
deliver to it any portion of the Fund which had been made available to the
Paying Agent and not disbursed to holders of shares of Company Common Stock and
holders of Company Options (including, without limitation, all interest and
other income received by the Paying Agent in respect of all amounts held in the
Fund or other funds made available to it), and thereafter each such holder shall
be entitled to look only to (i) the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned
property, escheat and other similar laws), and only as general creditors
thereof, with respect to any Per Share Cash Merger Consideration that may be
payable upon due surrender of the Certificates held by such holder and any Cash
Option Consideration payable upon due surrender and cancellation of such Company
Options, and (ii) the Liquidating Trust (subject to abandoned property, escheat
and other similar laws) with respect to any Per Share Non-Cash Merger
Consideration that may be issuable upon

                                        5
<PAGE>

due surrender of the Certificates held by such holder and any Non-Cash Option
Consideration issuable upon due surrender and cancellation of such Company
Options. If any Certificates representing shares of Company Common Stock shall
not have been surrendered immediately prior to such date on which the Per Share
Merger Consideration in respect of such Certificate would otherwise escheat to
or become the property of any Governmental Entity (as hereinafter defined), any
such cash, shares, dividends or distributions payable in respect of such
Certificate (other than the Per Share Non-Cash Merger Consideration or any cash,
shares, dividends or distributions payable in respect thereof, which shall
automatically and ratably inure to the benefit of the holders of Beneficial
Interests of the Liquidating Trust) shall, to the extent permitted by applicable
law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all
claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, none of Holding, the Surviving Corporation, Parent, Sub, the
Liquidating Trust or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder of a share
of Company Common Stock for any Per Share Merger Consideration delivered in
respect of such share of Company Common Stock to a public official pursuant to
any abandoned property, escheat or other similar law.

     (e) At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be
closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of
shares of Company Common Stock on the records of the Company. From and after the
Effective Time, except for Parent and Sub, the holders of shares of Company
Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to
have any rights with respect to such shares of Company Common Stock except as
otherwise provided herein or by applicable law, and all consideration paid
pursuant to this Article I upon the surrender or exchange of Certificates shall
be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the
shares of Company Common Stock theretofore represented by such Certificate.

     (f) Holding, Parent, Sub, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent,
as the case may be, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Per Share
Merger Consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder
of shares of Company Common Stock and from the Option Consideration otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Company Options such amounts
that Holding, Parent, Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder or any provision of state, local or foreign
tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Holding, Parent, Sub, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, such amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of
Company Common Stock or of Company Options, as the case may be, in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made by Holding, Parent, Sub, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent. The Surviving Corporation, Holding,
Parent or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, shall timely pay or cause to be
paid any amounts withheld pursuant to this Section 1.7(f) for applicable
foreign, federal, state and local taxes to the appropriate Governmental Entity
on behalf of such holders of Company Common Stock or Company Options.

     (g) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, the Surviving
Corporation shall pay all charges and expenses, including those of the Paying
Agent, in connection with the exchange of cash for shares of Company Common
Stock.

     SECTION 1.8.  Escrow Deposit.  On the date hereof, Parent has deposited in
escrow with SouthTrust Bank (the "Escrow Agent") in accordance with the terms of
the Escrow Agreement dated the date hereof among Parent, the Company and the
Escrow Agent (the "Escrow Agreement") cash in the amount of Five Million Dollars
($5,000,000) (the "Deposit"), which amount shall be held and disbursed in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement.

                           THE SURVIVING CORPORATION

     SECTION 2.1.  Articles of Incorporation.  The Articles of Incorporation of
the Company as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the
Articles of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation, until, subject to
Section 5.7(a), the same shall thereafter be altered, amended or repealed in
accordance with applicable law or such Articles of Incorporation.

     SECTION 2.2.  Bylaws.  The Bylaws of the Company as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation,
until, subject to Section 5.7(a), the same shall thereafter be altered, amended
or repealed in accordance with applicable law, the Articles of Incorporation of
the Surviving Corporation or such Bylaws.

     SECTION 2.3.  Directors and Officers.  From and after the Effective Time,
until the earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective
successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified in accordance with
applicable law, (i) the directors of Sub at the Effective Time shall be the
directors of the Surviving Corporation, and (ii) the officers of Sub at the
Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation.

                                  ARTICLE III

                 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

     The Company represents and warrants to each of Holding, Parent and Sub, in
each case except as set forth in the written disclosure letter (which letter
shall in each case specifically identify by reference to Sections of this
Agreement any exceptions to each of the representations and warranties set forth
herein) delivered by the Company to Parent concurrently with the execution and
delivery of this Agreement (the "Company Disclosure Letter"), as follows:

     SECTION 3.1.  Organization and Standing.  Each of the Company and each
Subsidiary (as hereinafter defined) (i) is a corporation or other legal entity
duly organized, validly existing and in good standing (with respect to the
jurisdictions that recognize the concept of good standing) under the laws of the
jurisdiction of its incorporation or organization, (ii) has all requisite
corporate or other power and authority and all necessary government approvals to
own, lease and operate its properties and assets and to conduct its business as
presently conducted and (iii) is duly qualified or licensed to do business as a
foreign corporation and is in good standing in each jurisdiction where the
character of the properties owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of its
business makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except where the
failure to be in good standing or so qualified or licensed, individually or in
the aggregate, has not had, or would not reasonably be expected to have, a
Company Material Adverse Effect (as hereinafter defined). The Company has
furnished or made available to Parent true and complete copies of its articles
of incorporation the "Company Articles of Incorporation") and bylaws (the
"Company Bylaws") and the articles of incorporation and bylaws (or equivalent
organizational documents) of each Subsidiary, each as amended to date. Such
articles of incorporation, bylaws or equivalent organizational documents are in
full force and effect, and neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is in
violation of any provision of its articles of incorporation, bylaws or
equivalent organizational documents.

     SECTION 3.2.  Capitalization; Subsidiaries.

     (a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 100,000,000
shares of Company Common Stock and 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $1.00
par value per share (the "Preferred Stock"), including 500,000 shares designated
as Series A Participating Cumulative Preferred Stock (the "Series A Preferred
Stock"). As of the date hereof, (i) 11,975,127 shares of Company Common Stock
are issued and outstanding, all of which are validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable and free of preemptive rights, (ii) no shares of Company Common
Stock are held in the treasury of the Company, (iii) Company Options to acquire
1,202,574 shares of Company Common Stock in the aggregate are outstanding
pursuant to the Company Stock Option Plans, and 2,099,750 shares of Company
Common Stock are authorized and

                                        7
<PAGE>

reserved for future issuance pursuant to the Company Stock Option Plans, and
(iv) no shares of Preferred Stock are issued or outstanding. Section 3.2(a) of
the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a correct and complete list of the
Company Options (and exercise prices) outstanding as of the date hereof. Except
pursuant to the Company Rights Plan, or as set forth above or in Section 3.2(a)
of the Company Disclosure Letter, there are no options, warrants, convertible
securities, subscriptions, stock appreciation rights, phantom stock plans or
stock equivalents or other rights, agreements, arrangements or commitments
(contingent or otherwise) of any character issued or authorized by the Company
relating to the issued or unissued capital stock of the Company or any
Subsidiary or obligating the Company or any Subsidiary to issue or sell any
shares of capital stock of, or options, warrants, convertible securities,
subscriptions or other equity interests in, the Company or any Subsidiary. All
shares of Company Stock subject to issuance as aforesaid, upon issuance on the
terms and conditions specified in the instruments pursuant to which they are
issuable, will be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable.
Except as set forth in Section 3.2(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter, there
are no outstanding contractual obligations of the Company or any Subsidiary to
repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any shares of Company Stock or any
capital stock of any Subsidiary or to pay any dividend or make any other
distribution in respect thereof or to provide funds to, or make any investment
(in the form of a loan, capital contribution or otherwise) in, any person.

     (b) Section 3.2(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a correct
and complete list of, and the jurisdiction of organization of, each corporation,
association, subsidiary, partnership, limited liability company or other entity
of which the Company controls, directly or indirectly, 10% or more of the
outstanding equity interests (each a "Subsidiary" and collectively, the
"Subsidiaries"). Except as set forth in Section 3.2(b) of the Company Disclosure
Letter, the Company owns, directly or indirectly, beneficially and of record all
of the issued and outstanding capital stock of each Subsidiary and does not own
an equity interest in any other corporation, association, partnership, limited
liability company or other entity, other than in the Subsidiaries. Each
outstanding share of capital stock or interest of each Subsidiary is duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and except as set forth
on Section 3.2(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter, each such share owned by the
Company or another Subsidiary is free and clear of all security interests,
liens, claims, pledges, options, rights of first refusal, agreements,
limitations on the Company's or such other Subsidiary's voting rights, charges
and other encumbrances of any nature whatsoever.

     SECTION 3.3.  Authority for Agreement.

     (a) The Company has all necessary corporate power and authority to execute
and deliver this Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder and, subject to
obtaining necessary shareholder approval, to consummate the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The execution, delivery and
performance by the Company of this Agreement, and the consummation by the
Company of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action (including, without
limitation, the unanimous approval of the Board of Directors of the Company) and
no other corporate proceedings on the part of the Company are necessary to
authorize this Agreement or to consummate the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (in each case other than the approval and
adoption of this Agreement by the affirmative vote of a majority of the voting
power of the then outstanding shares of Company Common Stock and the filing and
recordation of appropriate merger documents as required by the GBCC). This
Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming the
due authorization, execution and delivery by Holding, Parent and Sub,
constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company enforceable
against the Company in accordance with its terms, except that such
enforceability (i) may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium or other similar Laws (as hereinafter defined) affecting or relating
to the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and (ii) is subject to general
principles of equity. The affirmative vote of holders of the outstanding shares
of Company Common Stock entitled to vote at a duly called and held meeting of
shareholders is the only vote of the Company's Shareholders necessary to approve
this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

                                        8

     (b) At a meeting duly called and held on January 28, 2002, the Board of
Directors of the Company unanimously (i) determined that, as of the date
thereof, this Agreement and the Voting Agreement and the other transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby, including the Merger, are fair to, and in the
best interests of, the Company and the Company Shareholders, (ii) approved,
authorized and adopted this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby, (iii) resolved, subject to Section 5.5 of this Agreement,
to recommend approval and adoption of this Agreement and the Merger by the
Company Shareholders, and (iv) amended the Company Rights Plan to ensure that
(x) none of Holding, Parent or Sub will become an "Acquiring Person" (as defined
in the Company Rights Plan) as a result of this Agreement, the Merger or the
Voting Agreement, (y) no "Share Acquisition Date" or "Distribution Date" (each
as defined in the Company Rights Plan) will occur as a result of this Agreement,
the Merger or the Voting Agreement and (z) all outstanding rights to purchase
Series A Participating Cumulative Preferred Stock of the Company issued and
outstanding under the Company Rights Plan will expire at the Closing. The
actions taken by the Board of Directors of the Company constitute approval of
the Merger, this Agreement and the Voting Agreement and the other transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby by the Board of Directors of the Company under
the provisions of Section 14-2-1132 of the GBCC such that Section 14-2-1132 of
the GBCC does not apply to this Agreement, the Merger, the Voting Agreement, or
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. Other than Section 14-2-1132 of
the GBCC, no state anti-takeover or similar statute in Georgia, or to the
knowledge of the Company, in any other jurisdiction, is applicable to Holding,
Parent or Sub in connection with the Merger, this Agreement, the Voting
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.

     (c) Salomon Smith Barney Inc. (the "Independent Advisor") has delivered to
the Board of Directors of the Company its written opinion, dated the date of
this Agreement, to the effect that, as of such date and based on the
assumptions, qualifications and limitations contained therein, the Per Share
Merger Consideration is fair, from a financial point of view, to the Company
Shareholders. The Company has provided a complete and accurate copy of such
opinion to Parent solely for informational purposes.

     SECTION 3.4.  No Conflict.  The execution and delivery of this Agreement by
the Company do not, and the performance of this Agreement by the Company and the
consummation by the Company of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement will not, (i) conflict with or violate the
Company Articles of Incorporation or Company Bylaws or equivalent organizational
documents of any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) subject to Section 3.5, conflict with
or violate any United States federal, state or local or any foreign statute,
law, rule, regulation, ordinance, code, order, judgment, decree or any other
requirement or rule of law (a "Law") applicable to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or by which any property or asset of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is bound or affected, or (iii) except as set forth in Section 3.4
of the Company Disclosure Letter, result in a breach of or constitute a default
(or an event which with notice or lapse of time or both would become a default)
under, give to others any right of termination, amendment, acceleration or
cancellation of, result in triggering any payment or other obligations under, or
result in the creation of a lien or other encumbrance on any property or asset
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to, any note, bond, mortgage,
indenture, contract, agreement, lease, license, permit, franchise or other
instrument or obligation or Material Contract (as hereinafter defined) to which
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries or any property or asset of any of them is bound or
affected, except, in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) above, to the extent
that any such conflict, violation, breach, default or other occurrences would
not have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse
Effect.

     SECTION 3.5.  Required Filings and Consents.  Except as set forth in
Section 3.5 of the Company Disclosure Letter, the execution and delivery of this
Agreement by the Company do not, and the performance of this Agreement by the
Company will not, require any consent, approval, authorization or permit of, or
filing with or notification to, any United States federal, state or local or any
foreign government or any court, administrative or regulatory agency or
commission or other governmental authority or agency, domestic or foreign (a
"Governmental Entity"), except (i) for applicable requirements, if any, of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), state

                                        9
<PAGE>

securities or "blue sky" laws ("Blue Sky Laws") and filing and recordation of
appropriate merger documents as required by the GBCC, (ii) for filings
contemplated by Section 3.14, and (iii) for other immaterial consents,
approvals, authorizations, permits, filings, registrations and notifications
from or with local authorities or municipalities.

     SECTION 3.6.  Compliance.  Except as set forth in Section 3.6 of the
Company Disclosure Letter, each of the Company and its Subsidiaries (i) has been
operated at all times in compliance in all material respects with all Laws
applicable to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or by which any property,
business or asset of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is bound or affected
and (ii) is not in material default or violation of any material notes, bonds,
mortgages, indentures, contracts, agreements, leases, licenses, permits,
franchises, or other instruments or obligations to which the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries is a party or by which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or any property or asset of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is bound or
affected. Except as set forth in Section 3.6 of the Company Disclosure Letter,
neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has received any written or, to the
knowledge of the Company, oral communication during the past two (2) years from
a Governmental Entity that alleges that the Company or a Subsidiary is not in
compliance in any material respect with any applicable Law.

     SECTION 3.7.  SEC Filings, Financial Statements.

     (a) The Company and each Subsidiary, as necessary, has filed all forms,
reports, statements and documents required to be filed with the United States
Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") since January 1, 1999
(collectively, the "SEC Reports"), each of which has complied in all material
respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (the "Securities Act"), and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder, or the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder, each as in effect on the date so filed. When filed, none of the SEC
Reports (including, but not limited to, any financial statements or schedules
included or incorporated by reference therein) contained any untrue statement of
a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact required to be
stated or incorporated by reference therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading.

     (b) Each of the (i) audited consolidated balance sheets of the Company as
of December 31, 2000 and December 31, 1999 and the related consolidated
statements of operations, cash flows and changes in shareholders' equity
included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December
31, 2000 (the "10-K"), in each case, including any related notes thereto, as
filed with the SEC, and (ii) unaudited consolidated balance sheets of the
Company as of September 30, 2001 and December 31, 2000, and the related
consolidated statements of operations for each of the three month periods ended
September 30, 2001 and September 30, 2000 and the nine month periods ended
September 30, 2001 and September 30, 2000, and consolidated statements of cash
flows for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2001 and September 30,
2000, in each case, including any related notes thereto, as filed with the SEC
(collectively, the "Company Financial Statements"), have been prepared in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") applied on a
consistent basis throughout the periods involved (except as may be indicated in
the notes thereto, or in the case of the unaudited statements, as may be
permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC and subject, in the case of the unaudited
statements, to normal, recurring audit adjustments) and fairly present in all
material respects the consolidated financial position of the Company and its
Subsidiaries at the respective date thereof and the consolidated results of its
operations and changes in cash flows for the periods indicated.

     (c) Except as disclosed in Section 3.7(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter,
there are no liabilities of the Company or any Subsidiary of any kind
whatsoever, whether or not accrued and whether or not contingent or absolute,
that are material to the Company and the Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, other
than (i) liabilities disclosed or provided for in the consolidated balance sheet
of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of September 30, 2001, including the
notes thereto, (ii) liabilities disclosed in the SEC Reports, (iii) liabilities
incurred on behalf of the Company in connection with this Agreement and the
contemplated Merger, and (iv) liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past

                                        10
<PAGE>

practice since September 30, 2001, none of which are, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably likely to be material to the Company and the Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole. Section 3.7(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a
complete and correct list of all indebtedness guaranteed by the Company or any
Subsidiary.

     (d) The Company has heretofore furnished or made available to Parent a
complete and correct copy of any amendments or modifications which the Company
intends to file but which have not yet been filed with the SEC to agreements,
documents or other instruments which previously had been filed by the Company
with the SEC as exhibits to the SEC Reports pursuant to the Securities Act and
the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder or the Exchange Act and the
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.

     SECTION 3.8.  Absence of Certain Changes or Events.

     (a) Except as contemplated by this Agreement or as disclosed in the SEC
Reports filed prior to the date hereof, since December 31, 2000, the Company and
its Subsidiaries have conducted their respective businesses only in the ordinary
course and consistent with prior practice and there has not been (i) any event
or occurrence of any condition that individually or in the aggregate, has had or
could reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, (ii) any
declaration, setting aside or payment of any dividend or any other distribution
with respect to any of the capital stock of the Company or any Subsidiary, (iii)
except as set forth in Section 3.8(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter, any
material change in accounting methods, principles or practices employed by the
Company or any Subsidiary, or (iv) except as set forth in Section 3.8(a) of the
Company Disclosure Letter, any action of the type described in Sections 5.1(b)
or 5.1(c) which had such action been taken after the date of this Agreement
would be in violation of any such Section.

     (b) Since December 31, 2000, the Company has not received any written or,
to the knowledge of the Company, oral notice of (or, in the case of any
contract, lease or other arrangement that terminates or is extended by its terms
without the giving of notice, has otherwise become aware of) the termination or
extension of any Material Contract (as hereinafter defined), or suffered any
damage, destruction or loss (whether or not covered by insurance) to any Company
Property (as hereinafter defined) or any personal property of the Company or any
Subsidiary which, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected
to result in the Company's or a Subsidiary's loss of $50,000 or more.

     SECTION 3.9.  Taxes.

     (a) Except as set forth in Section 3.9(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter,
the Company and each of its Subsidiaries have timely filed all material Tax
Returns (as hereinafter defined) required to be filed by any of them. All such
Tax Returns are true, correct and complete in all material respects. All Taxes
(as hereinafter defined) of the Company and its Subsidiaries which are (i) shown
as due on such Tax Returns, (ii) otherwise due and payable or (iii) to the
Company's knowledge, claimed or asserted by any taxing authority to be due, have
been paid, except for those Taxes being contested in good faith and for which
adequate reserves have been established in the financial statements included in
the SEC Reports in accordance with GAAP. The Company and its Subsidiaries have
never received written notice from an authority in a jurisdiction where any of
the Company and its Subsidiaries does not file Tax Returns that any of them is
or may be subject to taxation by that jurisdiction that has not since been cured
by the filing of such return. There are no liens for any Taxes upon the assets
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, other than statutory liens for Taxes
not yet due and payable and liens for real estate Taxes contested in good faith.
Except as set forth in Section 3.9(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter, no Tax
Returns of the Company or its Subsidiaries are under audit or examination by any
taxing authority, and the Company does not know of any proposed or threatened
Tax claims, audits or assessments against the Company or any Subsidiary. Neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has made an election under Section
341(f) of the Code. None of the Company and its Subsidiaries (A) has been a
member of an affiliated group filing a consolidated federal income Tax Return
(other than a group the common parent of which was the Company) or (B) has any
liability for the Taxes of any person (other than any of the Company and its
Subsidiaries) under Treas. Reg. sec.1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state,
local, or

                                        11
<PAGE>

foreign law), as a transferee or successor, by contract, or otherwise. Neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has waived any statute of limitations in
respect of Taxes or agreed to any extension of time, in each case beyond the
date of this Agreement, with respect to a Tax assessment or deficiency. Each of
the Company and each Subsidiary has withheld and paid over to the relevant
taxing authority all Taxes required to have been withheld and paid in connection
with payments to employees, independent contractors, creditors, shareholders or
other third parties. Except as set forth in Section 3.9(a) of the Company
Disclosure Letter, the unpaid Taxes of the Company and its Subsidiaries for the
current taxable period did not, as of the most recent Company Financial
Statements, exceed the reserve for Tax liability set forth on the face of the
balance sheet in the most recent Company Financial Statements. For purposes of
this Agreement, (x) "Tax" (and, with correlative meaning, "Taxes") means any
federal, state, local or foreign income, gross receipts, property, sales, use,
occupancy, license, excise, franchise, employment, payroll, premium,
withholding, alternative or added minimum, ad valorem, transfer or excise tax,
or any other tax, custom, duty, governmental fee or other like assessment or
charge of any kind whatsoever, together with any interest or penalty or addition
thereto, whether disputed or not, imposed by any Governmental Entity, and (y)
"Tax Return" means any return, report or similar statement required to be filed
with respect to any Tax (including any attached schedules), including, without
limitation, any information return, claim for refund, amended return or
declaration of estimated Tax.

     (b) Section 3.9(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth with
reasonable specificity all jurisdictions in which the Company or any Subsidiary
currently has a presence requiring it to pay Taxes (a "Taxable Presence") and
all jurisdictions in which the Company or any Subsidiary has had a Taxable
Presence since January 1, 1998. The Company has made available to Parent correct
and complete copies of (i) all Tax Returns filed in connection with the three
year period ending on December 31, 2000 and (ii) all correspondence with any Tax
authorities (including, without limitation, all audits, notices and requests for
information from or to taxing authorities) since January 1, 1998.

     SECTION 3.10.  Assets.

     (a) Except as set forth in the 10-K, the SEC Reports filed thereafter, or
in Section 3.10(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter, the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries have good, marketable and, for the real property only, insurable
title to, or a valid leasehold interest in, all of their real and personal
properties and assets reflected in the 10-K or acquired after December 31, 2000
(other than any Unacquired Assets, or assets reflected in any SEC Reports filed
after the 10-K as having been disposed of since December 31, 2000 or otherwise
disposed of since December 31, 2000 in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice), in each case free and clear of all title
defects, liens, encumbrances and restrictions, except for (i) liens,
encumbrances or restrictions which secure indebtedness which are properly
reflected in the 10-K; (ii) liens for Taxes accrued but not yet payable; (iii)
liens arising as a matter of law in the ordinary course of business with respect
to obligations incurred after December 31, 2000, provided that the obligations
secured by such liens are not delinquent; (iv) such title defects, liens and
encumbrances and restrictions disclosed in the Title Documents (as hereinafter
defined); and (v) such title defects, liens and encumbrances and restrictions,
if any, that do not individually or in the aggregate, materially detract from
the value of the assets subject thereto or materially impact the operation of
the Company or any Subsidiary. Except as set forth in Section 3.10(a) of the
Company Disclosure Letter, the Company and each of its Subsidiaries either own
or have valid leasehold interests in all properties and assets used by them in
the conduct of their business. At the Effective Time, the personal property of
the Company and each Subsidiary (the "Personal Property") at each Company
Property (as hereinafter defined) shall be in sufficient levels so as to allow
for uninterrupted full service at each such Company Property in a manner
consistent with the Company's ordinary course of business and past practices
with respect to such Company Property.

     (b) Except as set forth in Section 3.10(b) of the Company Disclosure
Letter, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any legal
obligation, absolute or contingent, to any other person to sell or otherwise
dispose of any of its assets with an individual value of $50,000 or an aggregate
value in excess of $100,000, in each case, other than with respect to any
transfers of Unacquired Assets.

                                        12

     (c) Except for such property as shall have been taken out of service on a
temporary basis for repairs or replacement consistent with the Company's past
practices and normal industry practices, the buildings, fixtures and equipment
of the Company and its Subsidiaries are in good operating condition and repair
(ordinary wear and tear excepted), and are adequate for the uses to which they
are being put. The buildings, fixtures and equipment of the Company and its
Subsidiaries are sufficient for the continued conduct of the business of the
Company and its Subsidiaries after the Effective Time in substantially the same
manner as conducted prior to the Effective Time. Section 3.10(c) of the Company
Disclosure Letter sets forth a complete and accurate list of those rooms in any
of the Company's hotels that are not available for occupancy as of a date within
ten (10) days prior to the date hereof, and a brief explanation of why each such
room is not so available.

     (d) Section 3.10(d) of the Company Disclosure Letter (and the Title
Documents (as hereinafter defined)) sets forth a correct and complete list of
all real property (i) owned or leased by the Company or a Subsidiary, (ii) as to
which the Company or a Subsidiary has a license, easement or right of way to
use, (iii) as to which the Company or a Subsidiary has the option to purchase,
lease, license or acquire an easement or right of way or (iv) in which the
Company or a Subsidiary has any other interest. The list of real property in
Section 3.10(d) of the Company Disclosure Letter that is identified as being
owned by the Company or a Subsidiary includes a correct and complete list by
owner, property name, city and state of all real property (other than any
Unacquired Assets) owned by the Company or any Subsidiaries (the "Company
Properties"), and correctly identifies which entity is the record owner of title
to each such tract of real property (each being a "Company Property"). With
respect to each such Company Property, the entity identified in Section 3.10(d)
of the Company Disclosure Letter as owner, owns good, marketable and insurable
fee simple title to such Company Property, free and clear of all defects, liens,
encumbrances and restrictions other than (i) those existing title matters listed
as exceptions in the pro forma title policies or title insurance commitments
listed in Section 3.10(d) of the Company Disclosure Letter (the "Title
Documents"), (ii) those matters listed on Section 3.10(d) of the Company
Disclosure Letter as "Company Cure Items", (collectively, the "Company Cure

other matters as shall be set forth on Section 3.10(d) of the Company Disclosure
Letter, (all such matters referenced in clauses (i), (iii) and (iv) hereof being
sometimes collectively called the "Permitted Exceptions"). To the Company's

affect the Company Properties other than the Permitted Exceptions.

     (e) Except as described on Section 3.10(e) of the Company Disclosure Letter
and for the Permitted Exceptions, no Company Property or Personal Property or

default with respect to any contracts pertaining to the Company Properties, nor,

     (p) Except as set forth in Section 3.10(p) of the Company Disclosure
Letter, no condemnation, eminent domain or similar proceedings have been

default under any Material Contract, which defaults individually or in the
aggregate would reasonably be expected to be material to the Company or any
Subsidiary, and no circumstances exist that, with the passing of time or the
giving of notice, or both, would result in a default by the Company or any

respects, have been duly executed by the Company or one of its Subsidiaries
where applicable, and none of the Company, its Subsidiaries or, to the knowledge
of the Company, any other party thereto is in material default of its
obligations under such contracts. Except for this Agreement, the Material

construction or management of all or any part of the Company Properties.

order to make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading. The Proxy Statement will comply as to form

and the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, no representation or warranty is made by the Company with respect

any person (whether incorporated or unincorporated), that together with the
Company would be deemed a "single employer" within the meaning of Section 414 of
the Code, (an "ERISA Affiliate"), or to which such ERISA Affiliate makes or has
made, or has or has had an obligation to make, contributions at any time.

     (c) Except as set forth in Section 3.15(c) of the Company Disclosure

     3.15 of the Company Disclosure Letter, the Company has heretofore delivered
     or made available to Parent complete and accurate copies of the plan
     documents and any amendments thereto (or if the plan is not written, a
     written description thereof), any related trust or other funding vehicle,
     annual reports required to be filed with any Governmental Entity with
     respect to such plan, actuarial reports, funding and financial information
     returns and statements, all contracts with any parties providing services
     or insurance to such plan, copies of material correspondence with all
     Governmental Entities, plan summaries or summary plan descriptions, summary
     annual reports, booklets and personnel manuals and any other reports or
     summaries required under ERISA, the Code and all other applicable laws,
     regulations, orders or other legislative, administrative or judicial
     promulgations ("Applicable Benefit Laws"), the most recent determination
     letter received from the Internal Revenue Service with respect to each such
     plan intended to qualify under Section 401 of the Code, and such other
     documentation with respect to any Company Benefit Plan as is reasonably
     requested by Parent.

          (ii) The Company and its Subsidiaries have maintained all employee
     data necessary to administer each Company Benefit Plan, including data

          (iii) No Company Benefit Plan or ERISA Affiliate Plan is or was

     Benefit Plan or ERISA Affiliate Plan a "multiemployer pension plan", as
     defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA, or subject to Section 302 of ERISA.
     Neither the Company, any of its Subsidiaries, an ERISA Affiliate nor a
     predecessor in interest of any of them has or has had an obligation to
     reimburse another employer, either directly or indirectly, including
     through indemnification or otherwise, for making contributions to a plan
     that is or was subject to Title IV of ERISA.

          (iv) Each Company Benefit Plan has been established, registered,
     qualified, invested, operated and administered in all material respects in
     accordance with its terms in compliance with all Applicable Benefit Laws
     and in accordance with all understandings, written or oral, between the
     Company or its respective current or former employees, directors, officers,
     consultants, independent contractors, contingent workers or leased
     employees, as applicable. Neither the Company nor any of

     its Subsidiaries has incurred, and no facts exist which reasonably could be
     expected to result in any material liability to the Company or any of its
     Subsidiaries with respect to any Company Benefit Plan or any ERISA
     Affiliate Plan, including without limitation, any liability, tax, penalty
     or fee under ERISA, the Code or any Applicable Benefit Law (other than to
     pay premiums, contributions or benefits in the ordinary course).

          (v) All obligations regarding each Company Benefit Plan have been
     satisfied, and there are no outstanding defaults or violations by any party
     to any Company Benefit Plan. No taxes, penalties or fees are owing under
     any Company Benefit Plan.

          (vi) No fact or circumstance exists that could adversely affect the
     tax-exempt status of a Company Benefit Plan that is intended to be
     tax-exempt. Further, each Company Benefit Plan intended to be "qualified"
     within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code and the trusts maintained
     thereunder that are intended to be exempt from taxation under Section
     501(a) of the Code has received a favorable determination or other letter
     indicating that it is so qualified, or intends to submit a request for a
     determination letter within the applicable remedial amendment period, and
     the Company is not aware of any reason why such determination letter would
     not be issued by the Internal Revenue Service.

          (vii) The assets of each Company Benefit Plan are reported at their
     fair market value on the financial statements of each such plan as of the
     dates indicated on such statements.

          (viii) No Company Benefit Plan provides medical, surgical,
     hospitalization, death or similar benefits (whether or not insured) for
     current or former employees, directors, officers, consultants, independent
     contractors, contingent workers or leased employees (or any of their
     dependents, spouses or beneficiaries) of the Company, any or its
     Subsidiaries or any predecessor in interest of the Company or any of its
     Subsidiaries for periods extending beyond their retirement or other
     termination of service, other than continuation coverage mandated by
     Applicable Benefit Laws and only to the extent required under such laws.

          (ix) All contributions or premiums required to be made by any Company
     under the terms of each Company Benefit Plan or by Applicable Benefit Laws
     have been made in a timely fashion in accordance with Applicable Benefit
     Laws and the terms of the Company Benefit Plan. Each Company Benefit Plan
     is fully funded or fully insured on both an ongoing and termination or
     wind-up basis.

          (x) No insurance policy or any other insurance contract or agreement
     affecting any Company Benefit Plan requires or permits a retroactive
     increase in premiums or payments due thereunder.

          (xi) There have been no improper withdrawals, applications or
     transfers of assets from any Company Benefit Plan or the trusts or other
     funding media relating thereto, and neither the Company nor any of its
     Subsidiaries nor any of their agents has been in breach of any fiduciary
     obligation with respect to the administration of any Company Benefit Plan
     or the trusts or other funding media relating thereto.

          (xii) Each "employee benefit plan" (within the meaning of Section 3(3)
     of ERISA) of the Company by its terms or in the summary plan description
     for such plan provides that such plan may be amended, revised or terminated
     by the Company or the administrator of such plan, subject to contractual
     notice requirements.

          (xiii) Except as contemplated by Section 1.6, the execution, delivery
     and performance of, and consummation of the transactions contemplated by,
     this Agreement will not (A) entitle any current or former employee,
     director, officer, consultant, independent contractors, contingent worker
     or leased employee (or any of their dependents, spouses or beneficiaries)
     of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to severance pay, unemployment
     compensation or any other payment, or (B) accelerate the time of payment or
     vesting, or increase the amount of compensation due any such individual.

          (xiv) Except for payments under the Change of Control Agreements
     described in Section 3.11, the Company has not made any payments, is not
     obligated to make any payments, and is not a party

                                        19
<PAGE>

     to any agreement that under certain circumstances could obligate the
     Company to make any payments that will not be deductible for federal income
     tax purposes by reason of Section 280G of the Code.

          (xv) There are no pending, or, to the Company's knowledge, threatened
     Litigation by, against, involving or on behalf of any Company Benefit Plan
     by any current or former employee, director, officer, consultant,
     independent contractors, contingent worker or leased employee (or any of
     their dependents, spouses or beneficiaries) of the Company, any of its
     Subsidiaries or any predecessor in interest covered under such Company
     Benefit Plan, by any Governmental Entities or otherwise involving any such
     Company Benefit Plan (other than routine claims for benefits) that and, to
     the Company's knowledge, there exists no state of facts which after notice
     or lapse of time or both reasonably could be expected to give rise to any
     Litigation.

          (iv) each of the Franchisor's required FOCs were either properly

     one or more jurisdictions for its registrations for area franchise
     offerings, individual franchise offerings, and/or, if applicable, license
     offerings, the Franchisor did not offer or sell during the period of any
     such lapses any such area franchises, individual franchises, or, if
     applicable, licenses (A) in those jurisdictions, (B) to be operated outside
     those jurisdictions by residents of those jurisdictions, or (C) the sale of
     which might otherwise have triggered the application of the franchise
     registration laws of those jurisdictions during the periods of any such
     lapse;

          (viii) to the extent required by foreign, federal, state, and/or local
     law, the Franchisor has substantially complied with all applicable
     franchise advertising, and franchise sales broker filing requirements;

          (ix) neither the Franchisor nor, to the knowledge of the Company,
     after reasonable inquiry, any area franchisor or any of their employees,
     sales agents, or sales brokers for area franchises, individual franchises,
     or, if applicable, licenses, have provided information to prospective
     Franchisees that materially differs from the information contained in the
     FOCs provided to such prospects (including but not limited to "earnings
     claim" information);

          (x) the Franchisor has substantially complied with the requirements of
     appropriate franchise regulatory authorities by filing amendments to its

     or other matters requiring disclosure; and

          (xi) where required the Franchisor materially complied with foreign,
     federal, state, and/or local laws requiring registration, disclosure,
     and/or other compliance activities associated with any "material
     modifications" made to the Franchisor's then current area franchises,
     individual franchises, or, if applicable, licenses.

     (d) Franchise and Related Litigation.  The Franchisor's 2001 FOCs are the
most recent form of FOCs. The Franchisor has not received notice of any
threatened administrative, criminal and/or civil action against it and/or any
persons disclosed in Item II of the Franchisor's most recent applicable FOCs for
its area franchise agreement and individual franchise agreement where such
threatened administrative, criminal and/or material civil action alleges a
violation of a foreign and/or United States franchise, antitrust law, or
securities law, fraud, unfair or deceptive practices, or comparable allegations
as well as actions other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to the
Franchisor's business which are significant in the context of the number of the
Franchisor's franchisees and the size, nature, or financial condition of the
franchise system or its business operations.

     (e) Advertising Fund.  Except as set forth in Section 3.24(e) of the
Company Disclosure Letter, the Franchisor is not aware of any material
allegations that any of the expenditures from the Advertising Funds (as

other than expressly permitted by the contractual provisions associated with the
Advertising Fund, or was otherwise improper. Franchisor has maintained and
administered any collective advertising funds comprised of money paid by
Franchisees ("Advertising Funds") in compliance with all applicable state,
national, and international laws. The only covenants or agreements governing the
Advertising Funds are contained in the franchise agreements.

     (f) Franchise Terminations.  Since 1991, to the knowledge of the Company,
after reasonable inquiry, the Franchisor's termination of or effort to terminate
or refusal to renew any Franchisee has materially complied with applicable
foreign, federal, state, and/or local franchise termination laws and
regulations, including, without limitation, but not limited to, having provided
any such Franchisee involved in such a nonrenewal or termination any statutorily
required notice and opportunity to cure. Since 1991, the Franchisor has complied
with all other applicable foreign, federal or state laws and/or regulations
relating to ongoing franchise relationships, the termination of such
relationships, and/or the non-renewal of such relationships.

     SECTION 4.10.  Litigation.  There is no Litigation pending or, to the

Subsidiaries shall not take any action except in, the ordinary course of
business and in a manner consistent with prior practice; (ii) the Company and

2001 (disregarding, for purposes of this Section 5.1(a)(iv), any such adverse
impact resulting from seasonal trends or changes in the economy or the hotel

purposes of determining whether a Company Material Adverse Effect has occurred
pursuant to the definition thereof set forth in Section 8.11(b) hereof); (v) the
Company will continue to operate its properties (including by expending money
for repairs, maintenance and replacements) in a manner consistent with the

upon the exercise of Company Options outstanding as of the date of this
Agreement; (v) amend the Company Rights Plan except as necessary to comply with
the provisions of this Agreement; (vi) modify or adjust any Company Options or

     (c) Except as expressly contemplated or authorized by this Agreement or as
set forth on Section 5.1(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter, the Company
covenants and agrees that between the date of this Agreement and the Effective

bylaws or other equivalent organizational documents; (ii) create, assume or
incur any indebtedness for borrowed money or guaranty any such indebtedness of
another person, other than indebtedness owing to, or guaranties of indebtedness
owing to, the Company; (iii) make any loans or advances to any other person
other than loans or advances between any Subsidiaries of the Company or between
the Company and any of its Subsidiaries; (iv) sell, transfer, assign, mortgage,
pledge, lease or otherwise dispose of any of its assets or properties, or permit
any of its property, business or assets to be subject to any mortgage, lien,
security interest, deed to secure debt, deed of trust or other encumbrance,
restriction or charge of any kind, or enter into, amend, or cancel any
agreement, contract, commitment or arrangement for any of the foregoing, or
cause or allow any of the foregoing to occur; (v) merge or consolidate with any

except as required by GAAP or applicable Law; (vii) amend or terminate any
existing employment, severance, consulting, or other compensation agreement or
arrangement or enter into any new employment, severance, consulting or other
compensation agreement or arrangement or increase in any manner the base
compensation of, or enter into any new bonus or incentive agreement with any
directors or officers of the Company; (viii) amend or terminate any existing
employment, severance, consulting, or other compensation agreement or
arrangement (other than documented terminations for cause in material compliance
with applicable laws) or enter into any new employment, severance, consulting or
other compensation agreement or arrangement (other than any at-will employment
arrangement to fill an employment vacancy for the same general compensation and
benefits as the predecessor employee) or increase in any manner the base
compensation of, or enter into any new bonus or incentive agreement with any

agreement or commitment, that, in each case, is not terminable by the Company
upon 30 days notice (or less) without a fee or other penalty to the Company
(including, without limitation any contract, commitment or agreement to acquire
additional Technology Systems); provided, however, that this clause (xii) shall
not prohibit the Company from entering into any new franchise agreement with any
new or existing Franchisees substantially in the form of the agreements attached
to the Company's 2001 FOCs; (xiii) pay, loan or advance (other than the payment
of compensation, directors' fees or reimbursement of expenses in the ordinary
course of business) any amount to, or market, sell, transfer or lease any
properties or assets (real, personal or mixed, tangible or intangible) to, or
enter into any agreement with, any of its officers or

                                        32
<PAGE>

directors or any "affiliate" or "associate" of any of its officers or directors;

bond over) prior to Closing, in a fashion approved by the Parent in the Parent's
reasonable discretion, all Company Cure Items (without regard to the dollar
limitations set forth in this clause (xvii)), including all "standard
exceptions" and mechanic's, materialmen's and similar liens, so as to cause none
of the title policies delivered at Closing to have any exceptions for any
Company Cure Items); (xviii) pay, discharge or satisfy any liabilities or
obligations (whether absolute, accrued, asserted or unasserted, contingent or
otherwise), charge or encumbrance, in each case, involving amounts paid to a
single recipient in excess of $50,000 individually, and $150,000 in the
aggregate; (xix) acquire any real property or Personal Property, other than
acquisitions of Personal Property that are in the ordinary course of business
and consistent with past practice; (xx) fail to timely and correctly account for

unreasonably withheld in connection with the covenants set forth in Sections
5.1(c)(viii), 5.1(c)(xi) or 5.1(c)(xii) hereof. Further, Parent acknowledges
that its consent rights under Sections 5.1(a) and 5.1(c) are subject to the
implied duty of good faith, as applicable to contracts governed by Georgia law.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Holding, Parent and
Sub agree that the Company may incur and pay reasonable fees, costs and expenses
in connection with consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and may maintain, administer and make expenditures from the
Advertising Funds.

     (d) As soon as is reasonably practicable after the date hereof, the Company
shall deliver to its (i) executive officers, (ii) regional managers, (iii)
district managers and (iv) property level managers an explanation of the
operational limitations imposed by the provisions contained herein substantially
in the form of Exhibit 5.1(d).

     SECTION 5.2.  Access to Information; Confidentiality.

     (a) To the extent permitted by applicable Law, from the date hereof to the
Effective Time, the Company shall, and shall cause the officers, directors,
employees, auditors, attorneys, financial advisors, lenders and other agents
(collectively, the "Representatives") of the Company to, afford the
Representatives of Holding, Parent and Sub reasonable access at all reasonable
times to the officers, employees, agents, properties, offices and other
facilities, books and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and shall
furnish Holding, Parent and Sub with all financial, operating and other data and
information as Holding, Parent or Sub, through its Representatives, may
reasonably request. Nothing in this Section 5.2 shall require the Company to
provide access to or disclose information where such access or disclosure would
(i) result in the loss of any attorney-client privilege or (ii) be prohibited by
any confidentiality or non-disclosure agreement binding on the Company or any
Subsidiary. The parties hereto shall make appropriate substitute disclosure
arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions of clause (i) of the
preceding sentence apply. The Company shall furnish to Holding, Parent and Sub
monthly financial and operating data and information of the Company and all
Subsidiaries normally prepared by the Company as promptly as possible, but in no
event later than twenty-five (25) days following the end of each calendar month.
Holding and the Company will remain subject to the terms of a confidentiality
agreement between Holding and the Company dated October 2, 2000 (the
"Confidentiality Agreement"), and by executing this Agreement, Parent and Sub
shall become a party to the Confidentiality Agreement and agree to be bound by
the terms thereof to the extent Holding is so bound.

     (b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company agrees
and acknowledges that, from and after the date hereof and until the earlier of
the Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement, Parent shall be
permitted, except to the extent it would expressly violate applicable Law, to

                                        33
<PAGE>

have a representative present at the Company or any Subsidiary for purposes of
assuring compliance with the terms of this Agreement. The Company shall have the
right to have one or more representatives present at all times of any
inspections, interviews and communications conducted by Parent or its
representatives pursuant to this Section 5.2. Any investigations, inspections,
interviews and communications pursuant to this Section 5.2 shall be reasonably
related to the transactions contemplated hereby and conducted in such manner as
not to interfere unreasonably with the conduct of the business of the Company
and its Subsidiaries.

     (c) No investigation pursuant to this Section 5.2 shall affect any
representation or warranty in this Agreement of any party hereto or any
condition to the obligations of the parties hereto.

     SECTION 5.3.  Notification of Certain Matters.  The Company shall give
prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company, of
(i) the occurrence, or nonoccurrence, of any event which would be reasonably
likely to cause any representation or warranty made by it contained in this
Agreement to be materially untrue or inaccurate (without giving effect to any
qualifier with respect to materiality (including "Company Material Adverse
Effect") contained therein) and (ii) any failure by such party (or Holding or
Sub, in the case of Parent) in any material respect to comply with or satisfy
any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it
hereunder; provided, however, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this
Section 5.3 shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder
to the party receiving such notice. If any event or matter arises after the date
of this Agreement which, if existing or occurring at the date of this Agreement,
would have been required to be set forth or described in the Company Disclosure
Letter or which is necessary to correct any information in the Company
Disclosure Letter which has been rendered inaccurate thereby, then the Company
shall, for informational purposes only, promptly supplement, or amend, and
deliver to Parent the Company Disclosure Letter which it has delivered pursuant
to this Agreement.

     SECTION 5.4.  Reasonable Efforts; Further Assurances.

     (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the
parties hereto shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause
to be taken, all appropriate action and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable under applicable laws and regulations to
consummate and make effective the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement including, without limitation, using all commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain all licenses, permits, approvals, consents,
authorizations, qualifications and orders of each Governmental Entity and any
other third parties that are necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the
Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby (each a "Required Approval") and
to cause the conditions to Closing set forth in Article VI to be satisfied.

     (b) Each of the parties hereto shall, in connection with the efforts
referenced in Section 5.4(a) to obtain all Required Approvals, use its
commercially reasonable efforts to (i) cooperate in all respects with each other
in connection with any filing or submissions and in connection with any
investigation or other inquiry, including any proceeding initiated by a private
party, (ii) promptly inform the other party of any communication received by
such party from, or given by such party to, the Antitrust Division of the
Department of Justice (the "DOJ") or any other Governmental Entity and of any
material communication received or given in connection with any proceeding by a
private party, in each case regarding any of the transactions contemplated
hereby, and (iii) promptly inform the other party of the timing and content of
any communications with the DOJ or any such other Governmental Entity or, in
connection with any proceeding by a private party, with any other person, and to
the extent permitted by the DOJ or such other applicable Governmental Entity or
other person, give the other party the opportunity to attend and participate in
such meetings and conferences.

     (c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained in Sections 5.4(a) and 5.4(b), if any administrative or judicial
action or proceeding, including any proceeding by a private party, is instituted
(or threatened to be instituted) challenging any transaction contemplated by
this Agreement as violative of any Regulatory Law (as hereinafter defined), or
if any statute, rule, regulation, executive order, decree, injunction or
administrative order is enacted, entered, promulgated or enforced by a
Governmental Entity which would make the Merger or the transactions contemplated
hereby illegal or

                                        34
<PAGE>

would otherwise prohibit or materially impair or delay the consummation of the
Merger or the transactions contemplated hereby, each of the parties hereto shall
cooperate in all respects with each other and use its respective commercially
reasonable efforts to contest and resist any such action or proceeding and to
have vacated, lifted, reversed, or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction
or other action or order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is
in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the Merger
or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to have such statute,
rule, regulation, executive order, decree, injunction or administrative order
repealed, rescinded or made inapplicable. Notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be
required under the terms of this Agreement to dispose of or hold separate all or
any portion of the businesses or assets of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries in order to remedy or
otherwise address the concerns (whether or not formally expressed) of any
Governmental Entity under any antitrust statute or regulation. For purposes of
this Agreement, "Regulatory Law" means the Sherman Act, as amended, the Clayton
Act, as amended, the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as
amended, the Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, and all other Federal,
state and foreign, if any, statutes, rules, regulations, orders, decrees,
administrative and judicial doctrines and other laws that are designed or
intended to regulate mergers, acquisitions or other business combinations.

     (d) At and after the Effective Time, the officers and directors of the
Surviving Corporation and Parent will be authorized to execute and deliver, in
the name and on behalf of the Company, any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or
assurances and to take any other actions and do any other things, in the name
and on behalf of the Company, reasonably necessary to vest, perfect, or confirm
of record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation any and all right, title and
interest in, to and under any of the rights, properties or assets of the Company
acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in
connection with, the Merger.

     (e) In connection with, and without limiting the foregoing, the Company
shall (i) use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that no state
anti-takeover statute or similar statute or regulation is or becomes operative
with respect to this Agreement, the Merger or any other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or the Voting Agreement and (ii) if any state
anti-takeover statute or similar statute or regulation is or becomes operative
with respect to this Agreement, the Voting Agreement, the Merger or any other
transaction contemplated by this Agreement or the Voting Agreement, use its
commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that this Agreement, the Voting
Agreement, the Merger and any other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or the Voting Agreement may be consummated as promptly as reasonably practicable
on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and the Voting Agreement and
otherwise to minimize the effect of such statute or regulation on the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Voting Agreement.

     (f) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company agrees to
use commercially reasonable efforts and to cooperate with Holding, Parent and
Sub for purposes of (i) obtaining all consents and/or notifications required in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and continuation
of the Secured Debt, on terms no less favorable than the terms currently
applicable to the Company; (ii) obtaining an estoppel certificate substantially
in the form of Exhibit 5.4(f)(ii) hereto (the "Lender Estoppel") from all
lenders of Secured Debt (the "Secured Lenders"); (iii) obtaining consents and/or
notifications necessary to re-brand any Suburban branded assets as Intown Suites
branded assets; and (iv) providing for the termination and/or transfer of any or
all of the third party management agreements listed in Section 5.4(f) of the
Company Disclosure Letter, in each case upon or following the consummation of
the Merger. In addition, the Company acknowledges and agrees that Parent intends
to finance some or all of the Cash Merger Stock Consideration and the Total Cash
Option Consideration from one or more financing sources pursuant to the
Financing Commitments. Toward that end, the Company agrees to cooperate in good
faith and use commercially reasonable efforts to assist the Parent in obtaining
such financing.

     (g) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the parties agree to
cooperate in good faith and use their commercially reasonable efforts to ensure
that each of Chicago Title Insurance Company and

                                        35
<PAGE>

LandAmerica Financial Group, Inc. (the "Title Companies") is prepared at the
Closing to issue with respect to the Company Properties a title insurance policy
(ALTA Owner's Title Insurance Policy -- Form B), and a corresponding lender's
title insurance policy, and all endorsements attached to the Title Documents in
accordance with each of the Title Documents subject only to the Permitted
Exceptions (upon receipt of its required title insurance premium and performance
of any actions necessary to be performed by Parent or the Company or the
Subsidiaries under or in connection with such Title Documents, execution and
delivery to the Title Companies of standard seller title affidavits and such
other usual and customary obligations such as delivery of organizational
documents, authorizing resolutions and consents, and evidence of good standing).

     SECTION 5.5.  Board Recommendations.

     (a) In connection with the Merger and Shareholders' Meeting, the Board of
Directors of the Company shall (i) subject to Section 5.5(b), recommend to the
Shareholders that they vote in favor of the Merger and use all commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain the necessary approvals by the Company Shareholders
of this Agreement and (ii) otherwise comply with all legal requirements
applicable to such meeting.

     (b) Neither the Board of Directors of the Company, nor any committee
thereof, shall, except as expressly permitted by this Section 5.5(b) (i)
withdraw, qualify or modify, or propose publicly to withdraw, qualify or modify,
in a manner adverse to Parent, the approval or recommendation of the Board of
Directors or such committee of the Merger or this Agreement, (ii) approve or
recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend, any transaction
involving an Acquisition Proposal (as hereinafter defined) from a third party
(an "Alternative Transaction"), or (iii) cause the Company to enter into any
letter of intent, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement or other similar
agreement (each, an "Acquisition Agreement") related to any Alternative
Transaction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, prior to the approval of this
Agreement by the Company Shareholders, the Board of Directors of the Company
determines in good faith, after it has received a Superior Proposal (as
hereinafter defined) in compliance with Section 5.9 and after taking into
consideration advice from outside counsel with respect to its fiduciary duties
to Company Shareholders under applicable Georgia law, that such action is
required for the Board of Directors of the Company to comply with its fiduciary
obligations to the Company Shareholders under applicable law, the Board of
Directors of the Company may (subject to this and the following sentences)
inform Company Shareholders and publicly announce that it no longer believes
that the Merger is advisable and no longer recommends approval (a "Subsequent
Determination") and enter into an Acquisition Agreement with respect to a
Superior Proposal and approve or recommend such Superior Proposal, but only at a
time that is after the third business day (or the second business day in the
case of a material amendment to a Superior Proposal) following Parent's receipt
of written notice advising Parent that the Board of Directors of the Company is
prepared to accept a Superior Proposal. Such written notice shall specify the
material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal (and include a copy
thereof with all accompanying documentation, if in writing), identify the person
making such Superior Proposal and state that the Board of Directors of the
Company intends to make a Subsequent Determination. During such three (3)
business day period, the Company shall provide an opportunity for Parent to
propose such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement as would
enable the Board of Directors to proceed with its recommendation to its
shareholders without a Subsequent Determination. For purposes of this Agreement,
a "Superior Proposal" means any proposal (on its most recently amended or
modified terms, if amended or modified) made by a third party to enter into an
Alternative Transaction which the Board of Directors of the Company determines
in its good faith judgment (after receiving the advice of an independent
financial advisor) to be more favorable to the Company Shareholders than the
Merger from a financial point of view taking into account all relevant factors
(including whether, in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of the
Company (after receiving the advice of an independent financial advisor), the
third party is reasonably able to finance the transaction, and any proposed
changes to this Agreement that may be proposed by Parent in response to such
Alternative Transaction prior to the date of such determination).

                                        36
<PAGE>

     (c) Nothing contained in this Section 5.5 or any other provision hereof
shall prohibit the Company or any member of the Board of Directors of the
Company from (i) taking and disclosing to its shareholders a position
contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act with respect to
a tender or exchange offer by a third party, or (ii) from making any disclosure
to the Company Shareholders if, in the good faith judgment of the Board of
Directors of the Company, or such member, after consultation with outside
counsel, failure so to disclose would be inconsistent with applicable Law;
provided, however, neither the Company, its Board of Directors or any committee
of the Board of Directors, shall, except as specifically permitted by Section
5.5(b), withdraw, qualify, or modify, or propose to withdraw, qualify or modify,
its position with respect to the Merger or this Agreement or approve or
recommend, or propose to approve or recommend an Alternative Transaction.
Subject to the first sentence of this Section 5.5(c), the taking and disclosure
of a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a)(2) and (3) promulgated under the
Exchange Act shall not constitute a withdrawal, qualification or modification of
the Company's position with respect to the Merger or this Agreement.

     SECTION 5.6.  Shareholder Litigation.  The Company shall give Parent the
opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any shareholder
Litigation against the Company and its directors relating to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or the Merger; provided, however, that no such
settlement shall be agreed to without Parent's consent which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld.

     SECTION 5.7.  Indemnification.

     (a) It is understood and agreed that all rights to indemnification by the
Company now existing in favor of each present and former director and officer of
the Company or its Subsidiaries (the "Indemnified Parties") as provided in the
Company Articles of Incorporation or the Company Bylaws, in each case as in
effect on the date of this Agreement, or pursuant to any other agreements in
effect on the date hereof, copies of which have been provided to Parent, shall
survive the Merger and Parent shall (i) cause the Surviving Corporation to
continue in full force and effect for a period of at least six (6) years from
the Effective Time and (ii) perform, or cause the Surviving Corporation to
perform, in a timely manner, the Surviving Corporation's obligations with
respect thereto. Parent and Sub agree that any claims for indemnification
hereunder as to which they have received written notice prior to the sixth
anniversary of the Effective Time shall survive, whether or not such claims
shall have been finally adjudicated or settled.

     (b) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, and the Surviving
Corporation shall, maintain in effect for six (6) years from the Effective Time,
if available, the current directors' and officers' liability insurance policies
("D&O Insurance") for the benefit of those persons covered by such policies
(provided that the Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor policies of at
least the same coverage containing terms and conditions which are not materially
less favorable) with respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective Time;
provided, however, that in no event shall the Surviving Corporation be required
to expend pursuant to this Section 5.7(b) more than an amount per year equal to
two hundred percent (200%) of current annual premiums paid by the Company for
such insurance (such amount, the "Maximum Premium"). In the event that, but for
the proviso to the immediately preceding sentence, the Surviving Corporation
would be required to expend more than two hundred percent (200%) of current
annual premiums, the Surviving Corporation shall obtain the maximum amount of
such insurance obtainable by payment of annual premiums equal to two hundred
percent (200%) of current annual premiums. If the Surviving Corporation elects
to reduce the amount of insurance coverage pursuant to the preceding sentence,
it will furnish to the officers and directors currently covered by such D&O
coverage reasonable notice of such reduction in coverage and shall, to the
extent additional coverage is available, afford such persons the opportunity to
pay such additional premiums as may be necessary to maintain the existing level
of D&O Insurance Coverage.

     (c) If the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or
(ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the
successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation shall assume the obligations
set forth in this Section 5.7.

                                        37
<PAGE>

     (d) The obligations set forth in this Section 5.7 shall be joint and
several obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation, and each of the
Company's current and former officers and directors who may be Indemnified
Parties or covered by the D&O Insurance shall be intended third party
beneficiaries thereof and shall be entitled to enforce such obligations directly
against Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be.

     SECTION 5.8.  Public Announcements.  Parent and the Company shall consult
with each other before issuing any press release or otherwise making any public
statements with respect to this Agreement or the Merger and shall not issue any
such press release or make any such public statement prior to such consultation,
except as may be required by Law or any listing agreement with a national
securities exchange or trading system to which Parent or the Company is a party.
The parties agree that the initial press release to be issued with respect to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will be as set forth in Exhibit
5.8 to this Agreement.

     SECTION 5.9.  Acquisition Proposals.  The Company shall not, nor shall it
authorize or permit any of its Subsidiaries or Representatives to, directly or
indirectly, (a) solicit, initiate or encourage the submission of any Acquisition
Proposal or (b) participate in or encourage any discussion or negotiations
regarding, or furnish to any person any non-public information with respect to,
or take any other action to knowingly facilitate any inquiries with respect to,
or the making of, any proposal that constitutes, or may reasonably be expected
to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal; provided, however, that the foregoing
shall not prohibit the Board of Directors of the Company from furnishing
information to, or entering into discussions or negotiations with, any person or
entity that makes an unsolicited Acquisition Proposal prior to the approval of
this Agreement by the Company Shareholders if, and to the extent that, (A) the
Board of Directors of the Company, after taking into consideration advice of
independent outside legal counsel, determines in good faith that such action is
required for the Board of Directors of the Company to comply with its fiduciary
obligations to the Company Shareholders under applicable Georgia law, (B) prior
to taking such action, the Company receives from such person or entity an
executed agreement in reasonably customary form relating to the confidentiality
of information to be provided to such person or entity and (C) the Board of
Directors of the Company concludes in good faith (after receiving the advice of
an independent financial advisor), that the Acquisition Proposal is a Superior
Proposal. The Company shall provide immediate oral and written notice to Parent
of (a) the receipt of any such Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry which could
reasonably be expected to lead to any Acquisition Proposal, (b) the material
terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal or inquiry, (c) the identity
of such person or entity making any such Acquisition Proposal or inquiry and (d)
the Company's intention to furnish information to, or enter into discussions or
negotiations with, such person or entity. The Company shall continue to keep
Parent informed of the status and details of any such Acquisition Proposal or
inquiry. For purposes of this Agreement, "Acquisition Proposal" means any bona
fide proposal with respect to a merger, consolidation, share exchange, tender
offer or similar transaction involving the Company or any Subsidiary, or any
purchase or other acquisition of all or any portion of the assets of the Company
or any Subsidiary or any equity interest in the Company (other than in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice).

necessary in accordance with applicable Law and the Company Articles of
Incorporation and Company Bylaws to duly call, give notice of, and convene the
Shareholders' Meeting.

     (b) Subject to Sections 5.5 and 5.9 hereof, the Company shall solicit from

     SECTION 5.11.  Proxy Statement.

     (a) In consultation with Parent, the Company will as promptly as reasonably
practicable following the execution of this Agreement prepare, and file the
Proxy Statement with the SEC and will use all commercially reasonable efforts to
respond to the comments of the SEC and to cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed
to the Company Shareholders at the earliest reasonably practical time. The
Company shall furnish all information concerning it and the holders of its
capital stock as Parent may reasonably request in connection with this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each party to this
Agreement will notify the other parties promptly of the receipt of the comments
of the SEC, if any, and of any request by the SEC for amendments or supplements
to the Proxy Statement or for additional information with respect thereto, and
will supply the other parties with copies of all correspondence between such
party or its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or members of its
staff, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement or the Merger. If
(i) at any time prior to the Shareholders' Meeting, any event should occur
relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that, in the good faith
judgment of the Company, should be set forth in an amendment of, or a supplement
to, the Proxy Statement, the Company will promptly inform Holding and Parent and
(ii) if at any time prior to the Shareholders' Meeting, any event should occur
relating to Parent or Sub or any of their respective associates or affiliates,
or relating to the plans of any such persons for the Company after the Effective
Time that, in the good faith judgment of Parent, should be set forth in an
amendment of, or a supplement to, the Proxy Statement, Parent will promptly
inform the Company, and in the case of (i) or (ii) the Company will, upon
learning of such event, promptly prepare, and the Company shall file and, if
required, mail such amendment or supplement to the Company Shareholders;
provided, prior to such filing or mailing, the Company and Parent shall consult
with each other with respect to such amendment or supplement and shall
incorporate the other's reasonable comments thereon. Parent shall vote, or cause
to be voted, in favor of the Merger and this Agreement all shares of Company
Stock directly or indirectly beneficially owned by it.

     (b) The Company hereby consents to the inclusion in the Proxy Statement of
the recommendation of the Board of Directors of the Company described in Section
3.3, subject to any modification, amendment or withdrawal thereof, and
represents that the Independent Advisor has, subject to the terms of its
engagement letter with the Company (the "Independent Advisor Engagement
Letter"), consented to the inclusion of its opinion in the Proxy Statement. The
Company and its counsel shall permit Parent and its counsel to participate in
all communications with the SEC and its staff, including any meetings and
telephone conferences, relating to the Proxy Statement, the Merger or this
Agreement.

     SECTION 5.12.  Director Resignations.  The Company shall cause to be
delivered to Parent resignations of all the directors of the Company's
Subsidiaries to be effective upon the consummation of the Merger. The Company
shall cause such directors, prior to resignation, to appoint new directors
nominated by Parent to fill such vacancies.

     SECTION 5.13.  Company Options.  As promptly as practicable following the
date hereof, the Company shall take all action necessary to ensure that all
outstanding Company Options shall be exercisable in full immediately prior to
the consummation of the Merger and that all Company Options that are not
exercised prior to the Merger will be canceled as of the Effective Time in
exchange for the Option Consideration described in Section 1.6 of this
Agreement. The Company will provide evidence of cancellation reasonably
satisfactory to Parent for each Company Option at or prior to the Effective
Time.

     SECTION 5.14.  Third Party Notifications.  As soon as is reasonably
practicable after the date hereof, the Company shall deliver to each of (i) its
Major Suppliers and (ii) its Major Customers a notice relating to certain
restrictions applicable to the Company, in form reasonably acceptable to the
Company and Parent.

     SECTION 5.15.  Title Documents and Surveys.  The Company agrees to use its

     SECTION 5.16.  Unacquired Assets.  Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company, or its Subsidiaries, (a) shall (i) create the Liquidating Trust, which
shall be governed by a trust agreement having substantially the terms set forth
on Section 5.16 of the Company Disclosure Letter (the "Trust Agreement") and
(ii) organize the Liquidating Company, which shall be governed by an operating
agreement and plan of liquidation having substantially the terms set forth on
Section 5.16 of the Company Disclosure Letter (the "Operating Agreement") and
(b) shall have taken all steps necessary, in a fashion reasonably acceptable to
Holding, Parent and Sub, to complete the transactions set forth in Section 5.16
of the Company Disclosure Letter with respect to the assets of the Company and
its Subsidiaries identified therein (the "Unacquired Assets") (the transactions
set forth in Section 5.16 of the Company Disclosure Letter are referred to
herein as the "Divestiture"). The parties hereto understand and agree that all
of the Unacquired Assets will be owned by the Liquidating Trust or the
Liquidating Company from and after the Effective Time, provided, however, that
none of Holding, Parent, Sub, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective officers, directors, employees, agents, affiliates, successors or
assigns shall have any liability or responsibility for the consummation of the
Divestiture, or for any cost, expense or liability associated therewith
(including without limitation the administration of the Liquidating Trust and
Liquidating Company), or for any cost, expense or liability attributable to any
of the Unacquired Assets, including those surviving liabilities in connection
with the acquisition agreements for the Unacquired Assets, which liabilities
will be expressly assumed by the Liquidating Company. The Liquidating Trust and
Liquidating Company shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Holding, Parent,
Sub and the Surviving Corporation, and their respective officers, directors,
employees, agents, affiliates, successors and assigns for any cost, expense or
liability incurred by any of the foregoing in connection with the Divestiture,
or any of the Unacquired Assets under the terms of the Indemnification Agreement
(as hereinafter defined). Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement
to the contrary, and subject to all documents related to the Divestiture being
reasonably acceptable to Parent, it is understood and agreed that consummation
of the Divestiture as more fully described in Section 5.16 of the Company
Disclosure Letter will not constitute or result in (i) breach or violation of
any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of the Company set forth
herein, or (ii) a Company Material Adverse Effect, or a change or event that
will be considered in determining whether a Company Material Adverse Effect has
occurred. At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall complete the
Divestiture in a manner that does not require the Divestiture to be registered
under applicable state and Federal securities laws. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the Divestiture will be
restructured to the extent necessary to ensure that it is completed in a manner
that does not require that the Divestiture be registered under applicable state
and Federal securities laws.

     SECTION 5.17  Other Party Cooperation.  Upon request from Parent from time
to time prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts prior to the Effective Time to obtain appropriate approval or
nonopposition letters from landowners of certain properties adjacent to certain
of the Company Properties in connection with Parent's attempt to obtain certain
variances or similar actions which Parent may elect to pursue with respect to
such Company Properties as well as consents, estoppels or subordination,
non-disturbance or attornment agreements from certain parties to or
beneficiaries of agreements, declarations or covenants that affect any of the
Company Properties, or Governmental Entities regarding any of the Company
Properties (each, a "Real Property Estoppel"), each as reasonably requested in
writing by Parent.

     SECTION 5.18  Certain Tax Matters.

     (a) Tax Periods Ending on or Before the Effective Time.  Parent shall
prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed all Tax Returns
for the Company and its Subsidiaries for all periods ending on or prior to the
Effective Time which are filed after the Effective Time. Parent agrees to file
all such Tax Returns in a manner that treats the Divestiture for Tax purposes
consistently, except as otherwise required by law, with the Tax treatment
described in Section 5.16 of the Company Disclosure Letter. Parent agrees to
deliver to the trustee of the Liquidating Trust a copy of all such tax returns
at least ten (10) days before the date such tax returns are filed; provided,
that Parent acknowledges that the

                                        40
<PAGE>

date of delivery for such tax returns will be the date that a tax return in
substantially the form as the return filed is delivered to the trustee of the
Liquidating Trust.

     (b) Tax Periods Beginning Before and Ending After the Effective
Time.  Parent shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be
filed any Tax Returns of the Company and its Subsidiaries for Tax periods which
begin before the Effective Time and end after the Effective Time. Parent agrees
to file all such Tax Returns in a manner that treats the Divestiture for Tax
purposes consistently, except as otherwise required by law, with the Tax
treatment described in Section 5.16 of the Company Disclosure Letter. Parent
agrees to provide the trustee of the Liquidating Trust a copy of all such tax
returns at least ten (10) days before the date such tax returns are filed;
provided, that Parent acknowledges that the date of delivery for such tax
returns will be the date that a tax return in substantially the form as the
return filed is delivered to the trustee of the Liquidating Trust

     (c) Tax Sharing Agreements.  Any tax sharing agreement with respect to or
involving the Company (or any of its Subsidiaries) shall be terminated as of the
Effective Time and shall have no further effect for any taxable year (whether
the current year, a future year, or a past year).

     SECTION 5.19  Inventory.  No later than the Effective Time, the Company
shall deliver to Parent a reasonably complete and correct inventory of all
Personal Property of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of a date that is
within ten (10) days prior to the date of the Closing.

     SECTION 5.20  Employee Benefit Plans.

     (a) The Company shall amend the Suburban Lodges of America, Inc. Employee
Savings Plan ("401(k) Plan") to bring it into compliance with applicable law
prior to the Closing, to terminate the 401(k) Plan effective immediately prior
to the Closing, to cease all further contributions to the 401(k) Plan for pay
periods beginning on or after the Closing (other than as required to repay loans
made thereunder), to cease making any additional loans to participants under the
401(k) Plan effective as of the termination of such plan. Within a reasonable
period prior to the Closing, the Company shall provide to Parent a copy of the
amended 401(k) Plan, a completed Internal Revenue Service Form 5310 with
attachments in respect of the termination of the 401(k) Plan and written
resolutions authorizing the termination of the 401(k) Plan and other actions
contemplated by this Section 5.20(b), each of which shall be reasonably
satisfactory to Parent.

     (b) From and after the date hereof, the Company shall (i) provide all
documentation and information requested by or on behalf of Parent with respect
to the Company Benefit Plans, including, but not limited to nondiscrimination
testing data for the 401(k) Plan for 1995 through 1998, a copy of the Section
125/cafeteria plan document, a copy of the insurance policy for the Company's
long term disability policy, and all information needed to file Internal Revenue
Service Form 5310 or to make such other filings with the Internal Revenue
Service or the Department of Labor as Parent may require; (ii) take all action
necessary to correct any compliance deficiencies identified in any schedule or
annex to this Agreement or otherwise identified with reasonable detail to
Company or its Subsidiaries by Parent with respect to any Company Benefit Plan;
and (iii) provide evidence reasonably satisfactory to Parent of such
corrections.

     (c) Parent agrees that within twelve (12) months of the Closing all
employees of the Company who continue employment with the Surviving Corporation
or any subsidiary thereof after the Effective Time ("Continuing Employees") will
be eligible to participate in employee benefit programs maintained for the
benefit of employees of the Surviving Corporation, any Subsidiary of the
Surviving Corporation, Parent or Holding (each a "Parent Benefit Plan") on the
same basis and subject to the same terms and conditions as similarly situated
employees of the Surviving Corporation, Parent and Holding or any of their
respective subsidiaries; provided that the determination of "similarly situated"
and the effective time of such participation shall be in the discretion of
Parent or Holding. Prior to the commencement of eligibility to participate in a
Parent Benefit Plan by any Continuing Employee, Parent agrees to continue the
corresponding Company Benefit Plan and the Continuing Employee's participation
in such plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Continuing Employees shall be
eligible to participate in the Intown

                                        41
<PAGE>

Suites Management, Inc. 401(k) Salary Reduction Plan and Trust as of the first
entry date following the Closing, which is expected to be July 1, 2002, subject
to the terms of such plan. Each of Holding and Parent shall, or shall cause its
subsidiaries to, cause each Parent Benefit Plan to treat the prior service with
the Company and its affiliates of each Continuing Employee immediately prior to
the Closing as service rendered to Parent or its subsidiaries, as the case may
be, for purposes of eligibility to participate in and vesting thereunder (but
not benefit accrual) to the same extent such service is recognized under
corresponding plans, programs or arrangements of the Company or its affiliates
prior to the Closing; provided, however, that each such employee shall be given
credit for his or her service with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior
to the Effective Time for purposes of determining the amount of vacation to
which such employee is entitled in accordance with Parent's policies following
the Effective Time; provided, further, that such crediting of service shall not
operate to duplicate any benefit or the funding of such benefit. Parent agrees
that the Surviving Corporation shall be responsible for providing all legally-
mandated continuation coverage for Continuing Employees and their covered
dependents who experience a loss of coverage due to a "qualifying event" (within
the meaning of Section 603 of ERISA) which occurs at any time on or after the
Effective Time, as well as for all former employees of the Company and its
affiliates who, as of the Effective Time, have elected or are eligible to and
within the applicable time periods, elect continuation coverage. Nothing in this
Section 5.20(c) is intended to create any employment obligation other than as
employees at will who may be terminated with or without cause.

     (d) The Company agrees that three (3) business days prior to the Effective
Time, it will provide a schedule to Parent which identifies (i) each employee
who will be on FMLA leave at the Effective Time and his or her job title and
description, salary and benefits; (ii) each employee who has requested FMLA
leave to begin after the Effective Time; (iii) a description of the leave
requested; and (iv) a copy of all notices provided to such employee regarding
that leave.

     SECTION 5.21  Environmental Insurance.  On or prior to the date hereof, the
Company has provided to Parent a form of environmental insurance policy relating
to the Company's Dale Mabry site (the "Environmental Policy"). The Company shall
use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Environmental Policy to be provided
to Parent at the Closing, to be effective at such time.

     SECTION 5.22  Software Support.  Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts and to cooperate with Parent
to cause Radiant Systems, Inc. to enter into an agreement with the Company in
form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent for the provision of
transition support for the legacy system.

     SECTION 5.23.  Undertaking of Holding.  Holding shall perform, or cause to
be performed, when due, all obligations of each of Parent, Sub and Surviving
Corporation under this Agreement.

                                   ARTICLE VI

     by the requisite vote of the Company Shareholders, if and to the extent
     required by the GBCC, the Company Articles of Incorporation and the Company
     Bylaws;

          (b) No temporary restraining order, preliminary or permanent
     injunction or other order issued by any court of competent jurisdiction or
     other legal restraint or prohibition preventing the consummation of the
     Merger or the Divestiture shall be in effect; provided, however, that the
     parties invoking this condition shall use all commercially reasonable
     efforts to have any such order or injunction vacated; and

                                        42
<PAGE>

          (c) All actions by or in respect of or filings with any Governmental
     Entity required to permit the consummation of the Merger shall have been

     except to the extent that such representations and warranties address
     matters only as of a particular date, in which case such representations
     and warranties shall be true and correct in all material respects as of
     such earlier date, and in the case of clauses (A) and (B) without giving
     effect to any exceptions or qualifications for "material" or "materiality"
     or "Company Material Adverse Effect" contained in the text of the
     representation or warranty; provided, however, that the condition to the
     obligations of Holding, Parent and Sub set forth in this Section 6.2(a)(i)
     shall be deemed to be satisfied in full unless, in the aggregate, all such
     failures of the Company's representations and warranties to be true and
     correct as set forth above will cost Holding, Parent, the Company and/or
     any Subsidiary, or would reasonably be expected to cost Holding, Parent,
     the Company and/or any Subsidiary, an amount, net of insurance proceeds
     actually received or reasonably certain to be received, equal to or in
     excess of $5,000,000 (for the avoidance of doubt, and without limiting the
     generality of the foregoing, the parties are agreed that, for the purpose

     dollar threshold contained in Section 3.8(b) shall not apply), (ii) the
     Company shall have performed in all material respects all agreements,

     therein, the Company shall be deemed to have failed to perform "in all
     material respects" covenants required to be performed and complied with by
     it under this Agreement to the extent it breaches in any respect whatsoever
     any covenant set forth in Section 5.1(b)(i), 5.1(c)(ii) or 5.1(c)(vii)),
     and (iii) the Company shall have delivered to Parent a certificate to the
     effect that each of the conditions specified in (i) and (ii) above is
     satisfied in all respects;

          (b) There shall not be pending any action, proceeding, application or
     counterclaim by any third party before any court or governmental regulatory
     or administrative agency, authority or tribunal which challenges or seeks
     to challenge, restrain or prohibit the consummation of the Merger or the
     Divestiture;

          (c) Since the date of this Agreement, there shall not have occurred
     any change, condition, event or development that has resulted in, or could
     reasonably be expected to result in, whether individually or in the
     aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect;

          (d) Other than as expressly permitted herein, from and after the date
     of this Agreement, there shall have been no sale, transfer, license,
     conveyance, pledge or other disposition of all or any part of the Company
     Properties;

          (e) Parent shall have received owner's title insurance policies and

     Section 3.10(d) to the Company Disclosure Letter (with all Company Cure
     Items remedied and satisfied to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent) (for
     the avoidance of doubt, any changes or modifications to the exceptions
     listed in the Title Documents or the endorsements attached thereto that
     shall not be reasonably satisfactory to Parent shall be deemed to be
     substantial);

          (f) Kilpatrick Stockton LLP, counsel to the Company, shall have

     action vacated;

          (c) by any of Holding, Parent, Sub or the Company if the Merger shall
     not have been consummated by May 14, 2002 for any reason; provided,
     however, that the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section
     7.1(c) shall not be available to Holding, Parent or Sub if the failure of
     any of such parties to fulfill any obligation of such party under this
     Agreement has been the primary cause of, or resulted in, the failure to
     consummate the Merger on or before such date, and the right to terminate
     this Agreement under this Section 7.1(c) shall not be available to the
     Company if the failure of the Company to fulfill any obligation of such
     party under this Agreement has been the primary cause of, or resulted in,
     the failure to consummate the Merger on or before such date;

          (d) by Holding, Parent or Sub if the Board of Directors of the Company
     or any committee of the Board of Directors of the Company (i) shall have
     withdrawn or shall have modified in a manner adverse to Holding, Parent or
     Sub its approval or recommendation of the Merger or this Agreement, (ii)
     causes the Company to enter into an agreement with respect to an
     Alternative Transaction, (iii) shall have endorsed, approved or recommended
     any Alternative Transaction or (iv) shall have resolved to do any of the
     foregoing;

          (e) by any of the Company, Holding, Parent or Sub, if this Agreement
     and the Merger shall fail to be approved and adopted by the Company
     Shareholders at the Shareholders' Meeting (including any adjournment
     thereof);

          (f) By Holding, Parent or Sub, if either (i) any of the conditions set
     forth in Sections 6.1 or 6.2 shall have become incapable of fulfillment and
     shall not have been waived by Holding, Parent and Sub or (ii) (A) the
     Company shall breach in any material respect any of its representations,
     warranties, covenants or other obligations hereunder or, as of any date
     after the date of this Agreement, the representations and warranties of the
     Company shall fail to be true and correct in all material respects as of
     such date such that, in either such case, the condition to the obligations
     of Holding, Parent and Sub set forth in Section 6.2(a) would not then be
     satisfied, and (B) if and to the extent such breach or failure is capable
     of being cured by Company, within ten (10) business days after written
     notice of such breach or failure to the Company from Parent, the Company
     shall not have taken or caused to be taken such actions as shall be
     necessary to cure such breach or failure to the extent necessary in order
     for the condition to the obligations of Holding, Parent and Sub set forth
     in Section 6.2(a) to be satisfied on or before the Effective Time;

          (g) by the Company, if (i) any of the conditions set forth in Sections
     6.1 or 6.3 shall have become incapable of fulfillment and shall not have
     been waived by the Company or (ii) Holding, Parent or Sub shall breach in
     any material respect any of their respective representations, warranties or
     obligations hereunder and, within ten (10) days after written notice of
     such breach to Parent from the Company, such breach shall not have been
     cured in all material respects or waived by the Company and Parent or Sub,
     as the case may be, shall not have provided reasonable assurance to the
     Company that such breach will be cured in all material respects on or
     before the Effective Time;

          (h) by the Company if, in compliance with its obligations under
     Sections 5.5 and 5.9, (i) the Board of Directors of the Company shall have
     withdrawn or shall have modified in a manner adverse to Holding, Parent or
     Sub its approval or recommendation of the Merger or this Agreement and (ii)
     the Company shall have entered into an agreement with respect to a Superior
     Proposal; or

          (i) by Holding, Parent or Sub, for any other reason in its sole
     discretion, regardless of whether the conditions in Article VI have been
     satisfied.

     SECTION 7.2.  Effect of Termination.

     (a) In the event of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section
7.1 hereof, this Agreement shall forthwith be terminated and have no further
effect except as specifically provided herein and, except as provided in this
Section 7.2 and in Section 8.12, there shall be no liability on the part of any
party

                                        45
<PAGE>

hereto, provided that nothing herein shall relieve any party from liability for
fraud in connection with, or any willful breach of, this Agreement.

     (b) If Holding, Parent or Sub exercises its right to terminate this
Agreement under Section 7.1(d), or the Company exercises its right to terminate
this Agreement under Section 7.1(h), the Company shall pay to Parent upon demand
Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000) less any amount previously paid or then
payable to Parent pursuant to Section 7.2(d) hereof (the "Termination Fee"),
payable in same-day funds.

     (c) If within one year after termination of this Agreement pursuant to
Section 7.1(f)(ii) (but only to the extent (i) the Company is not entitled to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(g)(ii) at the time of such
termination and (ii) such termination is the result of (x) one or more breaches
of representations or warranties of the Company which were known to the Company
to be false when made or (y) a knowing and willful breach by the Company of the
agreements and covenants required to be performed and complied with by it under
this Agreement), the Company shall enter into any agreement relating to, or
consummate, an Acquisition Proposal with a person other than Holding, Parent or
Sub, then immediately prior to, and as a condition of, consummation of such
transaction the Company shall pay to Parent upon demand the Termination Fee,
payable in same-day funds; provided that no such amount shall be payable if the
Termination Fee shall have been paid in accordance with Section 7.2(b) of this
Agreement; provided further that, solely for purposes of this Section 7.2(c),
the term Acquisition Proposal shall not include any: (i) proposals related to
the sale or transfer of certain assets that the Company decides, based on the
advice of tax counsel, are necessary in order to meet the asset and income test
requirements of Section 856(c) of the Code if the Company elects to become
taxable as a real estate investment trust beginning with its taxable year ended
December 31, 2002 or December 31, 2003, or for any merger effected for the
purpose of converting the Company into a real estate investment trust so long as
such merger qualifies as a reincorporation pursuant to Section 368(A)(1)(f) of
the Code and does not result in a change in beneficial ownership of shares of
Company Common Stock, (ii) proposals related to the sale or transfer of fifteen
(15) or fewer Company Properties (in the aggregate) during the one year
following the termination of this Agreement and (iii) proposals related to the
sale or transfer of all or any portion of the Company's franchise business.

     (d) If Holding, Parent or Sub exercises its right to terminate this
Agreement under Section 7.1(f)(ii) (but only to the extent (i) the Company is
not entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(g)(ii) at the
time of such termination and (ii) such termination is the result of (x) one or
more breaches of representations or warranties of the Company which were known
to the Company to be false when made or (y) a knowing and willful breach by the
Company of the agreements and covenants required to be performed and complied
with by it under this Agreement), then the Company shall pay to Parent upon
demand, payable in same day funds, the actual, documented out-of-pocket costs
and expenses of Holding, Parent or Sub reasonably incurred in connection with
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including,
without limitation, any financing fees, costs and expenses, and the reasonable
fees of attorneys, accountants, brokers, investment advisors and other
representatives and advisors), up to a maximum of $3,000,000 less any amounts
previously paid to Parent by the Company in respect thereof (the "Expense
Reimbursement"); provided that no such amount shall be payable if the
Termination Fee shall have been paid or is then payable in accordance with
Section 7.2(b) or 7.2(c) of this Agreement.

     (e) If Holding, Parent or Sub exercises its right to terminate this
Agreement under Section 7.1(i), or the conditions precedent to the obligations
of Holding, Parent and Sub set forth in Sections 6.1 and 6.2 shall be satisfied
or waived and Holding, Parent or Sub shall nonetheless fail to consummate the
Closing as and when required to do so hereunder, then Parent shall, upon demand,
sign and deliver written instructions directing the Escrow Agent to release the
Deposit to the Company, in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement, as
payment of liquidated damages and not as a penalty, to reimburse the Company for
its time, expense and lost opportunity costs of pursuing the Merger. The parties
hereto understand and agree that the Deposit is reasonable as liquidated damages
in light of the costs and expenses that would be incurred by the Company if such
a termination were to occur, and in light of the

                                        46
<PAGE>

difficulty of proving the amount of actual damages that would be suffered by the
Company in such an event.

     (f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
(i) if either party fails promptly to pay to the other any amounts due under
this Section 7.2, such party shall pay the costs and expenses (including
reasonable legal fees and expenses) in connection with any action, including the
filing of any lawsuit or other legal action, taken to collect payment, together
with interest on the amount of any unpaid fee or obligation at the publicly
announced prime rate of Citibank, N.A. in effect from time to time from the date
such fee or obligation was required to be paid; and (ii) each of Holding, Parent
and Sub acknowledges and expressly agrees that neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries shall have any liability for any breach of a representation,
warranty, covenant or other agreement hereunder except to the extent such breach
results in the Company's obligation to provide Parent with the Expense
Reimbursement pursuant to Section 7.2(d).

     SECTION 7.3.  Amendments.  This Agreement may not be amended, modified or
altered except by action of the board of directors or other governing body of
each of the parties hereto set forth in an instrument in writing signed on
behalf of each of the parties hereto; provided, however, that after approval of
the Merger by the Company Shareholders (if required), no amendment may be made
without the further approval of the Company Shareholders if the effect of such
amendment would be to reduce the Per Share Merger Consideration or change the
form thereof.

     SECTION 7.4.  Waiver.  At any time prior to the Effective Time, whether
before or after the Shareholders' Meeting, any party hereto, by action taken by
its board of directors, may (i) extend the time for the performance of any of
the covenants, obligations or other acts of any other party hereto or (ii) waive
any inaccuracy of any representations or warranties or compliance with any of
the agreements, covenants or conditions of any other party or with any
conditions to its own obligations. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto
to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party by its duly authorized
officer. The failure of any party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights
under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such rights.
The waiver of any such right with respect to particular facts and other
circumstances shall not be deemed a waiver with respect to any other facts and
circumstances and each such right shall be deemed an ongoing right that may be
asserted at any time and from time to time.

                                  ARTICLE VIII

                               GENERAL PROVISIONS

     SECTION 8.1.  No Third Party Beneficiaries.  Other than the provisions of
Sections 1.6(c), 5.7 and 5.20(c) hereof, nothing in this Agreement shall confer
any rights or remedies upon any person other than the parties hereto.

     SECTION 8.2.  Entire Agreement.  This Agreement, the Confidentiality
Agreement and the other documents, schedules and instruments referred to herein
and to be delivered pursuant hereto constitute the entire agreement among the
parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes any prior
understandings, agreements, or representations by or among the parties, written
or oral, with respect to the subject matter hereof. The parties hereby agree
that for purposes of this Agreement (including, but not limited to conditions to
Closing) neither party has made to the other any representations, warranties or
covenants or other disclosures other than those specifically contained in this
Agreement or the Company Disclosure Letter.

     SECTION 8.3.  Succession and Assignment.  This Agreement shall be binding
upon and inure to the benefit of the parties named herein and their respective
successors. No party may assign either this Agreement or any of its rights,
interests, or obligations hereunder without the prior written approval of the
other parties; provided, however, that Sub may freely assign its rights to
another wholly owned subsidiary of Parent without such prior written approval
but no such assignment shall relieve Sub of any of its obligations hereunder.

                                        47

     SECTION 8.4.  Counterparts.  This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but all of which
together shall constitute one and the same instrument.

     SECTION 8.5.  Headings.  The section headings contained in this Agreement
are inserted for convenience only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement.

     SECTION 8.6.  Governing Law.  This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Georgia, without regard to
principles of conflicts of law thereof.

     SECTION 8.7.  Severability.  Any term or provision of this Agreement that
is invalid or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions
hereof or the validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in
any other situation or in any other jurisdiction. If the final judgment of a
court of competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision hereof is
invalid or unenforceable, the parties agree that the court making the
determination of invalidity or unenforceability shall have the power to reduce
the scope, duration, or area of the term or provision, to delete specific words
or phrases, or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a
term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to
expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and
this Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified after the expiration of the
time within which the judgment may be appealed.

     SECTION 8.8.  Specific Performance.  Each of the parties acknowledges and
agrees that the other party would be damaged irreparably in the event any of the
provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with their specific
terms or otherwise are breached. Accordingly, each of the parties agrees that
the other party shall be entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches of the provisions of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
this Agreement and the terms and provisions hereof in any action instituted in
any court of the United States or any state thereof having jurisdiction over the
parties and the matter, in addition to any other remedy to which it may be
entitled, at law or in equity.

     SECTION 8.9.  Construction.  The language used in this Agreement shall be
deemed to be the language chosen by the parties hereto to express their mutual
intent, and no rule of strict construction shall be applied against any party.
Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in this
Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation."

     SECTION 8.10.  Survival of Representations and Warranties and
Agreements.  The representations, warranties and agreements in this Agreement
shall terminate at the Effective Time or upon the termination of this Agreement
pursuant to Section 7.1, as the case may be, except that (i) the agreements set
forth in Articles I and VIII and Sections 5.4, 5.7, 5.16 and 5.20(c) shall
survive the Effective Time indefinitely, and (ii) the agreements set forth in
Sections 5.2 and 7.2 and in Article VIII shall survive the termination of this
Agreement indefinitely.

     SECTION 8.11.  Certain Definitions.

     (a) For purposes of this Agreement, the terms "associate" and "affiliate"

partnership (general or limited), limited liability company, limited liability
partnership, trust, joint venture, joint-stock company, syndicate, association,
entity, unincorporated organization or government or any political subdivision,
agency or instrumentality thereof.

     (b) For purposes of this Agreement, the phrase "Company Material Adverse
Effect" shall mean, with respect to the Company, any change, event or effect
that, when taken together with all other adverse changes, events or effects that
have occurred, is or is reasonably likely to (i) be materially adverse to the

liabilities (including, without limitation, contingent liabilities) of the
Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole or (ii) prevents or materially
delays the performance by the Company of any of its material obligations under

Adverse Effect shall not include (x) in and of itself failure by the Company to
meet analysts' earnings forecasts or estimates or changes in

                                        48

resulting from any change in general economic conditions or any other change
affecting the hotel industry generally, including any such change in general
economic conditions due to any act of war, terrorism or threat of war or
terrorism which changes do not disproportionately affect the Company and its
Subsidiaries (provided that it is understood and agreed that the foregoing
exclusion shall not exclude any change, event or effect that would otherwise be
a Company Material Adverse Effect caused by any act of war or terrorism or
threat of war or terrorism directed at the hotel industry which
disproportionately affects the Company and its Subsidiaries as compared to the
hotel industry as a whole), or (z) any change, event or effect resulting from
actions taken (or omitted) at the request of Holding, Parent or Sub or any other
actions of the Company or any Subsidiary (or omissions to act) required or
contemplated by this Agreement; provided, further, that for purposes of clause
(i) of this definition, a change, event or effect shall be deemed to be
"material" only if it will cost Parent, the Company and/or any Subsidiary, or
would be reasonably expected to cost Parent, the Company and/or any Subsidiary,
an amount equal to or in excess of $5,000,000 in the aggregate.

     (c) For purposes of this Agreement, the phrases "to the knowledge of the

particular matter, any other officers of the Company having primary

     SECTION 8.12  Unacquired Assets.  Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, prior to the Effective Time, the Company may sell,
transfer, assign, mortgage, pledge, lease or otherwise dispose of the Unacquired
Assets, or permit the Unacquired Assets to be subject to any mortgage, lien,
security interest, deed to secure debt, deed of trust or other encumbrance,
restriction or charge of any kind, or enter into, amend, or cancel any
agreement, contract, commitment or arrangement for any of the foregoing, or
cause or allow any of the foregoing to occur; provided, however, that the
Company must obtain Parent's consent, not to be unreasonably withheld or
delayed, prior to taking any such action with respect to the Unacquired Assets
to the extent any such action would impose any obligation or liability on the
Company that would survive the Effective Time; provided, further, that, to the
extent the Company enters into any contract related to the sale, transfer,
assignment, mortgage, pledge, lease or other disposition of any of the
Unacquired Assets, the Company agrees to provide in such contract that the
contract will be freely assignable by the Company in connection with a transfer
of the related Unacquired Asset and that upon any such assignment the Company
shall be released from any and all obligations or liabilities under such
contract. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the parties agree
that any exception to the representations and warranties in Article III hereof
that refers to the Unacquired Assets shall be deemed to be excepted from the
relevant representation or warranty only to the extent there are no obligations,
liabilities or other material adverse implications that would inure to Parent,
the Company or any Subsidiary as a result of the relevant act, omission or
circumstance relating to the Unacquired Assets.

     SECTION 8.13.  Fees and Expenses.  Except as provided in Section 7.2, and

                              W I T N E S S E T H:

     WHEREAS, Holding, Parent, Sub and the Company have entered into an

the Company (the "Merger"), with the Company as the surviving corporation, in
accordance with the provisions of the Georgia Business Corporation Code
("GBCC");

     WHEREAS, at the Effective Time, the Company Shareholders and certain
holders of Company Options (the "Beneficiaries") will own all of the beneficial
interests (the "Beneficial Interests") in the Liquidating Trust, which will own
at least 99% of the outstanding limited liability interests in the Liquidating

     WHEREAS, in consideration of each of Holding's, Parent's and Sub's
agreements herein and in the Merger Agreement, the Indemnitors have agreed to
cooperate with Holding, Parent and Sub with respect to the acquisition of the
Company by Holding, Parent and Sub upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in the Merger Agreement, and to indemnify Holding, Parent, Sub and
certain other related parties as contemplated herein.

     NOW, THEREFORE, in contemplation of the foregoing and in consideration of
the mutual agreements, covenants, representations and warranties contained
herein and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt of which is
hereby acknowledged, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties

Company.  Each of the Indemnitors and the Company jointly and severally hereby
represents and warrants to Holding, Parent and Sub, as follows:

     SECTION 2.1.  Organization; Standing; Purpose and Duration.

     (a) The Liquidating Trust (i) is a trust, duly organized, validly existing
and in good standing under the laws of the state of Georgia, (ii) has all
requisite trust power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and
assets and to conduct its affairs in accordance with the Trust Agreement and
(iii) has as its sole purpose the holding of the Unacquired Assets (either
directly, or indirectly through the Liquidating LLC) and the liquidation of the
Unacquired Assets and distribution of the proceeds thereof (net of any
obligations of the Liquidating Trust or the Liquidating LLC) to the
Beneficiaries in accordance with the
<PAGE>

Trust Agreement. The existence of the Liquidating Trust shall terminate on the
earliest to occur of (i) the exhaustion of the trust estate through the
distribution to the Beneficiaries, payment or discharge of the liabilities of
the Liquidating Trust, or the payment of expenses of, and claims against the
Liquidating Trust, (ii) a termination required by the applicable laws of the
State of Georgia, (iii) a termination by action of the Beneficiaries in
accordance with the Trust Agreement or (iv) the third anniversary of the
Effective Time; provided, that the term of the Liquidating Trust may be extended
beyond the third anniversary of the Effective Time upon the Trustee's receipt of
no-action assurances from the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC")
Division of Corporation Finance regarding the registration and reporting
requirements of the Liquidating Trust under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and any other
applicable federal securities act, based on such extension, and then only
pursuant to (a) the provisions of a no-action letter received from the SEC or
(b) guidelines outlined in an oral no-action position taken by the SEC staff
that are confirmed by the Trustee in a letter to the SEC (the date on which the
Liquidation Trust terminates pursuant to the foregoing, the "Termination Date").
The Beneficial Interests in the Liquidating Trust are not certificated and are
not transferable or assignable except by will, intestate succession, by
operation of law, or upon divorce or incapacity of the beneficiary, or some
other similar event.

     (b) The Liquidating LLC (i) is a limited liability company, duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the state of Georgia,
(ii) has all requisite limited liability company power and authority to own,
lease and operate its properties and assets and to conduct its affairs in
accordance with the Operating Agreement, (iii) is duly qualified or licensed to
do business as a limited liability company and is in good standing in each
jurisdiction where the character of the properties owned, leased or operated by
it or the nature of its business makes such qualification or licensing
necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified or licensed would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the
Liquidating LLC or the Liquidating Trust, (iv) has as its sole purpose the
holding and liquidation of the Unacquired Assets and the distribution of the
proceeds thereof to the Liquidating Trust in accordance with the Operating
Agreement and (v) will dissolve at a date and time no later than the termination
of the existence of the Liquidating Trust. The Operating Agreement provides that
only the Liquidating Trust and the managing member of the Liquidating LLC may be
members of the Liquidating LLC.

     SECTION 2.2.  Authority for Agreement.  Each of the Indemnitors and the
Company has all necessary power and authority to execute and deliver this
Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder and to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The execution, delivery and
performance by the Indemnitors and the Company of this Agreement, and the
consummation by the Indemnitors and the Company of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate or other
action and no other corporate or other proceedings on the part of the
Indemnitors or the Company are necessary to authorize this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. This Agreement has been duly
executed and delivered by the Indemnitors and the Company and, assuming due
authorization, execution and delivery by Holding, Parent and Sub, constitutes a
legal, valid and binding obligation of each of the Indemnitors and the Company,
enforceable against them in accordance with its terms.

     SECTION 2.3.  No Conflict.  The execution and delivery of this Agreement by
each of the Indemnitors and the Company do not, and the performance of this
Agreement by each of the Indemnitors and the Company and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not, (a) conflict with or
violate the articles of incorporation or organization, bylaws, trust agreement,
operating agreement, or other governing documents of the Indemnitors or the
Company, as applicable, (b) conflict with or violate any United States federal,
state or local or any foreign statute, law, rule, regulation, ordinance, code,
order, judgment, decree or any other requirement or rule of law applicable to
the Indemnitors or the Company, or by which any property or asset of the
Indemnitors or the Company is bound or affected, or (c) result in any breach of
or constitute a default (or an event which with notice or lapse of time or both
would become a default) under, give to others any right of termination,
amendment, acceleration or cancellation of, or result in the creation of a lien
or other encumbrance on any property or

                                        2
<PAGE>

asset of the Indemnitors or the Company pursuant to, any note, bond, mortgage,
indenture, contract, agreement, lease, license, permit, franchise or other
instrument or obligation to which the Indemnitors or the Company is a party or
by which the Indemnitors, the Company, or any property or asset of either of
them is bound or affected, except in each case, for any such conflicts,
violations, breaches, defaults or other occurrences which would not,
individually or in the aggregate, prevent or materially delay the performance by
the Indemnitors or the Company of their respective obligations under this
Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

     SECTION 2.4.  Required Filings and Consents.  The execution and delivery of

approval, authorization or permit of, or filing with or notification to, any
Governmental Entity.

     SECTION 2.5  Ownership.  At or prior to the Effective Time, and as a result
of the Divestiture, the Indemnitors will own the Unacquired Assets and except as
set forth on Schedule 2.5 attached hereto (a) as to any real property included
as part of the Unacquired Assets, will have good, marketable and insurable fee
simple title, in each case free and clear of all liabilities, claims, liens,
options, charges, participations and encumbrances of any kind or character
whatsoever (collectively, "Liens") and (b) as to any promissory notes included
as part of the Unacquired Assets, will own such promissory notes free and clear
of all Liens.

     SECTION 3.  Survival of Representations and Warranties.  The respective
representations and warranties of the Indemnitors contained herein shall not be
deemed waived or otherwise affected by any investigation made by the other party
hereto, and each representation and warranty contained herein shall survive the
closing of the transactions contemplated hereby until the earlier to occur of
the Termination Date or the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations,
including extensions thereof.

     SECTION 4.  Indemnification.

     SECTION 4.1  General Indemnification.  The Indemnitors shall defend and
indemnify Holding, Parent, Sub and the Company, and their respective agents,
affiliates, subsidiaries, controlling persons, officers, directors, employees,
successors and assigns (collectively, the "Indemnitees") for, and hold the
Indemnitees wholly harmless from and against, any and all losses, liabilities,
damages, costs (including, without limitation, court costs) and expenses
(including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred by any such
Indemnitee as a result of, or in connection with, any one or more of the
following:

          (a) the Divestiture (including, without limitation, to the extent such
     steps are taken, the formation of the Indemnitors, the transfer of the
     Unacquired Assets to the Indemnitors, the transfer by Suburban Holdings, LP
     of all of its limited liability company interest in the Liquidating LLC to
     SLA Properties, Inc. ("SLAPI") and Suburban Management, Inc. ("SMI"), the
     transfer by Suburban Construction, Inc. ("SCI"), SLAPI and SMI of their
     respective limited liability company interests in the Liquidating LLC to
     the Company, the issuance of a 1% limited liability company interest in the
     Liquidating LLC to its managing member, the transfer by the Company of all
     of its limited liability company interest in the Liquidating LLC to the
     Trustee, the transfer of Beneficial Interests to the Beneficiaries, any tax
     consequences associated with any of the foregoing and any liability
     (including, without limitation, any environmental liability or litigation)
     arising out of or related to any of the Unacquired Assets);

          (b) all matters otherwise relating to the Indemnitors, whether arising
     or occurring prior to or after the Effective Time;

          (c) the failure of the Divestiture to comply with applicable state and
     Federal securities laws; and

          (d) the amounts paid to holders of Dissenting Shares to the extent any
     such amounts are attributable to Beneficial Interests as determined by a
     court in accordance with Section 14-2-1330 of the GBCC.

                                        3
<PAGE>

     Any of the foregoing described in clauses (a), (b), (c) or (d) above are
collectively herein referred to as "Losses".

     SECTION 4.2  Procedures

     (a) In the event that an Indemnitee shall receive written notice of any
claim or proceeding by a third party other than an Indemnitor (a "Third Party
Claimant") against such Indemnitee that, if successful, might result in Losses
for which such Indemnitee is entitled to be indemnified under Section 4.1 (a
"Third Party Claim"), such Indemnitee shall give the Indemnitors promptly (and
in any event within ten (10) business days) written notice of such claim,
together with a copy of the written notice of the Third Party Claimant asserting
the Third Party Claim (collectively, the "Claim Notice"); provided, however,
that failure to make such delivery shall not affect the indemnification provided
hereunder except to the extent that such failure materially prejudices
Indemnitor's ability to contest such Third Party Claim.

     (b) If a Third Party Claim is made against an Indemnitee, the Indemnitors
shall be entitled to participate in the defense thereof and, if the Indemnitors
so choose, assume the defense thereof with counsel of its choice reasonably
acceptable to the Indemnitee. Should the Indemnitors so elect to assume the
defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnitors shall not be liable to the
Indemnitee for any legal expenses incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with
the defense thereof, except as provided below. If the Indemnitors assume such
defense, the Indemnitee shall have the right, but not the obligation, to
participate in the defense thereof and to employ counsel, at its own expense,
separate from the counsel employed by the Indemnitors; provided that if the
incurrence of any such fees and expenses of counsel was reasonably necessary to
respond timely to legal process for any period after the Claim Notice is given
during which the Indemnitors have not assumed the defense thereof such fees and
expenses shall be paid by the Indemnitors if and to the extent that they are
reasonable and the Indemnitors are responsible for indemnifying Indemnitee for
such Third Party Claim. If the Indemnitors do not assume the defense of a Third
Party Claim within ten (10) days after the giving by the Indemnitee to the
Indemnitors of a valid Claim Notice with respect to the Third Party Claim, the
Indemnitors shall be liable to the Indemnitee for all reasonable fees and
expenses of counsel employed by the Indemnitee if and in proportion to the
extent that the Indemnitee is responsible for indemnifying Indemnitee for such
Third Party Claim. If the Indemnitors choose to defend any Third Party Claim,
all the Indemnified Parties shall reasonably cooperate in the defense thereof at
the expense of the Indemnitors. Such cooperation shall include the retention and
(upon the Indemnitors' request) the provision to the Indemnitors of
non-privileged records and information which are relevant to such Third Party
Claim, and making employees reasonably available on a mutually convenient basis
to provide additional information and explanation of any material provided
hereunder and to act as a witness or respond to legal process. Regardless of
whether the Indemnitors assume the defense of a Third Party Claim, the
Indemnitee shall not admit any liability with respect to, or settle, compromise
or discharge, such Third Party Claim without the Indemnitors' prior written
consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). If the
Indemnitors assume the defense of the Third Party Claim, the Indemnitors may
agree to settle the Third Party Claim, so long as such settlement releases the
Indemnitee completely and unconditionally in connection with such Third Party
Claim (and with any claims arising therefrom or related thereto) and such
settlement is not otherwise prejudicial (financially or otherwise) to the
Indemnitee. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnitors shall not be entitled
to assume the defense of any Third Party Claim (and shall be liable for the
reasonable fees and expenses of counsel incurred by the Indemnitee in defending
such Third Party Claim) if the Third Party Claim seeks an order, injunction or
other equitable relief or relief for other than money damages against the
Indemnitee that the Indemnitee reasonably determines, after conferring with
outside counsel, cannot be separate from any related claim for money damages. If
such equitable relief or other relief portion of the Third Party Claim can be so
separate from that for money damages, the Indemnitors shall be entitled to
assume the defense of the portion relating to money damages as provided above.

     (c) In the event that an Indemnitee claims right to payment pursuant to
this Agreement (other than pursuant to a Third Party Claim), such Indemnitee
shall send written notice of such claim (a "Direct Claim Notice") to the
Indemnitors promptly upon learning of the facts forming the basis of such claim
(a "Direct Claim"); provided, however, that failure to promptly deliver such a
notice shall not affect the
                                        4
<PAGE>

indemnification provided hereunder except to the extent that such failure
materially prejudices Indemnitor's ability to contest such Direct Claim. Such
notice shall specify the basis for such claim. As promptly as possible after the
Indemnitee has given such notice, the Indemnitee and Indemnitors shall establish
the merits and amount of such claim (by mutual agreement, litigation,
arbitration or otherwise) and as soon as reasonably practicable, and in no event
more than ten (10) business days of the final determination of the merits and
amount of such claim, the Indemnitors shall deliver to the Indemnitee
immediately available funds in an amount determined sufficient to satisfy such
claim in accordance with the terms hereof.

     SECTION 4.3 (a)  Claims Period.  Neither Indemnitor shall be required to
indemnify any Indemnitees under Section 4.1 with respect to any Losses or any
Direct Claim unless either Indemnitor shall have been properly notified of a
Third Party Claim or a Direct Claim pursuant to Section 4.2 giving rise to such
Losses on or before the earlier to occur of the second anniversary of the
Effective Time or termination of the Liquidating Trust in accordance with its
terms. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, prior to the close of business on the
earlier to occur of the second anniversary of the Effective Time or termination
of the Liquidating Trust in accordance with its terms, either Indemnitor shall
have been properly notified of a Third Party Claim or a Direct Claim pursuant to
Section 4.2 and such Third Party Claim or Direct Claim, as the case may be,
shall not have been finally resolved or disposed of at such date, such Third
Party Claim or Direct Claim, as the case may be, shall continue to survive and
shall remain a basis for indemnity hereunder until such claim is finally
resolved or disposed of in accordance with the terms hereof.

     (b) Limit on Liability.  The claims for indemnity of Indemnitees hereunder
shall be payable solely by, and shall be enforceable solely against, the
Indemnitors, it being specifically understood and agreed that no holder of
Beneficial Interests shall have any personal liability to any Indemnitee for any
claim for indemnification hereunder and that the Indemnitees shall look solely
to the Indemnitor for payment or satisfaction of any and all such claims for
indemnification.

     (c) Remedies.  To the maximum extent permitted by law, and except for any
claims for equitable relief or claims involving fraud or bad faith, the
indemnities set forth in this Agreement shall be the exclusive remedies of the
Indemnitees for the recovery of any money damages for all Losses and any Direct
Claim, and the Indemnitees shall not be entitled to any other indemnification
rights or other remedies of any nature whatsoever with respect thereto, all of
which are hereby waived.

     SECTION 4.4  Holdback.  Each of the Indemnitors agrees that it will not,
prior to the first anniversary of the Effective Time, declare or make any
distributions (other than payment of fees, costs and out-of-pocket expenses of
Trustee and the managing member of the Liquidating Company) to the members of
the Liquidating Company or Beneficiaries, as applicable (the "Initial Holdback
Period"). Following the Initial Holdback Period, each of the Indemnitors agrees
that it will not declare or make distributions (other than payment of fees,
costs and out-of-pocket expenses of Trustee and the managing member of the
Liquidating Company) to the members of the Liquidating Company or Beneficiaries,
as applicable, to the extent of the disputed amount of any Third Party Claim or
Direct Claim for which either Indemnitor shall have been properly notified
pursuant to Section 4.2 which are pending at the expiration of the Initial
Holdback Period until such claim is finally resolved or disposed of in
accordance with the terms hereof; provided, however, that the Indemnitors may
declare or make distributions to the extent that the Indemnitors have cash on
hand greater than the disputed amount of any such pending Third Party Claims or
Direct Claims.
