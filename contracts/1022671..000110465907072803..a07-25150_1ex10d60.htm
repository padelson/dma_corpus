 _Noncompetition_. In order to protect the value of the business of the
Corporation and its Subsidiaries and the Stock, the Shareholders and their
Affiliates (collectively, the "Shareholder Group") agree for five (5) years
from the Closing Date, not to (i) engage, directly or indirectly, in
any manner in the business of the Corporation or its Subsidiaries as of the

or its Subsidiaries.

  

 _Breach_. The Shareholder Group agrees that any breach of _Sections 7.9(a)_
, _7.9(b)_ or _7.9(c)_ above will result in irreparable damage to Buyer for

breach should occur, the Shareholder Group consents to any temporary or
permanent injunction or decree of specific performance by any court of
competent jurisdiction in favor of Buyer enjoining any such breach, without
prejudice to any other right or remedy to which Buyer shall be entitled. In
the event that any portion of this _Section 7.9_ shall be determined by any
court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable by reason of its being
extended over too great a period of time or too large a geographic area or
over too great a range of activities, it shall be interpreted to extend only
over the maximum lesser period of time, geographic area, or range of
activities as to which it may be enforceable. Each of the covenants herein
shall be deemed a separate and severable covenant. In the event any member of
the Shareholder Group breaches any provision of this _Section 7.9_ , Buyer

enforcement, including reasonable attorneys fees.

of each of the Shareholders for purposes of this Agreement. The Shareholders
Representative shall have the sole authority to act on behalf of and to bind

Articles X and XI. The Shareholders Representative may be changed from time
to time with the consent of a majority of the Shareholders. The Shareholders
Representative may resign at any time by giving at least thirty (30) days

the Shareholders Representative shall continue to serve until its successor
accepts the duties of the Shareholders Representative.  If a successor
Shareholders Representative is not appointed within twenty (20) days after
the resignation, death or incapacity of the Shareholders Representative, then
the person then serving as the Shareholders Representative (or his executor
or other personal representative) or a majority of the Shareholders may
petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a
successor Shareholders Representative.

  

 _Title and Survey Matters_.

  

Within fourteen (14) business days from the date hereof, the Shareholders
shall use reasonable efforts to cause the Corporation to furnish to the Buyer
current title commitments (collectively, the "Title Commitment") issued by
LandAmerica or Lawyers Title Insurance Corporation (the "Title Company")
together with copies of all exceptions to title referenced therein. The Title
Commitment shall set forth the state of title to the Owned Properties, the
Shareholder Premises and the Leased Premises identified on _Section 7.12 of
the Disclosure Schedule_ (collectively, the "Insured Properties"), together
with all exceptions or conditions to such title, including, without
limitation, all easements, restrictions, rights-of-way,
covenants, reservations, and all other encumbrances affecting the Insured
Properties, which would appear in an owners or leasehold owners title
policy, if issued. The Title Commitment shall contain the express commitment
of the Title Company to issue one or more owners or leasehold owners title
policies (collectively, the "Title Policy") to the Company on the current
ALTA Form 2006 in amounts as the Buyer may determine not in excess of the
fair market value of such Owned Properties and such Leased Properties
(including all improvements located thereon), subject to the Permitted
Encumbrances. Each Title Policy delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall,
at Buyers election, and to the extent legally permissible and commercially
available, (i) insure title to the Insured Properties and all recorded
easements benefiting such Insured Properties as of the date of Closing or the
recording of any subsequent deed or article of merger, whichever occurs last,
(ii) contain an "extended coverage endorsement" insuring over the general
exceptions contained customarily in

        

such policies, (iii) contain an ALTA Zoning Endorsement 3.1 (or equivalent),
(iv) contain an endorsement insuring that the Insured Properties described in
the title insurance policy is the same real estate as shown on the Survey
delivered with respect to such property, (v) contain an endorsement insuring
that each street adjacent to the real property is a public street and that
there is direct and unencumbered pedestrian and vehicular access to such
street from the Real Property, (vi) if the Real Property consists of more
than one record parcel, contain a "contiguity" endorsement insuring that all
of the record parcels are contiguous to one another, (vii) contain a "non
imputation" endorsement to the effect that title defects known to the
officers, directors, and stockholders of the owner prior to the Closing shall
not be deemed "facts known to the insured" for purposes of the policy, and
(viii) contain an endorsement insuring against loss or damage sustained
by the non-availability of utilities. The insurance premium, costs for each
Title Policy shall be a Transaction Expense. The inability of the Title
Company to issue a zoning endorsement on a Title Commitment due to either (i)
a legal non conforming use of such property or (ii)  shall not be grounds
for objection by Buyer provided that the failure to issue such an endorsement
is not due to immaterial non-compliance with applicable zoning laws and
regulations shall not be grounds for objection by Buyer.

  

No later than fourteen (14) business days prior to the Closing Date, the
Buyer shall use reasonable efforts to obtain copies of one or more plats of
survey of each Insured Property (whether one or more, the "Survey") prepared
by a land surveyor or engineer licensed in the state in which the Insured
Property is located. The Survey shall, at Buyers election, (i) be currently
dated (which may include a current re-certification of a previously prepared
survey plat); (ii) show the location on the Insured Property of all
improvements, fences, evidences of abandoned fences, lakes, ponds, creeks,
streams, rivers, easements, roads, and right-of-way; (iii) identify all
easements and rights-of-way by reference to the recording information
applicable to the documents creating such easements or rights-of-way; (iv)

property, any encroachments from the Insured Property onto adjacent property,
and any encroachments into any easement or restricted area within the Insured
Property (v) locate all existing improvements (such as buildings, power
lines, fences, and the like); (vi) locate all dedicated public streets or
other roadways providing access to the Insured Property, including all curb
cuts and all alleys; (vii) locate all set-back lines and similar restrictions

irrevocably RELEASES and FOREVER DISCHARGES the Corporation and the Buyer and

affiliates, subsidiaries, shareholders, members, partners, limited partners,
and their respective present and former directors, managing directors,

judgments, executions, claims and demands, whether known or unknown,
suspected or unsuspected, absolute or contingent, direct or indirect or
nominally or beneficially possessed or claimed by any of the Releasing
Parties, whether the same be at law, in equity or mixed, which such Releasing
Party ever had or now has, or hereafter can, shall or may have against the
Released Parties, in respect of or arising from any and all agreements and
obligations incurred on or prior to the date hereof, or in respect of or
arising from any event occurring or circumstances existing on or prior to the
date hereof (collectively the " _Released Claims_ "); _provided_ ,  _however_
, that the Released Parties shall not be released from any of their
obligations or liabilities to the Releasing Parties (and none of
such obligations and liabilities shall be Released Claims) arising under (i)
this Agreement or any other agreement delivered in connection herewith, (ii)
rights to reimbursement for claims incurred prior to the date hereof under
the Employee Benefit Plans, (iii) any base salary and normal perquisites

Corporation, the Subsidiaries or the Joint Ventures; or (v) claims of Leonard
I. Rifkin or his heirs or estate for payments due under a certain Deferred

Each of the Releasing Parties hereby expressly waives any rights such
Releasing Party may have under the statutes of any jurisdiction or common law
principles of similar effect, to preserve Released Claims which such
Releasing Party does not know or suspect to exist in such Releasing Partys
favor at the time of executing this Agreement. Each of the Releasing
Parties understands and acknowledges that it may discover facts different
from, or in addition to, those which it knows or believes to be true with
respect to the claims released herein, and agrees that the terms of this
release shall be and remain effective in all respects notwithstanding any
subsequent discovery of different and/or additional facts.  Should any
Releasing Party discover that any fact relied upon in entering into this
release was untrue, or that any fact was concealed, or that an understanding
of the facts of law was incorrect, no Releasing Party shall be entitled to
any relief as a result thereof, and the Releasing Parties surrender any
rights they might have to rescind this release on any ground. This release is
intended to be and is final and binding regardless of any claim of
misrepresentation, promise made with the intention of performing, concealment
of fact, mistake of law, or any other circumstances whatsoever. Each of
the Releasing Parties hereby irrevocably covenants to refrain from asserting
any claim or demand, or commencing, instituting or causing to be commenced,
any proceeding of any kind against any Released Party based upon any
Released Claim.

  

If any of the Releasing Parties (or an affiliate thereof) brings any claim,
suit, action or manner of action against the Released Parties (or any of
them) in administrative proceedings, in arbitration or admiralty, at law, in
equity, or mixed, with respect to any Released Claim, then such Releasing
Party shall indemnify the Released Parties (or any of them) in the amount or
value of any final judgment or settlement (monetary or other) and any related
cost (including, without limitation, reasonable legal fees) entered against,
paid or incurred by the Released Parties (or any of them). Each Releasing
Party represents and warrants to the Released Parties that there has been no
assignment or other transfer of any interest in his or her Released Claims.

  

 _Senior Secured Notes_.  Within 5 Business Days of the date hereof, the
Corporation shall send notice (the "Change of Control Notice") to each holder
of its 6.75% Senior Secured Notes (the "Senior Notes", and each holder
thereof, a "Senior Noteholder") regarding the execution of this Agreement, in
form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Buyer, which notice shall
comply in all respects with _Section 8.3_ of that certain Note Purchase
Agreement, dated September 1, 2002 (the "Note Purchase Agreement"), including
an offer to prepay the Senior Notes on the Closing Date and an officers
certificate. If the Closing has not occurred within ninety (90) days of the
Proposed Prepayment Date, as set forth in the Change of Control Notice, the
Corporation shall comply with _Section 8.3(f)_ of the Note Purchase Agreement

option as set forth in _Section 8.3_ of the Note Purchase Agreement (the
"Prepayment").  The Corporation shall prepare or cause to be prepared all
necessary and appropriate documentation in connection with any Prepayment,
which shall be reasonably acceptable to the Buyer, so that any Prepayment
shall be consummated on the Closing Date.

shall assign to the Shareholders, and the Shareholders shall assume the
Corporations obligations to purchase one Learjet 45XR aircraft pursuant to
that certain Aircraft Purchase Agreement dated January 31, 2007 by and

 _Bonus Obligations_.  The Corporation and the Shareholders intend to pay
certain bonuses to certain employees of the Corporation on and after the
Closing Date. The bonuses include "Annual Performance Bonuses", "Longevity
Bonuses" and "Transaction Bonuses", each as further described in subsections
(a), (b) and (c) of this Section 7.19 and collectively referred to as the
"Bonuses". The consideration payable by the Buyer for the Stock set forth in
Section 2.1 hereof has been adjusted to reflect the portion of the Bonuses
that would be Transaction Expenses hereunder and, anything contained in this
Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, the Bonuses shall not be included
in Transaction Expenses or otherwise be payable by the Shareholders pursuant
to Section 13.3 of this Agreement. At the Closing or on such later dates as
may be specified herein, the Buyer shall cause the Corporation to pay the
Bonuses in the amounts, manner and to the employees of the Corporation as
specified herein.

  

 _Annual Performance Bonuses_. Annual Performance Bonuses for the fiscal year
of the Corporation ended on September 30, 2007 shall be paid by the
Corporation after the Closing but prior to December 15, 2007. The Corporation
has accrued $27,000,000 for payment of the Annual Performance Bonuses (the
"APB Amount"). On or prior to Closing, the Shareholders will provide the
Buyer with a schedule listing the employees of the Corporation who are to
receive an Annual Performance Bonus and the amount of such bonus for each
such employee, which amounts shall not exceed, in the aggregate, the APB
Amount. The Annual Performance Bonuses will be based on the evaluation of the
management of the Corporation in a manner consistent with the ordinary and
normal practices of the Corporation. All Annual Performance Bonus payments
shall be subject to all normal withholdings and deposits.

  

 _Longevity Bonuses_.  Longevity Bonuses shall be paid to certain employees
of the Corporation based on their tenure as an employee of the Corporation.
Longevity Bonuses shall be payable in Buyer Common Stock pursuant to Section
3.2(c) of this Agreement in an amount not to exceed 60,000 shares and in
federal, state and local withholding taxes and deposits paid by the
Corporation approximately equal to the withholding taxes and deposits payable
by the employee for the value of the Buyer Common Stock to be received by the
employee on the Closing Date.  At least three (3) days prior to the Closing,
the Shareholders shall deliver to Buyer a list of the employees of the
Corporation who are to be issued Buyer Common Stock as a Longevity Bonus at
Closing and the number of shares of Buyer Common Stock to be issued to each
employee. The Buyer shall issue the Buyer Common Stock to each such employee
on the Closing Date and shall cause the Corporation to pay as and when the
same are due and

        

payable all withholding taxes and deposits due by such employee on the actual
value of the Buyer Common Stock received by them (collectively, the
"Longevity Bonus Taxes"). Within thirty (30) days after payment of
the Longevity Bonus Taxes by the Corporation, the Buyer shall give the
Shareholder Representative written notice of the actual amount of the
Longevity Bonus Taxes and the employer portion of payroll taxes with respect
to the Longevity Bonuses paid by the Corporation. If the actual amount
exceeds $1,800,000, then the Shareholders, within ten (10) business days of
receipt of the notice, shall pay to the Corporation the difference. If the
actual amount paid is less than $1,800,000,the Corporation shall pay the
difference to the Shareholders with the notice. Any payment made by the
Shareholders to the Corporation or the Corporation to the Shareholders
pursuant to this Section 7.19(b) is intended to be and shall be a purchase
price adjustment.

  

The Buyer agrees that the Buyer Common Stock to be issued to employees of the
Company on the Closing Date pursuant to Section 7.19(b) hereof, shall be
registered under the Securities Act for resale by the employees at Closing or
as soon thereafter or reasonably practicable.

  

 _Transaction Bonuses_. Transaction Bonuses shall be paid to certain
employees of the Corporation in the form of shares of Buyer Common Stock
pursuant to Section 3.2(c) hereof and cash payments from the Corporation. At
least three (3) days prior to the Closing, the Shareholders shall deliver to
Buyer a list of the employees of the Corporation who are to receive a
Transaction Bonus, with the number of shares of Buyer Common Stock to be
issued and the cash bonus to be paid to each such employee set forth opposite
the employees name, which shares of stock shall not exceed 500,000 in the
aggregate and which cash amount shall not exceed $28,500,000 in the
aggregate. To the extent such cash amount is less than $28,500,000 in the
aggregate, the difference shall be paid to the Shareholders at Closing. The
Buyer shall issue the Buyer Common Stock to each such employee on the Closing
Date and shall cause the Corporation to pay to each such employee the cash
bonus payable to such employee within ten (10) days after the Closing, less
the withholding taxes and other deposits payable by each such employee on the
value of the Buyer Common Stock issued to such employee and the cash bonus
paid to such employee. Within thirty (30) days after payment of
the Transaction Bonuses by the Corporation, the Buyer shall give the
Shareholder Representative written notice of the employer portion of the
payroll taxes with respect to the Transaction Bonuses. If the actual amount
exceeds $1,300,000, then the Shareholders, within ten (10) business days of
receipt of the notice, shall pay to the Corporation the difference. If the
actual amount paid is less than $1,300,000, the Corporation shall pay the
difference to the Shareholders with the notice. Any payment made by the
Shareholders to the Corporation or the Corporation to the Shareholders
pursuant to this Section 7.19(c) is intended to be and shall be a purchase
price adjustment.

  

The Shareholders acknowledge that the Buyer Common Stock issued to employees
of the Corporation as Transaction Bonuses will not be registered under the
Securities Act and will be tradable by such employees only in conformity with
SEC Rule 144. and that the Buyer will place legends on the related stock
certificates and impose other transfer restrictions consistent therewith.

  

 _Financing Cooperation_. The Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall and
shall cause their respective officers and directors to reasonably
cooperate in connection with any future financings which Buyer may effect,
including (i) the preparation of financial statements

        

and other financial information for the Corporation and its Subsidiaries as
may be required to be included in any offering memorandum, prospectus or
similar documents relating to any such financings, (ii) participation in
meeting with prospective lenders, investors and rating agencies, due
diligence sessions, road shows, the preparation of offering memoranda,
prospectuses and similar documents and (iii) taking reasonable actions as may
be necessary or advisable to consummate such financing transactions as
contemplated by any such financings. The Corporation shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause its independent registered public
accounting firm to take such actions as Buyer may reasonably request in
connection with any such financings, including to (i) deliver a consent to
the use of its report on the relevant audited financial statements, (ii)
deliver a "comfort letter" in a form meeting the requirements of SAS 72 or
such other form as may be reasonably requested by Buyer, (iii) perform a SAS
100 review of any interim financial statements which may be required or
desirable, and (iv) participate, at Buyers request, in the preparation of
any offering memorandum, prospectus or similar document that includes, or
incorporates by reference, the foregoing financial information.

Representative.

purchase the Shareholder Premises for $10,000,000 in total for all the

INDEMNIFICATION

  

 _Agreement to Indemnify._

  

The Shareholders jointly and severally agree to indemnify and hold the Buyer,
its Affiliates (including after Closing, the Corporation and
its Subsidiaries) and their respective shareholders, members, directors,
officers, employees, attorneys and agents harmless from and against the
aggregate of all expenses (including reasonable attorney and other
professional fees and expenses and court costs), losses, costs, deficiencies,
diminution in value, liabilities and damages (collectively, "Losses") arising
out of or resulting from (i) any breach of a representation or warranty made
by the Shareholders in or pursuant to this Agreement, (ii) any claim by a
third party which, if true, would constitute a breach of representation or
warranty by the Shareholders or the Corporation, (iii) any breach of the
covenants or agreements made by Shareholders or the Corporation in or
pursuant to this Agreement, (iv) any inaccuracy in any certificate delivered
by the Shareholders or the Corporation pursuant to this Agreement, (v) all
Transaction Expenses.

  

The Buyer agrees to indemnify and hold the Shareholders harmless from
and against all Losses arising out of or resulting from (i) any breach of
a representation or warranty made by the Buyer in or pursuant to this
Agreement, (ii) any claim by a third party which, if true, would constitute a
breach of representation or warranty by the Buyer, (iii) any inaccuracy in
any certificate delivered by the Buyer pursuant to this Agreement, and (iv)
any breach of the covenants or agreements made by the Buyer in or pursuant to
this Agreement.

        

The parties indemnification obligations shall be determined as if
all references to "materiality" or a "Material Adverse Effect" were removed
from the representations and warranties.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, no
claim for Losses arising under _Section 10.1(a)(i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) or
10.1(b)_ other than those from any breach of representation or warranty in
_Sections 4.1, 4.2, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.6, 5.14(a), 5.15(a), and 5.19_ (the
"Excluded Representations") shall be asserted by the Buyer or by the
Shareholders, respectively, until the aggregate of all such Losses exceeds
the sum of $7,500,000 (the "Deductible Amount") in which case the party
entitled to indemnification shall be entitled to only the amount of its
Losses in excess of the Deductible Amount. Pursuant to this _Section 10.1_ ,
except in the case of fraud or intentional misrepresentation, the maximum
aggregate amount recoverable by the Shareholders or Buyer, as the case may
be, with respect to Losses arising from a breach of representation or
warranty (other than the Excluded Representations) shall be $50,000,000.
 Anything contained herein to the contrary notwithstanding, no Shareholder
shall be liable to Buyer for any portion of Buyers Losses which exceed, in
the aggregate, the actual consideration received by such Shareholder under
this Agreement for his Stock (including the proceeds of any Buyer
Common Stock received by a Shareholder and sold after the Closing).

  

 _Survival_. Each of the representations and warranties made by Shareholders
and the Buyer in this Agreement or pursuant hereto shall survive for 24
months after the Closing Date, except (i) the representations and warranties
of Shareholders contained in _Sections 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4 and 5.6_ shall
survive indefinitely, (ii) the representations and warranties in
_Sections 5.14(a) and 5.15(a)_ shall survive for 5 years after the Closing
Date, (iii) the representations and warranties of Shareholders in Section
5.13 shall survive for three (3) years after the Closing Date, and (iv) the
representations and warranties of Shareholders in _Sections 5.18 and 5.19_
shall survive indefinitely unless a statute of limitations applies to claims
of third parties in which case, with respect to such claims, such
representations and warranties shall expire sixty days following the
expiration of the applicable statute of limitations (including extensions
thereof).  No claim for the recovery of Losses from any breach of
representation or warranty may be asserted after such representations and
warranties expire; provided, however, that claims first asserted in writing
within the applicable period shall survive until finally resolved without
possibility of appeal. Notwithstanding any knowledge of facts determined or
determinable by any party by investigation, each party shall have the
right to fully rely on the representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements of the other parties contained in this Agreement or in any other
documents or papers delivered in connection herewith or therewith. Each
representation, warranty, covenant and agreement of the parties contained in
this Agreement is independent of each other representation, warranty,
covenant and agreement. All covenants and agreements in this Agreement shall
survive Closing until fully performed.

  

 _Defense of Third Party Claims_. With respect to each third party claim,
including claims of Governmental Authorities, subject to this Article X (a
"Third Party Claim"), the party seeking indemnification (the "Indemnified
Party") shall give prompt written notice to the indemnifying party (the
"Indemnifying Party") of the Third Party Claim, provided that failure to give
such notice promptly shall not relieve or limit the obligations of the
Indemnifying Party except to the extent the Indemnifying Party is materially
prejudiced thereby. Except for Third Party Claims arising in whole or in
part from Environmental Laws, if the remedy sought in the

        

Third Party Claim is solely money damages and the Indemnifying Party agrees
in writing to pay the claim without regard to any indemnity limitations
herein and reasonably demonstrates that it has the financial capacity to pay
for such Third Party Claim or if the Indemnified Party otherwise permits,
then the Indemnifying Party, at its sole cost and expense, may, upon notice
to the Indemnified Party, within thirty (30) days after the Indemnifying
Party receives written notice of the Third Party Claim, of its
acknowledgement of liability for the claim and desire to assume the defense
thereof, assume the defense of the Third Party Claim. The Indemnifying Party
shall have the right to assume the defense of Third Party Claims arising in
whole or in part from Environmental Laws or the generation, transportation,
storage, disposal, handling or other disposition of Materials of
Environmental Concern without regard to whether the claim is solely for money
damages if the Indemnifying Party agrees in writing to pay the claim without
regard to any indemnity limitations herein and reasonably demonstrates that
it has the financial capacity to pay for such Third Party Claim. If it assumes
the defense of a Third Party Claim, then the Indemnifying Party shall give
written notification to the Indemnified Party of its election to defend the
claim and its acknowledgement of liability for the claim and shall have sole
control over, and shall assume all expenses with respect to, the defense or
settlement of such claim, provided, however, that (i) the Indemnified Party
shall be entitled to participate in (but not control) the defense of such
claim and to employ counsel at its own expense to assist in the handling of
such claim; and (ii) the Indemnifying Party shall obtain the prior written
approval of the Indemnified Party (which shall not be unreasonably withheld)
before entering into any settlement of such claim, if pursuant to or as a
result of such settlement, an operations and maintenance plan, deed
restriction, environmental covenant, injunction or other equitable relief
would be imposed against the Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party shall,
to the extent reasonably practicable, provide the Indemnified Party with
thirty (30) days prior notice before it consents to a settlement of, or the
entry of a judgment arising from, any Third Party Claim.  Subject to the
exception for Third Party Claims arising in whole or in part from
Environmental Laws or the generation, transportation, storage, disposal,
handling or other disposition of Materials of Environmental Concern, with
respect to Third Party Claims in which the remedy sought is not solely money
damages and the Indemnified Party does not permit the Indemnifying Party to
assume the defense, the Indemnifying Party shall, upon notice to
the Indemnified Party within fifteen (15) days after the Indemnifying
Party receives notice of the Third Party Claim, be entitled to participate in
the defense with its own counsel at its own expense. If the Indemnifying
Party does not assume the defense of any Third Party Claim in accordance with
the terms of this Section 10.3, then the Indemnifying Party shall be bound by
the results obtained by the Indemnified Party with respect to the Third Party
Claim. The Parties shall cooperate in the defense of any Third Party Claim
and the relevant records of each Party shall be made available on a timely
basis.

  

 _Payment of Indemnification Claims by Shareholders_. In addition to any
other means of recovery available to Buyer, unless the remaining value of the
Escrow is less than the amount of the claim, Buyers claims
for indemnification shall first be settled by making a claim with the Escrow
Agent pursuant to the Escrow Agreement. For all purposes of determining the
number of shares of Buyer Common Stock to be released from the Escrow Amount,
all such shares shall be valued at the price of such shares on the date any
such claim is finally settled or adjudicated.

        

 _Shareholders Representative_. Each of the Shareholders agrees to indemnify
and hold harmless the Shareholders Representative by reason of its acting or
failure to act in connection with any of the transactions contemplated hereby
and against any loss, liability or expense the Shareholders Representative
may sustain or incur as a result of serving as the
Shareholders Representative hereunder, except such losses, liabilities and
expenses which are determined in a final judgment of a court to have resulted
primarily from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the
Shareholders Representative. Each of the Shareholders agrees that the
Shareholders Representative shall have no liability whatsoever to a
Shareholder or such Shareholders beneficiaries, heirs or
personal representatives for any matters arising out of this Agreement except
for liability for such matters which are determined in a final judgment of a
court to have resulted primarily from the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of the Shareholders Representative or as otherwise set forth in
any separate writing among the Shareholders. Each of the Shareholders hereby
agrees to reimburse the Shareholders Representative upon the request of the
Shareholders Representative for its pro rata share of (based on each
Shareholders percentage ownership of the Stock on the date hereof) all
reasonable expenses, disbursements and advances incurred or made by the
Shareholders Representative in the performance of its duties under
this Agreement.

  

TAX MATTERS

  

 _General_. Subject to the specific mechanisms of this _Section 11.1_ , the
Shareholders shall be jointly and severally responsible for, and shall
indemnify and hold Buyer harmless against: (i) all Tax liabilities of
the Corporation and its Subsidiaries, including any corporate level Taxes
resulting from the Section 338(h)(10) Election other than Taxes imposed on
the Corporation under Section 1374 and any similar state taxes that arise out
of or are attributable to the Section 338(h)(10) Election ("BIG Tax"), for
taxable periods, or portions thereof, ending on or before the Closing Date
and the portion of the Taxes for any Straddle Period (as defined below) that
are allocable to the portion of such Straddle Period ending on the Closing
Date; and (ii) any Taxes arising as a result of the payment of any "excess
parachute payments" as defined in Section 280G of the Code made in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Any BIG Tax is and
shall remain the obligation of the Corporation and the Buyer shall cause the
Corporation to timely satisfy such obligation without contribution from, or
indemnification by, the Shareholders.

  

 _Preparation of Tax Returns_. The Shareholders Representative shall
supervise and with the good faith cooperation of Buyer cause to be prepared
by the Corporation all Tax Returns of the Corporation and its Subsidiaries
for all taxable periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date with respect
to which a Tax Return was not due on or before the Closing Date ("Pre-Closing
Returns") and Buyer shall prepare any Tax Returns of the Company with respect
to a taxable period beginning before the Closing Date and ending after the
Closing Date (a "Straddle Period") (the "Straddle Period Returns"). The
Shareholders Representative shall submit each of the Pre-Closing Returns and
the Buyer shall submit each of the Straddle Period Returns to the other party
for its review at least thirty (30) days prior to the due date for the filing
of such Pre-Closing Return or Straddle Period Return (taking into account any
extensions). The

        

Shareholders and Buyer agree to consult and resolve in good faith any issues
and comments arising as a result of the review of each Pre-Closing Return and
Straddle Period Return, and mutually to consent to filing as promptly as
possible each Pre-Closing Return and Straddle Period Return; provided that if
the Shareholders Representative and Buyer are unable to resolve any such
issue within fifteen (15) days after any such Pre-Closing Return or Straddle
Period Return is submitted to the Shareholders Representative, the dispute
shall be submitted to the Independent Auditor for resolution.

  

 _Taxable Period_. If the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries is permitted
under any applicable foreign, state or local income Tax Law to treat the
Closing Date as the last day of a taxable period, the Shareholders and Buyer
shall treat (and cause their respective Affiliates to treat) the Closing Date
as the last day of a taxable period. For all purposes under this Agreement, in
the case of Taxes that are payable with respect to any Straddle Period, the
portion of any such Tax that is allocable to the portion of the period ending
on the close of the Closing Date shall be (i) in the case of Taxes that are
based upon or related to income or receipts, deemed equal to the amount which
would be payable if the taxable period ended on the Closing Date; and (ii) in
the case of all other Taxes, deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for the
entire period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number
of calendar days in the taxable period ending on the Closing Date and the
denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the entire taxable
period.

  

 _Section 338(h)(10) Elections_. Buyer and each of the Shareholders shall
timely make joint elections under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code
and comparable provisions of state law with respect to the purchase and sale
of the Stock ("Section 338(h)(10) Elections"), and shall timely file executed
copies of IRS Form 8023 and Form 8883, the required schedules thereto and any
similar state forms, with the proper authorities.  Each of the Shareholders
will include any income, gain, loss or deduction resulting from the Section
338(h)(10) Elections on such Shareholders Tax Return to the extent required
by applicable Law. Within ninety (90) days of the Closing Date, the Buyer
shall prepare and deliver to the Shareholders Representative an allocation
schedule allocating the aggregate deemed sales price of the assets among the
assets of the Corporation and its Subsidiaries in accordance with Section
338(h)(10) and Section 1060 of the Code and the regulations thereunder, which
shall be completed in a manner consistent with the Allocation
Agreement attached as _Schedule 11.4_ (the "Allocation Schedule"). The
Allocation Schedule shall be binding on all Parties for all applicable
purposes, including Tax purposes unless, within thirty (30) days after
delivery to the Shareholders Representative, the Shareholders Representative
notifies the Buyer of its disagreement as to one or more of the items on the
Allocation Schedule.  Any such disagreement shall be resolved by the
Independent Auditor. No Party shall file any Tax Returns or take any other
action which is inconsistent with the Allocation Schedule without prior
disclosure to and agreement of the other Party. In consideration for the
Shareholders agreement to make the Section 338(h)(10) Elections, at Closing,
Buyer shall pay the Shareholders an amount equal to $6,000,000 to be
allocated among the Shareholders in the relative proportions set forth on
_Schedule 3.2(d)_.

  

 _Tax Contests_. Buyer shall inform the Shareholders Representative of the
commencement subsequent to the Closing Date of any audit, examination or
proceeding ("Tax Contests") relating in whole or in part to Taxes for which
Buyer may be entitled to indemnity from the Shareholders hereunder and the
Shareholders Representative shall be entitled to control

        

and conduct those aspects of such Tax Contests that are related exclusively
to the liability for any Taxes the amount of which is recoverable by Buyer
from the Shareholders hereunder. Costs of any Tax Contest are to be borne by
the party controlling such Tax Contest. With respect to a Tax Contest which
the Shareholders Representative is entitled to control, the
Shareholders Representative shall have the right to determine, in its sole
discretion, such issues as (i) the forum, administrative or judicial, in
which to contest any proposed adjustment, (ii) the attorney and/or accountant
to represent the Corporation and its Subsidiaries in the Tax Contest, (iii)
whether or not to appeal any decision of any administrative or judicial body,
and (iv) whether to settle any such Tax Contest, except that the Shareholders
Representative shall not settle any Tax Contest in a manner that would have
an adverse Tax effect on the Corporation or its Subsidiaries for taxable
periods ending after the Closing Date without the prior written consent of
Buyer (which consent may not be unreasonably withheld). The Shareholders
Representative shall keep Buyer informed throughout the Tax Contest and
Buyers shall be entitled to participate at its sole expense in any such Tax
Contest. The Buyer or the Corporation and its Subsidiaries, as applicable,
shall deliver to the Shareholders Representative any power of attorney
reasonably required to allow the Shareholders Representative and its counsel
to represent the Corporation and its Subsidiaries in connection with the Tax
Contest and shall use their reasonable efforts to provide the Shareholders
Representative with such assistance as may be reasonably requested by the
Shareholders Representative in connection with the Tax Contest.

  

 _Amended Returns, etc_. Without the prior written consent of
the Shareholders Representative (which consent may not be unreasonably
withheld), or unless otherwise required by Law, none of Buyer, the
Corporation, or any Affiliate of Buyer shall (i) file any amended Tax Return
or propose or agree to any adjustment of any item with any Tax Authority with
respect to any taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date that would
(in any such case) have the effect of increasing the Shareholders liability
for any Taxes, increasing the indemnification obligations of the Shareholders
or increasing the amount recoverable by Buyer from the Shareholders with
respect to Taxes.

  

 _Access and Assistance_. The Shareholders Representative and Buyer shall,
upon written request of the other, provide the other, and the Buyer shall
cause the Corporation and its Subsidiaries to provide the
Shareholders Representative, with such assistance as may be reasonably
requested by any of them in connection with the preparation of any Tax
Return, audit, or other examination by any Tax Authority, or any Tax
Authority or judicial or administrative proceedings relating to liability for
Taxes, and each will retain and provide the other, and Buyer shall cause the
Corporation and its Subsidiaries to retain and provide the Shareholders
Representative with, any records or other information that may be relevant to
such Tax Return, audit or examination, proceeding or determination.  The
Shareholders Representative and Buyer shall provide the other with any final
determination of any such audit or examination, proceeding or determination
that affects any amount required to be shown on any Tax Return of the other
or the Corporation or its Subsidiaries for any period. Such assistance shall
include making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide
additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder and
shall include providing copies of any relevant Tax Returns and supporting
work schedules, which assistance shall be provided without charge except
for reimbursement of reasonable out-of-pocket expenses. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, Buyer shall retain, and shall cause the
Corporation and its Subsidiaries to retain, and the Shareholders
Representative shall retain, until the applicable

   

45  

   

statutes of limitations (including any extensions) have expired, copies of
all Tax Returns, supporting work schedules, and other records or information
that may be relevant to such returns for all taxable periods or portions
thereof ending before or including the Closing Date and shall not destroy or
otherwise dispose of any such records without first providing the other party
with a reasonable opportunity to review and copy the same.  Each party shall
bear its own expenses in complying with the foregoing provisions.

  

 _Transfer and Similar Taxes_. All real property transfer or gains
Taxes, other transfer, documentary, sales, use, registration, stamp and
similar Taxes and fees (including any penalties and interest) incurred in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
(collectively, "Transfer Taxes") shall be borne equally by the Shareholders
on the one hand, and the Buyer on the other hand. The Shareholders, in the
case of Transfer Taxes and corresponding Tax Returns due on or prior to the
Closing Date, and Buyer, in the case of corresponding Tax Returns due after
the Closing Date, shall cause the Corporation to remit payment for such
Transfer Taxes and duly and timely file such Tax Returns. Buyer and the
Shareholders shall cooperate in (a) determining the amount of Transfer Taxes,
(b) providing all requisite exemption certificates, and (c) preparing and
timely filing any and all required Tax Returns for or with respect to such
Transfer Taxes with any and all appropriate Tax Authorities.

  

TERMINATION

by mutual written consent of the Buyer and Shareholders Representative at any
time prior to the Closing;

  

by the Buyer in the event of a material breach by any of the Shareholders or
the Corporation of any provision of this Agreement, which breach, is not
cured within 20 days after written notice thereof, or, if the nature of such
breach is such that it can not reasonably be cured within 20 days despite the
best efforts of the Shareholders and the Corporation, then within a
reasonable period thereafter not to exceed 75 days provided that
the Shareholders or the Corporation, as the case may be, have taken
reasonable steps to begin to cure such breach within the initial 20 day
period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Buyer may not terminate this
Agreement for any breach of the Agreement that can be satisfied by the
payment of monies if the Shareholders agree to allow a portion of the
Consideration payable to the Shareholders under _Section 2.1_ equal to the
amount reasonably necessary to cure such breach to be placed in escrow (in
addition to the Escrow Amount set forth in _Section 3.2(c)_ ), to be held by
the Escrow Agent until such breach is cured by the Shareholders to
the reasonable satisfaction of the Buyer or the Shareholders and the Buyer
agree in writing to direct payment of all or any portion of such escrowed
amount to Buyer in consideration of the waiver of such breach of the
Agreement;

        

by the Shareholders in the event of a material breach by the Buyer of any
provision of this Agreement, which breach is not cured within 20 days after
written notice thereof, or, if the nature of such breach is such that it can
not reasonably be cured within 20 days despite the best efforts of the
Shareholders and the Corporation, then within a reasonable period thereafter
not to exceed 75 days provided that the Buyer has taken all reasonable steps
to begin to cure such breach within the initial 20 day period. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Shareholders may not terminate this Agreement for any
breach of the Agreement by the Buyer that can be satisfied by the payment of
monies if the Buyer agrees to place in escrow an amount reasonably necessary
to cure such breach to be held in escrow until such breach is cured by the
Buyer to the reasonable satisfaction of the Shareholders or the Shareholders
and Buyer agree in writing to direct payment of all or any portion of such
escrowed amount to the Shareholders in consideration of the waiver of such
breach of the Agreement; and

  

by either Buyer on the one hand, provided it is not in breach, or the
Shareholders on the other hand, provided none of the Shareholders or the
Corporation are in breach, if the Closing shall not have occurred by December
31, 2007.

  

 _Effect of Termination_. Except for this _Section 12.2_ , the provisions of
_Articles X and XIV_ and _Sections 7.6 and 7.11_ hereof and any
