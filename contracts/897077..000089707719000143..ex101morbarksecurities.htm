adjustment statement setting forth the amount of the Closing Indebtedness, the
Closing Working Capital, and the Cash and Cash Equivalents, in each case, as
of the Closing and, based on the Closing Indebtedness, the Closing Working

Adjustment Statement"). The Preliminary Adjustment Statement shall be prepared
and dated as of 12:01 a.m. eastern standard time zone on the Closing Date, in
accordance with the Accounting Principles and, except where inconsistent with
the Accounting Principles, using the same accounting principles and practices
as the Company has used historically, and in accordance with the definitions
of Closing Indebtedness, Closing Working Capital, and Cash and Cash
Equivalents as defined in this Agreement. The Preliminary Adjustment Statement
will entirely disregard (i) any and all effects on the assets or liabilities
of the Company and its Subsidiaries as a result of the transactions
contemplated hereby or of any financing or refinancing arrangements entered
into at any time by Purchaser or any other transaction entered into by
Purchaser in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby, and (ii) any of the plans, transactions, or changes which Purchaser
intends to initiate or make or cause to be initiated or made after the Closing
with respect to the Company or its Subsidiaries or their business or assets,
or any facts or circumstances that are unique or particular to Purchaser or
any of its assets or liabilities. If a Preliminary Adjustment Statement is not
timely delivered by the Purchaser, then the Sellers' Representative shall have
the option, in its own discretion, of (i) electing, by written notice to the
Purchaser, for the Estimated Transaction Consideration to be final and binding
on Purchaser and the Sellers or (ii) electing to prepare a Preliminary
Adjustment Statement and delivering it to the Purchaser no later than one
hundred twenty (120) days after the Closing Date, in which case the review,
dispute resolution and adjustment payment provisions set forth in Sections
2.5.2-2.5.5 shall apply to Purchaser in the same manner in which they would
have applied to the Sellers if Purchaser had delivered a timely and complete
Preliminary Adjustment Statement, mutatis mutandis. For purposes of complying
with the terms set forth in this Section 2.5, each Party shall cooperate with
and make available to the other Parties, their respective Representatives, and
the Accounting Referee, if any, all information, records, data and working
papers, and shall permit access to its facilities and direct access to its
personnel, as may be reasonably required in connection with the preparation
and analysis of the Preliminary Adjustment Statement and the resolution of any
disputes thereunder.

2.5.2 Adjustment Statement Review. If the Sellers' Representative reasonably
believes that the Preliminary Adjustment Statement is inaccurate or was not
properly prepared in accordance with Section 2.5.1, the Sellers'
Representative shall so notify the Purchaser no later than thirty (30) days
after the Sellers' Representative's receipt thereof, setting forth in such
notice its objections to the Preliminary Adjustment Statement with
particularity and the specific changes which the Sellers' Representative
proposes to be made in order to conform the Preliminary Adjustment Statement
to the terms of Section 2.5.1.

2.5.3 Adjustment Statement Dispute Resolution. If the Sellers' Representative
timely notifies the Purchaser of an objection by the Sellers' Representative
to the Preliminary Adjustment Statement in accordance with Section 2.5.2, and
if the Sellers' Representative and the Purchaser are unable to resolve such
dispute through good faith negotiations within thirty (30) days after the
Sellers' Representative's delivery of such notice of objection, then the
Sellers' Representative and the Purchaser shall mutually engage and submit
such dispute to, and the same shall be finally resolved in accordance with the
provisions of this Agreement by, Baker Tilly or, if such firm declines the
representation, a nationally recognized accounting firm mutually agreed to by
the Sellers' Representative and the Purchaser (the accounting firm ultimately
chosen, the "Accounting Referee"). The Accounting Referee shall determine and
report in writing to the Sellers' Representative and the Purchaser as to the
resolution of all disputed matters and the effect of such determinations on
the Preliminary Adjustment Statement within thirty (30) days after such
submission or such longer period as the Accounting Referee may reasonably
require, and such determinations shall be final, binding, and conclusive on
the Parties and upon which a judgment may be entered by a court of competent
jurisdiction. In making such calculations and determination, the Accounting
Referee (A) shall consider only whether the calculations of such disputed
amounts were prepared in accordance with this Agreement and whether there were
mathematical errors in the Preliminary Adjustment Statement (and the
Accounting Referee is not authorized or permitted to make any other
determination), (B) shall be bound by the terms of this Agreement, including
the definitions contained herein and (C) shall not assign a value to any item
greater than the greatest value for such item claimed by either party or less
than the smallest value for such item claimed by either party. The Accounting
Referee's determination of any Disputed Amount

| | | | | | | | 
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|--- 

 

|

-4-

| 

 

EAST\168212916.9

* * *



shall be based solely on written materials, presentations and arguments
submitted and/or made by Purchaser and the Sellers' Representative (i.e., not
based on an independent review). The fees and disbursements of the Accounting
Referee shall be borne by the Party (i.e., the Sellers, on the one hand, or
the Purchaser, on the other hand) that assigned amounts to items in dispute
that were, on a net basis, furthest in amount from the amount finally
determined by the Accounting Referee (however, such fees and disbursements
shall be shared equally in the event that the Parties' assigned amounts were,
on a net basis, both no more than 10% from the amount finally determined by
the Accounting Referee).

2.5.4 Final Adjustment Statement. The Preliminary Adjustment Statement shall
become the "Final Adjustment Statement" and as such shall become final,
binding and conclusive on the Parties for all purposes of this Agreement and
upon which a judgment may be entered by a court of competent jurisdiction,
upon the earliest to occur of the following:

(a) the mutual acceptance by the Sellers' Representative and the Purchaser of
the Preliminary Adjustment Statement, with such changes thereto, if any, as
may be proposed by the Sellers' Representative and consented to by the
Purchaser;

(b) the expiration of thirty (30) days after the Sellers' Representative's, or
the Purchaser's, receipt of the Preliminary Adjustment Statement, without
timely written objection by the Sellers' Representative, or the Purchaser, in
accordance with Section 2.5.2; or

(c) the delivery to the Sellers' Representative and the Purchaser by the
Accounting Referee of the final report of its determination of all disputed
matters submitted to the Accounting Referee pursuant to Section 2.5.3.

2.5.5 Adjustment of Transaction Consideration. If the Transaction
Consideration, as finally determined in accordance with this Section 2.5, is
greater than the Estimated Transaction Consideration, the Purchaser shall pay
the amount of such difference for the benefit of the Sellers in cash, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated in writing to
the Purchaser by the Sellers' Representative within five (5) Business Days of
final determination of the Transaction Consideration. If the Transaction
Consideration, as finally determined in accordance with this Section 2.5, is
less than the Estimated Transaction Consideration, then the Sellers'
Representative and the Purchaser shall direct the Escrow Agent to pay to
Purchaser from the Escrow Account an amount equal to such deficiency, up to
the Escrowed Adjustment Amount, within five (5) Business Days of final
determination of the Transaction Consideration. If the Escrowed Adjustment
Amount is inadequate to discharge the amount owed by Sellers, the Sellers
(with several liability for such obligation) promptly shall pay the balance
owed to the Purchaser. For tax purposes, any payment by the Purchaser or the
Sellers under this Section 2.5 shall be treated as an adjustment to the
Transaction Consideration.

2.6 Intentionally Omitted.

2.7 Insurance Policy The Purchaser shall obtain the RandW Policy with respect to
the representations and warranties of the Company, Blocker LLC, Splitter LP
and the Sellers in this Agreement on terms reasonably acceptable to the
Sellers' Representative, including a waiver of subrogation as to all Sellers
(and their related parties and Affiliates, with all of them as third party
beneficiaries of the provision), other than in the case of a final
adjudication against such person for Fraud, and that the Sellers shall be a
third party beneficiary of the foregoing provision. The Purchaser shall not
enter into any amendment, variation, or waiver of the foregoing subrogation
provision without the prior written consent of the Sellers\' Representative.
All costs and expenses and other amounts incurred in connection with the RandW
Policy, whether incurred prior to or after the Closing, shall be paid by the
Purchaser. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 2.7 shall
obligate the Purchaser for any fees or expenses of the attorneys of the
Company Group (prior to Closing) or the Sellers.

period of time (including total loss of its investment), and has sufficient

will be, as of the date hereof, bound. Purchaser has fully paid (or caused to
be paid) any and all policy fees, premiums, and other amounts that are due and
payable on or prior to the date hereof in connection with the RandW Policy. The
RandW Policy is a "Purchaser\'s" policy and has been negotiated by the Purchaser
and the RandW Carrier in consultation with the Company Group and the Sellers'
Representative.

5.9 Purchaser's Investigation and Non-Reliance. The Purchaser is a highly
sophisticated purchaser and has on its own and through its Representatives
conducted its own comprehensive investigation, due diligence, review, and
analysis regarding the Company Group, the Sellers, and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements. The Purchaser and
its Representatives have been provided with full and complete access to the
Representatives, properties, offices, facilities, and books and records of the
Company Group and all other information (including the information necessary
to determine whether to enter into this Agreement) that they have requested in
connection with their investigation of the Company Group and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements. The Purchaser is
not relying, has not relied, and disclaims all reliance upon any statement,
representation, or warranty (whether oral, written, express, or implied) made
by the Sellers, the Company Group, or any of their Affiliates or
Representatives of any kind whatsoever, except, in the case of the Company
Group, as expressly set forth in Article III of this Agreement and the
Schedules specifically identified in Article III, and in the case of the
Sellers, in Articles III and IV of this Agreement, and the Schedules
specifically identified in Articles III and IV of this Agreement. Neither the
Sellers nor the Company Group nor any of their Affiliates or Representatives
shall have any liability to the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates or
Representatives resulting from the use of any information, documents, or
materials made available to the Purchaser (or its Representatives), whether
orally or in writing, in any confidential information memoranda (including the
Information Memorandum), "data rooms," "virtual data rooms," management
presentations (including the Management Presentation), due diligence (whether
or not received from the Sellers or the Company Group or any of their
Affiliates or Representatives) in any form (including via discussion or
presentation) in expectation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Neither the Sellers nor the Company Group (nor any of their
Affiliates or Representatives) is making, directly or indirectly, any
representation or warranty with respect to any estimates, projections, or
forecasts involving the Company Group, including as contained in the
Information Memorandum and the Management Presentation. The Purchaser
acknowledges and agrees that there are inherent uncertainties in attempting to
make such estimates, projections, and forecasts and that Purchaser takes full
responsibility for making its own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of
any such estimates, projections, or forecasts (including the reasonableness of
the assumptions underlying any such estimates, projections, or forecasts). The
Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that, should the Closing occur, the
Purchaser is acquiring the Securities without any representation or warranty
as to the merchantability or fitness for any particular purpose of the Company
Group's respective assets, the nature or extent of any liabilities or
Indebtedness, the prospects of the business of the Company Group, or the
effectiveness or the success of any business operations and on an "as is" and
"where is" basis, except as expressly set forth, in the case of the Company
Group, in Article III of this Agreement and the Schedules specifically
identified in Article III, and in the case of the Sellers, in Articles III and
IV of this Agreement and the Schedules specifically identified in Articles III
and IV of this Agreement. Nothing in this Section 5.6 is intended to modify or

* * *



of the express representations or warranties of the Company Group or each
Seller set forth in Article III, or of each Seller in Article IV. The
provisions of this Section 5.9, together with the limited exclusive remedies
provided in Article VII and Article IX, were specifically bargained-for
between the Purchaser, the Sellers, and the Company Group in arriving at the
consideration to be paid under this Agreement.

VI. CERTAIN COVENANTS

6.1 Further Actions. From time to time, as and when reasonably requested by
any Party to this Agreement, the other Parties will execute and deliver, or
cause to be executed and delivered, all such documents and instruments and
will take, or cause to be taken, all such further or other actions, as the
requesting Party may reasonably deem necessary or desirable to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, in any such case, at the
requesting Party's sole cost and expense.

6.2 Indemnification of Directors, Officers and Sellers. From the Closing
through the sixth anniversary of the Closing, the Purchaser shall, and shall
cause the Company Group to, indemnify, defend, and hold harmless, to the
fullest extent permitted by Law, each person who was or is made a party or
threatened to be made a party to or is involved in any proceeding by reason of
the fact that such person is or was at any time prior to the Closing a
director, officer, member or shareholder of the Company Group (the "Company
Indemnified Parties") against all Damages reasonably incurred or suffered by
such Company Indemnified Party in connection therewith, whether claimed prior
to, at, or after the Closing. The right to indemnification conferred in this
Section 6.2 shall include the right to be paid by each of the Purchaser, the
Company Group (including any of their successors and assigns) for the expenses
incurred in defending any such proceeding, in advance of its final
disposition, within thirty days of receipt by the Purchaser, the Company Group
from the Company Indemnified Party of a written claim therefor. The
Organizational Documents of the Company Group shall contain, and Purchaser
shall cause the Organizational Documents of the Company Group to so contain,
provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification, advancement of
expenses, and exculpation of present and former directors of the Company Group
than are set forth in the Organizational Documents of the Company Group as of
the Effective Date. If the Purchaser, the Company, the Company's Subsidiaries,
or any of their successors or assigns (a) consolidates with or merges with or
into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving entity,
partnership, or other entity of such consolidation or merger or (b) transfers
or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that
the successors and assigns of the Company Group assume the obligations set
forth in this Section 6.2. Prior to Closing, the Company and its Subsidiaries
shall procure, at the sole cost and expense of the Purchaser, a six-year tail
on the current officers' and directors' liability insurance policy (the "DandO
Insurance") covering the persons who were officers and directors at any time
during the twelve month period prior to the Closing with respect to actions or
omissions occurring prior to the Closing Date. Nothing in this Section 6.2
shall be deemed to create liability for the Company as it exists prior to
Closing. The Purchaser covenants for itself and its Affiliates (including the
Company Group from and after the Closing), successors, assigns, heirs,
legatees, and personal representatives that it shall not institute any demand,
action, suit, proceeding, litigation, claim, or any other action or proceeding
against any of the Company Indemnified Parties, in their capacity as such,
with respect to any Damages arising from or relating to actions occurring
prior to the Closing in connection with or otherwise related to or arising
from the Company or its Subsidiaries, whether or not such Company Indemnified
Parties would be entitled to indemnification by the Company Group or the
Purchaser under this Section 6.2. Other than with respect to Fraud, a breach
of this Agreement, or a breach of any applicable Ancillary Agreement,
effective as of the Closing Date, the Purchaser hereby releases, and shall
cause the Company Group to release, each Company Indemnified Person from any
and all actions, causes, suits, debts, dues, sums of money, accounts,
reckoning, bonds, bills, liabilities, specialties, covenants, contracts,
controversies, agreements, promises, variances, trespasses, damages,
judgments, extents, executions, claims, and demands relating to the Company
Group occurring prior to the Closing (each, a "Released Claim"), and agrees
not to bring or threaten to bring or otherwise join in any Released Claim
against the Company Indemnified Parties or any of them, relating to, arising

out of, or in connection with any facts or circumstances relating to the
Company Group or any of its Subsidiaries which existed on or prior to the
Closing Date, other than with respect to Fraud, breach of this Agreement, or
breach of an applicable Ancillary Agreement.

6.3 Conduct of Business of the Company.

During the period from the date of this Agreement through the Closing: (i) the
Company Group will, and the Sellers will use their commercially reasonable
efforts to, cause the Company Group to conduct its operations in the Ordinary
Course, save and except for actions that are reasonably necessary to prepare
for Closing or any post-Closing transition, and (ii) without the prior written
consent of the Purchaser which shall not unreasonably be withheld, assets of
the Company Group not considered material Current Assets shall not be disposed
of outside of the Ordinary Course unless replaced with assets of similar
quality and quantity.

6.4 Exclusive Dealing.

During the period from the Effective Date to the earlier of the Closing or the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, the Sellers,
including the Sponsor (and the Affiliates of such Persons) will not, nor shall
the Sellers, including the Sponsor permit the Company Group to, take any
action to engage in discussions or negotiations with any Person other than the
Purchaser (and its Affiliates and Representatives) concerning any purchase of
any interests or investment in, or any merger, asset sale, recapitalization,
or similar transaction involving, the Company Group.

6.5 Review of the Company.

Prior to the Closing, the Sellers will cause the Company Group to give the
Purchaser, directly or through its Affiliates or Representatives, access to
the operations, books, and records of the Company Group to the extent the
Purchaser deems it necessary or advisable to have such access. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, (a) the Purchaser and its Representatives shall under no
circumstance contact any employee, contractor, agent, supplier, or customer of
the Company or its Subsidiaries without the advance written consent of the
Company and, if consent is given, only on such terms as are approved by the
Company, with the understanding that the Company shall be involved in such
process and that no information received from any such contact shall be relied
upon as a representation or warranty (x) by the Company, unless expressly set
forth in, and limited to, Article III of this Agreement and the Schedules
specifically identified in Article III or (y) by the Sellers, unless expressly
set forth in, and limited to, Articles III and IV of this Agreement and the
Schedules specifically identified in Articles III and IV of this Agreement;
(b) any due diligence shall be conducted in a manner that is least disruptive
to the operations and employees of the Company Group; and (c) neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be obligated to provide any
documentation or communication if the disclosure of such information in the
reasonable opinion of counsel to the Company would jeopardize an attorney-
client privilege or any work product doctrine.

6.6 Commercially Reasonable Actions.

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, from the Effective Date
to the Closing or the earlier termination of this Agreement pursuant to
Section 10.1, each of the Parties shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to comply with the covenants set forth in this Agreement; comply with
all applicable Laws, Orders, and Permits; and cause to be done all other
things reasonably necessary, proper, or advisable to consummate and make
effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

6.7 Update of Schedules.

The Company and the Sellers shall have the right prior to Closing to
supplement, modify, or amend the Schedules with respect to any matter arising
or discovered after the Effective Date which if existing or known at the
Effective Date would have been required to be set forth or described in such
Schedules and also with respect to events or conditions arising after the
Effective Date and prior to Closing. Any such supplemented, modified, or
amended Schedules shall be deemed to have cured any breach of any term or
condition set forth in this Agreement.

6.8 Intentionally Omitted.

shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take such actions as are
reasonably necessary to satisfy the closing conditions set forth in Article

efforts to take all actions required to be taken by the Purchaser to obtain
and bind the RandW Policy on the terms and conditions set forth in the Binder
Agreement in order to satisfy any conditions to the effectiveness of the RandW
Policy or the coverage to be provided thereby. The Purchaser shall pay or
cause to be paid, all costs and expenses related to the RandW Policy, including
the total premium, underwriting costs, brokerage commissions, and other fees
and expenses of such policy, as and when required by the Binder Agreement.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Purchaser shall timely
pay all premiums and other amounts required to cause the RandW Policy to become
and/or remain effective in accordance with its terms as of the Closing. The
RandW Policy shall be bound as of the date hereof, and shall include interim
breach coverage for the period between the date hereof and the Closing. During
the term of the RandW Policy, the Purchaser (i) shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries and their Affiliates, to maintain the RandW Policy in full force
and effect and (ii) shall not, and shall not permit its Subsidiaries to, (A)
amend, repeal or modify any provision of the RandW Policy without Seller's prior
written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, it
being understood that it shall not be unreasonable for Seller to withhold
consent in the event that any such amendment, repeal or modification would
adversely affect the Seller, in Seller's sole discretion), (B) take any action
or omit to take any action that would result in the cancellation, termination,
amendment or modification of the RandW Insurance Policy or coverage thereunder
other than by payment of claims thereunder, (C) permit the assignment,
substitution or transfer of the rights or obligations of the insurer under the
RandW Policy other than as allowed by the terms of the RandW Policy.

6.11 Merger Control Notifications. The Purchaser and the Sellers'
Representative on behalf of each of the Sellers shall (a) make the

authorizations, waivers, clearances and approvals, and to cause the expiration
or termination of any applicable waiting periods, (c) comply at the earliest
practicable date with any request for additional information or documentary

another in connection with any filings under the HSR Act or other Antitrust

reasonable best efforts to cause the waiting periods under the HSR Act to
terminate or expire, and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby as
promptly as possible and, in any event and in each case,

adversary proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, concerning the
legality of this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby

7.1 Preparation of Tax Returns; Control of Audits; Tax Refunds.

7.1.1 The Sellers' Representative shall prepare or cause to be prepared for
filing by the Company Group all Tax Returns for any Group Company for all Tax
periods ending on or before the Closing Date (the "Pre-Closing Periods") that
are due after the Closing Date and use commercially reasonable efforts to
ensure that such Tax Returns are filed no later than one (1) year following
the Closing Date. Such Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner consistent
with the terms of this Agreement and the Company's past practices, except to
the extent required by applicable Law. Such Tax Returns (including any related
work papers or other information reasonably requested by the Purchaser) shall
be provided to the Purchaser for its review not later than forty-five (45)
days before the due date for filing such Tax Returns (including extensions).
If the Purchaser does not provide the Sellers' Representative with a written
description of the items in the Tax Returns or the tax statement that the
Purchaser intends to dispute within fifteen (15) Business Days following the
delivery to the Purchaser of such documents, the Purchaser shall be deemed to
have accepted and agreed to such documents in the form provided, and the
Purchaser shall thereafter cause all such Tax Returns to be timely filed by
the applicable Group Company. The Purchaser shall not make any changes to such
Tax Returns without the prior written approval of the Sellers' Representative
which shall not be unreasonably withheld. The Purchaser shall defend,
indemnify and hold harmless each of the Sellers for any Damages they may
suffer or incur for the Purchaser's failure to timely file such Tax Returns or
obtain the approval of the Sellers' Representative as required in this Section
7.1.1. The Sellers' Representative and the Purchaser agree to timely consult
with each other and to negotiate in good faith any timely-raised issue arising
as a result of the review of such Tax Returns or the tax statement to permit
the filing of such Tax Returns as promptly as possible, which good faith
negotiations shall include each side exchanging in writing their positions
concerning the matter(s) in dispute and a meeting telephonically or in person
to discuss their respective positions. In the event the Parties are unable to
resolve any dispute within ten (10) days following the delivery of written
notice by the Purchaser of such dispute, the Sellers' Representative and the
Purchaser shall jointly request the Accounting Referee to resolve any issue in
dispute at least five (5) days before the due date of such Tax Return, in
order that such Tax Return may be timely filed. The Accounting Referee shall
make a determination with respect to any disputed issue within five (5) days
before the due date (including extensions) for the filing of the Tax Return in
question, and the Purchaser shall cause the applicable Group Company to file
such Tax Return on the due date (including extensions) therefor in a manner
consistent with the determination of the Accounting Referee. The determination
of the Accounting Referee shall be binding on the Parties; provided, however,
that any such determination shall be limited to the resolution of issues in
dispute. The fees and disbursements of the Accounting Referee shall be borne
by the Party (i.e., the Sellers, on the one hand, and the Purchaser, on the
other hand, that assigned amounts to items in dispute that were,

on a net basis, furthest in amount from the amount finally determined by the
Accounting Referee, or equally, in the event the Parties' assigned amounts
were, on a net basis, both no more than 10% from the amount finally determined
by the Accounting Referee). The Sellers, by and through the Sellers'
Representative, will timely pay (or cause to be timely paid) or reimburse the
Company or the Purchaser as applicable for all Pre-Closing Tax Liabilities (as
such term is defined herein) shown as due and owing on all such Tax Returns,
other than to the extent that an accrual with respect to such Tax is included
as a liability and taken into account for purposes of calculating Indebtedness
or Closing Working Capital. Except as expressly contemplated in this Article
VII, under no circumstances shall the Purchaser or any Group Company amend any
Tax Returns for Pre-Closing Periods without the prior written consent of the
Sellers' Representative which shall not be unreasonably withheld.

7.1.2 In the case of any taxable period that includes (but does not end on)
the Closing Date (a "Straddle Period"), the amount of any Taxes based on or
measured by income, receipts, or payroll of the Company or the Blocker LLC for
the portion of any taxable period beginning prior to the Closing Date shall be
determined based on a closing of the books as of the close of business on the
Closing Date (and for such purpose, the taxable period of any partnership or
other pass-through entity in which the Company or the Blocker LLC holds a
beneficial interest shall be deemed to terminate at such time) and the amount
of other Taxes of the Company or the Blocker LLC for a Straddle Period that
relates to the portion of any taxable period beginning prior to the Closing
Date determined based on actual results of operations prior to the Closing
Date. The Purchaser shall prepare or cause to be prepared, and timely file or
cause to be timely filed, all Tax Returns for the Blocker LLC, Splitter LP,
the Company and its Subsidiaries for the Straddle Periods. Such Tax Returns
shall be prepared in a manner consistent with the Company and the Blocker
LLC's respective past practices, except to the extent required by applicable
Law. Such Tax Returns (including any related work papers or other information
reasonably requested by the Sellers' Representative) shall be provided to the
Sellers' Representative for such person's review not later than forty-five
(45) Business Days before the due date for filing such Tax Returns (including
extensions). If the Sellers' Representative does not provide the Purchaser
with a written description of the items in the Tax Returns or the tax
statement that the Sellers' Representative intends to dispute within fifteen
(15) Business Days following the delivery to the Sellers' Representative of
such documents, the Sellers shall be deemed to have accepted and agreed to
such documents in the form provided, and the Purchaser shall thereafter cause
such Tax Returns to be timely filed by the applicable Group Company in the
form provided to the Sellers' Representative. The Purchaser and the Sellers'
Representative agree to timely consult with each other and to negotiate in
good faith any timely-raised issue arising as a result of the review of such
Tax Returns or the tax statement to permit the filing of such Tax Returns as
promptly as possible, which good faith negotiations shall include each side
exchanging in writing their positions concerning the matter or matters in
dispute and a meeting (whether in person or telephone) to discuss their
respective positions. In the event the Parties are unable to resolve any
dispute within ten (10) Business Days following the delivery of written notice
by the Sellers' Representative of such dispute, the Purchaser and the Sellers'
Representative shall jointly request the Accounting Referee to resolve any
issue in dispute at least ten (10) Business Days before the due date of such
Tax Return, in order that such Tax Return may be timely filed. The Accounting
Referee shall make a determination with respect to any disputed issue within
five (5) Business Days before the due date for the filing of the Tax Return in
question, and the Purchaser shall cause the applicable Group Company to file
such Tax Return on the due date (including extensions) for the filing of the
Tax Return with content consistent with the determination of the Accounting
Referee. The determination of the Accounting Referee shall be binding on the
Parties; provided, however, that any such determination shall be limited to
the resolution of issues in dispute. The fees and disbursements of the
Accounting Referee shall be borne by the Party (i.e., the Sellers, on the one
hand, and the Purchaser, on the other hand), that assigned amounts to items in
dispute that were, on a net basis, furthest in amount from the amount finally
determined by the Accounting Referee, or equally, in the event the Parties'
assigned amounts were, on a net basis, equally far, from or both within 10% of
the amount finally determined by the Accounting Referee). In addition to the
Straddle Period Tax Returns prepared by the Purchaser pursuant to this Section
7.1.2, the Purchaser shall also submit to the Sellers' Representative,
together with Straddle Period

Tax Returns, a proposed allocation of the Taxes with respect to any such
Straddle Period for which the Sellers are responsible pursuant to Section
7.4.3 hereof ("Sellers' Straddle Period Allocation"), and the dispute
resolution mechanism set forth in this Section 7.1.2 shall also apply with
respect to such proposed Sellers' Straddle Period Allocation. The Sellers,
severally, shall pay to the Purchaser on or before the date which is three (3)
Business Days before the due date of each applicable Tax Return (after giving
effect to any valid extensions) the amount of the Pre-Closing Tax Liabilities
for which the Sellers are responsible, as determined under this Section 7.1,
other than to the extent that an accrual with respect to such Tax is included
as a liability and taken into account for purposes of calculating Indebtedness
or Closing Working Capital. Post-Closing, the Purchaser, either through itself
or through the Company Group, will be solely responsible for any and all Taxes
of, or payable by, any Group Company that do not constitute Pre-Closing Tax
Liabilities, including without limitation, in the case of Taxes with respect
to a Straddle Period, all Taxes which are allocable, pursuant to Section
7.1.2, to the portion of such taxable year or period commencing after the
Closing Date.

7.1.3 The Purchaser and the Sellers' Representative shall cooperate fully in
connection with the filing of the Tax Returns pursuant to this Section 7.1
and, subject in all respects to the provisions of Section 7.2, in connection
with any audit, litigation, or other proceeding with respect to the Taxes of
any Group Company. Such cooperation shall include reasonably furnishing or
making available during normal business hours each Party's personnel;
executing reasonably necessary powers of attorney; and retaining for any
statutory period of limitations for the audit of any Tax Period by the
relevant tax authority and (upon a Party's request) providing records and
information that are reasonably relevant to the preparation of any such Tax
Return or to any such audit, litigation or other proceeding. The Purchaser and
the Sellers' Representative shall (a) retain or cause to be retained all books
and records that are in their possession with respect to Tax matters pertinent
to any Group Company relating to any Pre-Closing Period or Straddle Period
until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations (and, to the
extent notified by the Purchaser or the Sellers' Representative, any extension
thereof) for any audit or for any civil or criminal claim that could be
brought with respect to the applicable taxable periods, and abide by all
record retention agreements entered into with any Governmental Authority, and
(b) give the other Parties reasonable written notice before transferring,
destroying or discarding any such books and records and, if the other Party so
requests, the Purchaser or the Sellers' Representative, as the case may be,
shall allow the other Party to take possession of such books and records.

7.1.4 The Purchaser and the Sellers' Representative shall, upon request, use
their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any certificate or other
document from any Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce, or eliminate
any Tax that could be imposed on any Group Company (including with respect to
the transactions contemplated hereby).

7.1.5 To the extent that, subsequent to the date hereof, any Group Company
receives (a) any Tax refund attributable to the period of time prior to the
Closing, or the Purchaser receives any such Tax refund attributable to the
operations of any Group Company prior to the Closing, or (b) any credits
against Taxes in lieu of refunds described in clause (a), such Tax refund or
credits shall be the property of the Sellers, other than to the extent set
forth in the following sentence, and the Purchaser shall remit, and shall
cause the Company Group, to remit such Tax refund(s) or credits to the
Sellers' Representative for the benefit of the Sellers, within three (3)
Business Days after the receipt by the Group Company of such Tax refunds or
utilization of such Tax credits. The foregoing shall not apply with respect to
any Tax refund that is reflected as an asset of the applicable Group Company
that is taken into account for purposes of calculating Indebtedness or Closing
Working Capital. The Sellers' Representative shall have the authority, subject
the consent of Purchaser not to be unreasonably withheld, to prepare any claim
for refund or amended Tax Return for any Pre-Closing Tax Periods of any Group
Company and the Purchaser shall (and shall cause the Company Group to) execute
and timely file all such claim or Tax Return.

7.1.6 The Parties hereby acknowledge and agree that any and all Transaction
Tax Deductions and any other Tax benefits in any way arising out of or related
to the payment of the Selling Expenses, the Closing Indebtedness, any options
or restricted stock awards of the Company on or prior to the Closing Date and
any employee bonuses paid in connection with the transactions contemplated
herein shall be for the sole benefit of the Sellers and shall be allocated to
the applicable Pre-Closing Tax Period ending at 11:59 p.m. on the Closing Date
or the applicable portion of any Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date;
provided such amounts are either accrued as Current Liabilities, paid as
Closing Payments, or paid by Sellers without reimbursement from a Group
Company. The parties hereby agree to (i) prepare and file all Tax Returns
consistent with such allocation and (ii) the Sellers' entitlement to the
benefit of any and all such Transaction Tax Deductions and other Tax benefits
through the end of the applicable Pre-Closing Tax Period.

any Tax Return relating to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, (ii) make or change any
election with respect to, or that has retroactive effect to, any Pre-Closing
Tax Period of any Group Company, (iii) agree to waive or extend the statute of

Period in a jurisdiction where the Group Company has not historically filed
Tax Returns, (iv) initiate discussions or examinations with taxing authorities
regarding Taxes of any Group Company with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period,
(v) make any voluntary disclosures with respect to Taxes of any Group Company
for a Pre-Closing Tax Period, (vi) enter into any closing agreement or settle
any Tax claim or assessment relating to any Group Company for a Pre-Closing
Tax Period, (vii) surrender any right to claim a refund of Taxes of any Group
Company for a Pre-Closing Tax Period or (viii) otherwise take any action with
respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period that could result in the Sellers (or their
direct or indirect owners) being liable for any amounts, including under this
Agreement or to any taxing authority.

7.12 Tax Claims.

In the event a claim is made or a deficiency alleged following the Closing
relating to any Group Company by the IRS or any other taxing authority, which,
if successful, would result in a loss or liability in respect of which
indemnity may be properly sought against the Sponsor or Sellers, severally,
pursuant to this Agreement (collectively, an "Indemnity Tax Matter"), then the
following shall apply:

7.2.1 After any Group Company receives actual notice of a claim or alleged
deficiency, the Purchaser shall, or the Purchaser shall cause the Company to,
promptly (but in any event within five (5) Business Days) notify the Sellers'
Representative in writing of such claim or alleged deficiency.

7.2.2 The Sellers' Representative shall have the right to represent the
interests of the applicable Group Company before the relevant Governmental

Matter, including responding to inquiries, filing or amending Tax Returns, and
contesting, defending against, and resolving any assessment for additional
Taxes or notice of Tax deficiency or other adjustment of Taxes of, or relating
to, any such Indemnity Tax Matter. The Purchaser shall have the right (but not
the obligation) to participate in the defense of such Indemnity Tax Matter and
to employ counsel, at the Purchaser's own expense, separate from counsel
employed by the Sellers' Representative on behalf of the Sellers, and the
Sellers' Representative shall keep the Purchaser informed with respect to the
commencement, status, and nature of any such Indemnity Tax Matter and will, in
good faith, allow the Purchaser to consult with the Sellers' Representative
regarding the conduct of or positions taken in any such action.

(a) The Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall have no right to recover any
amounts pursuant to Section 9.2.1(a) (other than with regard to a Fundamental
Representation or a Tax Representation) until the total amount of such Damages
incurred by the Purchaser Indemnified Parties under Section 9.2.1(a), in the
aggregate, exceeds $1,320,000 (the "Deductible"), in which case the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties' sole recourse and remedy to recover any Damages pursuant
to Section 9.2.1(a) in excess of the Deductible will be: first, amounts
remaining of the Escrowed Indemnification Amount, then second, the RandW Policy.
Other than the Escrowed Indemnification Amount or amounts owed pursuant to
Section 7.1.2, or in the case of: (i) Fraud by such Seller, or (ii) a failure
of a Fundamental Representation or a Tax Representation, Purchaser Indemnified
Parties shall have no right to recover any amounts from any Seller pursuant to
Section 9.2.1(a). The Deductible will not apply to: (x) Fraud by a Seller, or
(y) a failure of a Fundamental Representation or a Tax Representation;
provided that with respect to a failure of a Fundamental Representation or a
Tax Representation, the Purchaser Indemnified Parties' recourse and remedy to
recover Damages related thereto will be: first, amounts remaining of the
Escrowed Indemnification Amount, then second, the Sellers until the retention
under the RandW Policy has been satisfied, then third, the RandW Policy until it
has been exhausted, and then fourth, the Sellers; provided, however to the
extent that such failure solely relates to the obligation of Sellers to pay
income Taxes related to a Pre-Closing Tax Period pursuant to Article VII
hereof and such failure is not subject to the RandW Policy, the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties' may seek recourse against the Sellers prior to exhausting
the RandW Policy, subject to the limitations provided in this Article IX.

(b) The maximum aggregate liability for Damages pursuant to (i) Section
9.2.1(b) shall not exceed ten percent (10%) of the amount of the Transaction
Consideration and (ii) in the case of: (x) Fraud, or (y) failure of a
Fundamental Representation or a Tax Representation shall not exceed the amount
of the Transaction Consideration actually received by the Sellers. The
Purchaser Indemnified Parties agree and stipulate that they shall not sue for
or seek to recover punitive damages or rescission damages in any lawsuit
claiming Fraud.

(c) The Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to indemnification
for any Damages to the extent a liability with respect to such Damages was
specifically reserved against or otherwise reflected on the Financial
Statements, unless such liability exceeds the amount of such reserve or the
amount reflected on the Financial Statements. In addition, a Purchaser
Indemnified Party may not seek indemnification for Damages suffered by it if
it has already received payment for such Damages in a post-Closing adjustment
under Section 2.5 or pursuant to the RandW Policy.

(d) The Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to indemnification
for any Damages pursuant to Section 9.2.1(b) to the extent indemnification for
such Damages can be sought pursuant to Section 9.2.1(a), which shall be such
Purchaser Indemnified Parties' sole remedy with respect to such Damages.

applicable to such representation and warranty.

9.3 Indemnification by the Purchaser.

9.3.1 Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Purchaser
will indemnify the Sellers and the Sellers' Representative (collectively, the
"Seller Indemnified Parties") against any and all Damages actually incurred or
suffered by the Seller Indemnified Parties to the extent resulting from
arising out of or otherwise related to:

(a) any failure of any Fundamental Representation made by the Purchaser in
this Agreement to be true and correct as of the date hereof and as of the
Closing (except those representations and warranties that address matters only
as of a specified date, which shall be true and correct as of that specified
date); or

(b) any breach of any covenant required to be performed by the Purchaser
pursuant to this Agreement.

9.3.2 The Seller Indemnified Parties shall have no right to recover any
amounts pursuant to Section 9.1(a) unless the Sellers' Representative notifies
Purchaser in writing pursuant to Section 9.4 by the Representations and
Warranties Survival Date. The Seller Indemnified Parties shall have no right
to recover any amounts pursuant to Section 9.1(b) unless the Sellers'
Representative notifies Purchaser in writing pursuant to Section 9.4 by the
Covenant Survival Date.

9.3.3 The Seller Indemnified Parties shall have no right to recover any
amounts pursuant to Section 9.1(a) until the total amount of such Damages
incurred by the Seller Indemnified Parties under Section 9.1(a), in the
aggregate, exceeds the Deductible, in which case the Seller Indemnified
Parties will be entitled to recover Damages in excess of the Deductible;
provided, however, that the Deductible shall not apply in the case of Fraud
committed by the Purchaser.

9.3.4 The aggregate liability of the Purchaser for Damages under Section
9.1(a) shall not exceed the Transaction Consideration; provided, however, that
such cap shall not apply in the case of Fraud committed by the Purchaser.

9.4 Indemnification Procedures.

9.4.1 Except as provided in Article VII with respect to certain Tax matters,
if any Person who or which is entitled to seek indemnification under Section
9.2 or 9.3 (an "Indemnified Party") receives notice of the assertion or
commencement of any Third Party Claim against such Indemnified Party with
respect to which the Person against whom or which such indemnification is
being sought (an "Indemnifying Party") is obligated to provide indemnification
under this Agreement, the Indemnified Party will give such Indemnifying Party
reasonably prompt written notice thereof; provided, however, that if the
Indemnified Party receives a complaint, petition, or any other pleading in
connection with a Third Party Claim which requires the filing of an answer or
other responsive pleading, the Indemnified Party shall furnish the
Indemnifying Party with a copy of such pleading at least ten (10) days prior
to the date a responsive pleading thereto is required to be filed (or promptly
upon receipt by the Indemnified Party, if the Indemnified Party receives such
complaint, petition or other pleading within such ten (10) day period). Such
notice by the Indemnified Party will describe the Third Party Claim in
reasonable detail, will include the justification for the demand for
indemnification under this Agreement with specificity, will include copies of
all available material written evidence thereof, and will indicate

* * *



the estimated amount, if reasonably practicable, of the Damages that have been
or may be sustained by the Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party will have
the right to participate in the defense of such Third Party Claim at the
Indemnifying Party's expense, or at its option (subject to the limitations set
forth in this Section 9.4.1) to assume the defense thereof by appointing a
recognized and reputable counsel to be the lead counsel in connection with
such defense; provided, however, that:

(a) The Indemnifying Party must give the Indemnified Party written notice of
its election to assume control of the defense of the Third Party Claim within
thirty (30) Business Days of the Indemnifying Party's receipt of the required
detailed notice of the Third Party Claim.

(b) In the event the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of the Third Party
Claim, the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense
of the Third Party Claim and to employ a recognized and reputable counsel of
its choice for such purpose; provided, however, that the fees and expenses of
such separate counsel shall be borne by the Indemnified Party and shall not be
subject to indemnification under this Article IX. In no event shall the
Indemnified Party or the Indemnifying Party settle a Third Party Claim without
the prior express written consent of the other Party, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed.

9.4.2 Any claim by an Indemnified Party on account of Damages that does not
result from a Third Party Claim (a "Direct Claim") will be asserted by giving
the Indemnifying Party reasonably prompt written notice thereof, but in any
event not later than thirty (30) days after the Indemnified Party becomes
actually aware of such Direct Claim. Such notice by the Indemnified Party will
describe the Direct Claim in reasonable detail, will include the justification
for the demand under this Agreement with specificity, will include copies of
all available material written evidence thereof, and will indicate the
estimated amount, if reasonably practicable, of Damages that has been or may
be sustained by the Indemnified Party.

9.5 Miscellaneous Indemnification Provisions.

9.5.1 Exclusive Remedy. Other than claims for Fraud, any claim pursuant to the
DandO Insurance, or any claim pursuant to Article II, the indemnification
provisions of this Article IX and Article VII shall be the sole and exclusive
remedy of the Indemnified Persons with respect to claims arising out of,
concerning, or related to the transactions that are the subject of, this
Agreement, whether sounding in contract, tort, fraud, statute, or otherwise,
and whether asserted against the Purchaser, the Company Group, their
respective officers, directors or employees, the Sellers' Representative, any
of the Sellers, or any other Person. However, in no event shall any Party, its
successors, or its permitted assigns be entitled to claim or seek rescission
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or rescission damages. Each
of the Parties, on behalf of itself and its equity owners, directors,
managers, officers, employees, Subsidiaries, and Affiliates, covenants not to
sue and agrees not to bring any actions or proceedings, at Law, equity, or
otherwise, against any other Party or its equity owners, directors, managers,
officers, employees, Subsidiaries or Affiliates arising out of, concerning, or
relating to any breach or alleged breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant, or condition in this Agreement, except pursuant to the express
provisions of this Article IX, Article II, or Article VII. Notwithstanding any
other sentence in this Section 9.5.1, (i) each Party shall be entitled to
bring an action for injunctive relief or specific performance to enforce the
terms of this Agreement and (ii) it is explicitly agreed that the Sellers'
Representative and the Company shall be entitled to seek specific performance
to cause the Purchaser to consummate the transaction contemplated hereby in
the event that (a) all conditions in Section 8.1 have been satisfied or waived
(other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied by
actions taken at the Closing, (b) the Purchaser fails to complete the Closing
by the date the Closing would otherwise be required to occur pursuant to
Section 2.2, and (c) the Sellers and the Company have confirmed to Purchaser
in writing that they are prepared to consummate the Closing. The foregoing
shall not be deemed to be or construed as a waiver or election of remedies by
either Party.

indemnification payment made pursuant to this Agreement shall be treated as an
adjustment to the Transaction Consideration for Tax purposes, unless otherwise
required by Law.

9.5.4 Insurance Proceeds and Other Recoveries; Tax Benefit. To be entitled to
seek indemnification under this Article IX from an Indemnifying Party, an
Indemnified Party must take commercially reasonable efforts to recover or
obtain payment for any Damages under any and all insurance policies that apply
or may apply to such Damages (including the RandW Policy). The amount of Damages
recoverable by an Indemnified Party pursuant to this Article IX with respect
to an indemnity claim shall be reduced by the amount of insurance or
indemnification proceeds, Tax Benefit, or other amounts actually recovered
from other sources by such Indemnified Party (following its commercially
reasonable efforts) with respect to the Damages to which such indemnity claim
relates, net of any reasonable expenses related to the recovery of such
payment.

9.5.5 No Consequential Damages. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
elsewhere in this Agreement, no Party (including any of its Subsidiaries)
shall, in any event, be liable to any other Person for any consequential,
incidental, indirect, immaterial, speculative, special, or punitive Damages of
such other Person, including loss of future revenue, income or profits,
diminution of value, or loss of business reputation or opportunity relating to
the breach or alleged breach hereof.

9.5.6 Good Faith; Mutual Cooperation. The Indemnifying Party and the
Indemnified Party shall reasonably cooperate with each other with respect to
resolving any claim or liability with respect to which an Indemnifying Party
is allegedly obligated to indemnify an Indemnified Party hereunder. The
Indemnified Party shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate
Damages (including the obligations under Section 9.5.4) and resolve any such
claim or liability.

power of the Securities at any time prior to the Closing or, if after Closing,

in trust and, if appropriate under this Agreement, distributing the
Transaction Consideration and paying any associated costs and expenses of the
transactions hereunder required to be paid by such Seller; (b) giving and
receiving all notices permitted or required by this Agreement or the Escrow
Agreement and acting on the Sellers' behalf hereunder for all purposes
specified in this Agreement or in the Escrow Agreement; (c) delivering any
unit certificates or instruments of transfer for the Securities endorsed or
executed by the Sellers to the Purchaser at Closing and any and all

all things and taking all actions, which the Sellers' Representative in its
sole discretion, may consider necessary or proper in the best interests of the
Sellers in connection with or to carry out the terms of this Agreement, as
fully as if such Sellers were personally present and acting. This power of
attorney and all authority conferred hereby is granted and conferred in
consideration of those interests and for the purpose of completing the
transactions contemplated hereby, and this power of attorney and all authority
conferred hereby shall be irrevocable and shall not be terminated by the
Sellers or by operation of Law, whether by the termination of the Sellers'
Representative or by the occurrence of any other event. If any Seller who is
an individual should die or become incompetent or incapacitated, any Seller
that is a legal entity should be dissolved, liquidated, or wound up, or any
other similar event should occur before the delivery of unit certificates or
other instruments of transfer representing the Securities pursuant to this
Agreement, such unit certificates and instruments shall nevertheless be
delivered by or on behalf of such Seller in accordance with the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, and all actions taken by the Sellers'
Representative pursuant to this Agreement shall be as valid as if such death,
incompetence, incapacity, dissolution, termination, winding up, or other
similar event had not occurred, regardless of whether the Purchaser or the
Sellers' Representative has received notice of such death, incompetence,
incapacity, dissolution, termination, winding up, or other similar event. The
Sellers' Representative will be promptly reimbursed by the Sellers for all
reasonable expenses, disbursements, or advances incurred by the Sellers'
Representative in such capacity upon demand. The Sellers, severally and not
jointly, agree to indemnify and hold harmless the Sellers' Representatives for
and from any Damages it may incur as a result of its duties hereunder or any
of its actions or inactions as such, except as may result from the Sellers'
Representative's actions that would constitute fraud, breach of fiduciary
duty, willful misconduct, or gross negligence.

10.7 Disclaimer of Unidentified Third Party Beneficiaries.

Except as provided in Article IX, this Agreement is for the sole benefit of
the Parties, the Company Group, and any of their successors and assigns (if
such successors or assigns are expressly permitted by this Agreement). Nothing
in this Agreement expressed or implied will give or be construed to give to
any Person, other than the Parties, the Company Group, and such permitted
successors and assigns, any legal or equitable rights under this Agreement.
