respective companies and their shareholders to consummate the business
combination transaction provided for herein in which the Company will,
subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, merge (the "Merger")

immediately following the consummation of the Merger; and   WHEREAS, the
parties desire to make certain representations, warranties and agreements in
connection with the Merger and also to prescribe certain conditions to the
Merger.   NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual
covenants, representations, warranties and agreements contained herein, and
intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties agree as follows:   
ARTICLE I   THE MERGER   1.1 The Merger. Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, in accordance with the Florida Business
Corporation Act (the "FBCA") and the South Carolina Business Corporation Act
("SCBCA"), at the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.2 hereof), the
Company shall merge with and into Parent. Parent shall be the surviving
corporation (hereinafter sometimes called the "Surviving Corporation") in the
Merger, and shall continue its corporate existence under the laws of the
State of South Carolina. The name of the Surviving Corporation shall continue
to be "The South Financial Group, Inc." Upon consummation of the Merger,
the separate corporate existence of the Company shall terminate.   1.2
Effective Time. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, articles of
merger complying with the FBCA (the "Florida Articles of Merger") shall be
duly prepared, executed and delivered for filing by the Department of State
of the State of Florida (the "Florida Department") as provided in the FBCA,
and articles of merger complying with the SCBA (the "South Carolina Articles
of Merger") shall be duly prepared, executed and delivered for filing by the
Secretary of State of the State of South Carolina (the "South Carolina
Secretary"), in each case on the Closing Date. The Merger shall become
effective at such time (the "Effective Time") as the later of the following
has occurred: (i) the Florida Articles of Merger are filed by the Florida
Department, (ii) the South Carolina Articles of Merger are filed by the South
Carolina Secretary; or (iii) at such time specified in the Florida Articles
of Merger and/or the South Carolina Articles of Merger.   1.3 Effects of
the Merger. At and after the Effective Time, the Merger shall have the
effects set forth in the FBCA and the SCBCA.   1.4 Conversion of Company
Common Stock.   (a) At the Effective Time, subject to the other provisions
of this Article I, and Sections 2.2(e) and 9.1(h) hereof, each share of
common stock, par value $1.00 per share, of the Company (the "Company
Common Stock") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time (other than shares of Company Common Stock held directly or indirectly
by Parent or the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries (as
defined below) (except for Trust Account Shares and DPC Shares, as such terms
are defined in Section 1.4(d) hereof)) shall, by virtue of this Agreement
and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into
and exchangeable for the right to receive, at the election of the
holder thereof as provided in and subject to the provisions of Section 1.5,
either (i) a number of shares of common stock, par value $1.00 per share,
of Parent ("Parent Common Stock") (together with the number of Parent
Rights (as defined in Section 5.2 hereof) associated therewith) equal to the
Per Share Stock Consideration or (ii) cash in an amount equal to the Per
Share Consideration (the "Per Share Cash Consideration"; the Per Share
Stock Consideration and the Per Share Cash Consideration are referred to
herein collectively as the "Merger Consideration").  For purposes of this
Section 1.4(a):   "Per Share Stock Consideration" shall mean the quotient,
rounded to the nearest ten-thousandth, obtained by dividing the Per
Share Consideration by the Final Parent Stock Price.   "Per Share
Consideration" shall mean the quotient, rounded to the nearest ten-
thousandth, obtained by dividing the Aggregate Consideration by the Common
Stock Deemed Outstanding.   "Aggregate Consideration" shall mean the sum of
(x) the Total Stock Consideration and (y) the Total Cash Amount.   "Total
Stock Consideration" shall mean the product obtained by multiplying (x) the
Total Stock Amount and (y) the Final Parent Stock Price.   "Total Stock
Amount" shall mean the product of (i) 0.6950 and (ii) 6,424,664.   "Total
Cash Amount" shall mean an amount equal to $32,400,178.   "Total Outstanding
Options" shall mean the number of shares of Company Common Stock issuable
upon exercise of all options granted by the Company to purchase shares of
Company Common Stock pursuant to the Company 1995 Nonstatutory Stock Option
Plan and outstanding as of the close of business on the Determination
Date.   "Common Stock Deemed Outstanding" shall mean the sum of (x)
the total number of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding as of the
close of business on the Determination Date and (y) the Total
Outstanding Options.   "Final Parent Stock Price" shall mean the average of
the closing sale prices of Parent Common Stock as reported on the Nasdaq
Stock Market\'s National Market (the "NASDAQ/NMS") during the Valuation
Period.   "Valuation Period" shall mean the ten consecutive trading
days during which the shares of Parent Common Stock are traded on the
NASDAQ/NMS ending on the third calendar day immediately prior to the
Effective Time (such day, the "Determination Date").   (b) All of the
shares of Company Common Stock converted into the Merger Consideration
pursuant to this Article I shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a
certificate (each a "Certificate") previously representing any such shares of
Company Common Stock shall thereafter cease to have any rights with respect
to such securities, except the right to receive (i) the Merger Consideration,
(ii) any dividends and other distributions in accordance with Section 2.2(b)
hereof, and (iii) any cash to be paid in lieu of any fractional share of
Parent Common Stock in accordance with Section 2.2(e) hereof.   (c) If,
between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the shares of
Parent Common Stock shall be changed into a different number or class of
shares by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, split-up,
combination, exchange of shares or readjustment, or a stock dividend thereon
shall be declared with a record date within such period, appropriate
adjustments shall be made to the Per Share Cash Consideration and the Per
Share Stock Consideration.   (d) At the Effective Time, all shares of
Company Common Stock that are owned directly or indirectly by Parent or the
Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries (other than shares of Company
Common Stock (x) held directly or indirectly in trust accounts, managed
accounts and the like or otherwise held in a fiduciary capacity for the
benefit of third parties (any such shares, and shares of Parent Common Stock
which are similarly held, whether held directly or indirectly by Parent or
the Company, as the case may be, being referred to herein as "Trust
Account Shares") and (y) held by Parent or the Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries in respect of a debt previously contracted (any such
shares of Company Common Stock, and shares of Parent Common Stock which are
similarly held, whether held directly or indirectly by Parent or the Company,
being referred to herein as "DPC Shares")) shall be cancelled and shall cease
to exist and no stock of Parent, cash or other consideration shall
be delivered in exchange therefor. All shares of Parent Common Stock that
are owned by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (other than Trust
Account Shares and DPC Shares) shall become treasury stock of Parent.   (e)
The calculations required by Section 1.4(a) shall be prepared jointly by
Parent and the Company prior to the Closing Date.   1.5 Election
Procedures.   (a) An election form and other appropriate and
customary transmittal materials (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the certificates theretofore
representing shares of Company Common Stock shall pass, only upon proper
delivery of such certificates to the Exchange Agent) in such form as Parent
and the Company shall mutually agree (the "Election Form") shall be
mailed thirty-five days prior to the anticipated Effective Date or on such
other date as the Company and Parent shall mutually agree (the "Mailing
Date") to each holder of record of Company Common Stock as of the close of
business on the fifth business day prior to the Mailing Date (the "Election
Form Record Date").   (b) Each Election Form shall permit the holder (or
the beneficial owner through appropriate and customary documentation
and instructions) to elect to receive (i) the Per Share Stock Consideration
in respect of all of such holder\'s Company Common Stock ("Stock
Election Shares"), (ii) the Per Share Cash Consideration in respect of all of
such holder\'s Company Common Stock ("Cash Election Shares"), (iii) the Per
Share Stock Consideration in respect of that portion of such holder\'s shares
of Company Common Stock equal to the Stock Percentage (as defined
below), rounded to the nearest whole share (the "Mixed Stock Shares"), and
the Per Share Cash Consideration in respect of that portion of such holder\'s
shares of Company Common Stock equal to the Cash Percentage (as defined
below), rounded to the nearest whole share (the "Mixed Cash Shares," and
together with the Mixed Stock Shares, the "Mixed Election Shares"), or to
make no election with respect to such holder\'s Company Common Stock ("No
Election Shares"). Any Company Common Stock with respect to which the
Exchange Agent has not received an effective, properly completed Election
Form on or before 5:00 p.m., on the 33rd day following the Mailing Date (or
such other time and date as Parent and the Company may mutually agree) (the
"Election Deadline") shall also be deemed to be "No Election Shares."
"Cash Percentage" shall mean the quotient, rounded to the nearest
thousandth, obtained by dividing (A) the quotient obtained by dividing the
Total Cash Amount by the Per Share Consideration, by (B) the total number of
shares of Company Common Stock outstanding as of the close of business on
the Determination Date. "Stock Percentage" shall mean the amount equal to
one (1) minus the Cash Percentage.   (c) Parent shall make available one or
more Election Forms as may reasonably be requested from time to time by all
persons who become holders (or beneficial owners) of Company Common Stock
between the Election Form Record Date and the close of business on the
business day prior to the Election Deadline, and the Company shall provide to
the Exchange Agent all information reasonably necessary for it to perform as
specified herein.   (d) Any such election shall have been properly made only
if the Exchange Agent shall have actually received a properly completed
Election Form by the Election Deadline. An Election Form shall be deemed
properly completed only if accompanied by one or more certificates (or
customary affidavits and indemnification regarding the loss or destruction of
such certificates or the guaranteed delivery of such certificates)
representing all shares of Company Common Stock covered by such Election
Form, together with duly executed transmittal materials included in the
Election Form. Any Election Form may be revoked or changed by the person
submitting such Election Form at or prior to the Election Deadline. In the
event an Election Form is revoked prior to the Election Deadline, the shares
of Company Common Stock represented by such Election Form shall become
No Election Shares and Parent shall cause the certificates
representing Company Common Stock to be promptly returned without charge to
the Person submitting the Election Form upon written request to that effect
from the holder who submitted the Election Form. Subject to the terms of
this Agreement and of the Election Form, the Exchange Agent shall
have reasonable discretion to determine whether any election, revocation
or change has been properly or timely made and to disregard immaterial
defects in the Election Forms, and any good faith decisions of Parent
regarding such matters shall be binding and conclusive. Neither Parent nor
the Exchange Agent shall be under any obligation to notify any person of
any defect in an Election Form.   (e) Within ten business days after the
Election Deadline, unless the Effective Time has not yet occurred, in which
case as soon thereafter as practicable, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent
to effect the allocation among the holders of Company Common Stock of rights
to receive Parent Common Stock or cash in the Merger in accordance with
the Election Forms as follows:   (i) Cash Election Shares and Mixed Cash
Shares More Than  Total Cash Amount. If the aggregate cash amount that would
be paid  upon the conversion in the Merger of the Cash Election Shares and 
the Mixed Cash Shares is greater than the Total Cash Amount, then:   (A) all
Mixed Stock Shares, Stock Election Shares  and No Election Shares shall be
converted into the right to  receive the Per Share Stock Consideration,  
(B) the Exchange Agent shall then select from  among the Cash Election
Shares, by a pro rata selection  process, a sufficient number of shares
("Stock Designated  Shares") such that the aggregate cash amount that will
be  paid in the Merger equals as closely as practicable the  Total Cash
Amount, and all Stock Designated Shares shall  be converted into the right to
receive the Per Share  Stock Consideration, and   (C) the Cash Election
Shares that are not Stock  Designated Shares and all Mixed Cash Shares will
be  converted into the right to receive the Per Share Cash 
Consideration.   (ii) Cash Election Shares Plus Mixed Cash Shares Less 
Than Total Cash Amount. If the aggregate cash amount that would be  paid upon
conversion in the Merger of the Cash Election Shares  and the Mixed Cash
Shares is less than the Total Cash Amount,  then:   (A) all Cash Election
Shares and Mixed Cash  Shares shall be converted into the right to receive
the  Per Share Cash Consideration,   (B) the Exchange Agent shall then
select first  from among the No Election Shares and then (if necessary) 
from among the Stock Election Shares, by a pro rata  selection process, a
sufficient number of shares ("Cash  Designated Shares") such that the
aggregate cash amount  that will be paid in the Merger equals as closely as 
practicable the Total Cash Amount, and all Cash  Designated Shares shall be
converted into the right to  receive the Per Share Cash Consideration,
and   (C) the Stock Election Shares and the No  Election shares that are
not Cash Designated Shares and  all Mixed Stock Shares shall be converted
into the right  to receive the Per Share Stock Consideration.   (iii) Cash
Election Shares and Mixed Cash Shares Equal to  Total Cash Amount. If the
aggregate cash amount that would be paid  upon conversion in the Merger of
the Cash Election Shares and the  Mixed Cash Shares is equal or nearly equal
(as determined by the  Exchange Agent) to the Total Cash Amount, then
subparagraphs (i)  and (ii) above shall not apply and all Cash Election
Shares and  Mixed Cash Shares shall be converted into the right to receive
the  Per Share Cash Consideration and all Stock Election Shares,  Mixed
Stock Shares and No Election Shares shall be converted into  the right to
receive the Per Share Stock Consideration.   (f) The pro rata selection
process to be used by the Exchange Agent shall consist of such equitable pro
ration processes as shall be mutually determined by Parent and the
Company.   1.6 Stock Options. (a) At the Effective Time, each
option granted by the Company to purchase shares of Company Common Stock,
other than options granted under the ESPP (as defined in Section 4.2) (each
a "Company Option"), which is outstanding and unexercised immediately
prior thereto shall cease to represent a right to acquire shares of
Company Common Stock and shall be converted automatically into a fully-
vested option to purchase shares of Parent Common Stock in an amount and at
an exercise price determined as provided below (and otherwise subject to
the terms of the Company\'s 1995 Nonstatutory Stock Option Plan, as amended
(the "Company Option Plan"), the agreements evidencing grants thereunder and
any other agreements between the Company and an optionee regarding
Company Options):   (1) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock to be 
subject to the new option shall be equal to the product of the  number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to the original  option and the Per
Share Stock Consideration, provided that any  fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock resulting from such  multiplication shall be rounded down to the
nearest whole share;  and   (2) the exercise price per share of Parent
Common Stock  under the new option shall be equal to the exercise price per 
share of Company Common Stock under the original option divided by  the Per
Share Stock Consideration, provided that such exercise  price shall be
rounded up to the nearest cent.   (b) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent
shall reserve for issuance the number of shares of Parent Common Stock
necessary to satisfy Parent\'s obligations under this Section 1.6. Parent
shall file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), no later
than two business days after the Effective Time, a registration statement on
an appropriate form under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
"Securities Act"), with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock subject
to options to acquire Parent Common Stock issued pursuant to Section 1.6(a)
hereof, and shall use its best efforts to maintain the current status of the
prospectus contained therein, as well as comply with applicable state
securities or "blue sky" laws, for so long as such options remain
outstanding; provided, however, that Parent shall only be required to file
and maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement with respect to
options that are eligible to be registered on a Form S-8.   (c) Prior to
the Effective Time, Parent and the Company shall take all such steps as may
be required to cause any acquisitions of Parent equity securities (including
derivative securities with respect to any Parent equity securities) and
dispositions of Company equity securities (including derivative securities
with respect to any Company equity securities) resulting from the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who is
anticipated to be subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") with
respect to Parent or who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section
16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company, to be exempt under
Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.   1.7 Parent Common Stock.
Except for shares of Parent Common Stock owned by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (other than Trust Account Shares and DPC Shares), which shall be
converted into treasury stock of Parent as contemplated by Section 1.4
hereof, the shares of Parent Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be unaffected by the Merger and such shares
shall remain issued and outstanding.   1.8 Articles of Incorporation. At
the Effective Time, the Articles of Incorporation of Parent, as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the Articles of
Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation.   1.9 Bylaws. At the Effective
Time, the Bylaws of Parent, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time, shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter
amended in accordance with applicable law.   1.10 Directors and
Officers.   (a) At and after the Effective Time, the directors of
Parent shall consist of all of the directors of Parent serving immediately
prior to the Effective Time and the additional person who shall become
a director of Parent in accordance with Section 7.12 hereof, each to
hold office in accordance with the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of
the Surviving Corporation until their respective successors are duly
elected or appointed and qualified.   (b) The officers of Parent
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the officers of the
Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with the Articles of
Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until their respective
successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified.   1.11 Tax
Consequences. It is intended that the Merger shall constitute a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") and that this Agreement shall
constitute a plan of reorganization for the purposes of Section 368 of the
Code.    ARTICLE II   EXCHANGE OF SHARES   2.1 Parent to Make Shares
and Cash Available. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit,
or shall cause to be deposited, with a bank or trust company (which may be a
Subsidiary of Parent) (the "Exchange Agent") selected by Parent and
reasonably satisfactory to the Company, for the benefit of the holders of
Certificates, for exchange in accordance with this Article II, (i)
certificates representing the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued
pursuant to Section 1.4 and Section 2.2(a) in exchange for outstanding shares
of Company Common Stock, (ii) such cash as shall be necessary to pay the Per
Share Cash Consideration in accordance with Section 1.4 and 2.2(a) hereof,
and (iii) the cash in lieu of fractional shares to be paid in accordance with
Section 2.2(e) hereof. Such cash and certificates for shares of Parent Common
Stock, together with any dividends or distributions with respect thereto, are
hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Fund."   2.2 Exchange of Shares.
(a) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, and in no event more
than five business days thereafter, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each
holder of record of a Certificate or Certificates who theretofore has not
submitted such holder\'s Certificate or Certificates with an Election Form, a
form letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only
upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent) and instructions for
use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger
Consideration. The Company shall have the right to review both the letter of
transmittal and the instructions prior to the Effective Time and provide
reasonable comments thereon. After completion of the allocation procedure set
forth in Section 1.5 and upon surrender of a Certificate or Certificates for
exchange and cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with a properly
executed letter of transmittal or Election Form, as the case may be, the
holder of such Certificate or Certificates shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor (x) a certificate representing that number of whole shares
of Parent Common Stock which such holder of Company Common Stock
became entitled to receive pursuant to the provisions of Article I hereof
and/or (y) a check representing the aggregate Per Share Cash Consideration
and/or the amount of cash in lieu of fractional shares, if any, which such
holder has the right to receive in respect of the Certificate or
Certificates surrendered pursuant to the provisions of Article I, and the
Certificate or Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No
interest will be paid or accrued on the Per Share Cash Consideration, the
cash in lieu of fractional shares or the unpaid dividends and distributions,
if any, payable to holders of Certificates.   (b) No dividends or other
distributions declared after the Effective Time with respect to Parent Common
Stock and payable to the holders of record thereof shall be paid to the
holder of any unsurrendered Certificate until the holder thereof shall
surrender such Certificate in accordance with this Article II. After the
surrender of a Certificate in accordance with this Article II, the record
holder thereof shall be entitled to receive any such dividends or other
distributions, without any interest thereon, which theretofore had become
payable with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock represented by such
Certificate.   (c) If any certificate representing shares of Parent
Common Stock is to be issued in a name other than that in which the
Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a
condition of the issuance thereof that the Certificate so surrendered shall
be properly endorsed (or accompanied by an appropriate instrument of
transfer) and otherwise in proper form for transfer, and that the person
requesting such exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent in advance any
transfer or other taxes required by reason of the issuance of a certificate
representing shares of Parent Common Stock in any name other than that of the
registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or required for any other
reason, or shall establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that
such tax has been paid or is not payable.   (d) After the Effective Time,
there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of the
shares of Company Common Stock which were issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates
representing such shares are presented for transfer to the Exchange Agent,
they shall be cancelled and exchanged for certificates representing shares of
Parent Common Stock or cash or both, as provided in this Article II.   (e)
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no certificates or
scrip representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued
upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates, no dividend or distribution
with respect to Parent Common Stock shall be payable on or with respect to
any fractional share, and such fractional share interests shall not entitle
the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a shareholder of Parent.

Company or Parent, respectively.   3.2 Standards. (a) No representation or

Effect with respect to the Company or Parent, respectively.   (b) As used

parties hereto shall cooperate with each other and use their reasonable best
efforts to promptly prepare and file all necessary documentation, to effect
all applications, notices, petitions and filings, and to obtain as promptly
as practicable all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all
third parties and Governmental Entities which are necessary or advisable to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including without
limitation the Merger). The Company and Parent shall have the right to review
in advance, and to the extent practicable each will consult the other on, in
each case subject to applicable laws relating to the exchange of information,
all the information relating to the Company or Parent, as the case may be,
and any of their respective Subsidiaries, which appears in any filing made
with, or written materials submitted to, any third party or any Governmental
Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In
exercising the foregoing right, each of the parties hereto shall act
reasonably and as promptly as practicable. The parties hereto agree that they
will consult with each other with respect to the obtaining of all permits,
consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties and Governmental
Entities necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and each party will keep the other apprised of the status
of matters relating to completion of the transactions contemplated

Agreement) from, or delivered by any of the foregoing to, any Governmental
Entity in respect of the transactions contemplated hereby.   7.2 Access to
Information. (a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable laws
relating to the exchange of information, each party shall, and shall cause
each of its Subsidiaries to, afford to the officers, employees, accountants,
counsel and other representatives of the other party, access, during normal
business hours during the period prior to the Effective Time, to all its
properties, books, contracts, commitments, records, officers, employees,
accountants, counsel and other representatives and, during such period, it
shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, make available to the other party
all information concerning its business, properties and personnel as the
other party may reasonably request. Neither party nor any of its Subsidiaries
shall be required to provide access to or to disclose information where such
access or disclosure would violate or prejudice the rights of its
customers, jeopardize any attorney-client privilege or contravene any law,
rule, regulation, order, judgment, decree, fiduciary duty or binding
agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement. The parties
hereto will make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under
circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply.  
(b) All information furnished to Parent or the Company by the other party
hereto pursuant to Section 7.2(a) shall be subject to, and the parties shall

Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, neither the Company nor
any of its directors, officers, agents, affiliates (as such term is used in
Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act) or representatives
(collectively, "Representatives") shall, directly or indirectly, initiate,
solicit, encourage or knowingly facilitate (including by way of
furnishing information) any inquiries with respect to or the making of any
Acquisition Proposal (as defined below).   (b) Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, the Company and its Board of Directors shall be
permitted (i) to comply with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the
Exchange Act with regard to an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) to engage in any
discussions or negotiations with, or provide any information to, any person
in response to an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal by any
such person, if and only to the extent that (a) the Company\'s Board of
Directors concludes in good faith and consistent with its fiduciary duties to
the Company\'s stockholders under applicable law that such Acquisition
Proposal would reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal (as
defined below), (b) prior to providing any information or data to any person
in connection with an Acquisition Proposal by any such person, the Company\'s
Board of Directors receives from such person an executed confidentiality
agreement containing terms at least as stringent as those contained in
the Confidentiality Agreement (as defined in Section 7.2(b)), and (c) prior
to providing any information or data to any person or entering
into discussions or negotiations with any person, the Company\'s Board
of Directors notifies Parent promptly of such inquiries, proposals, or
offers received by, any such information requested from, or any such
discussions or negotiations sought to be initiated or continued with, any of
its Representatives indicating, in connection with such notice, the name
of such person and the material terms and conditions of any
inquiries, proposals or offers.   (c) The Company agrees that it will, and
will cause its Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be
terminated any activities, discussions, or negotiations existing as of the
date of this Agreement with any parties conducted heretofore with respect to
any Acquisition Proposal.   (d) For purposes of this Section 7.3:    (i)

any proposal for a merger, reorganization,  consolidation, share exchange,
recapitalization, liquidation,  dissolution or other business combination
involving the Company or  the Company Bank or any proposal or offer to
acquire a substantial  equity interest in, or a substantial portion of the
assets of, the  Company or the Company Bank, other than the transaction
contemplated  or permitted by this Agreement.   (ii) The term "Superior
Proposal" means, with respect to  the Company, any written Acquisition
Proposal made by a person other  than Parent which is for (i) (a) a merger,
reorganization,  consolidation, share exchange, business combination,
recapitalization  or similar transaction involving the Company, (b) a sale,
lease,  exchange, transfer, or other disposition of at least 50% of the 
assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, in a  single
transaction or a series of related transactions, or (c) the  acquisition,
directly or indirectly, by a person of beneficial  ownership of 50% or more
of the Company Common Stock whether by  merger, consolidation, share
exchange, business combination, tender,  or exchange offer or otherwise, and
(ii) which is otherwise on terms  which the Board of Directors of the Company
in good faith concludes  (after consultation with its financial advisors and
outside counsel),  taking into account, among other things, all legal,
financial,  regulatory, and other aspects of the proposal and the person
making  the proposal, (a) would, if consummated, result in a transaction
that  is more favorable to its stockholders (in their capacities as 
stockholders), from a financial point of view, than the transactions 
contemplated by this Agreement, and (b) is reasonably capable of  being
completed.   7.4 Stockholder Meetings. The Company shall take all
steps necessary to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of
its stockholders to be held as soon as is reasonably practicable after the
date on which the S-4 becomes effective for the purpose of voting upon
the approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby. The Company shall, through its Board of
Directors, subject to the fiduciary duties of such board, recommend to
its stockholders approval of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby and such other matters as may be submitted to its
stockholders in connection with this Agreement.   7.5 Legal Conditions to
Merger. Each of Parent and the Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, use their reasonable best efforts (a) to take, or cause to
be taken, all actions necessary, proper or advisable to comply promptly with
all legal requirements which may be imposed on such party or its Subsidiaries
with respect to the Merger and, subject to the conditions set forth in
Article VIII hereof, to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and (b) to obtain (and to cooperate with the other party to obtain)
any consent, authorization, order or approval of, or any exemption by, any
Governmental Entity and any other third party which is required to be
obtained by the Company or Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries in
connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and to comply with the terms and conditions of such consent,
authorization, order or approval.   7.6 Affiliates. The Company shall use
its reasonable best efforts to cause each director, executive officer and
other person who is an "affiliate" (for purposes of Rule 145 under the
Securities Act) of the Company to deliver to Parent, as soon as practicable
after the date of this Agreement, a written agreement, in the form of Exhibit
7.6 hereto.   7.7 Stock Exchange Listing. Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the shares of Parent Common Stock to be
issued in the Merger to be approved for listing on the NASDAQ/NMS as of the
Effective Time.   7.8 Employee Benefit Plans; Existing Agreements. (a) As of
the Effective Time, the employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries
(the "Company Employees") shall be eligible to participate in employee
benefit plans of Parent or its Subsidiaries in which similarly situated
employees of Parent or its Subsidiaries participate, to the same extent
that similarly situated employees of Parent or its Subsidiaries participate
(it being understood that inclusion of Company Employees in Parent\'s
employee benefit plans may occur at different times with respect to different
plans).   (b) With respect to each Parent Plan for which length of service
is taken into account for any purpose, service with the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (or predecessor employers to the extent the Company provides
past service credit) shall be treated as service with Parent for purposes of
determining eligibility to participate, vesting, and entitlement to benefits,
including for severance benefits and vacation entitlement (but not for
accrual of defined benefit pension benefits); provided however, that such
service shall not be recognized to the extent that such recognition would
result in a duplication of benefits. Such service also shall apply for
purposes of satisfying any waiting periods, evidence of insurability
requirements, or the application of any preexisting condition limitations.
Each Parent Plan shall waive pre-existing condition limitations to the same
extent waived under the applicable Company Plan. Company Employees shall be
given credit for amounts paid under a corresponding benefit plan during the
same period for purposes of applying deductibles, copayments and out-of-
pocket maximums as though such amounts had been paid in accordance with the
terms and conditions of the Parent Plan.   (c) As of the Effective Time,
Parent shall assume and honor and shall cause the appropriate Subsidiaries of
Parent to assume and to honor in accordance with their terms all agreements
listed in Section 7.8 of the Company Disclosure Schedule (the "Benefit
Agreements"). Parent acknowledges and agrees that the Merger will constitute
a merger, sale or a change in control of the Company for all purposes under
such agreements. The provisions of this Section 7.8(c) are intended to be for
the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each director, officer or
employee that is a party to any Benefit Agreement.   (d) Parent and the
Company agree that, prior to the Effective Time, the company may adopt a
severance plan (the "Severance Plan") and a change in control retention plan
(the "Retention Plan"), each substantially as provided in Section 6.1(i) of
the Company Disclosure Schedule. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, any Plan or otherwise, Parent agrees to maintain in full force and
effect, without amendment or modification, (i) for a period of no less than
one year following the Closing Date, the Severance Plan and (ii) the
Retention Plan until such time as all Parent or Company obligations are
fulfilled thereunder.   7.9 Indemnification. (a) In the event of any
threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation,
whether civil, criminal or administrative, in which any person who is now, or
has been at any time prior to the date of this Agreement, or who becomes
prior to the Effective Time, a director, officer or employee of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries (the "Indemnified Parties") is, or is threatened
to be, made a party based in whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in
part out of, or pertaining to (i) the fact that he is or was a director,
officer or employee of the Company, any of the Subsidiaries of the Company or
any of their respective predecessors or affiliates or (ii) this Agreement
or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, whether in any case
asserted or arising before or after the Effective Time, the parties hereto
agree to cooperate and use their best efforts to defend against and respond
thereto. It is understood and agreed that after the Effective Time, Parent
shall indemnify and hold harmless, as and to the fullest extent permitted by
law, each such Indemnified Party against any losses, claims,
damages, liabilities, costs, expenses (including reasonable attorney\'s fees
and expenses in advance of the final disposition of any claim, suit,
proceeding or investigation to each Indemnified Party to the fullest extent
permitted by law upon receipt of any undertaking required by applicable
law), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any
such threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation,
and in the event of any such threatened or actual claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation (whether asserted or arising before or
after the Effective Time), the Indemnified Parties may retain counsel
reasonably satisfactory to them after consultation with Parent; provided,
however, that (1) Parent shall have the right to assume the defense thereof
and upon such assumption Parent shall not be liable to any Indemnified Party
for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses subsequently
incurred by any Indemnified Party in connection with the defense thereof,
except that if Parent elects not to assume such defense or counsel for
the Indemnified Parties reasonably advises that there are issues which
raise conflicts of interest between Parent and the Indemnified Parties,
the Indemnified Parties may retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to
them after consultation with Parent, and Parent shall pay the reasonable
fees and expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified Parties, (2) Parent
shall in all cases be obligated pursuant to this paragraph to pay for only
one firm of counsel for all Indemnified Parties, (3) Parent shall not be
liable for any settlement effected without its prior written consent
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), and (4) Parent shall have
no obligation hereunder to any Indemnified Party when and if a court
of competent jurisdiction shall ultimately determine, and such
determination shall have become final and nonappealable, that indemnification
of such Indemnified Party in the manner contemplated hereby is prohibited
by applicable law. Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim
Indemnification under this Section 7.9, upon learning of any such claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation, shall promptly notify Parent
thereof, provided that the failure to so notify shall not affect the
obligations of Parent under this Section 7.9 except to the extent such
failure to notify materially prejudices Parent. Parent\'s obligations under
this Section 7.9 shall continue in full force and effect without time limit
from and after the Effective Time.   (b) Parent shall cause the persons
serving as officers and directors of the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time to be covered for a period of three years from the Effective
Time by the directors\' and officers\' liability insurance policy maintained
by the Company (provided that Parent may substitute therefor policies of at
least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions which are
not less advantageous than such policy) with respect to acts or
omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time which were committed by such
officers and directors in their capacity as such; provided, however, that in
no event shall Parent be required to expend on an annual basis more than
200% of the current amount expended by the Company (the "Insurance Amount")
to maintain or procure insurance coverage, and further provided that if
Parent is unable to maintain or obtain the insurance called for by this
Section 7.9(b), Parent shall use all reasonable best efforts to obtain as
much comparable insurance as is available for the Insurance Amount.   (c)
In the event Parent or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with
or merges into any other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers or
conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any person,
then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary, proper provision shall
be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent assume the obligations
set forth in this Section 7.9.   (d) The provisions of this Section 7.9 are
intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each
Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives.   7.10
Additional Agreements. In case at any time after the Effective Time any
further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full title to all
properties, assets, rights, approvals, immunities and franchises of any of
the parties to the Merger, the proper officers and directors of each party to
this Agreement and their respective Subsidiaries shall take all such
necessary action as may be reasonably requested by Parent.   7.11 Employee
Stock Purchase Plan. Parent shall assume and honor the ESPP and shall not
take any action that would terminate, or adversely affect the participants
in, the ESPP until the completion of the annual offering (the "Offering")
commenced under the ESPP on January 1, 2002, which Offering shall terminate
on December 31, 2002 (the "Offering Termination Date"). The options granted
to participants in the ESPP shall have the terms described in Section 7.11 of
the Company Disclosure Schedule.   7.12 Appointment of Directors. Effective
as of the Effective Time, Parent shall cause its Board of Directors to be
expanded by one member, to a total of 18 members, and shall appoint Gordon W.
Campbell (the "Company Director") to fill the vacancy on Parent\'s Board of
Directors created by such increase. Subject to the foregoing, as of the
Effective Time the class of directors with a term expiring at Parent\'s 2005
annual meeting of stockholders shall include the Company Director. If the
Company Director does not become a director of Parent because of death,
disability or otherwise, or if the Company Director shall cease to be a
director of Parent at any time before the third anniversary of the Effective
Time, Parent agrees, after consultation with the Bank Directors (as defined
in Section 7.13), to cause a person who is a member of the Board of
Directors of the Company as of the date hereof to be elected or appointed to
the Board of Directors of Parent as the new Company Director. In
connection with the annual meeting of Parent next following the Effective
Time (the "Next Annual Meeting"), Parent shall nominate the Company Director
for election as a director by the stockholders of the Company, to
continue serving as a director of the class of directors whose term expires
at Parent\'s 2005 annual meeting of stockholders, and Parent shall
solicit proxies for his election at the Next Annual Meeting.   7.13

reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement, (a) Parent shall (i)
cause the Board of Directors of Parent Bank to approve the Bank Merger
Agreement, (ii) cause Parent Bank to execute and deliver the Bank Merger
Agreement, and (iii) approve the Bank Merger Agreement as the sole
stockholder of Parent Bank, and (b) the Company shall (i) cause the Board of
Directors of the Company Bank to approve the Bank Merger Agreement, (ii)
cause the Company Bank to execute and deliver the Bank Merger Agreement, and
(iii) approve the Bank Merger Agreement as the sole stockholder of the
Company Bank.   (b) The Bank Merger Agreement shall provide that (i)
the surviving entity in the Bank Merger (the "Surviving Bank") shall
continue under the name "Mercantile Bank", or another name to be mutually
agreed by Parent and the Company, (ii) immediately following the effective
time of the Bank Merger, the directors of the Surviving Bank shall consist of
all the directors of the Parent Bank serving immediately prior to the
effective time of the Bank Merger and the Bank Directors (as defined below),
each to hold office in accordance with the Articles of Incorporation and
Bylaws of the Surviving Bank until their respective successors are duly
elected or appointed and qualified, and (iii) the Bank Directors shall hold
office for a period of no less than two years from the effective time of the
Bank Merger. The Bank Merger Agreement shall contain other terms that are
normal and customary in light of the transactions contemplated hereby and
such additional terms as are necessary to carry out the purposes of
this Agreement. The term "Bank Directors" shall mean, collectively, Gordon
W. Campbell and four additional persons who are currently serving in the
board of directors of either the Company or Company Bank, each of who shall
be reasonably acceptable to Parent.   (c) If any of the Bank Directors does
not become a director of the Surviving Bank because of death, disability or
otherwise, or if any of the Bank Directors shall cease to be a director of
the Surviving Bank at any time before the second anniversary of the effective
time of the Bank Merger, Parent agrees, after consultation with the remaining
Bank Directors, to cause a person who is a member of the Board of Directors
of the Company as of the date hereof to be elected or appointed to the
Board of Directors of the Surviving Bank as the new Bank Director.   7.14
Advisory Board. Parent shall, effective as of the Effective Time, cause each
individual who is currently serving as a director of the Company or the
Company Bank (other than the Company Director and the Bank Directors), if
such persons are willing to so serve, to be elected or appointed as members
of an advisory board ("Advisory Board") established by Parent, the function
of which shall be to advise Parent with respect to deposit and lending
activities in the Company\'s former market area and to maintain and develop
customer relationships. The members of the Advisory Board who are willing to
so serve initially shall be elected or appointed for a term of one year.
Parent agrees annually to re-elect or re-appoint each of the initial members
of the Advisory Board to two successive one-year terms following the initial
one-year term; provided, however, that Parent shall have no obligation to re-
elect or re-appoint any member if Parent reasonably determines that such
member has a conflict of interest that compromises such member\'s ability to
serve effectively as a member of the advisory board or any cause exists
that otherwise would allow for removal of such person as a director of
Parent if such person were a member of Parent\'s Board of Directors. Each
member of the Advisory Board shall receive a fee for such service consistent
with Parent\'s other advisory boards, as described in Section 7.14 of
Parent\'s Disclosure Schedule. Service on the Board of Directors of the
Surviving Bank or the Advisory Board shall constitute continued service for
purposes of the Company Option Plan.    ARTICLE VIII   CONDITIONS

AMENDMENT   9.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any
time prior to the Effective Time, whether before or after approval of
the matters presented in connection with the Merger by the stockholders of
the Company:   (a) by mutual consent of the Company and Parent in a
written instrument, if the Board of Directors of each so determines by a vote
of a majority of the members of its entire Board;   (b) by either Parent or
the Company upon written notice to the other party (i) 30 days after the date
on which any request or application for a Requisite Regulatory Approval shall
have been denied or withdrawn at the request or recommendation of the
Governmental Entity which must grant such Requisite Regulatory Approval,
unless within the 30-day period following such denial or withdrawal a
petition for rehearing or an amended application has been filed with the
applicable Governmental Entity, provided, however, that no party shall have
the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.1(b)(i) if
such denial or request or recommendation for withdrawal shall be due to the
failure of the party seeking to terminate this Agreement to perform or
observe the covenants and agreements of such party set forth herein or (ii)
if any Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction shall have issued a
final nonappealable order enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the Merger;  
(c) by either Parent or the Company if the Merger shall not have been
consummated on or before the later of (i) October 31, 2002, or (ii) if the
S-4 is given a full review by the SEC, December 31, 2002, unless the failure
of the Closing to occur by such date shall be due to the failure of the party
seeking to terminate this Agreement to perform or observe the covenants and
agreements of such party set forth herein;   (d) by either Parent or the
Company if the approval of the stockholders of the Company required for the
consummation of the Merger shall not have been obtained by reason of the
failure to obtain the required vote at a duly held meeting of such
stockholders or at any adjournment or postponement thereof;   (e) by either
Parent or the Company (provided that the terminating party is not then in
material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement
contained herein) if there shall have been a material breach of any of the
representations or warranties set forth in this Agreement on the part of the
other party, which breach is not cured within thirty days following written
notice to the party committing such breach, or which breach, by its nature,
cannot be cured prior to the Closing; provided, however, that neither party
shall have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section
9.1(e) unless the breach of representation or warranty, together with all
other such breaches, would entitle the party receiving such representation
not to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby under Section 8.2(a)
(in the case of a breach of representation or warranty by the Company) or
Section 8.3(a) (in the case of a breach of representation or warranty by
Parent);   (f) by either Parent or the Company (provided that
the terminating party is not then in material breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained herein) if
there shall have been a material breach of any of the covenants or agreements
set forth in this Agreement on the part of the other party, which breach
shall not have been cured within thirty days following receipt by the
breaching party of written notice of such breach from the other party hereto,
or which breach, by its nature, cannot be cured prior to the Closing; or  
(g) by the Company, in the event that the Board of Directors of the Company
determines in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that in
light of a Superior Proposal it is necessary to terminate this Agreement in
order to comply with its fiduciary duties to the Company and to the
Company\'s shareholders under applicable law; provided, however, that the
Board of Directors of the Company may terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this Section 9.1(g) solely in order to concurrently enter into a letter of
intent, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement or other similar
agreement (each, an "Acquisition Agreement") related to a Superior Proposal;
provided further, however, that this Agreement may be terminated pursuant to
this Section 9.1(g) only after the fifth day following Parent\'s receipt of
written notice advising Parent that the Board of Directors of the Company is
prepared to accept a Superior Proposal, and only if, during such five-day
period, if Parent so elects, the Company and its advisors shall have
negotiated in good faith with Parent to make such adjustments in the terms
and conditions of this Agreement as would enable Parent to proceed with the
transactions contemplated herein on such adjusted terms; or   (h) by the
Company at any time during the three-day period following the Determination
Date (as defined in Section 1.4 hereof), if both of the following conditions
are satisfied:   (1) the Average Closing Price (as defined below) shall  be
less than the product of 0.85 and the Starting Price; and   (2) (i) the
number obtained by dividing the Average  Closing Price by the Starting Price
(such number being referred to  herein as the "Parent Ratio") shall be less
than (ii) the number  obtained by dividing the Index Price on the
Determination Date by  the Index Price on the Starting Date and subtracting
0.10 from  such quotient (such number being referred to herein as the
"Index  Ratio");  subject to the following. If the Company elects to
exercise its termination right pursuant to the immediately preceding
sentence, it shall give prompt written notice to Parent; provided that such
notice of election to terminate may be withdrawn at any time within the
aforementioned three-day period. During the three-day period commencing with
its receipt of such notice, Parent shall have the option of increasing the
Total Stock Amount and/or the Total Cash Amount in a manner such that the
conditions set forth in either clauses (1) or (2) above shall be deemed not
to exist; provided, however, that the Total Cash Amount shall not be
increased in a manner that would cause the failure of the conditions set
forth in Sections 8.2(d) or 8.3(d) hereof. For purposes hereof, the condition
set forth in (1) above shall be deemed not to exist if the Total Stock Amount
and/or the Total Cash Amount is increased so that the Per Share Consideration
after such increase is not less than the Per Share Consideration that would
have been in effect if the condition set forth in (1) above did not exist.
For purposes hereof, the condition set forth in clause (2) above shall
be deemed not to exist if the Total Stock Amount and/or the Total Cash
Amount is increased so that the Per Share Consideration after such increase
is not less than the Per Share Consideration that would have been in effect
if the condition set forth in (2) above did not exist. If Parent makes
this election, within such three-day period, it shall give prompt written
notice to Company of such election and the revised Total Stock Amount and/or
Total Cash Amount, whereupon no termination shall have occurred pursuant to
this Section 9.1(h) and this Agreement shall remain in effect in accordance
with its terms (except as the Total Stock Consideration and/or Total Cash
Amount shall have been so modified), and any references in this Agreement
to "Total Stock Consideration," "Total Stock Amount," "Per Share
Stock Consideration" and "Per Share Cash Consideration" shall thereafter
be deemed to refer to the Total Stock Consideration, Total Stock Amount,
Per Share Stock Consideration and Per Share Cash Consideration after
giving effect to any adjustment made pursuant to this Section 9.1(h). For
purposes of this Section 9.1(h), the following terms shall have the
meanings indicated:   "Average Closing Price" means the average of the last
reported sale prices per share of Parent Common Stock as reported on the
NASDAQ/NMS (as reported in The Wall Street Journal or, if not reported
therein, in another mutually agreed upon authoritative source) for the 10
consecutive trading days immediately preceding the Determination Date (as
defined in Section 1.4(a) hereof).   "Index Price" on a given date means
the closing price of the NASDAQ Bank Index.   "Starting Price" shall mean
$19.568.   If Parent declares or effects a stock dividend,
reclassification, recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares
or similar transaction between the Starting Date and the Determination Date,
the prices for the common stock of Parent shall be appropriately adjusted
for the purposes of applying this Section 9.1(h).   9.2 Effect of
Termination.   (a) In the event of termination of this Agreement by
either Parent or the Company as provided in Section 9.1, this Agreement
shall forthwith become void and have no effect except (i) Sections 7.2(b),
9.2 and 10.3 shall survive any termination of this Agreement and (ii)
that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
no party shall be relieved or released from any liabilities or damages
arising out of its willful breach of any provision of this Agreement.   (b)
If the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(g), the
Company shall pay to Parent a termination fee equal to $5 million (the
"Termination Fee Amount") by wire transfer of same day funds on the date of
termination.   (c) In the event that an Acquisition Proposal with respect
to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall have been made known to
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and shall have been publicly
announced or otherwise become public, or shall have been made to the
shareholders of the Company, and thereafter (x) this Agreement is terminated
by either Parent or the Company pursuant to either (i) Section 9.1(c) hereof
and prior to such termination the stockholders of the Company shall not
have previously approved the Merger, or (ii) Section 9.1(d) hereof as a
result of the failure of the stockholders of the Company to approve the
Merger, and (y) within twelve months of such termination (A) the Company or
the Company Bank enters into any Acquisition Agreement providing for
any transaction described in clause (i)(a) or clause (i)(b) of
Section 7.3(d)(ii), other than any such transaction involving a
merger, consolidation or similar transaction as to which the common
stockholders of the Company immediately prior thereto own in the aggregate at
least 60% of the common stock of the surviving or transferee corporation or
its publicly-held parent corporation immediately following
consummation thereof, or (B) any person shall acquire beneficial ownership of
or the right to acquire 25% or more of the outstanding shares of Company
Common Stock, then upon the first occurrence of either of the events
contemplated by clause (y) the Company shall pay Parent a termination fee
equal to the Termination Fee Amount by wire transfer of same day funds.  
(d) The Company agrees that the agreements contained in Section 9.2(b) and
9.2(c) above are integral parts of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and constitute liquidated damages and not a penalty.   (e)
Provided that the Company shall not be in material breach of this Agreement,
in the event that this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company
pursuant to (i) Section 9.1(c), and at the time of such termination any of
the Non-Florida Approvals (as defined below) shall not have been obtained, or
(ii) Section 9.1(b) as a result of the failure of Parent to obtain any of the
Non-Florida Approvals, Parent shall pay to the Company a termination fee of
$3.5 million by wire transfer of same day funds on the date of termination.
The term "Non-Florida Approvals" shall mean the Requisite Regulatory
Approvals other than any regulatory approval required under Florida law.  
9.3 Amendment. Subject to compliance with applicable law, this Agreement may
be amended by the parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by their
respective Boards of Directors, at any time before or after approval of the
matters presented in connection with the Merger by the stockholders of either
the Company or Parent; provided, however, that after any approval of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement by the Company\'s stockholders,
there may not be, without further approval of such stockholders, any
amendment of this Agreement which reduces the amount or changes the form of
the consideration to be delivered to the Company stockholders hereunder other
than as contemplated by this Agreement. This Agreement may not be amended
except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties
hereto.   9.4 Extension; Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective
Time, each of the parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by its Board
of Directors, may, to the extent legally allowed, (a) extend the time for
the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other
party hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and
warranties of the other party contained herein or in any document delivered
pursuant hereto and (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or
conditions of the other party contained herein. Any agreement on the part of
a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set
forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such party, but such
extension or waiver or failure to insist on strict compliance with an
obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver
of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure.

take place at 10:00 a.m. on the first day which is (a) the last business day
