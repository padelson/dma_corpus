 AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of April 27, 2004 (the "Agreement"), between ASSOCIATED BANC-CORP, a Wisconsin corporation ("Associated") and FIRST FEDERAL CAPITAL CORP, a Wisconsin corporation (the "Company"). 

   

 W I T N E S S E T H: 

   

 WHEREAS, the Company is a unitary thrift holding company, the wholly owned subsidiary of which is First Federal Capital Bank (the "Bank"), and its wholly owned subsidiaries, First Cap Holdings, Inc., First Reinsurance, Inc., First Enterprises, Inc., FF Mortgage Reinsurance, Inc., and Turtle Creek Corporation (such subsidiaries collectively with the Bank and any other direct or indirect subsidiary of the Company are referred to in this Agreement as the "Company Subsidiaries"); and 

   

 WHEREAS, the Company, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement and in accordance with the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law ("Wisconsin Law") will merge with and into Associated (the "Merger"); and 

   

 WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of the Company and Associated have determined that the Merger will enhance the ability of the Company and Associated to better serve their existing depositors and customers and increase their financial strength; and 

   

 WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of the Company and Associated believe that the Merger will benefit the shareholders and the employees of the Company and Associated; and 

   

 WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Associated and the Company have (i) determined that the Merger and the exchange of cash and newly issued shares of Associated Common Stock (as defined in Section 1.06) for shares of Company Common Stock (as defined in Section 1.06) pursuant and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement are fair to and in the best interests of the respective corporations and their shareholders, and (ii) approved and adopted this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby; and 

   

 WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company has, subject to its fiduciary duties under applicable law, resolved to recommend approval of the Merger by the shareholders of the Company; and 

   

 WHEREAS, Associated and the Company intend to effect a merger that qualifies as a tax-free reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"); and 

   

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual covenants and agreements herein contained, and intending to be legally bound hereby, Associated and the Company hereby agree as follows: 

    

ARTICLE I

    

THE MERGER

   

 SECTION 1.01. The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with Wisconsin Law, at the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.02), the Company shall be merged with and into Associated. As a result of the Merger, the separate corporate existence of the Company shall cease and Associated shall continue as the surviving corporation of the Merger (the "Surviving Corporation"). 

   

 SECTION 1.02. Effective Time. The parties hereto shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing Articles of Merger (the "Articles of Merger") with the Department of Financial Institutions of the State of Wisconsin, in such form as required by, and executed in accordance with the relevant provisions of, Wisconsin Law (a) after the satisfaction or, if permissible, waiver of conditions set forth in Article VII, and (b) as promptly as possible within the thirty (30) day period commencing with the latest of the following dates: 

          |

 (i)   The date of expiration of any applicable waiting period after approval by the  Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the "Federal Reserve  Board") under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the  "BHCA"); 

  
---|--- 
    
          |

 (ii)   Such date as may be prescribed by the Federal Reserve Board or any other  agency or authority pursuant to applicable law, rules, or regulations, prior to  which consummation of the transaction described and referred to herein may not  be effected; 

  
---|--- 
    
          |

 (iii)   The date of the shareholders meeting of the Company to vote upon and approve the  Merger pursuant to Section 6.02; or 

  
---|--- 
    
          |

 (iv)   If the transaction contemplated by this Agreement is being contested in any  legal proceeding and Associated or the Company has elected to contest the same,  the date that such legal proceeding has been brought to a non-appealable  conclusion sufficiently favorable, in the judgment of Associated and the  Company, to permit consummation of the transaction contemplated hereby. 

  
---|--- 
    
   

 The date and time of the filing of the Articles of Merger with the Wisconsin Department of Financial Institutions, or on such later date or later time as specified in the Articles of Merger, is hereinafter referred to as the "Effective Time." In no event shall the Effective Time occur prior to August 1, 2004. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, with respect to the calendar quarter in which the Effective Time is to occur, Associated and the Company will cooperate not to set the Effective Time on a date that is after the record date for Associateds regular quarterly dividend for such quarter, if any, and before the record date for the Companys regular quarterly dividend for such quarter, if any, in order to prevent the Companys shareholders from not being entitled to receive either dividend for such quarter. 

   

 SECTION 1.03. Effect of the Merger. At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger shall be as provided in the applicable provisions of Wisconsin Law. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, except as otherwise provided herein, all the property, rights, privileges, powers, and franchises of Associated and the Company shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities, and duties of Associated and the Company shall become the debts, liabilities, and duties of the Surviving Corporation. 

   

 SECTION 1.04. Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws. At the Effective Time, the Articles of Incorporation and the Bylaws of Associated, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the Articles of Incorporation and the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation. 

   

 SECTION 1.05. Directors and Officers. The directors of Associated immediately prior to the Effective Time, together with one (1) independent director (as defined by The NASDAQ Stock Market ("NASDAQ")) of the Company (selected by the nominating committee of the Board of Directors of Associated) who will be designated a Class B Director with a term expiring at the annual meeting of Associateds shareholders in 2006 and Jack C. Rusch who will be designated a Class C Director with a term expiring at the annual meeting of Associateds shareholders in 2007, shall be the initial directors of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, and the officers of Associated immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation, in each case until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified. 

   

 SECTION 1.06. Conversion of Securities. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Associated, the Company, or the holders of any of the following securities: 

   

 .........(a)   each share of common stock, par value $0.10 per share, of the Company (the  "Company Common Stock") (all issued and outstanding shares of the  Company Common Stock being hereinafter collectively referred to as  "Shares") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective  Time (other than any Shares to be canceled pursuant to Section 1.06(b))  shall, at the election of the holder of each Share, (i) be converted, in  accordance with Section 1.07, into the right to receive 0.635 (such ratio,  as it may be adjusted pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the  "Exchange Ratio") shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share,  of Associated ("Associated Common Stock") or (ii) be converted into  the right to receive Cash Consideration (as defined below); provided, however,  that ten percent (10%) of the Company Common Stock to be converted pursuant to  the Merger shall consist of the aggregate of (i) the Company Common Stock that  will be converted to Cash Consideration, and (ii) the Company Common Stock that  will be converted into the right to receive cash in lieu of Fractional Shares  (as defined in Section 1.07(f)) if any pursuant to Section 1.07(f). Cash  Consideration shall be the amount of cash equal to the product obtained by  multiplying the Exchange Ratio by the Associated Common Stock closing price on  the date of the Effective Time. As of the Effective Time, all such Shares shall  no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and  shall cease to exist, and each Certificate (as defined in Section 1.07(c)) shall  thereafter represent the right to receive a certificate representing shares of  Associated Common Stock into which such Shares are convertible and/or Cash  Consideration. Certificates shall be exchanged for certificates representing  whole shares of Associated Common Stock issued in consideration therefor and/or  for Cash Consideration and cash in lieu of Fractional Shares (if any) upon the  surrender of such Certificates in accordance with the provisions of  Section 1.07, without interest. No Fractional Shares (if any) shall be  issued, and, in lieu thereof, a cash payment shall be made pursuant to  Section 1.07(f) hereof. Under no circumstances shall the total Shares  converted to Cash Consideration and Shares converted to the right to receive  cash in lieu of Fractional Shares (if any) represent more or less than ten  percent (10%) of the Company Common Stock to be converted pursuant to the  Merger. 

   

 .........(b)   each share of Company Common Stock held in the treasury of the Company and each  Share owned by Associated or any direct or indirect wholly owned Associated  Subsidiaries (as defined in Section 3.01) immediately prior to the Effective  Time shall be canceled and extinguished without any conversion thereof and no  payment shall be made with respect thereto. 

   

 .........(c)   (i) Each Election Form (as defined in Section 1.07(b)) shall permit the holder  of Shares (or the beneficial owner through appropriate and customary  documentation and instructions), other than Shares to be cancelled in accordance  with Section 1.06(b), to (A) elect to receive Associated Common Stock with  respect to all or a portion of such holders Shares (a "Stock  Election") and/or (B) elect to receive cash with respect to all or a  portion of such holders Company Common Stock (a "Cash  Election"). Shares as to which a Stock Election is made are referred to  herein as "Stock Election Shares," and Shares as to which a Cash  Election is made are referred to herein as "Cash Election Shares." Any  Shares with respect to which the holder (or the beneficial owner, as the case  may be) shall not have submitted to the Exchange Agent an effective, properly  completed Election Form on or before 5:00 P.M., Central Time, on the business  day that is two business days prior to the Effective Time (the "Election  Deadline") shall be deemed to be Stock Election Shares. Any such election  shall have been properly made only if the Exchange Agent shall have actually  received a properly completed Election Form by the Election Deadline. Any  Election Form may be revoked or changed by the person submitting such Election  Form prior to the Election Deadline. Subject to the terms of this Agreement and  of the Election Form, the Exchange Agent shall have reasonable discretion to  determine whether any election, revocation or change has been properly or timely  made and to disregard immaterial defects in the Election Forms, and any good  faith decisions of the Exchange Agent regarding such matters shall be binding  and conclusive. None of Associated, the Company and the Exchange Agent shall be  under any obligation to notify any person of any defect in an Election Form. 

   

 .........   (ii) If the number of Cash Election Shares is, when considered together with the  number of shares of Company Common Stock to be converted into cash to be paid in  lieu of Fractional Shares, equal to more or less than ten percent (10%) of the  total Shares, Associated and the Company will reduce or increase the number of  Cash Election Shares by the number necessary to cause the Cash Election Shares  to equal ten percent (10%) of the total Shares. If there is an excess of Cash  Election Shares, the number of Cash Election Shares which may not be so  converted into Cash Consideration shall be converted into Stock Election Shares  and exchanged for Associated Common Stock in accordance with Section 1.06(a),  with the reduction in Cash Election Shares to be made pro rata among the  shareholders of the Company making Cash Elections based upon the number of  Shares for which each such shareholder has made a Cash Election. If there is a  deficiency of Cash Election Shares, the number of Stock Election Shares which  may not be so converted into shares of Associated Common Stock, shall be  converted into Cash Election Shares and exchanged for Cash Consideration in  accordance with Section 1.06(a), with the reduction in Stock Election Shares to  be made pro rata among the shareholders of the Company making Stock Elections  based on the number of shares for which each such shareholder has made a Stock  Election. 

   

 SECTION 1.07. Exchange of Certificates. 

   

 .........(a)   Exchange Agent. As of the Effective Time, Associated shall deposit, or shall  cause to be deposited, with an exchange agent designated by Associated and  acceptable to the Company (the "Exchange Agent"), and such deposit  shall be solely for the benefit of the holders of Shares, for exchange in  accordance with this Article I through the Exchange Agent, Cash  Consideration, certificates representing the shares of Associated Common Stock  and cash to be paid in lieu of Fractional Shares (if any) (such Cash  Consideration, certificates for shares of Associated Common Stock and cash in  lieu of Fractional Shares (if any), together with any dividends or distributions  with respect thereto, being hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange  Fund") payable or issuable pursuant to Sections 1.06 or 1.07(f) (if  any) in exchange for Shares. 

   

 .........(b)   Election Forms. At least fourteen (14) days prior to the Effective Time, the  Exchange Agent shall mail or personally deliver to each holder of record of  Shares (or his or her attorney in fact) forms mutually agreeable to Associated  and the Company for the exercise of elections as described in Section 1.06(c)  ("Election Forms"). 

   

 .........(c)   Exchange Procedures. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time,  but in no event later than three (3) business days after the Effective Time, the  Exchange Agent shall mail or personally deliver to each holder of record (or his  or her attorney-in-fact) of a certificate or certificates which immediately  prior to the Effective Time represented Shares (the "Certificates"),  whose Shares were converted into the right to receive Cash Consideration and/or  shares of Associated Common Stock pursuant to Section 1.06 and cash in lieu  of Fractional Shares (if any), (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall  specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the  Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange  Agent (or a lost certificate affidavit in a form reasonably acceptable to the  Exchange Agent) and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as  Associated may reasonably specify), and (ii) instructions for use in  effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for certificates  representing shares of Associated Common Stock and/or Cash Consideration and  cash in lieu of Fractional Shares (if any). The foregoing letter of transmittal  and instructions shall be subject to prior approval of the Company. At the  Effective Time and upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the  Exchange Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, the  holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor  Cash Consideration and/or a certificate representing that number of whole shares  of Associated Common Stock which such holder has the right and cash in lieu of  Fractional Shares (if any), and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith  be canceled and Cash Consideration and/or certificate representing shares of  Associated Common Stock and the cash in lieu of Fractional Shares (if any) shall  be sent as promptly as practicable to such holder. In the event of a transfer of  ownership of Shares which is not registered in the transfer records of the  Company, Cash Consideration and/or a certificate representing the proper number  of shares of Associated Common Stock and the cash in lieu of Fractional Shares  (if any) may be issued to a transferee if the Certificate representing such  Shares is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required  to evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock  transfer taxes have been paid. The Exchange Agent shall make reasonable efforts  to make available additional letters of transmittal and instructions to all such  persons who become holders (or beneficial owners) of Company Common Stock.  Certificates surrendered for exchange by any affiliate of the Company shall not  be exchanged for certificates representing shares of Associated Common Stock  and/or Cash Consideration and cash in lieu of Fractional Shares (if any) until  Associated has received a written agreement from such person as provided in  Section 4.04 hereof. Until surrendered as contemplated by this  Section 1.07, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the  Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the  certificate representing shares of Associated Common Stock and/or Cash  Consideration and cash in lieu of Fractional Shares (if any) as contemplated by  Section 1.07(f). 

   

 .........(d)   Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares. No dividends or other  distributions declared or made after the Effective Time with respect to  Associated Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be  paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the shares  of Associated Common Stock represented thereby, and no Cash Consideration or  cash payment in lieu of Fractional Shares (if any) shall be paid to any such  holder pursuant to Section 1.07(f), until the holder of such Certificate  shall surrender such Certificate. All dividends or other distributions declared  on or after the Effective Time with respect to Associated Common Stock and  payable to the holder of record thereof on or after the Effective Time that are  payable to the holder of a Certificate not theretofore surrendered and exchanged  for Associated Common Stock pursuant to this Section 1.07(d) shall be paid or  delivered by Associated to the Exchange Agent, in trust, for the benefit of such  holders. All such dividends and distributions held by the Exchange Agent for  payment or delivery to the holders of unsurrendered Certificates unclaimed on  the date of termination of the Exchange Fund pursuant to Section 1.07(g) shall  be repaid or redelivered by the Exchange Agent to Associated. Subject to the  effect of applicable laws, following surrender of any such Certificate, there  shall be paid to the holder of the certificates representing whole shares of  Associated Common Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest,  (i) promptly, the amount of any cash payable with respect to a Fractional  Share (if any) to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 1.07(f)  and the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the  Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of Associated  Common Stock, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of  dividends or other distributions, with a record date after the Effective Time  but prior to surrender and a payment date occurring after surrender, payable  with respect to such whole shares of Associated Common Stock. 

   

 .........(e)   No Further Rights in the Shares. All Cash Consideration and shares of Associated  Common Stock issued upon conversion of the Shares in accordance with the terms  hereof (including any cash paid pursuant to Section 1.07(f)) shall be  deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such  Shares. 

   

 .........(f)   No Fractional Shares. No certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of  Associated Common Stock ("Fractional Shares") shall be issued upon the  surrender for exchange of Certificates, and such Fractional Share interest will  not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights of a shareholder of  Associated. Each holder of a Fractional Share interest shall be paid an amount  in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying such Fractional Share  interest to which such holder (after taking into account all Fractional Share  interests then held by such holder) would otherwise be entitled by the  Associated Common Stock closing price on the date of the Effective Time. 

   

 (g)   Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which remains  undistributed to the shareholders of the Company for one year after the  Effective Time shall be delivered to Associated, upon demand, and any  shareholders of the Company who have not theretofore complied with this  Article I shall thereafter look only to Associated for payment of their  claim for Cash Consideration, Associated Common Stock, any cash in lieu of  Fractional Shares (if any), and any dividends or distributions with respect to  Associated Common Stock. 

   

 (h)   No Liability. Neither Associated nor the Company shall be liable to any holder  of Shares for any such Shares (or dividends or distributions with respect  thereto) or cash delivered to a public official pursuant to any abandoned  property, escheat, or similar law. 

   

 (i)   Withholding Rights. Associated shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any  cash consideration payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Shares or  any holder of Company Stock Options pursuant to Section 1.10 such amounts as  Associated is required by law to deduct and withhold with respect to the making  of such payment under the Code, or any provision of state, local, or foreign tax  law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Associated, such withheld  amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid  to the holder of the Shares or Company Stock Options, as applicable, in respect  of which such deduction and withholding was made by Associated. 

   

 SECTION 1.08. Stock Transfer Books. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and there shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock thereafter on the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of certificates evidencing ownership of Shares of the Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares except as otherwise provided herein or by law. On or after the Effective Time, any Certificates presented to the Exchange Agent or Associated for any reason shall be converted into Cash Consideration and/or shares of Associated Common Stock in accordance with this Article I. 

   

 SECTION 1.09. Anti-Dilution Adjustment. If, subsequent to the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time, Associated shall pay a stock dividend or make a distribution on Associated Common Stock in shares of Associated Common Stock or any security convertible into Associated Common Stock or shall combine or subdivide its stock, then in each such case, from and after the record date for determining the shareholders entitled to receive such dividend or distribution or the securities resulting from such combination or subdivision, an appropriate adjustment (if any) shall be made to the Exchange Ratio set forth in Section 1.06 above, for purposes of determining the number of shares of Associated Common Stock into which the Company Common Stock shall be converted. For purposes hereof, the payment of a dividend in Associated Common Stock, or the distribution on Associated Common Stock in securities convertible into Associated Common Stock, shall be deemed to have effected an increase in the number of outstanding shares of Associated Common Stock equal to the number of shares of Associated Common Stock into which such securities shall be initially convertible without the payment by the holder thereof of any consideration other than the surrender for cancellation of such convertible securities. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section shall not apply to any stock options, warrants, restricted stock sale, or performance stock issued under option plans of Associated existing as of the date of this Agreement. 

   

 SECTION 1.10. Treatment of Company Stock Options. All rights under any option to purchase shares of Company Common Stock that remains outstanding and unexercised, whether vested or unvested, immediately prior to the Effective Time (the "Company Stock Options") shall become null and void and cease to represent a right to acquire shares of Company Common Stock as of the Effective Time and shall at the option of the holder be either (i) converted into options (the "New Options") to purchase that number of shares of Associated equal to (a) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, multiplied by (b) the Exchange Ratio (rounding Fractional Shares down to the nearest whole share), or (ii) converted to the right to receive cash in an amount (less any applicable withholding tax) equal to the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Company Stock Option multiplied by the amount by which the Exchange Ratio times the Associated Common Stock closing price on the date of the Effective Time exceeds the exercise price for such Company Stock Option; provided, however that Company Stock Options issued after April 1, 2004 shall be converted to a right to receive cash pursuant to (ii) of the first clause of this sentence with no option to convert to New Options pursuant to (i) of the first clause of this sentence. The exercise price per share of Associated Common Stock under each converted New Option shall be equal to the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock which was purchasable under the Company Stock Option that such New Option replaces divided by the Exchange Ratio (rounded down to the nearest whole cent). Each option which is an "incentive stock option" as defined in Section 422 of the Code shall be adjusted as required by Section 424 of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder so as not to constitute a modification, extension, or renewal of the option within the meaning of Section 424(h) of the Code. The duration and vesting of each such New Option shall be the same as the original Company Stock Option it replaces, except to the extent vesting may be accelerated under the terms of the applicable Company stock option plan by reason of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. At or before the Effective Time, the Company shall cause to be effected any amendments to any plans, grant agreements, or other documents relating to any of the Company Stock Options which may be necessary in order to give effect to the provisions of this Section 1.10 and, if necessary, will use reasonable efforts to obtain the consent of any holder of Company Stock Options necessary to effect any such amendments.

 .........(e)   The Company and ERISA Affiliates have maintained and operated each Employee  Benefit Plan in compliance with the applicable plan documents and all applicable  Laws relating to the Employee Benefit Plans (including, without limitation, the  Code, ERISA, HIPAA, USERRA, ADEA, FMLA, and ADA and the applicable regulations  and rulings under each of these laws), except for any failure to comply which  would not result in liability to the Company or any Company Subsidiary in excess  of $250,000, individually or in the aggregate. The Company and ERISA Affiliates  have incurred no Liability to any governmental agency in connection with any  Employee Benefit Plan. 

   

 .........(f)   The Company or ERISA Affiliates, as applicable, have made all contributions  required to be made pursuant to the terms of any Employee Benefit Plan or any  collective bargaining agreement to which it is a party or as otherwise required  by applicable Law. Amounts accrued to date as Liabilities in connection with any  Employee Benefit Plan of the Company or any ERISA Affiliate which have not been  paid have been properly recorded on the books of the Company in accordance with  GAAP and, if applicable, Code section 412. With respect to each Employee  Benefit Plan, all insurance premiums have been paid in full and on a timely  basis for all periods ending on or prior to the signing of this Agreement. No  contribution made to an Employee Benefit Plan was subject to an excise tax under  Code section 4972 that has not been satisfied in full. All contributions and  payments by the Company and any ERISA Affiliate in respect of any Employee  Benefit Plan have been or are fully deductible under the Code.

If an Employee Benefit Plan is self-funded and the Company  or an ERISA Affiliate is party to a stop-loss insurance policy with respect to  such Employee Benefit Plan, the Company or ERISA Affiliate has complied with all  terms of the stop-loss policy and has timely paid all premiums owing with  respect to such stop-loss policy through the signing of this Agreement.

Any Pension Plan which is a retirement plan exempt from Parts 2,  3, and 4 of Subtitle B of ERISA as an unfunded retirement plan established for a  select group of management or highly compensated employees has timely filed the  one-time notice with the DOL required pursuant to DOL Regulation section  2520.104-23.

 .........(j)   With respect to each Employee Benefit Plan (i) no non-exempt prohibited  transaction, as defined in ERISA section 406 or Code section 4975, has occurred,  (ii) neither the Company, any ERISA Affiliate, nor any of their current or  former directors, officers, employees, or any other "fiduciary,"  within the meaning of ERISA section 3(21), has committed any breach of fiduciary  responsibility imposed by ERISA or any other applicable law, or has any  Liability for failure to comply with ERISA or the Code for any action or failure  to act in connection with the operation, administration, or investment of the  assets of any Employee Benefit Plan. There is no pending, threatened, or  anticipated action, audit, suit, grievance, arbitration, or other manner of  litigation or claim relating to any Employee Benefit Plan (other than routine  claims for benefits). Neither the Company, ERISA Affiliates, nor any of their  directors, officers, employees, or any fiduciary of any Employee Benefit Plan  has any knowledge of any facts that could give rise to arbitration, litigation,  or claims with respect to any Employee Benefit Plan. Each "fiduciary"  and every "plan official" (as defined in section 412 of ERISA) of each  Employee Benefit Plan is bonded or otherwise insured to the extent required by  section 412 of ERISA. The Company and ERISA Affiliates are not subject to an  excise tax under Code section 4977, 4978, 4979, 4979A, 4980, 4980D, or 4980F  that has not been satisfied in full. There have been no investigations or audits  of any Employee Benefit Plan by any governmental authority that have been  concluded that resulted in any Liability to the Company or ERISA Affiliates that  has not been fully discharged, and the Company has provided Associated copies of  any closing letter, closing agreement, or other documentation describing the  resolution of such prior audits or investigations. 

   

 .........(k)   Following the adoption, restatement, or amendment of all Employee Benefit Plans  as provided to Associated, the Company, ERISA Affiliates, and any of their  officers or directors have taken no action directly or indirectly which  obligates the Company or ERISA Affiliates to institute or modify or change any  Employee Benefit Plan, any actuarial or other assumption used to calculate  funding obligations with respect to any of the Companys and ERISA  Affiliates Employee Benefit Plans, or the manner in which contributions to  any of the Employee Benefit Plans are made or the basis on which such  contributions are determined. 

   

 .........(l)   No Employee Benefit Plan is funded through a "welfare benefit fund" as  defined in Code section 419(e), and neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate  has established or maintained any arrangement that could be deemed to qualify as  a funded welfare plan. The Company and ERISA Affiliates have not incurred any  liability under Code section 4976 that has not been satisfied in full. 

   

 .........(m)   Except as set forth in Section 2.10(m) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, no  Employee Benefit Plan provides medical, life, or other welfare benefits (whether  or not insured), with respect to persons who are not current employees of the  Company or ERISA Affiliates (other than coverage mandated by COBRA). With  respect to any Employee Benefit Plan required to be disclosed in Section 2.10(m)  of the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company has disclosed to Associated all  documents relating to the Employee Benefit Plan that have been provided to  participants. Further, with respect to any Employee Benefit Plan required to be  disclosed in Section 2.10(m) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, documents  relating to the Employee Benefit Plan that have been provided to participants  have, from the inception of the Employee Benefit Plan to the present, informed  participants that the Company reserves the right to terminate or amend the  Employee Benefit Plan at any time. Each Employee Welfare Plan that is a  "group health plan" within the meaning of Code section 5000 has been  operated in compliance with the applicable plan document, COBRA, ERISA, the  administrative simplification provisions of HIPAA, as applicable, the secondary  payor requirements of section 1862(b) of the Social Security Act, and applicable  state law requirements, except for any failure to comply which would not result  in liability to the Company or any Company Subsidiary in excess of $250,000,  individually or in the aggregate. No Employee Welfare Plan or Fringe Benefit  Plan provides benefits for persons who are not eligible for coverage under the  terms of such plans. No claim for medical benefits has been incurred (but not  reported) under any Employee Welfare Plan (subject to the Companys  knowledge with respect to claims incurred after January 27, 2004) with  respect to any current or former employee (or the spouse or dependent of such  employee) that is in excess of $25,000. The Companys financial statements,  as of the signing of this Agreement, will contain adequate accruals for incurred  or continuing but unpaid claims under Employee Benefit Plans not funded by  insurance. 

   

 .........(n)   Except as disclosed in the Company Disclosure Schedule at Section 2.10(n),  the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not (i)  entitle any present or former director, officer, or employee of the Company or  ERISA Affiliates to severance pay, unemployment compensation, excess parachute  payments (within the meaning of section 280G of the Code), or any other payment;  (ii) accelerate the time of payment or vesting of benefits under any of the  Employee Benefit Plans; or (iii) increase the amount of compensation or benefits  due under any of the Employee Benefit Plans with respect to any such present or  former director, officer, or employee of the Company or any of the Company  Subsidiaries.

Except as set forth in the Company Disclosure Schedule at Section 2.11 or filed as an exhibit in the Filed Company SEC Reports, as of the date of this Agreement, neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries is a party to or bound by (a) any employment or consulting contract which provides for a base or guaranteed annual level of compensation in excess of $100,000 (without regard to any commissions), (b) any contract or commitment for capital expenditures in excess of Two-Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($250,000) for any one (1) project, or (c) contracts or commitments for the purchase of materials or supplies or for the performance of services that require the Company to make payments in excess of Two-Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($250,000) in any twelve-month period. 

   

 SECTION 2.12. Registration Statement; Proxy Statement. None of the information supplied or to be supplied by the Company for inclusion in (a) the Registration Statement (as defined in Section 6.01), (b) the Proxy Statement/Prospectus (as defined in Section 6.01), or (c) any other document to be filed with the SEC or other regulatory authority in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, at the respective times such documents are filed and, in the case of the Registration Statement, when it becomes effective and at the Effective Time, and with respect to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, when mailed, shall be false or misleading with respect to any material fact, or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading. In the case of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, none of such information at the time of the Companys shareholders meeting pursuant to Section 6.02 (the "Meeting") shall be false or misleading with respect to any material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to correct any statement in any earlier communication with respect to the solicitation of any proxy for the Meeting. The Company has received from Sandler ONeill and Partners, L.P. an opinion (the "Fairness Opinion") to the effect that the consideration the Companys shareholders will receive pursuant to the Merger is fair to the Companys shareholders from a financial point of view, and such Fairness Opinion, if updated by Sandler ONeill and Partners, L.P. as of the date of mailing of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, may be included therein. 

   

 SECTION 2.13. Title to Property. The Company Disclosure Schedule at Section 2.13 correctly identifies all real property owned, leased, or used by the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries.

All leases pursuant to which the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries lease from others real or personal property including, without limitation, leases for branch offices, are in good standing, valid, effective, binding, and enforceable in accordance with their respective terms, and there is not or there has not occurred, under any of such leases, any existing material default or event of default (or event which with notice or lapse of time, or both, would constitute a material default and in respect of which the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries have not taken adequate steps to prevent such a default from occurring). The Companys and each of the Company Subsidiaries buildings and equipment in regular use have been reasonably maintained and are in good and serviceable condition, reasonable wear and tear excepted. None of the buildings, structures, or appurtenances owned or leased by the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries for their operation or maintenance as now operated or maintained, contravenes any zoning ordinances or other administrative regulations (whether or not permitted because of prior non-conforming use), or violates any restrictive covenant or any provision of Law, the effect of which would materially interfere with or prevent the continued use of such properties for the purposes for which they are now being used or would materially and adversely affect the value thereof.

 (g)   The Company and each of the Company Subsidiaries have filed all reports,  returns, and other filings required to be filed with respect to the  Companys Property under Environmental Laws and the Environmental Permits  except where the failure to do so would not have a Material Adverse Effect on  the Company.

 (h)   To the Companys knowledge, the business of the Company and each of the  Company Subsidiaries and the Companys Property have been and are being  operated in accordance with all applicable Environmental Laws and Environmental  Permits. Neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries has received  any written notice nor does the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries have  knowledge that any of the Companys Property is not in material compliance  with all Environmental Laws and Environmental Permits and no proceeding for the  suspension, revocation, or cancellation of any Environmental Permit is pending  or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened. 

   

 (i)   There are no actions pending, or to the knowledge of the Company, threatened  against the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries which in any case assert  or allege (i) the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries violated any  Environmental Law or Environmental Permit or is in default with respect to any  Environmental Permit or any order, writ, judgment, variance, award, or decree of  any government authority issued under any Environmental Law; (ii) the  Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries is required to clean up or take  remedial or other response action due to the disposal, discharge, or other  release of any Hazardous Substance on the Companys Property or elsewhere;  or (iii) the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries are required to  contribute to the cost of any past, present, or future cleanup or remedial or  other response action which arises out of or is related to the disposal,  discharge, or other release of any Hazardous Substance by the Company, the  Company Subsidiaries, or others.

 SECTION 2.15. Absence of Agreements. Neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries is a party to any written agreement or memorandum of understanding with, or a party to any commitment letter or similar undertaking, or is subject to any order or directive by, or is a recipient of any extraordinary supervisory letter which restricts materially the conduct of its business (including any contract containing covenants which limit the ability of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries to compete in any line of business or with any person or which involve any restriction of the geographical area in which, or method by which, the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries may carry on their business) or in any manner relates to their capital adequacy, credit policies, or management, except as set forth at Section 2.15 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, nor has the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries been advised that any federal, state, or governmental agency is contemplating issuing or requesting (or is considering the appropriateness of issuing or requesting) any such order, decree, agreement, memorandum of understanding, extraordinary supervisory letter, commitment letter, or similar submission. 

   

 SECTION 2.16. Taxes. The Company and each of the Company Subsidiaries have timely filed all Tax Returns (as defined below) required to be filed by any of them, and the Company and each of the Company Subsidiaries have timely paid and discharged all Taxes (as defined below) due in connection with or with respect to the filing of such Tax Returns and have timely paid all other Taxes as are due, except such as are being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and with respect to which the Company is maintaining reserves adequate for their payment. The liability for Taxes set forth on each such Tax Return adequately reflects the Taxes required to be reflected on such Tax Return. For purposes of this Agreement, "Tax" or "Taxes" shall mean taxes, charges, fees, levies, and other governmental assessments and impositions of any kind, payable to any federal, state, local, or foreign governmental entity or taxing authority or agency, including, without limitation, (a) income, franchise, profits, gross receipts, estimated, ad valorem, value added, sales, use, service, real or personal property, capital stock, license, payroll, withholding, disability, employment, social security, workers compensation, unemployment compensation, utility, severance, production, excise, stamp, occupation, premiums, windfall profits, transfer, and gains taxes; (b) customs, duties, imposts, charges, levies, or other similar assessments of any kind; and (c) interest, penalties, and additions to tax imposed with respect thereto, and "Tax Returns" shall mean returns, reports, and information statements with respect to Taxes required to be filed with the United States Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS") or any other governmental entity or taxing authority or agency, domestic or foreign, including, without limitation, consolidated, combined, and unitary tax returns. For purposes of this Section 2.16, references to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries include former subsidiaries of the Company for the periods during which any such entities were owned, directly or indirectly, by the Company. Other than as listed at Section 2.16 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, neither the IRS nor any other governmental entity or taxing authority or agency is now asserting, either through audits, administrative proceedings, court proceedings, or otherwise, or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatening to assert against the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, any deficiency or claim for additional Taxes. Other than as listed at Section 2.16 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries has granted any waiver of any statute of limitations with respect to, or any extension of a period for the assessment of, any Tax.

The accruals and reserves for taxes reflected in the Company Balance Sheet are adequate to cover all Taxes accruable by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis through the date thereof (including Taxes being contested) in accordance with GAAP. No agreements relating to allocating or sharing of Taxes exist between the Company and/or any of the Company Subsidiaries.

Neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries has been refused any insurance with respect to any material assets or operations, nor has coverage been limited in any respect material to their operations by any insurance carrier to which they have applied for any such insurance or with which they have carried insurance during the last five (5) years. All of such claims have been timely filed by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and are listed on Section 2.17 of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

The Company has delivered to Associated true and complete copies of all documents reflecting internal control over financial reporting of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries.

          |

 (ii)   by the Company or Associated (A) if there has been a breach in any material  respect (except that where any statement in a representation or warranty  expressly includes a standard of materiality, such statement shall have been  breached in any respect) of any representation, warranty, covenant, or agreement  set forth in this Agreement on the part of the nonterminating party, or  (B) if any representation or warranty of the nonterminating party shall be  discovered to have become untrue in any material respect (except that where any  statement in a representation or warranty expressly includes a standard of  materiality, such statement shall have become untrue in any respect), in either  case which breach or other condition has not been cured within 15 business days  or which breach by its nature cannot be cured prior to the Effective Time;  provided, however, that neither the Company nor Associated shall have the right  to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.01(a)(iii) unless the  breach of any representation or warranty (but not breaches of covenants or  agreements), together with all other such breaches, would entitle the party  receiving such representation or warranty not to consummate the transactions  contemplated hereby under Section 7.02(a) (in the case of a breach of a  representation or warranty by the Company) or Section 7.03(a) (in the case of a  breach of a representation or warranty by Associated); and provided further that  this Agreement may not be terminated pursuant to this clause (iii) by the  breaching party or party making any representation or warranty which shall have  become untrue in any material respect;

---|--- 
    
          |

 (vi)   by Associated, if all of the conditions set forth in Section 7.02 are not  satisfied on or before the Expiration Date; 

  
---|--- 
    
          |

 (vii)   by the Company, if all of the conditions set forth in Section 7.03 are not  satisfied on or before the Expiration Date;

          |

 (ix)   by Associated if the Companys Board of Directors (x) withdraws or modifies  in a manner adverse to Associated its recommendation or approval with respect to  this Agreement or the Merger, (y) makes any recommendation with respect to a  Competing Transaction (including making no recommendation or stating an  inability to make a recommendation), other than a recommendation to reject such  Competing Transaction, or (z) takes any action prohibited by Section 4.02(e); 

  
---|--- 
    
          |

 (x)   by Associated if, prior to the Effective Time, a Competing Transaction occurs or  the Company enters into any agreement to engage in a Competing Transaction; 

  
---|--- 
    
          |

 (xi)   by Associated if the Company fails to take the actions provided in Section 6.02  (either in breach of such Section or pursuant to the exception related to its  fiduciary duties provided in such Section); or 

  
---|--- 
    
          |

 (xii)   by the Company if both [a] the Associated Average Price (as defined below)  is less than 85% of the Associated Closing Price, and [b] the number  obtained by dividing the Associated Average Price by the Associated Closing  Price is less than the number obtained by dividing the Final Index Price (as  defined below) by the Initial Index Price (as defined below) and subtracting .15  from such quotient. If the Company makes an election to terminate this Agreement  under this Section 8.01(a)(xii), the Company shall, on or before the end of  the second business day after the end of the Calculation Period (as defined  below), give ten days written notice thereof to Associated. If, during the  seven-day period commencing with its receipt of such notice, Associated  proposes, by notice in writing to the Company, that the Exchange Ratio shall be  adjusted to equal (A) the product of Associated Closing Price multiplied by the  Exchange Ratio in effect prior to such adjustment, divided by (B) the Associated  Average Price (carried out to five decimal places and rounded up if the sixth  decimal price is five or greater), the Company may in its sole discretion give  Associated notice of acceptance of such proposal within five (5) business days  of receipt thereof, in which case no termination shall have occurred and this  Agreement shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with its terms  (except that the Exchange Ratio shall have been so modified).
