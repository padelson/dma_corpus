AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of March 30, 2001 (this "AGREEMENT"),
among General Electric Capital Corporation, a New York
corporation ("PARENT"), Galahad Acquisition Corp., a Maryland corporation
("MERGER SUB") and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, and Franchise Finance
Corporation of America, a Maryland corporation (the "COMPANY").  
WITNESSETH:   WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Merger
Sub and the Company have each determined that the merger of the Company with
Merger Sub (the "MERGER"), upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, is advisable and in the best interests of their
respective stockholders, and such Boards of Directors have approved such
Merger pursuant to which each outstanding share of common stock, par value
$.01 per share, of the Company (the "COMPANY COMMON STOCK") issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (as defined in SECTION
1.3), other than shares owned or held directly or indirectly by Parent or
directly by the Company, will be converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration (as defined in SECTION 1.8(B)); and   WHEREAS,
following the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time, the Company
intends, with the cooperation of Parent, to dispose of certain assets set
forth on ANNEX A hereto (as amended from time to time pursuant to SECTION 5.2
hereof) and certain liabilities associated therewith (the "DISPOSITION");  
WHEREAS, immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Company intends,
with the cooperation and at the direction of Parent, to transfer all of the
interests in the securitizations of the Company set forth on Section 5.9 of
the Company Disclosure Schedule (excluding any rights, duties or obligations
as a servicer or subservicer) that are held by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (including those held by FFCA Residual Interest Corporation
("FRIC") (the "SECURITIZATION INTERESTS")) to Galahad REIT Corporation, a
Delaware corporation ("GALAHAD") and a wholly owned subsidiary of General
Electric Capital Services, Inc. ("HOLDINGS"), the parent corporation of
Parent; and   WHEREAS, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company desire to make
certain representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby and also to prescribe various
conditions to the transactions contemplated hereby;   NOW, THEREFORE, in
consideration of the foregoing and the respective representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, and intending to be
legally bound hereby, the parties hereto agree as follows:   ARTICLE I  
THE MERGER   1.1 THE MERGER. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the Maryland General
Corporation Law (the "MGCL"), Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the
Company at the Effective Time. From and after the Effective Time, the
separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and the Company shall
continue its corporate existence under the MGCL as the surviving corporation
(the "SURVIVING CORPORATION").   1.2 CLOSING. Subject to the terms and
conditions hereof, the closing of the Merger (the "CLOSING") will take place
on the second Business Day after the satisfaction or waiver (subject to
applicable law) of the conditions set forth in ARTICLE VI (excluding
conditions that, by their terms, cannot be satisfied until the Closing Date),
unless another time or date is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto
(any such date, the "CLOSING DATE"). The Closing shall be held at the offices
of Simpson Thacher and Bartlett, 425 Lexington Avenue, New York, New York,
unless another place is agreed to by the parties hereto.   1.3 EFFECTIVE
TIME. As soon as practicable following the Closing, the parties shall (i)
file articles of merger (the "ARTICLES OF MERGER") in such form as is
required by, and executed in accordance with the relevant provisions of, the
MGCL, and (ii) make all other filings or recordings required under the MGCL.
The Merger shall become effective at such time as the Articles of Merger are
duly filed with the State Department of Assessments and Taxation of Maryland,
or at such subsequent time as Parent and the Company shall agree and specify
in the Articles of Merger (the date and time the Merger becomes effective
being the "EFFECTIVE TIME").   1.4 EFFECTS OF THE MERGER. At and after the
Effective Time, the Merger will have the effects set forth in the MGCL.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the
Effective Time all the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of
the Company and Merger Sub shall be vested in the Surviving Corporation, and
all debts, liabilities, obligations and duties of the Company and Merger Sub
shall become the debts, liabilities, obligations and duties of the Surviving
Corporation.   1.5 CHARTER. The charter of the Company as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall upon the Effective Time and by
virtue of the Merger be amended to read in its entirety as set forth in
EXHIBIT 1.5, and as so amended shall be the charter of the Surviving
Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by
applicable law.   1.6 BY-LAWS. The by-laws of the Company as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall upon the Effective Time be
amended to read in their entirety as set forth in EXHIBIT 1.6, and as so
amended shall be the by-laws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter
changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable law.   2   1.7
OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS OF THE SURVIVING CORPORATION. Except as set forth on
Section 1.7 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, the officers of the Company
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the officers of
the Surviving Corporation, until their respective successors are duly elected
and qualified or their earlier resignation or removal or otherwise ceasing to
be an officer, as the case may be. The Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause each of the directors of the Company to tender their
resignations as directors of the Company immediately prior to the Effective
Time, which such resignations shall become effective at and as of the
Effective Time. The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation until
their respective successors are duly elected and qualified or their earlier
resignation or removal or otherwise ceasing to be a director, as the case may
be.   1.8 EFFECT ON CAPITAL STOCK. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Merger Sub or any
holder of any capital stock thereof:   (a) (i) Each share of Company Common
Stock issued and outstanding  immediately prior to the Effective Time (other
than Cancelled Shares (as  defined in SECTION 1.8(A)(II)), shall be converted
into the right to  receive $25.00 per share in cash, without interest
thereon.   (ii) Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding 
immediately prior to the Effective Time and owned or held by Parent or any 
of its Subsidiaries and each share of Company Common Stock held in treasury 
of the Company at the Effective Time ("CANCELLED SHARES") shall, by virtue 
of the Merger, cease to be outstanding and shall be cancelled and no Merger 
Consideration or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange 
therefor. For purposes of this SECTION 1.8(A)(II), shares of Company Common 
Stock owned beneficially or held of record by any plan, program or 
arrangement sponsored or maintained for the benefit of any current or  former
employee of the Company, Parent or any of their respective  Subsidiaries will
not be deemed to be held by the Company, Parent or any  such Subsidiary,
regardless of whether the Company, Parent or any such  Subsidiary has the
power, directly or indirectly, to vote or control the  disposition of such
shares.   (iii) Each share of capital stock of Merger Sub issued and
outstanding  immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
the right  to receive one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share
of common  stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving
Corporation.   3   (b) As a result of the Merger and without any action on
the part of  the holders thereof, at the Effective Time, all shares of
Company Common  Stock outstanding immediately prior to such time shall cease
to be  outstanding and shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and
each  holder of a certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time 
represented any such shares of Company Common Stock (a "Certificate") shall 
thereafter cease to have any rights with respect to such shares of Company 
Common Stock, except the right to receive the consideration specified in 
SECTION 1.8(A)(I) (the "MERGER CONSIDERATION") in accordance with ARTICLE  II
upon the surrender of such Certificate (other than in the case of  Cancelled
Shares); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the foregoing shall not affect  the payment
of dividends with a record date prior to the Effective Time to  the holders
of record on such record date.   1.9 TREATMENT OF OPTIONS AND RESTRICTED
STOCK.   (a) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each then
outstanding  employee or other stock option and each then outstanding
director stock  option (each, an "OPTION"), whether or not then vested or
exercisable,  shall be (or, if not previously vested and exercisable, shall
become)  vested and exercisable and such Options immediately thereafter shall
be  cancelled by the Company, and each holder of a cancelled Option shall
be  entitled to receive at the Effective Time or as soon as practicable 
thereafter from the Company (and, if necessary, Parent shall provide funds 
to the Company sufficient for such payments) in consideration for the 
cancellation of such Option an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) 
the number of shares of Company Common Stock previously subject to such 
Option and (ii) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the 
exercise price per share of Company Common Stock previously subject to such 
Option, less any applicable withholding taxes.   (b) Immediately prior to
the Effective Time, all restrictions on all  outstanding shares of restricted
Company Common Stock granted to employees  or directors shall lapse, and such
shares of Company Common Stock shall be  converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration in accordance  with SECTION 1.8(A)(I).   (c) The
Company shall (i) take all actions necessary and appropriate  so that all
stock or other equity based plans maintained with respect to  the Company
Common Stock, including, without limitation, the stock or other  equity based
plans listed on Section 3.1(p) of the Company Disclosure  Schedule ("OPTION
PLANS"), shall terminate as of the Effective Time, (ii)  use its reasonable
best efforts to provide that any other Benefit Plan  providing for the
issuance, transfer or grant of any capital stock of the  Company or any
interest in respect of any capital stock of the Company  shall be amended to
provide that no further issuances, transfers or grants  shall be permitted
from and after the Effective Time, and (iii) use its  reasonable best efforts
to provide that, from and after the Effective Time,  no holder of an Option
or any participant in any Option Plan shall have any  right thereunder to
acquire any capital stock of the Company, Parent or the   4   Surviving
Corporation. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall use  its
reasonable best efforts to (x) obtain all necessary consents from, and 
provide (in a form reasonably acceptable to Parent) any required notices  to,
holders of Options and (y) amend the terms of the applicable Option  Plan, in
each case, as is necessary to give effect to the provision of this  paragraph
(c).   ARTICLE II   EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES   2.1 EXCHANGE FUND. Prior
to the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall appoint a bank or trust company
acceptable to the Company to act as exchange agent (the "EXCHANGE AGENT") for
the payment of the Merger Consideration. At or prior to the Effective Time,
Parent shall deposit or cause to be deposited with the Exchange Agent, in
trust for the benefit of holders of shares of Company Common Stock, for
exchange in accordance with SECTION 1.8, all the cash to be paid pursuant to
this Agreement in exchange for outstanding Company Common Stock. Any cash
deposited with the Exchange Agent shall hereinafter be referred to as
the "EXCHANGE FUND."   2.2 EXCHANGE PROCEDURES. As promptly as practicable,
but in any event within five (5) Business Days after the Effective Time, the
Exchange Agent will send to each record holder of a Certificate, (i) a letter
of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk
of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in a form and have such other
provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger
Consideration. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time,
each holder of a Certificate, upon surrender of a Certificate to the Exchange
Agent together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other
documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration with
respect to the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock previously
represented by such Certificate. The Exchange Agent shall accept such
Certificates upon compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the
Exchange Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance
with normal exchange practices. No interest will be paid or will accrue on
any cash payable pursuant to SECTION 1.8. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of Company Common Stock which is not registered in the transfer
records of the Company, a check in the proper amount of cash pursuant to
SECTION 1.8 may be issued with respect to such Company Common Stock to such
a transferee if the Certificate formerly representing such shares of
Company Common Stock is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all
documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that
any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid.   2.3 NO FURTHER
OWNERSHIP RIGHTS IN COMPANY COMMON STOCK. All cash paid upon surrender of
Certificates in accordance with the terms of ARTICLE I and this ARTICLE II
shall be deemed to have been issued or paid in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly
represented thereby, except as otherwise provided herein or by law.   5  
2.4 TERMINATION OF EXCHANGE FUND. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
which remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates for twelve months
after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation or
otherwise on the instruction of the Surviving Corporation, and any holders of
Certificates who have not theretofore complied with this ARTICLE II shall
thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned
property, escheat or other similar laws) for the Merger Consideration to
which such holders are entitled pursuant to SECTION 1.8 with respect to the
shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented thereby.   2.5 NO
LIABILITY. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation
or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any Merger
Consideration from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant
to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.   2.6
INVESTMENT OF THE EXCHANGE FUND. Any funds included in the Exchange Fund may
be invested by the Exchange Agent, as directed by Parent; PROVIDED, HOWEVER,
that such investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United
States of America and backed by the full faith and credit of the
United States of America or in commercial paper obligations rated A-l or P-1
or better by Moody\'s Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poor\'s
Corporation, respectively. Any interest and other income resulting from such
investments shall be paid to Parent upon termination of the Exchange Fund
pursuant to SECTION 2.4 hereof.   2.7 LOST CERTIFICATES. If any Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such
Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may
direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with
respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will deliver in exchange for
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the applicable Merger
Consideration with respect to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly
represented thereby pursuant to this Agreement.   2.8 WITHHOLDING RIGHTS.
Each of the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock or
Options such amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld with respect
to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended from time to time (the "CODE"), and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder, or any provision of state, local or foreign tax law.
To the extent that amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder
of the shares of Company Common Stock or Options in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made.   6   2.9 FURTHER ASSURANCES. At and
after the Effective Time, the officers and directors of the Surviving
Corporation will be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on
behalf of the Company or Merger Sub, any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or
assurances and to take and do, in the name and on behalf of the Company or
Merger Sub, any other actions and things to vest, perfect or confirm of
record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation any and all right, title and
interest in, to and under any of the rights, properties or assets deemed
acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in
connection with, the Merger.   2.10 STOCK TRANSFER BOOKS. At the close of
business, New York City time, on the day the Effective Time occurs, the stock
transfer books of the Company shall be closed and there shall be no further
registration of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock thereafter on the
records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of
Certificates shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares of
Company Common Stock formerly represented thereby, except as otherwise
provided herein or by law. On or after the Effective Time, any Certificates
presented to the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Corporation or Parent for any
reason shall be cancelled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration with
respect to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented
thereby.   ARTICLE III   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES   3.1
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY. Except as set forth in the
Company Disclosure Schedule delivered by the Company to Parent in
connection with the execution of this Agreement (the "COMPANY DISCLOSURE
SCHEDULE") (each section of which qualifies the correspondingly numbered

SECTION 8.11(F))  on the Company. The copies of the charter, articles or

Company solely through open market purchases), (B)  for Options and other
rights representing in the aggregate the right  to purchase 3,973,618 shares

as amended, of the Company (the  "1995 STOCK OPTION PLAN") and (2) the 1997

Company solely through open market purchases), as of the  date of this
Agreement, there are no securities, options, warrants,   8   calls,
rights, commitments, agreements, arrangements or undertakings  of any kind to
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party  or by which any of
them is bound obligating the Company or any of its  Subsidiaries to issue,
deliver, sell, repurchase, redeem or otherwise  acquire or cause to be
issued, delivered, sold, repurchased, redeemed  or acquired, shares of
capital stock or other voting securities of the  Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or obligating the Company or any of  its Subsidiaries to issue,
grant, extend or enter into any such  security, option, warrant, call, right,

Subsidiary of the Company have been  validly issued and are fully paid and
nonassessable and are owned (of  record and beneficially) by the Company
and/or one or more of its  wholly owned Subsidiaries, free and clear of all
pledges, claims,  liens, charges, encumbrances and security interests of any
kind or  nature whatsoever (collectively, "LIENS"). Except (A) for the
capital  stock or other ownership interests of its Subsidiaries, (B) as 
acquired in the ordinary course of business pursuant to foreclosure, 
workout, settlement or similar transactions, and (C) for security  interests
held in the ordinary course of business, the Company does  not own, directly

that is material to the business of the Company  and its Subsidiaries, taken
as a whole.   (c) AUTHORITY; NO CONFLICTS.   (i) The Company has all
requisite corporate power and authority  to enter into this Agreement and to
consummate the transactions  contemplated hereby, subject in the case of the
consummation of the  Merger, to the receipt of the Required Company Vote (as

the  consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly 
authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the  Company,
subject in the case of the consummation of the Merger to the  receipt of the
Required Company Vote. This Agreement has been duly  executed and delivered
by the Company and constitutes a valid and  binding agreement of the Company,
enforceable against it in accordance  with its terms, except as such
enforceability may be limited by  bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium and similar laws  relating to or affecting creditors generally, by
general equity  principles (regardless of whether such enforceability is
considered in  a proceeding in equity or at law) or by an implied covenant of
good  faith and fair dealing.   (ii) The execution and delivery of this
Agreement does not, and  the consummation of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated  hereby will not, conflict with, or result in any
violation of, or  constitute a default (with or without notice or lapse of
time, or  both) under, or require an offer to purchase to be made under, or
give   9   rise to a right of termination, amendment, cancellation or 
acceleration of any obligation or the loss of a material benefit  under, or
the creation of a Lien on any assets (any such conflict,  violation, default,
right of termination, amendment, cancellation or  acceleration, loss or
creation, a "VIOLATION") pursuant to: (A) any  provision of the charter,
articles or certificate of incorporation or  by-laws or similar governing
document of the Company or any Subsidiary  of the Company, or (B) except as
would not, individually or in the  aggregate, reasonably be expected to have
a Material Adverse Effect on  the Company and subject to obtaining or making
the consents,  approvals, orders, authorizations, registrations, declarations
and  filings referred to in paragraph (iii) below, any loan or credit 
agreement, note, mortgage, bond, indenture, lease, benefit plan or  other
agreement, obligation, instrument, permit, concession, franchise  or license,
or any judgment, order, decree, statute, law, ordinance,  rule or regulation
("LAWS") applicable to the Company or any  Subsidiary of the Company or their
respective properties or assets.   (iii) No consent, approval, order or
authorization of, or  registration, declaration or filing with, any Person or
the United  States government or any United States domestic state, municipal
or  local government, any instrumentality, subdivision, court, 
administrative agency or commission or other authority thereof, or any 
United States domestic quasi-governmental or private body exercising  any
regulatory, taxing, importing or other United States domestic  governmental
or quasi-governmental authority (a "GOVERNMENTAL  ENTITY"), is required by
the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company  as a result of the execution
and delivery of this Agreement by the  Company or the consummation of the
Merger and the other transactions  contemplated hereby, except for those
required under or in relation to  (A) the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust
Improvements Act of 1976, as  amended (the "HSR ACT"), (B) the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as  amended (the "EXCHANGE ACT"), (C) the MGCL with
respect to the filing  of the Articles of Merger, (D) the Required Company
Vote, (E) the  rules and regulations of the New York Stock Exchange (the
"NYSE"), (F)  state approvals required in connection with the Surviving 
Corporation\'s commercial loan and lease origination, servicing and  selling
activities and (G) such consents, approvals, orders,  authorizations,
registrations, declarations and filings the failure of  which to make or
obtain would not, individually or in the aggregate,  reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect on the  Company. Consents, approvals,
orders, authorizations, registrations,  declarations and filings required
under or in relation to any of the  foregoing clauses (A) through (F) are
hereinafter referred to as  "REQUIRED CONSENTS."   (d) REPORTS AND
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. The Company has filed all  material reports, schedules,
forms, statements and other documents required  to be filed by it with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC")  since January 1, 2000
(collectively, including all exhibits thereto, the   10   "COMPANY SEC
REPORTS"). No Subsidiary of the Company is required to file  any form, report
or other document with the SEC. None of the Company SEC  Reports filed as of
their respective dates (or, if amended or superseded by  a subsequent filing,
then as of the date of such filing), as so amended or  superseded, contained
any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to  state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make  the statements therein,
in light of the circumstances under which they were  made, not misleading or
failed to comply as to form in all material  respects with the applicable
requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as  amended, the Exchange Act
and, in each case, the rules and regulations  promulgated thereunder. Each of
the consolidated financial statements  (including the related notes) included
in the Company SEC Reports presents  fairly, in all material respects, the
consolidated financial position and  consolidated results of operations and
cash flows of the Company and its  Subsidiaries as of the respective dates or
for the respective periods set  forth therein, all in conformity with United
States generally accepted  accounting principles ("U.S. GAAP") (except, in
the case of unaudited  consolidated quarterly statements, as permitted by
Form 10-Q of the SEC)  consistently applied during the periods involved
except as otherwise noted  therein, and subject, in the case of the unaudited
interim financial  statements, to normal and recurring year-end
adjustments.   (e) LIABILITIES. Except for (i) liabilities incurred in the
ordinary  course of business consistent with past practice or otherwise
permitted  hereunder, (ii) liabilities arising from this Agreement or the
transactions  contemplated hereby and transaction expenses incurred in
connection with  this Agreement, (iii) liabilities disclosed in the Company
SEC Reports  filed prior to the date hereof, and (iv) liabilities which,
individually or  in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material  Adverse Effect on the Company, since the date of the most recent
audited  annual financial statements included in the Company SEC Reports
filed with  the SEC prior to the date of this Agreement (the "FILED AUDITED 
FINANCIALS"), neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has incurred 
any liabilities (whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise and 
whether due or to become due) that would be required to be reflected or 
reserved against in a consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its 
Subsidiaries prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP as applied in preparing 
the fiscal year end consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its 
Subsidiaries contained in the Filed Audited Financials.   (f) ABSENCE OF
CERTAIN CHANGES OR EVENTS. Except as otherwise  contemplated hereby, from the
date of the Filed Audited Financials to the  date hereof: (i) the Company and
its Subsidiaries have conducted their  business in all material respects in
the ordinary course in substantially  the same manner as heretofore
conducted; (ii) there has not been any  Material Adverse Effect on the
Company; (iii) the Company has not declared  any dividends on or made any
other distributions in respect of any of its  capital stock, except regular
quarterly dividends by the Company in an  amount not in excess of $0.56 per
share for each dividend; (iv) the Company  has not changed its methods of
accounting for financial accounting or tax   11   purposes in any manner
that would be reasonably expected to have a  significant adverse effect on
its financial statements; (v) the Company has  not made or revoked any
material express or deemed election relating to  Taxes; and (vi) neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has (A)  waived in writing any rights
which waiver would reasonably be expected to  have a Material Adverse Effect
on the Company, (B) suffered any  extraordinary loss or extraordinary losses
(as defined in Opinion No. 30 of  the Accounting Principles Board of the
American Institute of Certified  Public Accountants and any amendments or
interpretations thereof) which  would reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on the  Company, (C) made or agreed to make any
material increase in the  compensation payable or to become payable to any
Company Employee, except  for regularly scheduled increases in compensation
payable or increases  otherwise occurring in the ordinary and usual course of
business consistent  with past practices, (D) made or agreed to make any
increase in any Company  Plan or adopt a new employee benefit plan, which in
either case would  result in a material increase in liability to the Company,
or (E) made any  capital expenditures in respect of its business or
operations (excluding  capital expenditures made in respect of portfolio or
other properties held  or controlled in the course of its business) in excess
of $2,500,000 in the  aggregate.   (g) INFORMATION SUPPLIED.   (i) None
of the information supplied or to be supplied by the  Company for inclusion
or incorporation by reference in the Proxy  Statement (as defined in SECTION
5.1(A)), on the date it is first  mailed to stockholders of the Company or at
the time of the Company  Stockholders Meeting, contains or will contain any
untrue statement of  a material fact or omits or will omit to state any
material fact  required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements  therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not  misleading or necessary to correct any statement in any earlier 
communication with respect to the solicitation of proxies for the  Company
Stockholders Meeting which has become false or misleading.   (ii)
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this SECTION  3.1(G), no
representation or warranty is made by the Company with  respect to statements
made in the Proxy Statement based on information  supplied by Parent for
inclusion therein. For purposes of the  foregoing, it is understood and
agreed that information concerning or  related to Holdings, Parent or Merger
Sub or their respective  Subsidiaries will be deemed to have been supplied by
Parent and  information concerning or related to the Company and the
Company  Stockholders Meeting shall be deemed to have been supplied by the 
Company.   (h) BOARD APPROVAL. The Board of Directors of the Company, by 
resolutions duly adopted at a meeting duly called and held and not 
subsequently rescinded or modified in any way (the "BOARD APPROVAL"), has 
duly (i) declared that this Agreement and the Merger and the other   12  
transactions contemplated hereby are advisable to, and in the best  interests
of, the Company and its stockholders, (ii) approved this  Agreement and the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and  (iii) recommended
that the stockholders of the Company approve the Merger  and the other
transactions contemplated hereby, including the amendment to  the Company\'s
charter contemplated hereby. The Board Approval (assuming the  accuracy of
the representation in SECTION 3.2(H)) (together with opt-out  exemptions
incorporated in the Company\'s by-laws) is sufficient to render  inapplicable
to the Merger and this Agreement (and the transactions  provided for herein)
the restrictions on "business combinations" (as  defined in Subtitle 6 of
Title 3 of the MGCL) set forth in Subtitle 6 of  Title 3 of the MGCL and the
limitations on the voting rights of shares of  stock acquired in a "control
share acquisition" (as defined in Subtitle 7  of Title 3 of the MGCL) set
forth in Subtitle 7 of Title 3 of the MGCL, and  to the knowledge of the
Company as of the date hereof, no other state  business combination or
takeover statute or similar statute or regulation  applies to the Merger and
this Agreement (and the transactions provided for  herein).   (i) VOTE
REQUIRED. The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority  of the
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock entitled to vote (the  "REQUIRED
COMPANY VOTE") is the only vote of the holders of any class or  series of
Company capital stock necessary to approve the Merger and the  other
transactions contemplated hereby, including the amendment to the  Company\'s
charter contemplated hereby (assuming the accuracy of the  representation in
SECTION 3.2(H)).   (j) OPINION OF FINANCIAL ADVISOR. The Company has
received the opinion  of Merrill Lynch and Co. (the "FINANCIAL ADVISOR"), dated
the date of this  Agreement, to the effect that, as of such date, the Merger
Consideration is  fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of the
Company Common  Stock.   (k) RIGHTS AGREEMENT. The Company has amended the
Rights Agreement to  ensure that (i) none of a "Flip-In Event", a
"Distribution Date" or a  "Stock Acquisition Date" (in each case as defined
in the Rights Agreement)  will occur, and none of Parent, Merger Sub or any
of their "Affiliates" or  "Associates" will be deemed to be an "Acquiring
Person" (in each case as  defined in the Rights Agreement), by reason of the
execution and delivery  of this Agreement or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated  hereby, and (ii) the Rights will expire
immediately prior to the Effective  Time. On or prior to the date hereof, no
"Flip-In Event", "Distribution  Date" or "Stock Acquisition Date" (as defined
in the Rights Agreement) has  occurred.   (l) RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS.
Except for those arrangements,  agreements and contracts disclosed (or
incorporated by reference) in the  Company SEC Reports filed prior to the
date hereof and except for the  Company Plans, set forth on Section 3.1(l) of
the Company Disclosure  Schedule is a list of all written arrangements,
agreements and contracts  currently in effect entered into by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries   13   with any Person who is an officer, director
or affiliate of the Company, or  any entity of which any of the foregoing is
an affiliate, other than those  arrangements, agreements and understandings
which (i) are terminable by the  Company upon no more than 30 days\' prior
notice without payment of any  premium or penalty or (ii) would not,
individually or in the aggregate,  reasonably be expected to create or result
in a liability to the Company in  excess of $100,000.   (m) LITIGATION.
There are no claims, actions, suits, proceedings or  investigations
(collectively, "CLAIMS") pending or, to the knowledge of the  Company,
threatened against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any  properties
or rights of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, before any  Governmental
Entity, nor is there any judgment, decree, injunction, ruling  or order of
any Governmental Entity or arbitrator outstanding specifically  against the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, except for any of the  foregoing as would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be  expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company. To the Company\'s  knowledge, there
has not been any investigation of the Company or any of  its Subsidiaries
conducted by any Governmental Entity during the two years  prior to the date
hereof which was concluded and resulted in a significant  adverse effect on
the ability of the Company and its Subsidiaries to  conduct their respective
businesses.   (n) COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS; PERMITS. The businesses of the
Company and  its Subsidiaries are not being and have not during the past two
years been,  conducted in violation of any Law of any Governmental Entity,
except for  any violations that would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably  be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. The
Company  and each of its Subsidiaries hold all permits, licenses,
variances,  exemptions, authorizations, operating certificates, orders and
approvals of  all Governmental Entities (the "COMPANY PERMITS"), that are
required for  each of them to own, lease or operate their assets and to carry
on their  businesses as presently conducted, except where the failure to hold
Company  Permits would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected  to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. The Company and
its  Subsidiaries have not received any notice of any default under or
violation  of, any such Company Permit, except for such violations or
defaults that  would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have  a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.   (o)
TAXES.   (i) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries and any 
consolidated, combined, unitary or aggregate group for tax purposes of  which
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is or has been a member  has timely
filed all income or franchise Tax Returns and all other  material Tax Returns
(as defined below) required to be filed by it  (after giving effect to any
extension properly granted by a Tax  Authority (as defined below) having
authority to do so) and has timely  paid (or the Company has timely paid on
its behalf), or adequately   14   provided for on the Company\'s financial
statements in accordance with  U.S. GAAP, all income, franchise and other
material Taxes (as defined  below) due and owing except such Taxes that are
being contested in  good faith by appropriate proceedings and for which the
Company or any  of its Subsidiaries shall have set aside on its books
adequate  reserves. Each such Tax Return is complete and accurate in all 
material respects. The most recent financial statements of the Company  filed
with the SEC reflect an adequate reserve for all Taxes payable  by the
Company and its Subsidiaries for all taxable periods and  portions thereof
through the date of such financial statements for  which no Tax Return is yet
due. No material deficiencies for any Taxes  have been proposed, asserted or
assessed in writing against the  Company or any of its Subsidiaries and, to
the knowledge of the  Company, no such deficiencies otherwise have been
proposed, asserted  or assessed. No requests for waivers of the time to
assess any federal  income taxes or other material Taxes are pending and no
extensions of  time to assess any such Taxes are in effect. There are no
material  pending actions or proceedings by any Tax Authority for assessment
or  collection of any Tax. No claim has been made in writing by a Tax 
Authority in a jurisdiction where the Company or any of its  Subsidiaries
does not file Tax Returns that it is or may be subject to  taxation by the
jurisdiction and, to the knowledge of the Company, no  such claim otherwise
has been made, in both cases, where such claim,  were it to be sustained,
would result in a material Tax liability to  the Company and/or any of its
Subsidiaries. All Taxes required to be  withheld, collected and paid over to
any Tax Authority by the Company  or any of its Subsidiaries have been timely
withheld, collected and  paid over to the proper Tax Authority. Since the
most recent audited  financial statements contained in thc Company SEC
Reports, the Company  has incurred no liability for Taxes under Sections
857(b), 857(f),  860(c) or 4981 of the Code, including without limitation any
Tax  arising from a prohibited transaction described in Section 857(b)(6) 
of the Code, determined without regard to the transactions  contemplated
under this Agreement and any actions taken by Parent on  or after the Closing
Date, and since December 31, 2000, neither the  Company nor any of its

after the Closing  Date, no event has occurred, and no condition or
circumstance exists,  which presents a material risk and, since December 31,
2000, no event  has occurred, and no condition or circumstance has arisen,
which  presents a risk that (i) any Tax described in the preceding sentence 
will be imposed upon the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in a  material
amount or (ii) the Company has not or will not qualify as a  REIT for federal
income tax purposes. Complete copies of all federal   15   and all

asset (A) the  disposition of which would be subject to rules similar to
Section 1374  of the Code as a result of an election under Internal Revenue
Service  Notice 88-19 or Treas. Reg.ss.1.337-5T, or (B) that is subject to
a  consent filed pursuant to Section 341(f) of the Code and the  regulations
thereunder. Neither the Company nor any of its  Subsidiaries is obligated, at
the date hereof, to make any payment  that would not be deductible pursuant
to Section 162(m) of the Code  prior to or at the Closing. Neither the
Company nor any of its  Subsidiaries is party to, nor has any liability under
(including  liability with respect to any predecessor entity), any 
indemnification, allocation or sharing agreement with respect to Taxes 
(other than any reimbursement agreement relating to payroll Taxes in  respect
of shared employees). As used in this Agreement, "TAX" or  "TAXES" shall
include all federal, state, local and foreign income,  property, sales, use,
occupancy, transfer, recording, withholding,  franchise, employment, excise
and other taxes, or governmental charges  of any nature whatsoever, together

taxable year beginning June 1, 1994 through December 31, 2000 has been 
properly subject to taxation as a real estate investment trust within  the
meaning of Section 856 of the Code (a "REIT") and has qualified as  a REIT
for such years, (y) has operated since December 31, 2000, and  will continue
to operate to and including the Closing, in such a  manner as to qualify as a
REIT for its taxable year beginning January  1, 2001, determined as if such
taxable year ended as of the Closing  and (z) has not taken or omitted to
take any action which action or  omission would reasonably be expected to
result in a challenge to its  status as a REIT and no such challenge is
pending or to the Company\'s  knowledge threatened; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that
the Company shall not be  deemed to be in breach of this representation by
reason of its failure  to make a distribution in excess of that permitted to
be made pursuant  to Section 4.1(b). Each of the Company\'s Subsidiaries
which is a (x)   16   partnership, joint venture or limited liability
company (A) has been  since its formation and continues to be treated for
federal income tax  purposes as a partnership or disregarded as a separate
entity, as the  case may be, and has not been treated for federal income tax
purposes  as a corporation or an association taxable as a corporation and
(B)  has not since the later of its formation or the acquisition by the 
Company of a direct or indirect interest therein owned any assets 
(including, without limitation, securities) that would cause the  Company to
violate Section 856(c)(4) of the Code, or (y) corporation  has been since its
formation a qualified REIT subsidiary under Section  856(i) of the Code,
except as set forth on Section 3.1(o) of the  Company Disclosure Schedule.

have properly and timely elected,  effective for the taxable year beginning
on January 1, 2001, to treat  Funding as a "taxable REIT subsidiary" for
purposes of the Code. The  Company has not elected and will not elect to pay
Tax on any capital  gain recognized on or after January 1, 2001.   (iii)
The representations set forth in this SECTION 3.1(O) that  are qualified as

incentive, bonus, stock option,  stock purchase, and restricted stock plan,
program or policy sponsored  or maintained by the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries, any of their  affiliates and any trade or business (whether or
not incorporated)  which is or has ever been under common control, or which
is or has  ever been treated as a single employer, with any of them under
Section  4.14(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code ("ERISA AFFILIATE"), in which 
present or former employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries  or
ERISA Affiliates ("COMPANY EMPLOYEES") participate (collectively,  the
"COMPANY PLANS"). All Company Plans set forth on Section 3.1(p) of  the
Company Disclosure Schedule, if any, that would result in the  payment to any
Company Employee of any money or other property or  accelerate or provide any
other rights or benefits thereto as a result  of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, whether or not  such payment or acceleration
would constitute a parachute payment  within the meaning of Code Section
280G, are so indicated by an  asterisk. The Company Plans are in compliance
with all applicable  requirements of ERISA, the Code, and other applicable
Laws and have  been administered in all material respects in accordance with
their   17   terms and such Laws, except where the failure to so comply or
be  administered would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably  be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. Each  Company Plan
which is intended to be qualified within the meaning of  Section 401 of the
Code has received a favorable determination letter  as to its qualification,
and, to the knowledge of the Company, nothing  has occurred that would
reasonably be expected to cause the loss of  such qualification or the loss
of the tax-exempt status for any trust  maintained with respect to any such
Company Plan.   (ii) Except with respect to (A) the Company\'s Change of
Control  Severance Plan and (B) any liabilities which arise under any

Effective Time, neither the Company nor Parent shall, at or after the 
Effective Time, have any liability with respect to any employment,  change in
control, "continuity" or severance agreement, plan, program  or policy with
or with respect to any Company Employee.   (iii) No Company Plan is subject
to Title IV of ERISA (including  any "multiemployer plan" (as defined in
Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA)),  and neither the Company nor any of its ERISA
Affiliates has ever  contributed or been obligated to contribute to any
pension plan  subject to Title IV of ERISA (including any multiemployer
plan).   (iv) No event or condition has occurred, to the knowledge of the 
Company, in connection with which the Company or any of its ERISA  Affiliates
would be subject to any liability, encumbrance or Lien with  respect to any
Company Plan under ERISA, the Code or any other  applicable Law or under any
agreement or arrangement pursuant to or  under which the Company or any of
its ERISA Affiliates are required to  indemnify any person against such
liability, where such liability,  individually or in the aggregate, would
reasonably be expected to have  a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.  
(v) True, correct and complete copies of the following documents  with
respect to each of the Company Plans have been made available or  delivered
to Parent by Company, to the extent applicable: (A) any  plans or agreements,
all amendments thereto and related trust  documents, and amendments thereto;
(B) the most recent Form 5500 and  all schedules thereto and the most recent
actuarial report, if any;  (C) the most recent IRS determination letter; and
(D) any summary plan  descriptions.   (vi) With respect to any Company
Plan, (A) no actions, suits or  claims (other than routine claims for
benefits in the ordinary course)  are pending or threatened in writing and
(B) to the knowledge of the  Company, no facts or circumstances exist that
could give rise to any   18   such actions, suits or claims, in each case
which, individually or in  the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse  Effect on the Company.   (vii) None of the Company
Plans provide for post-employment life  or health insurance, benefits or
coverage for any participant or any  beneficiary of a participant, except as
may be required under the  Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of
1985, as amended  ("COBRA") and any such participation is at the expense of
the  participant or the participant\'s beneficiary.   (viii) None of the

of any such employees. To  the knowledge of the Company, there is no union
organization activity  involving any of the Company Employees, pending or
threatened in  writing, nor has there been any union representation involving
such  employees within the past two years. To the Company\'s knowledge,
there  are no complaints, charges or claims against the Company or any of
its  Subsidiaries pending or, threatened in writing, by or before any 
Governmental Entity based on, arising out of, in connection with, or 
otherwise relating to the employment or termination of employment or  failure
to employ by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, of any  individual which
would reasonably be expected, individually or in the  aggregate, to have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company. The  Company and its Subsidiaries are
in compliance with all laws,  regulations and orders relating to the
employment of labor, including  all such laws, regulations and orders
relating to wages, hours, the  Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification

closing" law,  collective bargaining, discrimination, civil rights, safety
and  health, workers\' compensation and the collection and payment of 
withholding and/or social security taxes and any similar tax, except  where
the failure to be so in compliance would not be reasonably  expected,
individually or in the aggregate, to have a Material Adverse  Effect on the
Company. There has been no "mass layoff" or "plant  closing" as defined by
WARN with respect to the Company or any of its  Subsidiaries in the 90 day
period immediately prior to the date  hereof.   (q) ENVIRONMENTAL

not  result in the Company and its Subsidiaries incurring Environmental

expected to result in the assertion of an  Environmental Claim against the
Company or its Subsidiaries or  otherwise result in the Company or its
Subsidiaries incurring any  Environmental Liability.   (ii) Neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party  to any order or, to the

7.1(F), the Company agrees that its obligations pursuant to the preceding 
provisions of this SECTION 5.1 shall not be affected by the commencement,

certificate delivered by it pursuant to any of the facilities listed in 
Section 5.3(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, and (ii) consistent with 
its legal obligations, all other information concerning its business,

HOWEVER, that Company may restrict the foregoing access to the extent that 
any Law of any Governmental Entity (which, for purposes of this SECTION 5.3 
shall include any foreign governmental entities) applicable to the Company 
or any existing agreement requires the Company or its Subsidiaries to 
restrict access to any properties or information.   33   (b) Parent and

extent required by, and in accordance with, the  provisions of the letter
dated April 8, 1999 between the Company and Parent  (the "CONFIDENTIALITY

taken, all  actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,

consents,  approvals and authorizations of all third parties and Governmental
Entities  necessary or advisable in order to consummate the transactions
contemplated  by this Agreement and (ii) keep the other party apprised of the
status of  matters relating to completion of the transactions contemplated
hereby.  Subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information,
each of  the Company and Parent shall have the right to review in advance,
and will  consult with the other with respect to, all the information
relating to the  other party and each of their respective Subsidiaries, which
appears in any  filings, announcements or publications made with, or written
materials  submitted to, any third party or any Governmental Entity in
connection with  the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In
exercising the  foregoing right, each of the parties hereto agrees to act
reasonably and as  promptly as practicable.   (b) In furtherance and not in
limitation of the foregoing, each party  hereto agrees to make an appropriate
filing of a Notification and Report  Form pursuant to the HSR Act with
respect to the transactions contemplated  hereby as promptly as practicable,
and in any event within five (5)  Business Days of the date hereof, and to
supply as promptly as practicable  any additional information and documentary
material that may be requested  pursuant to the HSR Act and to take all other
actions necessary to cause  the expiration or termination of the applicable
waiting periods under the  HSR Act as soon as practicable. Nothing in this
SECTION 5.4 shall require  the Company, Merger Sub, Parent or any of their
respective Subsidiaries to  sell, hold separate or otherwise dispose of or
conduct their respective  businesses in a specified manner, whether as a
condition to obtaining any  approval from a Governmental Entity or any other
Person or for any other  reason, if such sale, holding separate or other
disposition or the conduct  of their business in a specified manner would
reasonably be expected to  have a material adverse effect on the business,
financial condition or  results of operations of either the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as  a whole or the BAF Business (as defined below) (it
being understood that  (i) any obligation of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries to sell, hold  separate or otherwise dispose of or conduct its
business in a specified   34   manner, is strictly limited to the assets,
properties and operations of (A)  the franchise finance business conducted by
Parent under the name of  "Business Asset Funding" (the "BAF BUSINESS") and
(B) in addition to the  obligations under clause (i)(A) above, after the
Effective Time, the  Company and its Subsidiaries, (ii) in no event shall
Parent or any of its  Subsidiaries have any obligation to sell, hold separate
or otherwise  dispose of or conduct any of its businesses in a specified
manner other  than the BAF Business and, after the Effective Time, that of
the Company  and its Subsidiaries and (iii) in the case of any such action
required of  Parent or Merger Sub or their respective Subsidiaries, the
determination of  such a material adverse effect will be measured instead
against aggregate  business, financial condition or results of operations of
the BAF Business  that would be equivalent economically to the aggregate
assets and  businesses of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole).   (c) Each of Parent and the Company shall, in connection with the 
efforts referenced in SECTION 5.4(B) to obtain all requisite approvals and 
authorizations for the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under  the
HSR Act or any other Regulatory Law (as defined below), use its  reasonable
best efforts to (i) cooperate in all respects with each other in  connection
with any filing or submission and in connection with any  investigation or
other inquiry, including any proceeding initiated by a  private party, (ii)
promptly inform the other party of any communication  received by such party
from, or given by such party to, the Antitrust  Division of the Department of
Justice (the "DOJ"), the Federal Trade  Commission (the "FTC") or any other
Governmental Entity (including any  foreign governmental entity) and of any
material communication received or  given in connection with any proceeding
by a private party, in each case,  regarding any of the transactions
contemplated hereby, and (iii) permit the  other party to review any
communication given by it to, and consult with  each other in advance of any
meeting or conference with, the DOJ, the FTC  or any such other Governmental
Entity (including any foreign governmental  entity) or, in connection with
any proceeding by a private party, with any  other Person, and to the extent
permitted by the DOJ, the FTC or such other  applicable Governmental Entity
(including any foreign governmental entity)  or other Person, give the other
party the opportunity to attend and  participate in such meetings and
conferences. For purposes of this  Agreement, "REGULATORY LAW" means the
Sherman Act, as amended, the Clayton  Act, as amended, the HSR Act, the
Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended,  and all other federal, state and
foreign, if any, statutes, rules,  regulations, orders, decrees,
administrative and judicial doctrines and  other laws that are designed or
intended to prohibit, restrict or regulate  actions having the purpose or
effect of monopolization or restraint of  trade or lessening of competition
through merger or acquisition.   (d) In furtherance and not in limitation of
the covenants of the  parties contained in this SECTION 5.4, if any
administrative or judicial  action or proceeding, including any proceeding by
a private party, is  instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging
any transaction  contemplated by this Agreement as violative of any
Regulatory Law, each of  Parent and the Company shall cooperate in all
respects with each other and   35   use its respective reasonable best
efforts to resolve, contest and resist  any such action or proceeding and to
have vacated, lifted, reversed or  overturned any decree, judgment,
injunction or other order, whether  temporary, preliminary or permanent, that
is in effect and that prohibits,  prevents or restricts consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this  Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing
or any other provision of this  Agreement, nothing in this SECTION 5.4 shall
limit a party\'s right to  terminate this Agreement pursuant to SECTION
7.1(B) or 7.1(C).   5.5 ACQUISITION PROPOSALS. The Company agrees that after
the date hereof neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any of the
officers and directors of it or its Subsidiaries shall, and that it shall
direct and use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and its
Subsidiaries\' employees, agents and representatives (including any
investment banker, attorney or accountant retained by it or any of its
Subsidiaries) not to, directly or indirectly, initiate, solicit or knowingly
encourage any inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer with respect
to a merger, reorganization, share exchange, consolidation, business
combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar
transaction involving it or any of its material Subsidiaries, or any purchase
or sale of all or 20% or more of the equity securities of it or any of its
material Subsidiaries or of the assets of it and its Subsidiaries taken as
a whole (any such proposal or offer, other than a proposal or offer made by
Parent or an affiliate thereof, being hereinafter referred to as an
"ACQUISITION PROPOSAL"); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Company may take any of
the foregoing actions to the extent such actions are in connection with any
transaction permitted under SECTION 4.1(E) or 4.1(F). The Company further
agrees that neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any of the officers
and directors of it or its Subsidiaries shall, and that it shall direct and
use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and its Subsidiaries\'
employees, agents and representatives (including any investment banker,
attorney or accountant retained by it or any of its Subsidiaries) not to,
directly or indirectly, have any discussion with or provide any confidential
information or data to any Person relating to an Acquisition Proposal, or
engage in any negotiations concerning an Acquisition Proposal, or accept an
Acquisition Proposal. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, the Company and its Board of Directors, including all of the
aforementioned Persons, shall be permitted to (A) to the extent applicable,
comply with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act
with regard to an Acquisition Proposal, and (B) in response to an unsolicited
bona fide written Acquisition Proposal by any Person, (I) furnish information
to, request information from, and engage in discussions or negotiations with
the Person making such Acquisition Proposal and (II) recommend such an
unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal to the stockholders of the
Company, or withdraw or modify in any adverse manner its approval or
recommendation of this Agreement, if and only to the extent that, in any such
case as is referred to in clause (B), (i) the Board of Directors of the
Company concludes in good faith that such Acquisition Proposal (x) in the
case of clause (I) above could reasonably be expected to constitute or result
in a Superior Proposal or (y) in the case of clause (II) above constitutes a
Superior Proposal (after giving effect to any concessions which are offered
by Parent, if any, following delivery of notice to Parent required pursuant
to SECTION 7.1(F)), and (ii) prior to providing any information to any Person
in connection with an Acquisition Proposal by any such   36  Person, the

proceeding or investigation from Parent  and the Surviving Corporation within
ten (10) Business Days of receipt from  the Covered Party of a request

such policies  in full force and effect, and continue to honor the Company\'s
obligations  thereunder.   (c) If Parent, the Surviving Corporation, any of

notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth  hereinabove, the
provisions of this paragraph (a) shall not be satisfied if  the

_________, 2001  Franchise Finance Corporation  of America 17207 North
Perimeter Drive Scottsdale, Arizona 85255   Re: Certain Federal Income Tax
Issues  Ladies and Gentlemen:   We have acted as your tax counsel, in
connection with the merger of Gallahad Acquisition Corp., a Maryland
corporation ("Merger Sub") with and into Franchise Finance Corporation of
America (the "Company") pursuant to that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger
(the "Merger Agreement") among General Electric Capital Corporation
("Capital"), Merger Sub and the Company, dated as of March 30, 2001.   You
have requested our opinion concerning certain federal income tax matters,
including but not limited to, your continued characterization as a
real estate investment trust for federal income tax purposes (a "REIT") under
the provisions of Section 856 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the "Code"). This opinion is based on various facts and assumptions
concerning your business, operations and properties. In connection with
rendering this opinion, you have delivered certain representations to us and,
with your permission, we have relied upon such representations.   Based on
such facts, assumptions and representations, it is our opinion that as of the
date hereof: (i) beginning with the taxable year of the Company ended
December 31, 1994 through the taxable year ended December 31, 2000,
the Company has been organized in conformity with and has satisfied the
requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT; (ii) for the taxable
year of the Company that began on January 1, 2001, the Company has been
organized in conformity with the requirements for qualification and taxation
as a REIT and the Company\'s methods of operation have enabled it to qualify
as a REIT; (iii) each of FFCA Acquisition Corporation, FFCA Institutional
Advisors, Inc., FFCA Residual Interest Corporation, FFCA Secured Assets
Corporation, FFCA Secured Lending Corporation, FFCA Secured Franchise Loan
Trust 1997-1, FFCA Franchise Loan Owner Trust 1998-1, FFCA Secured Franchise
Loan Trust 1998-1, FFCA Secured Franchise Loan Trust 1999-1, FFCA Secured
Franchise Loan Trust 1999-2, FFCA Secured Franchise Loan Trust 2000-1, FFCA
Secured Franchise Loan Trust 1996-C1, FFCA Loan Warehouse Corporation and
FFCA Capital Holding Corporation has been (at all times during the period
each such entity has been in existence) and will be treated as a qualified
REIT subsidiary within the meaning of Section 856(i) of the Code; and (iv)
FFCA Co-Investment Limited Partnership has been (at all times on and after
June 1, 1994) and will be treated as a partnership, rather than as an
association or publicly traded partnership taxable as a corporation for
federal income tax purposes.   This opinion is based in part on the Code,
Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder and interpretations thereof by
the Internal Revenue Service and the courts having jurisdiction over such
matters, each as of the date hereof and all of which are subject to change
either prospectively or retroactively. Also, any variation or difference in
the facts from those set forth in the representations furnished to us by you
may affect the conclusions stated herein. Moreover, your qualification and
taxation as a REIT depends upon your ability to meet, through actual annual
operating results, distribution levels and diversity of stock ownership, the
various qualification tests imposed under the Code, the results of which have
not been and will not be reviewed by Kutak Rock LLP. Accordingly, no
assurance can be given that the actual results of your operation for
any taxable year will satisfy such requirements.   In rendering this
opinion we have assumed that, with respect to the period commencing the first
day subsequent to the date hereof and ending on the last day of the
Company\'s current taxable year, the Company will be organized and operated
in a manner which will permit it to remain qualified as a REIT. However, in
rendering this opinion, we have analyzed the effect of the sales of the
assets pursuant to Sections 5.2 and 5.9 of the Merger Agreement on
the characterization of the Company as a REIT.   This opinion is rendered
only to the Company and its successor-in-interest, and may not be furnished
to, quoted to, or relied upon by any other person, firm or corporation, other
than Capital and its affiliates or in connection with an audit or examination
by a taxing authority, without our prior written consent. Please be advised
that we have rendered no opinion regarding any tax issues, other than as set
forth herein.   Very truly yours,     OFFICER\'S CERTIFICATE  FOR
FRANCHISE FINANCE CORPORATION OF AMERICA  REGARDING CERTAIN INCOME TAX
MATTERS  _________, 2001    The undersigned officers of Franchise Finance
Corporation of America, a Maryland corporation (the "Company"), in connection
with the merger of the Company with Gallahad Acquisition Corp. pursuant to
the terms of that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger
Agreement") dated as of March 30, 2001, hereby certify that, to the best of
their knowledge, each of the following statements is and will continue to be
true and correct:   1. At all times during the period commencing on June 1,
1994 and ending on the date hereof, one hundred (100) or more shareholders
have simultaneously held beneficial ownership of the outstanding capital
stock of the Company.   2. The Company will issue its capital stock,
including but not limited to the capital stock described in paragraphs 37,
39, 40, 41, 42 and 43 hereof, in a manner so that at all times, such stock is
not closely-held within the meaning of Section 856(a)(6) of the Code.   3.
Effective for its taxable year which ended December 31, 1994, the Company has
filed an election to be a taxed as a real estate investment trust and such
election has not been and will not be terminated or revoked.   4. At all
times the Company has and will continue to use its diligent efforts to
enforce the transfer and ownership restrictions on its common stock and
preferred stock (to the extent issued) as set forth in the
Company\'s Amendment and Restatement of Charter (the "Charter").   5. A
representative sample of each of the Company\'s Leases and Loans, as of the
date hereof, has been made available to Kutak Rock LLP for its review.   6.
The Company does not perform services with respect to any of its
rental properties other than (a) leasing vacant space, (b) developing and
leasing new space, (c) repairing or maintaining a tenant\'s premises after
the expiration or termination of a lease and prior to opening the premises to
new tenants, (d) restoration of the leased property after a casualty; and (e)
such other services as may have been disclosed to Kutak Rock LLP in
writing.   7. Except as otherwise disclosed to Kutak Rock LLP in writing,
with respect to each Lease, the amount of rent received or accrued by the
Company (either directly or through any partnership in which the Company may
acquire an interest) is not based in whole or in part on the income or
profits of the lessee. In certain cases, rent under a Lease is based in whole
or in part on a fixed percentage or percentages of gross receipts or gross
sales of a tenant.   8. With respect to each and every tenant under a Lease,
neither the Company nor any owner (actual or Constructive) of 10% or more of
the outstanding capital stock of the Company, is the owner (actual or
Constructive) (a) in the case of a tenant that is a corporation, capital
stock of such tenant possessing 10% or  more of the total combined voting
power of all classes of capital stock entitled to vote, or 10% or more of the
total number of shares of all classes of capital stock of such tenant; or (b)
in the case of a tenant that is not a corporation, an interest of 10% or more
in the assets or net profits of such tenant.   9. Except as otherwise
disclosed to Kutak Rock LLP in writing, with respect to each Lease from which
the Company receives or accrues rent attributable to personal property: (a)
such personal property is leased in connection with a lease of real property,
and (b) the rent attributable to personal property is less than 15% of the
total rent received or accrued under the Lease, determined by: (i) in the
case of tax years ending on or before December 31, 2000, comparing the
relative tax basis of the personal property being leased to the tax basis of
all of the property being leased; and (ii) in the case of tax years ending
after December 31, 2000, by comparing the relative fair market value of the
personal property being leased to the aggregate fair market value of
all property being leased.   10. Except as otherwise disclosed to Kutak
Rock LLP in writing, no amount of interest accruing with respect to any debt
obligation owned by the Company is based in whole or in part on the income or
profits of any person. In certain cases, such interest is based in whole or
in part on a fixed percentage or percentages of the gross sales or receipts
of the obligor of such debt instruments.   11. Except for the Subsidiaries
and FFCA Funding Corporation, the Company does not presently own shares of
capital stock in any corporation (including mutual funds) or equity interests
in entities which are characterized as associations taxable as corporations
for federal income tax purposes (including Delaware business trusts) except
for as provided in paragraph 34 of this Officers\' Certificate, either
directly, through a partnership or through any other arrangement.   12. The
Company owns 100% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of FFCA Funding
