 _AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER_  

   

 THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER ("Agreement"), dated as of December 9, 2008, is by and among Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, a Delaware corporation ("Parent"), Descartes Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"), and Dow Pharmaceutical Sciences, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), and Harris Goodman, in his or her capacity as representative of the Company Securityholders (the "Stockholder Representative"). Capitalized terms used in this Agreement are defined in Section 11.1, or in the applicable Section of this Agreement to which reference is made in Section 11.2. 

  

 _RECITALS:_  

   

 WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company deem it advisable and in the best interests of their respective stockholders to consummate the business combination provided for herein; 

  

 WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement and as an inducement to Parent to enter into this Agreement, certain employees listed on _Annex B_ (the "Key Employees") have executed an employment and noncompetition agreement in form and substance satisfactory to Parent (collectively, the "Employment and Noncompetition Agreements"); 

  

 WHEREAS, immediately following the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and as a condition and inducement to Parent and Merger Sub to enter into this Agreement, each stockholder of the Company listed on Annex A (each, a "Principal Company Stockholder") is executing and delivering to Parent an action by written consent of the Company Stockholders voting in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and approval of the transactions contemplated hereby, which approval is sufficient to constitute the Company Stockholder Approval (together with an irrevocable voting proxy in favor of Parent) and such action by written consent shall be certified by the Secretary of the Company as having been filed with the Company; 

  

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises and the respective representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, and of other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto, intending to be legally bound hereby, agree as follows: 

  

ARTICLE 1 

   

THE MERGER  

  

 1.1 _The Merger_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Certificate of Merger in such form as is required by the relevant provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the "DGCL"), at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company and the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall thereupon cease (the "Merger"). As a result of the Merger, the outstanding shares of capital stock of Merger Sub and the Company shall be converted or canceled in the manner provided in Article II 

   ##### 

  

 

of this Agreement, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease
and the Company shall be the surviving corporation following the Merger (the
"Surviving Corporation"). 

   

 1.2 _Closing; Effective Time_. The closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall take place at the offices of Morgan, Lewis and Bockius LLP, One Market, Spear Tower, San Francisco, California, at 10:00 a.m. on a date to be specified by the parties which shall be no later than three (3) Business Days after the satisfaction (or waiver as provided herein) of the conditions set forth in Article VII (other than those conditions that by their nature will be satisfied at the Closing), unless another time, date and/or place is agreed to in writing by the parties. The date upon which the Closing occurs is herein referred to as the "Closing Date." Simultaneously with, or as soon as practicable following, the Closing, the Company as the surviving corporation shall file the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware as provided in Section 252(c) of the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective at such time as the Certificate of Merger is so filed or at such later time as is set forth in the Certificate of Merger, if different, which time is hereinafter referred to as the "Effective Time." 

  

 1.3 _Effects of the Merger_. 

  

 (a) At and after the Effective Time, the Merger shall have the effects specified in the DGCL. 

   

 (b) At the Effective Time, the Certificate of Incorporation of the Company shall be amended and restated in its entirety to be identical to the Certificate of Incorporation of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that Article I of the Certificate of Incorporation shall read: "The name of this corporation is Dow Pharmaceutical Sciences, Inc.". As so amended and restated, the Certificate of Incorporation of the Company shall be the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation, until amended thereafter in accordance with applicable Law. 

   

 (c) At the Effective Time, the Bylaws of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation (except that all references to Merger Sub in the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be changed to reflect the name change of Merger Sub), until amended thereafter in accordance with applicable Law. 

   

 (d) At the Effective Time, each of the directors and officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors and officers of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office until their respective death, permanent disability, resignation or removal or until his or her respective successor is duly elected and qualified, all in accordance with the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation and applicable Law. 

   

 1.4 _Further Assurances_. If, at any time after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall consider or be advised that any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances or any other acts or things are necessary, desirable or proper (a) to vest, perfect or confirm, of record or otherwise, in the Surviving Corporation its right, title and interest in, to or under any of the rights, privileges, powers, franchises, properties or assets of either of the Constituent Corporations, or (b) otherwise to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, the Surviving 

   ##### 

  

    

Corporation and its proper officers and directors or their designees shall be
authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of either
Constituent Corporation, all such deeds, bills of sale, assignments and
assurances and to do, in the name and on behalf of either Constituent
Corporation, all such other acts and things as may be necessary, desirable or
proper to vest, perfect or confirm the Surviving Corporations right, title
and interest in, to and under any of the rights, privileges, powers,
franchises, properties or assets of such Constituent Corporation and
otherwise to carry out the purposes of this Agreement. 

  

ARTICLE 2 

   

MERGER CONSIDERATION; CONVERSION OF SECURITIES  

  

 2.1 _Merger Consideration_. The aggregate amount to be paid by Parent on the Closing Date with respect to all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company and any options or other rights to acquire any securities of the Company (including (a) the Companys Class A Common Stock, par value $.001 (the "Class A Common Stock"), (b) the Companys Class B Common Stock, par value $.001 (the "Class B Common Stock," and together with the Class A Common Stock, the "Company Common Stock"), (c) the Companys Series A Convertible Participating Preferred Stock, par value $.001 (the "Company Preferred Stock") and (d) the Company Stock Options, shall equal: (i) $285,000,000 (subject to adjustment as set forth in Section 2.8), (ii) _less_ the Indemnity Escrow Amount, (iii) _less_ the Companys Net Debt if the Companys Net Debt is a positive amount, or plus the absolute value of the Companys Net Debt if the Companys Net Debt is a negative amount, each as set forth in the CFO Certificate, (iv) less the [***], (v) _less_  the Retention Escrow Amount (the "Closing Consideration"); _provided, however_ , notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any portion of Closing Consideration payable as a result of the absolute value of the Companys Net Debt being a negative amount, the parties agree that Parent may opt to deposit all or a portion of such portion of the Closing Consideration with the Paying Agent after the Closing (instead of at the Closing), in which case Parent, subject to the following proviso, may cause the Surviving Corporation to deposit all or a portion of such amount with the Paying Agent and Parent shall deposit any remainder of such amount with the Paying Agent, in each case as soon as practicable, and in any event within one (1) Business Day, after the Closing Date,  _provided, further_ , that Parent shall not cause the Surviving Corporation to deposit with the Paying Agent any amount of cash that, after such deposit, would cause the Surviving Corporation: (i) to be unable to pay its debts (including trade debts) as they mature; (ii) to have the fair value of the Surviving Corporations liabilities exceed the fair value of its assets as a going concern; or (iii) to be left with less than a reasonable amount of capital. Such amount equal to $285,000,000 (subject to adjustment as set forth in this Section 2.1, Section 2.8 and Section 2.9), plus any Milestone Payments paid pursuant to Section 2.10, _plus_ any IDP-111 Revenue paid pursuant to Section 2.11 shall be referred to herein as the "Merger Consideration"). 

  

 2.2 _Effect on Company Capital Stock, Company Stock Options_. 

  

 (a) The Company agrees that, prior to the Effective Time, all outstanding Company Common Stock Equivalents other than Company Stock Options, shall be terminated or converted into, or exercised or exchanged for, shares of Company Common Stock. "Company Common Stock Equivalents" means options, warrants, purchase rights, subscription rights,

---|---|--- 
    ***  |   | CONFIDENTIAL PORTIONS OMITTED AND FILED SEPARATELY WITH
THE COMMISSION  
          ##### 

  

 

conversion rights, exchange rights or any other Contracts that, directly or
indirectly, could require the Company to issue, sell or otherwise cause to
become outstanding shares of Company Common Stock. "Company Stock Options"
means options to purchase shares of Company Common Stock issued pursuant to
the Companys 2001 Stock Plan (the "Company Stock Plan"). 

   

 (b) Subject to Section 2.1, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any Company Securityholder: 

   

 (i) each share of Class A Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Dissenting Shares and Treasury Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive: (A) at Closing, an amount in cash equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (1) $17,500,000 by (2) the sum of the number of issued and outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock and the number of shares of Class A Common Stock subject to vested Company Stock Option as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (after giving effect to the 50% vesting acceleration of then unvested Company Stock Options pursuant to the Company Stock Plan) (such quotient, the "Class A Fixed Closing Payment Per Share"); and (B) any amounts to be distributed with respect to such share pursuant to Section 2.3; 

  

 (ii) each share of Class B Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Dissenting Shares and Treasury Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive any amounts to be distributed with respect to such share pursuant to Section 2.3; 

  

 (iii) each share of Company Preferred Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Dissenting Shares and Treasury Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive: (A) at Closing, an amount in cash equal to $5.10345 plus the amount of the cumulated preferred dividend between July 1, 2006 and the Closing with respect to such share as provided for in the Companys certificate of incorporation; and (B) any amounts to be distributed with respect to such share pursuant to Section 2.3; 

  

 (iv) each Company Stock Option to purchase shares of Common Stock under the Company Stock Plan which is outstanding immediately prior to the Closing Date shall not be assumed by Parent and, accordingly, at the Effective Time, shall terminate and cease to be outstanding immediately upon the Effective Time in accordance with Company Stock Plan. The holders of the Company Stock Options shall cease to have any further right or entitlement to acquire shares of common stock of the Company or any shares of capital stock of Parent under their cancelled Company Stock Options. In exchange for each such cancelled Company Stock Option, the holder shall be entitled to receive: (A) in the case of Company Stock Options to purchase Class A Common Shares, at Closing, an amount in cash equal to the Class A Fixed Closing Payment Per Share multiplied by the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the cancelled Company Stock Option that were vested as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (after giving effect to the 50% vesting acceleration pursuant to the Company Stock Plan); and (B) in the case of all Company Stock Options (and in the case of Company Stock Options to purchase Class A Common Shares, in addition to the amount provided for in clause "(A)" of this sentence), any amounts to be distributed pursuant to Section 2.3 with respect 

   ##### 

  

    

to the shares underlying such Company Stock Option that were vested as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time (after giving effect to the 50%
vesting acceleration pursuant to the Company Stock Plan), provided, however,
that the aggregate exercise price payable for such vested shares shall be
deducted from the amount otherwise payable to the holder of such Company Stock
Option (it being understood that the amount to be so deducted shall not be
returned to Parent but shall remain with the Paying Agent as an amount to be
distributed by the Paying Agent in accordance with Section 2.3(g));
_provided, further, however_ , that no such payments shall be made prior to
January 1, 2009. The payments to be made in respect of Company Stock Options
shall be subject to the collection of all applicable withholding taxes, and
the amount remaining after such taxes are collected shall be paid to the
holder of the cancelled Company Stock Option; 

  

 (v) each share of Company Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock held in the Companys treasury ("Treasury Shares") immediately prior to the Effective Time and each share owned by any subsidiary of the Company shall not represent the right to receive any Merger Consideration, and each such share shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no cash, securities or other property shall be payable in respect thereof; and

 2.4 _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock or Company Stock Options_. The payment of the Merger Consideration pursuant to the terms of this ARTICLE II in respect of each share of Company Common Stock and each Company Stock Option owned by the Company Securityholders shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to each such share of Company Common Stock and each Company Stock Option, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented for transfer to the Surviving Corporation, they shall be canceled and exchanged in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Article II. 

  

 2.5 _Lost Certificates_.

 2.6 _Dissenters  Rights_.

Shares in the manner provided in the California General Corporate Law (the
"CGCL") or the DGCL ("Dissenting Shares") shall not represent the right to
receive the Merger Consideration. If any Company Stockholder shall fail to
perfect or shall effectively withdraw or lose his or her right to appraisal
and payment under the CGCL or the DGCL, as the case may be, each Company Share
held by such Company Stockholder shall thereupon, in accordance with and
subject to the provisions set forth in this Article II, represent the right
to receive the Merger Consideration and Parent shall promptly deposit such
Company Stockholders portion of the Closing Consideration with the
Paying Agent. 

   

 (b) The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any demands for appraisal received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands, and any other communications received by the Company in connection with any demands for appraisal. The Company shall not, except with the written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to any such demands. Parent shall have the right to control all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal, provided, however, that if Parent settles such demand without the consent of the Company (or the Stockholder Representative if post Closing), which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, then no Parent Indemnitee shall have a right for indemnification with respect to such demand pursuant to Section 9.2(a)(iii). 

   

 2.7 _Withholding_. Paying Agent, on behalf of Parent, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock or Dissenting Shares such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any provision of applicable Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Paying Agent or Parent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of shares of Company Common Stock or Dissenting Shares in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Paying Agent or Parent. 

  

 2.8 _Determination of Closing Working Capital_. 

  

 (a) No later than two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to Parent an estimated balance sheet as of the Closing Date, which shall include a good faith calculation of the estimated Working Capital as of the Closing Date prepared in accordance with the Working Capital Methodology applied on a basis consistent with its application in the preparation of the Balance Sheet (except as otherwise provided in the following sentence) (the "Estimated Closing Working Capital"). "Working Capital" as of any date means the amount equal to the Acquired Corporations Current Assets minus Current Liabilities. For purposes of clarity, the definition of Working Capital is after the subtraction of all cash, cash equivalents and short term investments from the balance sheet as consistent with the definition of Current Assets. 

       

 (i) If the Estimated Closing Working Capital is less than [***], the Closing Consideration shall be reduced by the difference between [***] and the Estimated Closing Working Capital.

 (ii) If the Estimated Closing Working Capital is greater than [***], the Closing Consideration shall be increased by the difference between the Estimated Closing Working Capital and [***]. 

  

 (b) Within 60 days after the Closing Date, Parent will prepare, or cause to be prepared, and deliver to the Stockholder Representative an unaudited statement (the "Closing Working Capital Statement"), which shall set forth Parents good faith calculation of Working Capital as of the Closing Date ("Closing Working Capital"). The Closing Working Capital Statement shall be prepared in accordance with Working Capital Methodology applied on a basis consistent with its application in the preparation of the Balance Sheet (except as otherwise provided in Section 2.8(a)). Parent shall make available to the Stockholder Representative or any of its agents or representatives all relevant books, records, supporting calculations and other items reasonably requested by the Stockholder Representative or any of its agents or representative. 

   

 (c) Upon receipt from Parent, the Stockholder Representative shall have 30 days to review the Closing Working Capital Statement (the "Review Period"). If the Stockholder Representative disagrees with Parents computation of Closing Working Capital, the Stockholder Representative may, on or prior to the last day of the Review Period, deliver a notice to Parent (the "Notice of Objection"), which sets forth the Stockholder Representatives objections to Parents calculation of Closing Working Capital. Any Notice of Objection shall specify those items or amounts with which the Stockholder Representative disagrees, together with a reasonably detailed written explanation of the reasons for disagreement with each such item or amount, and shall set forth the Stockholder Representatives calculation of Closing Working Capital based on such objections. To the extent Parent has not made available to the Stockholder Representative or any of its agents or representatives all relevant books, records, supporting calculations and other items reasonably requested by the Stockholder Representative or any of its agents or representative, the Notice of Objection shall specify such fact in the Notice of Objection. Promptly after receiving such Notice of Objection Parent shall make available to the Stockholder Representative items reasonably requested by the Stockholder Representative in such Notice of Objection. To the extent not set forth in the Notice of Objection, the Stockholder Representative shall be deemed, on behalf of all Company Securityholders, to have agreed with Parents calculation of all other items and amounts contained in the Closing Working Capital Statement. 

        

 (d) Unless the Stockholder Representative delivers the Notice of Objection to Parent within the Review Period, the Stockholder Representative shall be deemed, on behalf of all Company Securityholders, to have accepted Parents calculation of Closing Working Capital and the Closing Working Capital Statement shall be final, conclusive and binding. If the Stockholder Representative delivers the Notice of Objection to Parent within the Review Period, Parent and the Stockholder Representative shall, during the 30 days following such delivery or any mutually agreed extension thereof, use their commercially reasonable efforts to reach agreement on the disputed items and amounts in order to determine the amount of Closing Working Capital. If, at the end of such period or any mutually agreed extension thereof, Parent and the Stockholder Representative are unable to resolve their disagreements, they shall jointly retain and refer their disagreements to a nationally recognized independent accounting firm mutually acceptable to Parent and the Stockholder Representative (neither of which will

unreasonably withhold consent thereto) (the "Independent Expert"). Parent and
the Stockholder Representative shall instruct the Independent Expert promptly
to review this Section 2.8 and to determine solely with respect to the
disputed items and amounts so submitted whether and to what extent, if any,
the Closing Working Capital set forth in the Closing Working Capital
Statement requires adjustment. The Independent Expert shall base its
determination solely on written submissions by Parent and the Stockholder
Representative and not on an independent review. Parent and the Stockholder
Representative shall make available to the Independent Expert all
relevant books and records and other items reasonably requested by the
Independent Expert. Parent and the Stockholder Representative shall request
that the Independent Expert deliver to Parent and the Stockholder
Representative, as promptly as practicable but in no event later than 45 days
after its retention, a report which sets forth its resolution of the disputed
items and amounts and its calculation of Closing Working Capital; _provided_
, that in no event shall Closing Working Capital as determined by the
Independent Expert be less than Parents calculation of Closing Working
Capital set forth in the Closing Working Capital Statement nor more than the
Stockholder Representatives calculation of Closing Working Capital set forth
in the Notice of Objection. The decision of the Independent Expert shall be
final, conclusive and binding on the parties. The costs and expenses of the
Independent Expert shall be allocated between Parent and the Stockholder
Representative based upon the percentage which the portion of the contested
amount not awarded to each such Party bears to the amount actually contested
by such Party; provided, that the portion allocated to the Stockholder
Representative shall be recoverable only from the Escrow Fund, and the
Stockholder Representative shall not be personally liable therefor. Each of
the Parent and the Stockholder Representative agrees to execute, if requested
by the Independent Expert, a reasonable engagement letter, including
customary indemnities in favor of the Independent Expert.

payment shall be net of any expenses of the Paying Agent incurred or
reasonably expected to be incurred (as estimated in good faith by the Paying
Agent) by Parent with respect thereto.

Furthermore, each of the Company and Parent shall also, no later than seven business days after the date of this Agreement, make or cause to be made any other filings which the Parties deem to be necessary or advisable in connection with the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and which relate to any of the Antitrust Laws other than the HSR Act. Each of the Company and Parent shall furnish to each others counsel

In the event any future annual premiums exceed such maximum payment, the Surviving Corporation shall be 

    ##### 

  

 

entitled to reduce the amount of coverage to the amount of coverage that can
be obtained for a premium equal to such Maximum Amount. 

   

 (c) Parent may obtain (or Parent may cause Surviving Corporation to elect) comparable "tail" coverage with regard to any insurance policies of Company, with the amount of coverage and placement consistent with the level and scope of coverage of the current liability insurance, and such coverage cost shall be at Parents expense.

 6.6 _Employee Matters_. Following the Closing Date, Parent shall provide the employees of the Company and any Subsidiary of the Company who are employed by Parent or any Affiliate of Parent after the Closing Date ("Continuing Employees") with substantially the same benefits (other than compensation including salary, bonus and equity compensation ("Compensation"), which shall be substantially the same as such Continuing Employees Compensation immediately prior to the Effective Time) in the aggregate as those provided to similarly situated employees of Parent. For purposes of determining eligibility to participate, vesting and entitlement to benefits where length of service is relevant (including for purposes of vacation accrual) under any Parent employee benefit plan (other than a defined benefit plan) and to the extent permitted by applicable Law, Parent shall provide that the Continuing Employees shall receive service credit under each Parent employee benefit plan (other than a defined benefit plan) for their period of service with the Company prior to the Closing, except where doing so would cause a duplication of benefits. Parent shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to waive all limitations as to preexisting conditions exclusions (or actively at work or similar limitations), evidence of insurability requirements and waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to the Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents under any health and welfare plan that such employees may be eligible to participate in after the Closing Date.

If the Surviving Corporation suffers, incurs or otherwise becomes subject to any Losses as a result of or in connection with any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement, then (without limiting any of the rights of the Surviving Corporation as a Parent Indemnitee) Parent shall also be deemed, by virtue of its ownership of the stock of the Surviving Corporation, to have incurred Losses as a result of and in connection with such inaccuracy or breach. 

   

 (c) Except as provided in Section 9.3(d), the Parent Indemnitees rights pursuant to this Article IX, and their recourse to the Indemnity Escrow Fund [***], shall be the sole and exclusive recourse and remedies for Losses available to Parent Indemnitees for any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement or certificate or other document furnished or to be furnished to Parent in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ that [***]. 

   

 (d) Nothing contained in this Article IX shall be deemed to limit or restrict in any manner any rights or remedies which the Parent Indemnitees have, or might have, at Law, in equity or otherwise, based on (i) fraud (or, to the extent California law is applicable, actual fraud with intent to deceive, or to induce a party to enter into this Agreement) in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby or (ii) any breach by a Company Securityholder of any representation and warranty and covenant or agreement contained in any other agreement entered into by such Company Securityholder with or the benefit of Parent in connection with the Merger. 

   

 9.4 _Indemnification Claims; Indemnity Escrow Arrangements_. 

  

 (a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein (but subject to Section 9.3(d)), no Parent Indemnitee shall be entitled to indemnification under this Article IX (or to exercise its rights of setoff pursuant to Section 2.10(f) or 2.11(f)) unless it has duly delivered a written notice to the Stockholder Representative and the Escrow Agent (any such notice being referred to as a "Notice of Claim," and the claim for indemnification described in such Notice of Claim being referred to as an "Indemnification Claim") before the end of the Applicable Survival Period (in the case of claims based on the Companys Representations), setting forth: (i) the subsection of Section 9.2(a) such claim is based upon and, if based upon Section 9.2(a)(i), the specific representation and warranty of the Company alleged to have been inaccurate, and, if based upon Section 9.2(a)(ii), the specific covenant or agreement alleged to have been breached; (ii) a detailed description of the facts and circumstances giving rise to the indemnification obligation; (iii) the aggregate dollar amount of the Losses that have been incurred by such Parent Indemnitee or if unknown a good faith estimate of such Losses (the aggregate amount of such estimate being referred to as the "Claimed Amount"); and (iv) in the event of a Third Party

Claim, a copy of such Third Party Claim (if available) and a description of
the basis for such Third Party Claim. 

   

 (b) During the 30-Business Day period commencing upon the receipt by the Stockholder Representative of a Notice of Claim, the Stockholder Representative may deliver to the Parent Indemnitee and the Escrow Agent (if funds are then still held in the Indemnity Escrow Fund) a written response (the "Response Notice") in which the Stockholder Representative: (i) agrees that the full Claimed Amount is owed to such Parent Indemnitee; (ii) agrees that part (but not all) of the Claimed Amount (the "Agreed Amount") is owed to such Parent Indemnitee; or (iii) asserts that no part of the Claimed Amount is owed to such Parent Indemnitee. Any part of the Claimed Amount that is not agreed by the Stockholder Representative to be owed to such Parent Indemnitee pursuant to the Response Notice (or the entire Claimed Amount, if the Stockholder Representative asserts in the Response Notice that no part of the Claimed Amount is owed to such Parent Indemnitee) shall be referred to as the "Contested Amount." If no Response Notice is delivered during such 30-Business Day period, then, for purposes of this Agreement, the Stockholder Representative shall be deemed to have agreed that the full Claimed Amount is owed to such Parent Indemnitee. 

   

 (c) If the Stockholder Representative delivers a Response Notice to a Parent Indemnitee agreeing that the full Claimed Amount is owed to such Parent Indemnitee, then [***], within three Business Days following the receipt of such Response Notice by such Parent Indemnitee, Parent and the Stockholder Representative shall jointly execute and deliver to the Escrow Agent a written notice instructing the Escrow Agent to release the full Claimed Amount (or such lesser amount as may remain in the Indemnity Escrow Fund) to such Parent Indemnitee from the Indemnity Escrow Fund. 

   

 (d) If the Stockholder Representative delivers a Response Notice to the Parent Indemnitee agreeing that less than the full Claimed Amount is owed to such Parent Indemnitee, then [***], within three Business Days following the receipt of such Response Notice by such Parent Indemnitee, the Parent and the Stockholder Representative shall jointly execute and deliver to the Escrow Agent a written notice instructing the Escrow Agent to release the Agreed Amount (or such lesser amount as may remain in the Indemnity Escrow Fund) to such Parent Indemnitee from the Indemnity Escrow Fund. 

   

 (e) If the Stockholder Representative delivers a Response Notice to a Parent Indemnitee indicating that there is a Contested Amount, the Stockholder Representative and such Parent Indemnitee shall attempt in good faith to resolve the dispute related to the Contested Amount. If such Parent Indemnitee and the Stockholder Representative resolve such dispute in writing, then a settlement agreement stipulating the amount owed to such Parent Indemnitee (the "Stipulated Amount") shall be signed by such Parent Indemnitee and the Stockholder Representative. Within three Business Days after the execution of such settlement agreement, [***],

Parent and the Stockholder Representative shall jointly execute and deliver to
the Escrow Agent a written notice instructing the Escrow Agent to release the
Stipulated Amount (or such lesser amount as may remain in the Indemnity
Escrow Fund) to such Parent Indemnitee from the Indemnity Escrow Fund. 

   

 (f) If the Stockholder Representative and Parent Indemnitee are unable to resolve the dispute relating to any Contested Amount during the 30-day period commencing upon the receipt of the Response Notice by the Parent Indemnitee, then either the Parent Indemnitee or the Stockholder Representative may submit the contested portion of the indemnification claim to binding arbitration in Santa Clara County, California in accordance with the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures then in effect. Arbitration will be conducted by one arbitrator, mutually selected by Parent and the Stockholder Representative; _provided, however_ , that if Parent and the Stockholder Representative fail to mutually select an arbitrator within 15 Business Days after the contested portion of the indemnification claim is submitted to arbitration, then the arbitrator shall be selected by JAMS in accordance with its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures then in effect. The arbitrator may take into account interest and a partys efforts to mitigate Losses in calculating Losses. The parties agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the arbitration hearing to be conducted within 75 days after the appointment of the arbitrator, and to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the decision of the arbitrator to be furnished within 15 days after the conclusion of the arbitration hearing. The parties shall be entitled to only limited discovery at the discretion of the arbitrator, and agree that any discovery shall be completed at least 10 days prior to the commencement of the arbitration hearing. The decision of the arbitrator shall relate solely: (i) to whether the Parent Indemnitee is entitled to recover the Contested Amount (or a portion thereof), and the portion of such Contested Amount the Parent Indemnitee is entitled to recover; and (ii) to the determination of whether the Parent Indemnitee is the prevailing party as provided below. The final decision of the arbitrator shall be furnished to the Stockholder Representative, the Parent Indemnitee, the Parent (if different then the Parent Indemnitee) and the Escrow Agent in writing, shall constitute a conclusive determination of the issues in question, binding upon the Stockholder Representative, the Company Securityholders (other than holders of Dissenting Shares) and all the Parent Indemnitees and shall not be contested by any of them. If the Parent Indemnitee is determined by the arbitrator to be the prevailing party, then the aggregate dollar amount of the arbitrators award to the Parent Indemnitee shall be increased by the amount of the reasonable expenses (including attorneys fees) of the Parent Indemnitee, and the fees and expenses associated with the arbitration (including the arbitrators fees and expenses). If the Parent Indemnitee is determined by the arbitrator not to be the prevailing party and the arbitrator determines that the Stockholder Representative is the prevailing party, then any amount awarded by the arbitrator to the Parent Indemnitee shall be reduced by the amount of the reasonable expenses (including attorneys fees) of the Stockholder Representative, and the fees and expenses associated with the arbitration (including the arbitrators fees and expenses), and if no amount is awarded to the Parent Indemnitee, the Parent Indemnitee shall reimburse the Stockholder Representative for its reasonable expenses (including attorneys fees) and pay the fees and expenses associated with the arbitration (including the arbitrators fees and expenses). The final decision of the arbitrator shall include the total dollar amount of the award to the Parent Indemnitee or to the Securityholders, if any (the "Award Amount"), and shall be furnished to the Stockholder Representative and the Parent Indemnitee in writing. Within three Business Days following the receipt of the final award of the arbitrator setting forth the Award Amount, 

    ##### 

  

    

(i) if the Award Amount is to be paid to the Parent Indemnitee, then [***],
Parent and the Stockholder Representative shall jointly execute and deliver
to the Escrow Agent a written notice instructing the Escrow Agent to release
the Award Amount (or such lesser amount as may remain in the Indemnity Escrow
Fund) to the Parent Indemnitee or (ii) if the Award Amount is to be paid
to the Company Securityholders, Parent and the Stockholder Representative
shall jointly execute and deliver to the Escrow Agent a written notice
instructing the Escrow Agent to release the Award Amount (or such lesser
amount as may remain in the Indemnity Escrow Fund) from the Indemnity Escrow
Fund to the Paying Agent. 

   

 (g) If the aggregate amount remaining in the Indemnity Escrow Fund, including any interest accrued or income otherwise earned thereon, as of the eighteen-month anniversary of the Closing (the "Aggregate Escrow Balance") exceeds the aggregate dollar amount, as of the eighteen-month anniversary of the Closing, of the Contested Amounts associated with all indemnification claims that have not been finally resolved and paid prior to such date in accordance with this Section 9.4 (each, an "Unresolved Escrow Claim", and the aggregate dollar amount of such Contested Amounts as of the eighteen-month anniversary of the Closing being referred to as the "Aggregate Pending Claim Amount"), then the Parent and the Stockholder Representative shall jointly execute and deliver to the Escrow Agent a written notice instructing the Escrow Agent to release the Aggregate Distribution Amount to the Paying Agent from the Indemnity Escrow Fund For purposes of this Section 9.4, the "Aggregate Distribution Amount" shall be the Aggregate Escrow Balance as of the Survival Termination Date _minus_ the Aggregate Pending Claim Amount. 

   

 (h) Following the eighteen-month anniversary of the Closing, if an Unresolved Escrow Claim is finally resolved, Parent and the Stockholder Representative shall jointly execute and deliver to the Escrow Agent, within three Business Days after the final resolution of such Unresolved Escrow Claim, a written notice instructing the Escrow Agent to release the Excess Escrow Amount to the Paying Agent. For purposes of this Section 9.4(h), the "Excess Escrow Amount" shall mean the amount (if any) by which the aggregate amount remaining in the Indemnity Escrow Fund, including any interest accrued or income otherwise earned thereon, as of the date of resolution of such Unresolved Escrow Claim exceeds the aggregate amount of the Contested Amounts associated with all other remaining Unresolved Escrow Claims. 

   

 9.5 _Third Party Claims_. 

  

 (a) Promptly following the receipt by a Parent Indemnitee of notice of the assertion of any claim or the commencement of any Action by a third party in respect of which indemnity may be sought under the provisions of this Article IX ("Third Party Claim"), Parent shall provide a Notice of Claim with respect to such Third Party Claim to the Stockholder Representative and a duplicate copy of such Notice of Claim to the Escrow Agent. Subject to Section 9.4(a), failure or delay in notifying the Stockholder Representative will not relieve the Company Securityholders of any liability they may have to the Parent Indemnitee, except to the

extent that such failure or delay causes actual harm to the Company
Securityholders with respect to such Third Party Claim. 

   

 (b) Subject to the further provisions of this Section 9.4, the Stockholder Representative will have 10 Business Days (or less if the nature of the Third Party Claim requires and such necessary shortened deadline is specified in the Notice of Claim) from the date on which the Stockholder Representative received the Notice of Claim to notify the Parent Indemnitee that the Stockholder Representative will assume the defense or prosecution of such Third Party Claim and any litigation resulting therefrom with counsel of its choice (reasonably satisfactory to the Parent Indemnitee) and at its sole cost and expense (a "Third Party Defense"). Except to the extent the Parent Indemnitee and the Stockholder Representative agree in writing otherwise, if the Stockholder Representative assumes the Third Party Defense in accordance with the preceding sentence, the Indemnitors shall be conclusively deemed to have acknowledged that the Third Party Claim is within the scope of their indemnity obligation hereunder and shall hold the Parent Indemnitee harmless from and against the full amount of any Losses resulting therefrom (subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement). Any Parent Indemnitee shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any such Action and to participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall not be at the expense of the Company Securityholders unless (A) the Stockholder Representative shall have failed, within the time after having been notified by the Parent Indemnitee of the existence of the Third Party Claim as provided in the first sentence of this paragraph (b), to assume the defense of such Third Party Claim, or (ii) the employment of such counsel has been specifically authorized in writing by the Stockholder Representative. 

   

 (c) The Stockholder Representative will not be entitled to assume the Third Party Defense if: 

   

 (i) a Third Party Claim seeks, in addition to or in lieu of monetary damages, any injunctive or other equitable relief (except where non-monetary relief is merely incidental to a primary claim or claims for monetary damages); 

  

 (ii) the claim for indemnification relates to or arises in connection with any criminal proceeding, action, indictment, allegation or investigation; 

  

 (iii) the claim for indemnification relates to or arises in connection with any Environmental Action or any Taxes; 

  

 (iv) under applicable standards of professional conduct, a conflict on any significant issue exists between the Parent Indemnitee and the Stockholder Representative in respect of such Third Party Claim; 

  

 (v) the Third Party Claim involves a customer or supplier of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; 

  

 (vi) the Parent Indemnitee reasonably believes an adverse determination with respect to the Third Party Claim would be detrimental to or injure the Parent Indemnitees reputation or future business prospects; 

   ##### 

  

  

 (vii) upon petition by the Parent Indemnitee, the appropriate court rules that the Stockholder Representative failed or is failing to vigorously prosecute or defend such Third Party Claim; or 

  

 (viii) the amount of claimed Losses subject to all outstanding Notices of Claim exceeds the value of the Indemnity Escrow Fund. 

  

 (d) If the Stockholder Representative assumes a Third Party Defense, it will take all steps necessary in the defense, prosecution, or settlement of such claim or litigation and the Company Securityholders shall reimburse the Parent Indemnitees promptly for any and all Losses caused by or arising out of such Third Party Claim (subject to the last sentence of Section 9.5(b)). The Stockholder Representative will not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement except with the written consent of the Parent Indemnitee (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed); provided, however, the consent of the Parent Indemnitee shall not be required if all of the following conditions are met: (i) the terms of the judgment or proposed settlement include as an unconditional term thereof the giving to the Parent Indemnitee by the third party of a release of the Parent Indemnitee from all liability in respect of such Third Party Claim; (ii) there is no finding or admission of (A) any violation of Law by the Parent Indemnitee (or any Affiliate thereof), and (B) any violation of the rights of any Person; (iii) there is no effect on any other Action or claims of a similar nature that may be made against the Parent Indemnitee (or any Affiliate thereof); and (iv) the sole form of relief is monetary damages which are paid in full by the Stockholder Representative. The Stockholder Representative shall conduct the defense of the Third Party Claim actively and diligently, and the Parent Indemnitee will provide reasonable cooperation in the defense of the Third Party Claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parent Indemnitee shall have the right to pay or settle any Third Party Claim,  _provided_ that in such event, subject to the following sentence, it shall waive any right to indemnity therefor by the Company Securityholders for such claim unless the Stockholder Representative shall have consented to such payment or settlement (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed). 

   

 (e) In the event that (i) a Parent Indemnitee gives Notice of Claim to the Stockholder Representative and the Stockholder Representative fails or elects not to assume a Third Party Defense which the Stockholder Representative had the right to assume under this Section 9.4 or (ii) the Stockholder Representative is not entitled to assume the Third Party Defense pursuant to this Section 9.4, the Parent Indemnitee shall have the right, with counsel of its choice, to defend, conduct and control the Third Party Defense, at the sole cost and expense of the Company Securityholders. In each case, the Parent Indemnitee shall conduct the Third Party Defense actively and diligently, and the Stockholder Representative will provide reasonable cooperation in the Third Party Defense and use his commercially reasonable efforts to cause the former Company Securityholders to cooperate in the Third Party Defense. The Parent Indemnitee shall have the right to consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to the Third Party Claim on such terms as it may deem appropriate; _provided, however_ , that the amount of any settlement made or entry of any judgment consented to by the Parent Indemnitee without the consent of the Stockholder Representative shall not be determinative of the validity of the claim against the Indemnity Escrow Fund, except with the consent of the Stockholder Representative (which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). Notwithstanding Section 10.5 hereof, in connection with any Third Party Claim, the 

    ##### 

  

 

Stockholder Representative hereby consents to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of
any court in which an Action in respect of a Third Party Claim is brought
against any Parent Indemnitee for purposes of any claim that a Parent
Indemnitee may have under this Article IX with respect to such Action or the
matters alleged therein and agrees that process may be served on the
Stockholder Representative with respect to such a claim anywhere in the
world. If the Stockholder Representative does not elect to assume a Third
Party Defense which it has the right to assume hereunder, the Parent
Indemnitee shall have no obligation to do so. 

   

 9.6 _Non-Third Party Claims_. Parent will send a Notice of Claim to the Stockholder Representative promptly following discovery by any Parent Indemnitee of any matter that gives rise to a claim of indemnity pursuant hereto and that does not involve a Third Party Claim being asserted against it. Concurrently therewith Parent shall send a duplicate copy of such Notice of Claim to the Escrow Agent. Subject to Section 9.4(a), failure or delay in notifying the Stockholder Representative will not relieve the Company Securityholders of any liability they may have to the Parent Indemnitee, except and only to the extent that such failure or delay causes harm to the Company Securityholders with respect to such claim. The Stockholder Representative will reasonably cooperate and assist the Parent Indemnitee in determining the validity of the claim for indemnity. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to prevent a Parent Indemnitee from making a claim hereunder for potential or contingent claims or demands that may be made by a third party;  _provided_ , that the Notice of Claim sets forth the specific basis for any such contingent claim to the extent then feasible and the Parent Indemnitee has reasonable grounds to believe that it is more likely than not that such a claim will be made by a third party and Parent has established a reserve for such a claim on its financial statements in accordance with GAAP; _provided, further_  that with respect to any such claim made either after the date that is eighteen (18) months following the Closing Date [***], Parent may cause a portion of [***] equal or up to the Claimed Amount with respect thereto to be placed in a separate escrow account, established and paid for by Parent with the Escrow Agent, which shall remain available to indemnify Parent for such Losses until the resolution of such Indemnification Claim pursuant to the procedures set forth herein;  _provided, further_ that, for the avoidance of doubt, no Parent Indemnitee will be entitled to receive an indemnification payment (or exercise a right of setoff) pursuant to Section 9.4 with respect to Losses for matters specified in such a Notice of Claim unless and until it actually incurs such Losses. 

  

 9.7 _Effect of Investigation; Waiver_. 

  

 (a) A Parent Indemnitees right to indemnification or other remedies based upon the representations and warranties and covenants and agreements of the Company will not be affected by any investigation, knowledge or waiver of any condition by the Parent Indemnitee. Such representations and warranties and covenants and agreements shall not be affected or deemed waived by reason of the fact that the Parent Indemnitee knew or should have known that any representation or warranty might be inaccurate or that the Company failed to comply with any agreement or covenant. Any investigation by such party shall be for its own protection only and shall not affect or impair any right or remedy hereunder.

 (b) The waiver by any Parent Indemnitee of any condition based on the accuracy of any representation or warranty, or compliance with any covenant or agreement, will not affect any right to indemnification or other remedy based on such representations and warranties and covenants and agreements unless otherwise expressly agreed in writing by the Parent Indemnitee. 

   

 (c) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall use commercially reasonable efforts to seek, and shall cause each of their respective affiliates to use commercially reasonable efforts to seek, full recovery under all insurance policies covering any Losses to the same extent they would if such Losses were not subject to indemnification under this Agreement. In the event that an insurance recovery is made by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any Parent Indemnitee with respect to any Losses for which Parent has previously been indemnified under this Agreement, then a refund equal to the aggregate amount of any recovery (less any expenses incurred in obtaining such recovery) shall be made promptly to the Company Securityholders on a pro rata basis based on their respective Company Securityholders Escrow Participation Percentages.
