receive the Merger Consideration provided in Section&nbsp;1.9(b)
hereof unless and until such holder fails to perfect or

5.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>JOINT PROXY STATEMENT/
PROSPECTUS; REGISTRATION STATEMENT; OTHER.</I> As promptly as
practicable after the execution of this Agreement, EPIX and
Predix will cooperate to prepare and file the Joint Proxy
Statement with the SEC, and EPIX will prepare and file with the
SEC the Registration Statement in which the Joint Proxy
Statement will be included as a prospectus. Each of EPIX and
Predix will respond to any comments of the SEC and will use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Registration
Statement to be declared effective under the Securities Act as
promptly as practicable after such filing and will cause the
Joint Proxy Statement to be mailed to its stockholders at the
earliest practicable time. As promptly as practicable after the
execution of this Agreement, EPIX and Predix will prepare and
file any other filings required under the Exchange Act, the
Securities Act or any other federal or state securities laws
relating to the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (collectively, the <B>&#147;Other Filings&#148;</B>).
Predix will cooperate with all reasonable requests of EPIX in
connection with the preparation, filing and response to comments
on the Registration Statement, Joint Proxy Statement and Other
Filings. Each party will notify the other party promptly upon
the receipt of any comments from the SEC or its staff and of any
request by the SEC or its staff or any other governmental
officials for amendments or supplements to the Registration
Statement, the Joint Proxy Statement or any Other Filing or for
additional information and will supply the other party with
copies of all correspondence between such party or any of its
representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, or its staff or
other government officials, on the other hand, with respect to
the Registration Statement, the Joint Proxy Statement, the
Merger or any Other Filing. The Joint Proxy Statement, the
Registration Statement and the Other Filings will comply in all
material respects with all applicable requirements of law and
the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. Whenever any
event occurs which is required to be set forth in an amendment
or supplement to the Joint Proxy Statement, the Registration

be, will promptly inform the other party of such occurrence and
cooperate in filing with the SEC or its staff or any other
government officials, and/or mailing to stockholders of EPIX and
Predix, such amendment or supplement. The Joint Proxy Statement
will also include the recommendations of (i)&nbsp;the Board of
Directors of EPIX in favor of approval of this Agreement, the
Merger and the issuance of shares of EPIX Common Stock in the
Merger (except that the Board of Directors of EPIX may withdraw,
modify or refrain from making such recommendation if the EPIX
Board of Directors reasonably concludes in good faith, after
having received the advice of its outside legal counsel, that
not taking such actions would be inconsistent with the Board of
Directors&#146; fiduciary duties under applicable law) and
(ii)&nbsp;the Board of Directors of Predix in favor of approval
of this Agreement and the Merger, provided, however, that the
Board of Directors of Predix may withdraw, modify or refrain
from making such recommendation only if: (1)&nbsp;Predix has
received an unsolicited bona fide written Predix Superior Offer,
(2)&nbsp;Predix has notified EPIX, at least seven (7)&nbsp;days
in advance of the date upon which it intends to withdraw or
effect a change in its recommendation to Predix&#146;s
stockholders specifying the material terms and conditions of
such Predix Superior Offer and furnishing to EPIX complete and
unredacted copies of any relevant proposed transaction term
sheets, letters of intent or agreements with the party making
such Predix Superior Offer and any other material documents
received by it or its representatives, (3)&nbsp;Predix, prior to
effecting such a withdrawal or change in recommendation, has
negotiated, and has caused its financial and legal advisors to
negotiate with EPIX i n good faith for ten (10)&nbsp;days to
make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this
Agreement such that such Predix Superior Offer would no longer
constitute a Predix Superior Offer, (4)&nbsp;Predix&#146;s Board
of Directors has considered such adjustments in the terms and
conditions of this Agreement resulting from such negotiations,
and has concluded in good faith, based upon consultation with
its financial advisors and with Predix&#146;s outside legal
counsel, that such proposal for a Predix Superior Offer remains
a Predix Superior Offer even after giving effect to the
adjustments proposed during such negotiations with EPIX, and
(5)&nbsp;the Predix Board of Directors reasonably concludes in
good faith, after having received the advice of its outside
legal counsel, that taking such actions is required in order for
the Board of Directors of Predix to comply with its fiduciary
obligations to Predix&#146;s stockholders under applicable law.

applicable contract or agreement as in effect on the date hereof

suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before or
after the Effective Time) and subject to the specific terms of
any indemnification contract, (i)&nbsp;any counsel retained by
the Indemnified Parties for any period after the Effective Time

defense of any such matter; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>,
that the Surviving Corporation will not be liable for any
settlement effected without its prior written consent (which
consent will not be unreasonably withheld); and <U>provided</U>,
<U>further</U>, that, in the event that any claim or claims for
indemnification are asserted or made within such six-year
period, all rights to indemnification in respect of any such
claim or claims will continue until the disposition of any and
all such claims. The Indemnified Parties as a group may retain
only one law firm to represent them in each applicable
jurisdiction with respect to any single action unless there is,
under applicable standards of professional conduct, a conflict
on any significant issue between the positions of any two or
more Indemnified Parties, in which case each Indemnified Party
which respect to whom such a conflict exists (or group of such
Indemnified Parties who among them have no such conflict) may
retain one separate law firm in each applicable jurisdiction.
