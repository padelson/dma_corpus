  1.5. _DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS._  The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial directors of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, and the officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation, in each case until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified. 

  

  

    

  1.6. _CONVERSION OF MERGER SUB COMMON STOCK._ Each of the shares of the common stock, par value $.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall become shares of the Surviving Corporation after the Merger and shall thereafter constitute all of the issued and outstanding shares of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

  

    

  1.7. _EFFECT ON CAPITAL STOCK._ At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and pursuant to the terms provided herein, and without any action on the part of EPIX, Predix or the holders of any of the following securities except as provided herein: 

  

        |   
---|--- 
      |   (a) _ _Conversion of Predix Shares_._ Every Share  (as
defined in Section 1.17) issued and outstanding  immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than the  Dissenting Shares as defined in Section 1.14)
shall be  automatically converted into the right to receive  1.248509 shares
(the "Exchange Ratio") of  validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable EPIX
Common Stock  (the "Initial Merger Consideration").  
      
      |   (b) _ _Cancellation_._ Each Share held in the  treasury
of Predix and each Share owned by EPIX or by any direct  or indirect wholly-
owned subsidiary of Predix or EPIX  immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall, by virtue of the  Merger and without any action on the part of the
holder thereof,  cease to be outstanding, be canceled and retired without

---|--- 
      |   Physiome Sciences, Inc. 1997 Stock Option Plan (the 
"Physiome 1997 Stock Option Plan," together  with the Predix 2003 Stock Plan,
the "Predix Stock  Plans") shall be assumed by EPIX in accordance with 
Section 5.5.  
      
      |   (d) _ _Warrants_._ All warrants outstanding at the

Agreement, (i) Predix grants additional options to purchase  Predix Common
Stock pursuant to Section 4.1(c) or  (ii) EPIX issues additional shares of
EPIX Common Stock  before the Effective Time, the Exchange Ratio shall be
adjusted  to reflect fully the effect of the issuance of any such options 
to purchase Predix Common Stock or additional shares of EPIX  Common Stock,
as the case may be. The Exchange Ratio shall be  adjusted to reflect fully
the effect of any stock split, reverse  split, stock dividend (including any
dividend or distribution of  securities convertible into EPIX Common Stock or
Shares),  reorganization, recapitalization or other like change with 
respect to EPIX Common Stock or Shares occurring after the date  hereof and
prior to the Effective Time. For the avoidance of  doubt, the Exchange Ratio
shall equal the quotient of  (i) the sum of (A) the number of outstanding
shares of  EPIX Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time 
divided by .5001 minus (B) the number of outstanding shares  of EPIX Common
Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time,  divided by (ii) the number of
outstanding Shares and shares  of Predix Common Stock or Predix Preferred
Stock reserved for  issuance upon the exercise of outstanding warrants and
options,  in each case, as of immediately prior to the Effective Time.  
      
      |   (f) _ _Fractional Shares_._ No fraction of a share  of
EPIX Common Stock will be issued, but in lieu thereof each  holder of Predix
Common Stock and Predix Preferred Stock who  would otherwise be entitled to a
fraction of a share of EPIX  Common Stock (after aggregating all fractional
shares of EPIX  Common Stock to be received by such holder) shall receive
from  EPIX an amount of cash (rounded to the nearest whole cent),  without
interest, equal to the product of (i) such  fraction, multiplied by (ii) the
applicable price per share  calculated in accordance with Section 1.7(a)
based on the  average closing price of a share of EPIX Common Stock on The 
NASDAQ National Market (the "NASDAQ") over the  five (5) trading days ending
on the trading day prior to  the Effective Time.  
      
      |   (g) _ _Limitations_._ Notwithstanding anything 
contained in this Section 1.7, the aggregate number of  shares of EPIX Common
Stock issuable under this Section 1.7  (as a result of the conversion of the
Shares and the exercise of  the options and warrants, if any, to purchase
Predix Common  Stock or Predix Preferred Stock assumed by EPIX) shall in no 
event exceed forty-nine and ninety-nine hundredths percent  (49.99%) of the
outstanding shares of EPIX Common Stock  immediately after the Effective
Time.  
    

  

    

  1.8. _MILESTONE PAYMENT._ In addition to the shares of EPIX Common Stock to be issued pursuant to Section 1.7(a) hereof, EPIX shall make a milestone payment (the "Milestone Payment," together with the Initial Merger Consideration, the "Merger Consideration") as follows:

Payment may be deferred in accordance with  paragraph (d)(ii) below.  ##### Table of Contents

      |   (c) _ _Achievement of the Milestone_._ For  purposes of
this Agreement, the term "Achievement of the  Milestone" shall mean EPIXs

Effective Time by EPIX with at  least 60 patients.  
    

        |   
---|--- 
      |   The term "Positive Data" shall mean that  PRX-00023,

question as set forth  in the applicable protocols of such clinical trial.  
    

        |   
---|--- 
      |   (ii) Predix or the Surviving Corporation, entering into
a  strategic partnership for any drug candidate discovered or to be

the Surviving  Corporations existing or planned research and development 
programs as of the Effective Time and reflected in Predixs  2006 operating
plan and budget provided to EPIX or the 2007  operating plan and budget

        |   
---|--- 
      |   (d) _ _Form and Value of Payment_._ The Milestone 
Payment shall be paid at the option of EPIX (determined in  accordance with
Section 5.16), either:  
    

        |   
---|--- 
      |   (i) in cash, additional shares of validly issued, fully 
paid and non-assessable EPIX Common Stock or any combination  thereof. The
number of shares of EPIX Common Stock, if any, to  be issued in connection
with this option shall equal  (i) the amount of the Milestone Payment EPIX
determines to  pay in shares of EPIX Common Stock, divided by (ii) the 
amount that is equal to the average closing price of a share of  EPIX Common

therafter  (the "Deferred Payment Date") in accordance  with Section 1.8(e) ##### Table of Contents

  

        |   
---|--- 
      |   Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Milestone Payment paid
to  each holder of an option or warrant to purchase Predix Common  Stock or
Predix Preferred Stock at the Effective Time shall be  made solely in cash
and, _provided_ , further that EPIX will  not issue fractional shares of EPIX
Common Stock pursuant to  this Section 1.8, but will pay cash in lieu
thereof.  
      
      |   (e) _ _Deferred Payment_._ In the event that EPIX 
elects to pay the Milestone Payment pursuant to  Section 1.8(d)(ii) above,
the Deferred Amount shall be paid  in shares of validly issued, fully paid
and non-assessable EPIX  Common Stock to the fullest extent permissible
under  Section 1.8(f) below, with any remaining balance paid in  cash plus
interest on such cash amount at an annual rate (using  a 360-day year) of ten
percent (10%) calculated from the  Milestone Payment Date. The number of
shares of EPIX Common  Stock to be issued in connection with this Section
1.8(e)  shall equal (i) the Deferred Amount, divided by  (ii) seventy-five
percent (75%) of the amount that is equal  to the average closing price of a
share of EPIX Common Stock on  the NASDAQ over the thirty (30) trading days
ending on the  trading day that is ten (10) days prior to the Deferred 
Payment Date.  
      
      |   (f) _ _Limitations_._ Notwithstanding anything  else
contained herein, in no event shall the aggregate number of  shares of EPIX
Common Stock that may be issued pursuant to this  Section 1.8, when combined
with the aggregate Initial  Merger Consideration and shares of EPIX Common
Stock issued or  issuable as a result of the exercise of the options and 
warrants, if any, to purchase Predix Common Stock or Predix  Preferred Stock
assumed by EPIX, exceed forty-nine and  ninety-nine hundredths percent
(49.99%) of the outstanding  shares of EPIX Common Stock immediately after
such issuance.  
      
      |   (g) _ _Allocation of Milestone Payment_._ The 
Milestone Payment shall be allocated and paid to each holder of  record at
the Effective Time of a Share, Predix Warrant or an  option to purchase
Predix Common Stock, in each case, pro rata  based upon the percentage of the
Initial Merger Consideration  that such holder would have received pursuant
to  Section 1.7(a), assuming that for these purposes that each  Predix
Warrant and option to purchase Predix Common Stock or  Predix Preferred Stock
(whether or not vested) was exercised in  full immediately prior to the
Effective Time.  
    

  

    

  1.9. _EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES._  

  

  (a) _ _Exchange Agent_._ EPIX shall make available or cause to be made available, to or for the account of a bank or trust company designated by EPIX (the "Exchange Agent"), in trust for the benefit of the holders of Predix Common Stock and Predix Preferred Stock, for exchange in accordance with Section 1.7 and this Section 1.9, through the Exchange Agent, (i) certificates evidencing the EPIX Common Stock issuable pursuant to this Agreement in exchange for outstanding Shares, and (ii) an amount of cash sufficient to permit the Exchange Agent to make necessary payments of cash in lieu of fractional shares of EPIX Common Stock in accordance with Section 1.7(f). 

  

  (b) _ _Exchange Procedures_._ As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, EPIX will instruct the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time evidenced outstanding Shares (the "Certificates") (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as EPIX may reasonably specify after review by Predix) and (ii) instructions to effect the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the certificates evidencing shares of EPIX Common Stock and, in lieu of any fractional shares thereof, cash. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other customary documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefore: (A) certificates evidencing that number of whole shares of EPIX Common Stock which such holder has the right to receive in accordance with the Exchange Ratio, in respect of the Shares formerly evidenced by such Certificate, (B) the Milestone Payment, (C) any dividends or other distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 1.7(e), and (D) cash in lieu of fractional shares of EPIX Common Stock to which such holder is  ##### Table of Contents

  

 entitled pursuant to Section 1.7(f), and the Certificate so surrendered
shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of
Shares which are not registered in the transfer records of Predix as of the
Effective Time, EPIX Common Stock and cash may be issued and paid in
accordance with this Article I to a transferee if the Certificate
evidencing such Shares are presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied
by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer pursuant to
this Section 1.9(b) and by evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes
have been paid. Until so surrendered, each outstanding Certificate that,
prior to the Effective Time, represented Shares will be deemed from and
after the Effective Time, for all corporate purposes, other than the payment
of dividends, if any, to evidence the right to receive the number of full
shares of EPIX Common Stock into which such Shares shall have been so
converted, the right to receive the Milestone Payment and the right to
receive an amount in cash in lieu of the issuance of any fractional shares in
accordance with Section 1.7. 

  

  (c) _ _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_._ No dividends or other distributions declared or made after the Effective Time, with respect to EPIX Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time, shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate until the holder of such Certificate shall surrender such Certificate. Subject to applicable law, following surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be paid to the record holder of the certificates representing whole shares of EPIX Common Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest, at the time of such surrender, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of EPIX Common Stock.

The Indemnified Parties as a group may retain only one law firm to represent them in each applicable jurisdiction with respect to any single action unless there is, under applicable standards of professional conduct, a conflict on any significant issue between the positions of any two or more Indemnified Parties, in which case each Indemnified Party which respect to whom such a conflict exists (or group of such Indemnified Parties who among them have no such conflict) may retain one separate law firm in each applicable jurisdiction.

  (c) If EPIX delays or suspends the S-3 Registration Statement or requires the Affiliate Stockholders to cease sales of shares pursuant to Section 5.18(b) above, EPIX shall, as promptly as practicable (and in any event within four (4) business days) following the termination of the circumstance which entitled EPIX to do so, take such actions as may be necessary to file or reinstate the effectiveness of the S-3 Registration Statement and/or give written notice to all Affiliate Stockholders authorizing them to resume sales pursuant to the S-3 Registration Statement. If as a result thereof the prospectus included in the S-3 Registration Statement has been amended to comply with the requirements of the Securities Act, EPIX shall enclose such revised prospectus with the notice to Affiliate Stockholders given pursuant to this Section 5.18(c), and the Affiliate Stockholders shall make no offers or sales of shares pursuant to the S-3 Registration Statement other than by means of such revised prospectus. 

  

  

    

  5.19. _ACCOUNTANT S LETTERS._ Each of EPIX and Predix shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause to be delivered to the other party a "comfort" letter of Ernst and Young LLP dated within two (2) business days before the date on which the Registration Statement shall become effective and addressed to such other party, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to such other party.

  8.5. _WAIVER._ At any time prior to the Effective Time, any party hereto may, with respect to any other party hereto, (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein. Any such extension or waiver shall be valid if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by the party or parties to be bound. 

  

  

    

  8.6. _HEADINGS._ The headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. 

  

  

    

  8.7. _SEVERABILITY._ If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law, or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent possible. 

  

  

    

  8.8. _ENTIRE AGREEMENT._ This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement and supersedes all prior agreements and undertakings (other than the Confidentiality Agreement), both written and oral, among the parties, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof and, except as otherwise expressly provided herein, are not intended to confer upon any other person any rights or remedies hereunder. 

  

  

    

  8.9. _ASSIGNMENT._ No party may assign this Agreement or any of its rights, interests or obligations hereunder without the prior written approval of the other parties hereto. 

  

  

    

  8.10. _PARTIES IN INTEREST._  This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto, and nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other person any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement, other than Section 5.8 (which is intended to be for the benefit of the Indemnified Parties and may be enforced by such Indemnified Parties). 

  

  

    

  8.11. _FAILURE OR INDULGENCE NOT WAIVER; REMEDIES CUMULATIVE._ No failure or delay on the part of any party hereto in the exercise of any right hereunder shall impair such right or be construed to be a waiver of, or acquiescence in, any breach of any representation, warranty or agreement herein, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right preclude other or further exercise thereof or of any other right. All rights and remedies existing under this Agreement are cumulative to, and not exclusive of, any rights or remedies otherwise available. 

  

  

    

  8.12. _GOVERNING LAW._ This agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the internal laws of the State of Delaware applicable to contracts executed and fully performed within the State of Delaware.

 exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon
such party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy will not preclude
the exercise of any other remedy. The parties hereto agree that irreparable
damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement
were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to seek
an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any court of the
United States or any state having jurisdiction, this being the addition to
any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. 

  

  

    

  8.14. _COUNTERPARTS._ This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.
