Amount, shall pay to each Seller its Pro Rata Allocation of the Working
Capital Excess Amount, _provided_ , that the Sellers Representative may, in
its reasonable discretion, withhold a portion of the Working Capital Excess

9.09_. If the Final Net Working Capital as determined pursuant to this
_Section 2.06_ is less than the Estimated Net Working Capital (such amount,

Agent to deliver to the Surviving Company out of the Purchase Price Escrow

absolute value of the Working Capital Deficit Amount. All payments made
pursuant to this _Section 2.06(f)_ shall be made by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the account designated by the receiving party
in writing. If the Final Net Working Capital as determined pursuant to this

Act.

with and make available (or cause to be made available) to the other Party,
during normal business hours, all books, records and information retained or
remaining in existence after the Closing Date which are necessary or useful in
connection with any Tax Contest, any litigation or investigation or any other
matter requiring any such books, records or information for any reasonable

the Company.

 



 

Section 5.02 _Antitrust Matters_.

 



 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, each
Party and the Sellers Representative agrees to (i) make, or cause to be made,
appropriate filings of Notification and Report Forms pursuant to the HSR Act

early termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act, (ii) make, or cause
to be made, all filings required of each of them or any of their respective

to the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Laws. Parent and the Sellers shall each
be responsible for one-half of all filing fees under the HSR Act and under any

in this Agreement to the contrary, the Parties shall use their reasonable best
efforts to resolve objections, if any, as may be asserted by any Governmental
Authority or any other Party with respect to the transactions under any
applicable Law so as to enable the Parties to close the Transactions
contemplated hereby as promptly as

 



     

 

 



 

practicable, and in any event prior to the Closing Date; _provided, however_ ,
that in no event shall Parent or Merger Sub be required to: (1) propose,
negotiate, commit to or effect, by consent decree, hold separate order or
otherwise, the sale, divestiture or disposition of businesses, product lines
or assets of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub, (2) terminate any existing
relationships, contractual rights or obligations of the Company, Parent or
Merger Sub, or (3) otherwise take or commit to take actions that would limit
the Companys, Parents or their respective Affiliates, freedom of action
with respect to, or its ability to retain, one or more of the businesses,
product lines or assets of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub.

 



 

(b) Each of Parent and the Sellers agree that they will not, and they will not
permit their Affiliates to, enter into any transaction or agreement to effect
any transaction (including any merger or acquisition) that would make it more
difficult, or increase the time required, to (i) obtain the expiration,
termination, or waiver of any required waiting period under the HSR Act or any
other Antitrust Law applicable to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or the Transaction Documents, (ii) avoid the entry of, the
commencement of litigation seeking the entry of, or to effect the dissolution
of, any injunction, temporary restraining order or other order that is
reasonably likely to prevent or materially delay the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Transaction Documents,
(iii) obtain all actions or nonactions, waivers, expirations or terminations
of waiting periods, clearances, consents and orders of any Governmental
Authorities necessary for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, or (iv) delay or prevent the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby or by this Agreement. Neither Party shall not consent to
any voluntary extension of any statutory deadline or waiting period or to any
voluntary delay of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or by the Transaction Documents or withdraw its notification and
report form pursuant to the HSR Act or any other filing made pursuant to any
other Antitrust Law unless the other party has given its prior written consent
to such extension or delay.

 



 

Section 5.03 _Publicity_. Except as required by applicable Law, no publicity,
release, disclosure or announcement of or concerning this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be issued by any Party or any Affiliate
or representative of such Party, without the advance written consent of the
Sellers Representative and Parent, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent, Merger
Sub and the Sellers Representative shall be permitted to make disclosures
concerning this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents and the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby (a) to prospective investors and
lenders in connection with financings and acquisitions that it is
contemplating; and (b) as required by any Governmental Authority, including
pursuant to any applicable securities exchange rules. In the event that a
Party is required by applicable Law to make a release or announcement, such
Party shall provide the other Parties with a reasonable opportunity to review
and comment on such release or announcement before such release or
announcement is made.

 



 

Section 5.04 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise specifically provided in this
Agreement, the Parties to this Agreement shall bear their respective expenses
incurred in connection with the preparation, execution and performance of this
Agreement and consummation of the Transactions, including, without limitation,
all fees and expenses of agents, representatives, counsel, financial advisors,
actuaries and accountants. Notwithstanding anything contained

 



     

 

 



 

herein to the contrary, all transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration and such other Taxes, and all conveyance fees, recording charges
and other fees and charges incurred in connection with the completion of the
Transactions (" _Transfer Taxes_ ") shall be borne by Parent. Parent shall
cause the Surviving Company to pay such Transfer Taxes as and when due and
file all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to such
Taxes, fees and charges pursuant to and in accordance with all applicable
Laws, and, if required by applicable Law, the Sellers or the Sellers
Representative will join in the execution of any such Tax Returns.

 



 

Section 5.05 _Certain Tax Matters_. The following provisions shall govern the
allocation of responsibility as between Parent, on the one hand, and the
Sellers, on the other hand, for certain Tax matters (for purposes of this
Section, references to the Company shall include the Surviving Company where
the context may require):

 



 

(a) _Straddle Period_. In the case of any Straddle Period, the amount of any
Taxes based on or measured by income or receipts of the Company which related
to the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be determined based on an interim closing
of the books as of the Effective Time (and for such purpose, the taxable
period of any partnership or other pass-through entity in which the Company
holds a beneficial interest shall be deemed to terminate at such time), and
the amount of other Taxes of the Company for a Straddle Period which relate to
the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for
the entire taxable period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is
the number of days in the taxable period ending on the Closing Date and the
denominator of which is the number of days in such Straddle Period. The
Sellers and Parent shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law treat the
Closing Date as the last day of the taxable period of the Company. However,
Parent and the Sellers agree that for the federal income tax return (and
applicable state income Tax Returns), the taxable year of the Company
beginning on January 1, 2019 will close on the day prior to the Closing Date
pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii) (and comparable
provisions of applicable state and local Tax law). For the avoidance of doubt,
Parent and the Sellers agree that any deductions or other Tax benefits
resulting from the payment of the Seller Transaction Expenses and the payment
of the outstanding amount of the Indebtedness of the Company as of the Closing
shall be allocated to the applicable Pre-Closing Tax Period to the maximum
extent permitted by applicable Tax law and such allocated amounts shall be
solely for the benefit of the Sellers.

 



 

(b) _Responsibility for Filing Tax Returns_. The Sellers Representative shall
prepare or cause to be prepared and timely file or cause to be timely filed
all income Tax Returns of the Company for all Pre-Closing Tax Periods other
than a Tax Return that includes the Surviving Company and Parent (or any
member of Parents affiliated group) (" _Pre-Closing Income Tax Returns_ ").
The Sellers Representative shall provide Parent with a reasonable opportunity
to review and comment on each such Pre-Closing Income Tax Return and such Pre-
Closing Income Tax Returns shall be subject to Parents approval, not to be
unreasonably delayed, conditioned, or withheld. Parent shall prepare or cause
to be prepared and timely file or cause to be timely filed all other Tax
Returns of the Company that are filed after the Closing Date. To the extent
such Tax Returns related to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, Parent shall provide the
Sellers Representative with a copy of all such Pre-Closing Tax Period Tax
Returns at least thirty (30) days before the due date for filing such Tax
Returns. Any such Tax Returns shared with Sellers Representative may be
reformatted, redacted, or otherwise altered in content and presentation to

 



     

 

 



 

ensure only Company information is included and no information of any other
member of Parents affiliated group is provided. The Sellers Representative
shall provide comments and suggested changes for all Pre-Closing Tax Period
Tax Returns to Parent at least fifteen (15) days prior to the due date for
such Tax Returns, such Pre-Closing Tax Period Tax Returns shall be subject to
Sellers Representatives approval, not to be unreasonably delayed,
conditioned, or withheld. All Tax Returns relating, in whole or in part, to
any Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be prepared consistent with the past practice
of the Company, unless otherwise required by applicable Tax law. The Sellers
Representative shall pay Parent for the amount of Tax on any Pre-Closing Tax
Period Tax Return and Straddle Period Tax Return allocated to the Pre-Closing
Tax Period hereunder at least five (5) days prior to the filing of such Tax
Return.

 



 

(c) _Cooperation on Tax Matters_. Parent, the Surviving Company, and the
Sellers Representative shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably
requested by any other party, in connection with the filing of Tax Returns
pursuant to this _Section 5.05_ and any Tax Contest. Such cooperation shall
include (i) the provision of any necessary powers of attorney and (ii) the
retention and (upon the other partys request) the provision of records and
information that are reasonably relevant to any such Tax Contest and making
employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional
information and explanation of any material provided hereunder. The Sellers
Representative and Parent agree to, and agree to cause their respective
Affiliates, including the Surviving Company, to, (A) retain all books and
records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Company relating to any
taxable period beginning before the Closing Date until the expiration of the
applicable statute of limitations (and, to the extent notified by Parent or
the Sellers Representative, any extensions thereof) of the respective taxable
periods, and to abide by all record retention agreements entered into with any
taxing authority, and (B) to give the Sellers Representative reasonable
written notice prior to transferring, destroying or discarding any such books
and records and, if any other party so requests, to the extent the books and
records are with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period and do not contain
information deemed confidential by Parent, Parent shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates to, allow such other party to take possession of such books and
records. Parent and Sellers Representative further agree, upon request, to
use their reasonable best efforts to obtain any certificate or other document
from each other or any Governmental Authority as may be necessary to mitigate,
reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed (including, but not limited
to, with respect to the Transaction).

 



 

(d) _Audits_. In the event a Tax Contest involves Taxes with respect to one or
more Tax Periods ending on or before the Closing Date, the Sellers
Representative shall control the conduct of, and the settlement, compromise or
other resolution of such Tax Contest with respect all Tax Periods ending on or
before the Closing Date; provided, however, that (x) Parent shall be permitted
(but not obligated) to participate, at its own expense, in such Tax Contest
and (y) the Sellers Representative may not settle, compromise or otherwise
resolve any such Tax Contest in a manner that would materially adversely
affect the Tax liability of the Company for any Post-Closing Tax Period
without the prior written consent of Parent, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. The Party receiving the notice
of any Tax Contest shall provide the other Parties with notice in writing of
such Tax Contest within ten (10) days of receiving such notice from the
Governmental Authority; provided, however, that the failure to give notice
will not affect the rights and obligations of any party hereunder, except to
the extent any Party was adversely affected as a result. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, at Sellers

 



     

 

 



 

Representatives election and at the Sellers expense, Parent shall control
the conduct of, and the settlement, compromise, or other resolution of any
such Tax Contest with respect to a Tax Period ending on or before the Closing
Date.

 



 

(e) _Amended Tax Returns_. Any amended Tax Return of the Company or any claim
for Tax refund on behalf of the Company for any Tax Period ending on or prior
to the Closing Date shall be filed, or caused to be filed, only by the
Sellers Representative or by Parent) or Surviving Company) with the Sellers
Representatives written consent; provided, however, that the Sellers
Representative shall not, without the prior written consent of the Parent,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, make
or cause to be made any such filing (other than a claim for Tax refund on
account of the carryback of any Tax attribute of the Company from one Tax
Period ending on or prior to the Closing Date to another such period) if such
filing would adversely affect the Tax liability of the Company or the
Surviving Company for any Post-Closing Tax Period. Notwithstanding the
immediately preceding sentence, Parent or the Surviving Company shall be
permitted to file any such amended Tax Return if (i) such amended Tax Return
is required by applicable Tax law and (ii) the Sellers Representative
delivers its prior written agreement that such amended Tax Return is required
by applicable Tax law. Parent or the Surviving Company may participate in any
"voluntary disclosure" process or procedure sponsored by a Taxing Authority if
any such activity is necessary to ensure the Company is in compliance with
applicable Tax laws or correct historic tax positions of the Company, as long
as the Sellers Representative delivers its prior written agreement that such
action(s) is so necessary. In the event the Sellers Representative does not
agree that an amended Tax Return is required by Tax law or that participation
in a voluntary disclosure process or procedure is necessary, the matter of
whether such amended Tax Return is required by Tax law or such activity is
more likely than not necessary to ensure the Company is in compliance with
applicable Tax laws or correct historic tax positions of the Company shall be
submitted to the Independent Accounting Firm for resolution in a manner and
pursuant to procedures substantially identical to those set forth in _Section
2.06_ for resolving disputes regarding the Final Net Working Capital. For the
avoidance of doubt, a Tax Contest (and any related activities or filings) is
covered under clause (d) and is not subject to or governed by this clause (e),
and furthermore, any activity permitted to be undertaken by Parent under this
provision is not subject to _Section 5.05(b)_ (other than the final sentence
therein) or _Section 5.05(d)_.

 



 

(f) _Tax Covenants_. For the avoidance of doubt, except to the extent
permitted under _Section 5.05(e)_, Parent covenants that without obtaining
the prior written consent of the Sellers Representative (which consent shall
not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), Parent shall not,
and shall not cause or permit the Surviving Company to, make or change any
material Tax election on behalf of the Company with respect to any Pre-Closing
Tax Period or any Straddle Period (unless such change occurs by operation of
law) and (ii) after the Closing Date, neither Parent nor the Surviving Company
shall, without the prior written consent of the Sellers Representative, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, agree to
the waiver or any extension of the statute of limitations relating to any
Taxes of the Company for any Tax Period ending on or before the Closing Date.

 



 

(g) _Refunds_. The Sellers shall have the sole and exclusive right to (x) any
Tax refunds received by the Company for any Pre-Closing Tax Period or any
portion of a Straddle

 



     

 

 



 

Period ending prior to the Closing Date and (y) the amount of any credits
against Taxes in lieu of refunds described in _clause (x)_. Parent shall pay
any such Tax refund and the amount of any such Tax credit in lieu of a refund
to the Sellers Representative no later than ten (10) days after the receipt
by the Company of any such Tax refund or the reporting by the Company of the
amount of any such Tax Credit. The Sellers Representative shall waive
Parents obligation under this clause (g) and instruct Parent not to make such
payment (or if already paid, return such funds to Parent consistent with the
intent reflected in this sentence) if making such payment, in the Sellers
Representatives opinion, could result in a treatment inconsistent with
_Section 2.13_.

 



 

Section 5.06 _Exclusivity_. As an inducement to Parent and Merger Sub to enter
into this Agreement, and in consideration of the time and expense which it has
devoted and will devote to the transactions contemplated hereby during such
period, subsequent to the execution of this Agreement and until the earlier of
(i) the Closing Date and (ii) the termination of this Agreement in accordance
with _Section 7.01_, each Seller agrees that it shall not, and shall direct
its Affiliates, stockholders, members, directors, managers, officers,
employees, consultants, representatives or agents not to (including, without
limitation, any investment banker, attorney or accountant retained or acting
on behalf of the Seller), directly or indirectly, (A) initiate, solicit,
encourage, entertain or respond to any inquiry or proposal with respect to a
merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination, liquidation, or
dissolution or sale of all or a portion of the assets of the Company or any
purchase of any of the equity securities of the Company (an " _Acquisition
Proposal_ ") or (B) enter into any discussions, negotiations or agreements
concerning an Acquisition Proposal with, or disclose any information
concerning the Company or otherwise assist or facilitate any effort relating
to an Acquisition Proposal by, any Person. Each Seller will, and shall cause
its Affiliates to, immediately cease any existing discussions with any Persons
concerning any Acquisition Proposal.

(a) During the period between the date hereof until the earlier of the Closing
Date and the date this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to _Article

applicable Law, or (iii) as consented to in writing by Parent. Consistent with

Section 5.08 _Disclosure Schedules_.

 



 

(a) The Disclosure Schedules are a material part of this Agreement as if fully
set forth in this Agreement and are intended only to qualify and limit the
representations, warranties and covenants of the Sellers contained in this
Agreement, and will not be deemed to expand in any way the scope or effect of
any of such representations, warranties or covenants. Parent hereby
acknowledges and agrees that: (i) certain agreements and other matters may be
listed in the Disclosure Schedules for informational purposes only, as they do
not rise above applicable materiality thresholds, they are not outside of the
ordinary course of business or their disclosure is not otherwise required
under the terms of this Agreement (items that are not required to be disclosed
but are disclosed, the " _Informational Disclosures_ "); (ii) in no event will
the Informational Disclosures be deemed or interpreted to broaden or otherwise
amplify or influence the construction or interpretation of any of the
representations and warranties; (iii) disclosures made for the purpose of any
Schedule of the Disclosure Schedules will be deemed made for the purpose of
all Schedules so long as cross-references are made or the applicability to the
other section(s) is reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure; (iv)
headings in the Disclosure Schedules have been inserted for reference only and
will not be deemed to modify or influence the interpretation of the
information contained in the Disclosure Schedules or this Agreement; (v) no
reference to or disclosure of any item or other matter in the Disclosure
Schedules will be construed as an admission or indication that such item or
other matter is material or outside of the ordinary course of business or that
such item or other matter is required to be referred to or disclosed in the
Disclosure Schedules or otherwise imply that any such item or matter creates a

 



     

 

 



 

measure for materiality for the purposes of this Agreement; (vi) no disclosure
in the Disclosure Schedules relating to any possible breach or violation of
any agreement or Law shall be construed as an admission or indication that any
such breach or violations exists or has actually occurred; (vii) the inclusion
of any matter, information or item in the Disclosure Schedules will not be
deemed to constitute an admission of any liability by Seller to any third
party; and (viii) summaries of or references to any written document in the
Disclosure Schedules do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their
entirety by the written documents themselves; provided, that Parent, Merger
Sub and their representatives have been provided with reasonable access to
such documents at least three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date.

 



 

(b) The Sellers shall update the Disclosure Schedules in accordance with this
_Section 5.08(b)_ (each such update, a " _Schedule Update_ "). Any Schedule
Update shall be limited to disclosure of facts, events or circumstances that
first occurred or first existed after the date of this Agreement and, with
respect to any representations qualified by knowledge, facts, events or
circumstances of which the Sellers first obtained knowledge following the
original and complete delivery of the Disclosure Schedules and prior to the
Closing. For purposes of determining whether the conditions set forth in
_Section 6.01_ have been satisfied, the Schedule Updates shall not be deemed
to cure any misrepresentation or breach of warranty reflected in the Schedule
Updates (x) arising in the ordinary course of business unless such newly
scheduled item results from a breach of covenant by a Seller, (y) resulting
from any actions taken by Parent or any of its representatives, or (z)
resulting from any action taken by any Seller at the request or with the
consent of Parent or its representatives; _provided_ , _however_ , if a
Schedule Update discloses any fact, event, claim or development that has had,
or would reasonably be expected to have, cause or result in a Material Adverse
Effect, Parent may (A) terminate this Agreement or (B) elect to close the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and by doing so waive any rights
to indemnification with respect to such matter identified in the Schedule
Updates.

 



 

(c) During the period from the date hereof until the earlier of the Closing
Date and the date this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to _Article
VII_, each of Parent and the Sellers Representative shall promptly notify the
other of any Legal Proceeding that shall be instituted or, to the Knowledge of
Parent or Knowledge of the Sellers, respectively, threatened against Parent,
Merger Sub or Sellers, as applicable, to restrain, prohibit or otherwise
challenge the legality of any transaction contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

Section 5.09 _R andW Insurance_. Parent acknowledges and agrees that the RandW
Insurance Policy provides that the insurer providing the same shall have no
right of subrogation against the Sellers Representative, any Seller, or their
respective Affiliates, except in the case of Fraud. Parent shall not: (a)
permit the RandW Insurance Policy to be amended, supplemented, or otherwise
modified, and shall not grant any waiver or consent thereunder, in each case
in a manner that would be inconsistent with the foregoing sentence or that
would reasonably be expected to otherwise be materially adverse to the
interests of the Sellers Representative, any Seller, or their respective
Affiliates; (b) voluntarily cancel the RandW Insurance Policy or permit it to
lapse; or (c) take action that would reasonably be expected to cause the RandW
Insurance Policy to lapse or to be rescinded or canceled.

 



     

 

 



 

Section 5.10 _Director and Officer Liability and Indemnification_.

 



 

(a) Following the Closing Date, Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to
include and maintain in effect in their organizational and governing documents
for a period of six (6) years after the Closing Date, provisions regarding
exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses of former officers,
directors, managers and agents which are, with respect to each such entity, no
less advantageous to the intended beneficiaries than the corresponding
provisions contained in such documents as of the date of this Agreement, it
being the intent of the Parties that the officers, directors, managers and
agents of the Company prior to the Closing shall continue to be entitled to
such exculpation and indemnification to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Law.

 



 

(b) The obligations of Parent under this _Section 5.10_ shall not be
terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any officers,
directors, managers, managing members or agents to whom this _Section 5.10_
applies without the consent of such affected director, officers, manager,
managing member or agent (it being expressly agreed that the directors,
officers, managers, managing members and agents to whom this _Section 5.10_
relates shall be third party beneficiaries of this _Section 5.10_, each of
whom may enforce the provisions of this _Section 5.10_).

 



 

(c) In the event that Parent, the Surviving Company or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in either such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the
Surviving Company, as the case may be, shall assume all of the obligations set
forth in this _Section 5.10_.

 



 

Section 5.11 _Confidentiality_. From and after the Closing Date, without the
prior written consent of Parent, (i) the Sellers shall not, and shall cause
their Affiliates not to, use the confidential information related to the
Business (the " _Confidential Information_ ") to the detriment of Parent or
the Surviving Company; and (ii) the Sellers shall, and shall cause their
Affiliates to, hold the Confidential Information in strict confidence, and
without limiting the foregoing, not disclose the Confidential Information to
any Person (other than Parent or Parents Affiliates); provided, however, that
the foregoing will not apply to the extent that (A) the same information is
currently publicly available or becomes publicly available and that such
public availability does not result from the misappropriation or improper
disclosure, directly or indirectly, of such information by the Sellers or
their Affiliates; (B) the Confidential Information is required by applicable
Law to be disclosed, but then only (1) to the extent disclosure is required
and (2) after undertaking in good faith to give Parent notice of such
obligation so that it may seek a protective order or other similar or
appropriate relief; or (C) the Confidential Information is being disclosed
solely as part of a Legal Proceeding initiated with respect to the enforcement
of Sellers or their Affiliates rights hereunder or under any agreement or
transaction contemplated hereby.

_Section 5.11_ and applicable Law relating to the sharing of information,
during normal business hours, upon reasonable advance notice, to the offices,
properties, employees and business and financial records (including computer
files, retrieval programs and similar documentation) of the Company to the
extent Parent shall reasonably deem necessary and shall furnish to Parent or
its authorized representatives such additional information concerning the
Company as shall be reasonably requested; provided, however, that the Sellers
and the Company shall not be required to (a) violate any Laws or obligation of
confidentiality to which any Seller or the Company is subject or (b)
jeopardize any privilege which any of them may possess in discharging their
obligations pursuant to this _Section 5.13_; and, provided, further, that
other than as contemplated elsewhere in this Agreement, (i) the Sellers and
the Company shall not be required to provide or prepare any documents or
reports that they do not maintain or prepare in the ordinary course of
business, (ii) the Sellers and the Company shall not be required to furnish or
otherwise make available to Parent customer-specific data or competitively
sensitive information relating to areas of the Companys business in which
Parent or its Affiliates compete against the Company or which the Sellers
Representative determines the disclosure of which could cause significant
competitive harm to the Company if the transactions contemplated hereby are
not consummated, and (iii) Parent shall not, without the prior written consent
of the Sellers Representative, contact or communicate with any vendor,
customer, employee, independent contractor or other business partner of the
Company, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned. Parent agrees that such investigation shall be conducted in such
a manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the operations of the Company
or the Sellers Representative.

 



 

Section 5.14 _Non-competition and Non-solicitation_.

 



 

(a) Each Seller agrees that, during the Restricted Period, it shall not and
shall cause each of its Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly, engage in
any Restricted Business in any capacity, including rendering services to or
having a financial interest in any Restricted Business. For the avoidance of
doubt, Parent and each of the Sellers agree that it would be a violation of
this _Section 5.14_ for a Seller or any of its Affiliates to act as
consultant, advisor, independent

 



     

 

 



 

contractor, officer, manager, employee, principal, agent, lender or trustee of
any Person that is engaged in any Restricted Business during the Restricted
Period, provided that nothing in this _Section 5.14_ shall prohibit a Seller
or any of its Affiliates from owning, directly or indirectly, solely as an
investment, up to one percent (1%) of any class of "publicly traded
securities" of any Restricted Business, meaning securities that are traded on
a national or foreign securities exchange.

 



 

(b) Each Seller agrees that during the Restricted Period it shall not and
shall cause each of its Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly, solicit for
employment or encourage to leave employment any employee of the Company
(including the Surviving Company). Nothing in this _Section 5.14_ shall
prohibit a Seller or any of its Affiliates from placing general advertisements
that may be targeted to a particular geographic or technical area but that are
not specifically targeted toward employees of the Company (including the
Surviving Company) or any of their Affiliates, successors or assigns.

 



 

(c) Each Seller acknowledges that (a) any violation of the provisions of this
_Section 5.14_ would cause irreparable harm to parent and that money damages
would not be an adequate remedy for any such violation and (b) accordingly,
Parent and its Affiliates shall be entitled to obtain injunctive or other
equitable relief to prevent any actual or threatened breach of any of such
provisions and to enforce such provisions specifically, without the necessity
of posting a bond or other security or of proving actual damages, by an
appropriate court in the appropriate jurisdiction. The remedies provided in
this _Section 5.14_ are cumulative and shall not exclude any other remedies
to which Parent may be entitled under this Agreement or applicable Law, and
the exercise of a remedy under this _Section 5.14_ shall not be deemed an
election excluding any other remedy or any waiver thereof.

 



 

(d) If any Governmental Authority determines that the foregoing restrictions
are too broad or otherwise unreasonable under applicable Law, including with
respect to time or geographical scope, such Governmental Authority is hereby
requested and authorized by the Parties to revise the foregoing restriction to
include the maximum restrictions allowable under Law. Each Seller
acknowledges, however, that this _Section 5.14_ has been negotiated by each
such Person and that the geographical scope and time limitations, as well as
the limitation on activities, are reasonable in light of the circumstances
pertaining to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

Section 5.15 _Listing Application_. Parent shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause all such filings with the NYSE to be completed and otherwise
to take all such actions as may be reasonably necessary for the Parent Common

quarter and the related statements of earnings and stockholders equity and
cash flows for the three-, six- or nine-month period then ended, as
applicable, and the corresponding three-, six- or nine-month period of the

by Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X for interim financial statements filed in a
periodic report with the SEC.

to prepare the financial statements referred to in _clauses (a)_ , _(b)_ and
_(c)_ above.

Merger Subs failure to effect the Closing) and the Sellers Representative
has provided written notice to Parent irrevocably confirming that the Sellers

funds to an account designated in writing by Parent.

 



 

(b) In no event shall either the Sellers, on the one hand, or Parent and
Merger Sub, on the other hand, be required to pay a Termination Fee on more
than one occasion. The Parties acknowledge and hereby agree that the
Termination Fee, if, as and when required pursuant to this _Section 7.03,_
shall not constitute a penalty but will be reasonable liquidated damages that
will compensate the Company, the Sellers and the Sellers Representative, on
the one hand, or Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, in the
circumstances in which it is payable for the efforts and resources expended
and opportunities foregone by such Party while negotiating this Agreement and
in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby, which amount would otherwise be
impossible to calculate with precision.

or expenses suffered or incurred by the Company, the Sellers, the Sellers
Representative, on the one hand, or Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand,
or any of their respective Affiliates or any other Person in connection with
this Agreement and the Transaction. Upon payment of the Termination Fee, the
Party paying the Termination Fee, and its Affiliates shall have no further
liability or obligation relating to or arising out of the Transaction, in each
case whether based on contract, tort or strict liability, by the enforcement
of any assessment, by any legal or equitable Action, by virtue of any
applicable Laws or otherwise and whether by or through attempted piercing of
the corporate or partnership veil, by or through a claim by or on behalf of a
Party or another Person or otherwise.

respective terms, and if no specific term is specified, the covenants and
agreements to be performed prior to the Closing shall not survive the Closing
and the covenants and the agreements to be performed after the Closing shall
continue until thirty (30) days following their applicable statute of
limitations. No Party shall have any liability with respect to claims first
asserted in connection with any representation or warranty after the
applicable Survival Period. In the event, however, that notice of any claim
for indemnification (an " _Indemnity Claim Notice_ ") is given to the other

recovery from the Sellers; and

this _Article VIII_ shall be determined by taking into account (i) any
amounts actually recovered by the Indemnified Party under its insurance
policies or otherwise; provided, that such amount shall be reduced by any
costs and expenses incurred in obtaining such recovery and by the amount of
any increase in insurance premiums resulting from making the claim giving rise
to such recovery, _provided_ , _further_ , that notwithstanding anything else
herein to the contrary, an Indemnified Party shall make reasonable efforts to
recover from an insurer, and (ii) any amounts recovered by the Indemnified
Party from a third party.

 



 

(e) Except with respect to claims arising out of Fraud, the Parties
acknowledge and agree that their sole and exclusive remedy with respect to any
and all claims for any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant,
agreement or obligation set forth herein or otherwise relating to the subject
matter of this Agreement shall be pursuant to the indemnification provisions
set forth in this _Article VIII_. In furtherance of the foregoing, each Party
hereby waives, to the fullest extent permitted under Law, any and all rights,
claims and causes of action for any breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant, agreement or obligation set forth herein or otherwise relating to
the subject matter of this Agreement it may have against the other Parties
hereto and their Affiliates and each of their respective representatives
arising under or based upon any Law or any other theory or right, except

shall not include (i) imposing or levying charges on or recapturing amounts
from customers of the Business, and (ii) an obligation to litigate or initiate
any action or pursue indemnification against a customer or supplier of the
Company, including for example taking any action to collect previously

special or indirect damages relating to the breach or alleged breach of this
Agreement.

 



 

Section 8.05 _Indemnification Claims_.

 



 

(a) _Claims for Indemnification_. In order to seek indemnification under
_Sections 8.02 _or _8.03_ the party claiming indemnification (the "
_Indemnified Party_ ") shall deliver an Indemnity Claim Notice to the party
from whom the indemnification is sought (each, an " _Indemnifying Party_ " and
collectively, the " _Indemnifying Parties_ ") (which Indemnity Claim Notice
shall specify in reasonable detail the nature and good faith estimate based on
information then available to the Indemnified Party of the amount of any such
claim).

 



 

(b) _Resolution of Conflicts_. If the Indemnifying Party delivers a written
statement objecting to the claim stated in the Claim Notice (or the
calculation or any portion thereof) (an " _Objection Notice_ ") within thirty
(30) days of the date of its receipt of the Claim Notice, the Sellers
Representative and Parent shall attempt for a period of thirty (30) days in
good faith to agree upon the rights of the respective Parties with respect to
each of such claims. In the event the Parties are unable to resolve all
objections stated in the Objection Notice within such thirty (30) day period,
either Parent or the Sellers Representative may pursue any and all legal or
equitable remedies available to them under applicable Law to the extent
permitted by this Agreement.

 



 

(c) _Third Party Claims_. The obligations and liabilities of the Parties
hereunder with respect to indemnity pursuant to this _Article VIII_ resulting
from any claim or other assertion of liability by third parties (hereinafter
called collectively, " _Third Party Claims_ ") shall be subject to the
following terms and conditions:

 



 

(i) Promptly after the receipt by an Indemnified Party of notice of the
commencement of any Third Party Claim, such Indemnified Party shall give the
Indemnifying Party written notice thereof in reasonable detail in light of the
circumstances then known to such Indemnified Party along with a copy of the
Third Party Claim. The failure to give such notice shall not relieve the
Indemnified Party from any obligation under _Article VIII_ except where, and
solely to the extent that, such failure actually and materially prejudices the
rights of the Indemnifying Party.

 



 

(ii) The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to undertake at its sole
expense, by counsel of its own choosing, the defense of such Third Party
Claim; provided _,_ however, that the Indemnifying Party shall not have the
right to defend or direct the defense of such Third Party Claim if such claim,
suit or demand is (A) criminal in nature, would reasonably be expected to lead
to criminal proceedings, (B) seeks an injunction or other equitable or non-
monetary relief against the Indemnified Party, or (C) the Indemnified Party
has been advised by

 



     

 

 



 

counsel that an actual or potential conflict exists between the Indemnified
Party and the Indemnifying Party in connection with the defense of the Third
Party Claim.

 



 

(iii) In the event that the Indemnifying Party shall elect not to undertake
such defense, or within a reasonable time after notice of any such Third Party
Claim from the other Party shall fail to defend, the Indemnified Party (upon
notice to the Indemnifying Party) shall have the right to undertake the
defense by counsel or other representatives of its own choosing, on behalf of
and for the account and risk of the Indemnifying Party (who shall be
responsible for paying the reasonable fees and expenses such counsel and
defense to the extent indemnifiable under this Agreement).

 



 

(iv) Notwithstanding anything in this _Article VIII_ to the contrary, (A)
neither the Indemnifying Party nor the Indemnified Party shall, without the
others prior written consent, settle or compromise any Third Party Claim or
consent to entry of any judgment, (B) in the event that the Indemnifying Party
undertakes defense of any Third Party Claim in accordance with _Section
8.05(c)(ii)_, the Indemnified Party, by counsel or other representative of its
own choosing and at its sole cost and expense, shall have the right to consult
with, and be provided reasonable access to all relevant information within the
possession of, the Indemnifying Party and its counsel or other representatives
concerning such Third Party Claim, and (C) in the event that the Indemnified
Party undertakes defense of any Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party, by
counsel or other representative of its own choosing and at its sole cost and
expense, shall have the right to consult with, and be provided reasonable
access to all relevant information within the possession of, the Indemnified
Party and its counsel or other representatives concerning such Third Party
Claim.

 



 

Section 8.06 _Determination of Losses; Miscellaneous_.

 



 

(a) For purposes of determining whether there has been a breach of any
representation or warranty for purposes of indemnification under this _Article
VIII_, all representations and warranties shall be treated as if the words
"materially," "in all material respects," "Material Adverse Effect" or similar
words were omitted from such representations and warranties, and for purposes
of determining the amount of Losses resulting therefrom, any Material Adverse
Effect or materiality qualification limiting the scope of such representation
or warranty shall be disregarded.

 



 

(b) The Parties shall cooperate with any reasonable request of the other and
make available, at the others expense, all information (but excluding
privileged communications) necessary for the other to pursue any
indemnification or reimbursement from a third party for any Losses in the
event that the other elects to pursue such indemnification or reimbursement.

 



 

Section 8.07 _R andW Insurance Policy_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary contained in this Agreement:

 



 

(a) Parent will purchase the RandW Insurance Policy on its own behalf, to insure

representations and warranties

 



     

 

 



 

contained in this Agreement and such other items for which insurance is

(b) any limits on indemnification in this _Article VIII_ shall not limit

exercising any right, power or privilege under this Agreement or under any
other instrument or document given in connection with or pursuant to this
Agreement shall impair any such right, power or privilege or be construed as a

Sub shall assign this Agreement in whole or in part, whether by operation of
Law or otherwise without the prior written consent of (i) the Sellers

obligations of the parties hereto, and any claims or disputes relating
thereto, shall be governed by and construed under and in accordance with the

including without limitation a breach, default, or misrepresentation or any
determination made by a Party hereto pursuant to this Agreement, shall, to the
extent made by or against any Party or any of its Affiliates after the
unsuccessful negotiation in good faith by the Parties hereto, be finally and
conclusively resolved exclusively in the State or Federal courts located in
the Borough of Manhattan, the City of New York . In furtherance of the

Section 9.08 _Specific Performance_. The Parties hereto acknowledge and agree
that the breach by any of them of this Agreement would cause irreparable
damage to the other Parties hereto and that they will not have an adequate
remedy at Law. Therefore, the Parties under this Agreement shall be permitted
to seek a decree of specific performance issued by any court of competent
jurisdiction, and appropriate injunctive relief may be applied for and granted
in connection therewith. Such remedies shall, however, be cumulative and not
exclusive and shall be in addition to any other remedies at Law which any
Party may have under this Agreement.

 



 

Section 9.09 _Appointment of the Sellers  Representative_.

 



 

(a) The Sellers hereby appoint and designate the Sellers Representative as
their representative to act on behalf of the Sellers for certain purposes, as
specified in this _Section 9.09_. The Sellers hereby grant to the Sellers
Representative such powers and authority as are necessary to carry out the
following functions as the Sellers Representative of the Sellers: (i) to give
and receive notices on behalf of the Sellers, (ii) to administer and resolve
any claims arising under _Section 2.06_ and _Article VIII_ hereof, and (iii)
to take such other actions on behalf of the Sellers as are contemplated by
this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents. For the avoidance of
doubt, nothing in this _Section 9.09_ shall be deemed to expand or alter the
joint and several nature of the indemnification obligations of the Sellers
pursuant to _Article VIII_ hereof. Parent and any Parent Indemnified Party
(A) shall be entitled to rely on any action or decision of the Sellers
Representative hereunder and (B) shall have no liability to any Seller for any
actions taken pursuant to instructions within the authority of the Sellers
Representative. The appointment of a Person as the Sellers Representative of
the Sellers will be deemed coupled with an interest and will be irrevocable,
and any other Person may conclusively and absolutely rely, without inquiry,
upon any actions of the Sellers Representative as the actions of the Sellers
hereunder in all matters referred to in this Agreement or any other
Transaction Document to which such Sellers are a party. All that the Sellers
Representative will do or cause to be done by virtue of its appointment as the
Sellers Representative of the Sellers pursuant to this _Section 9.09_ is
hereby ratified and confirmed by each of the Sellers.

 



      

 

 



 

(b) In performing the functions specified in this Agreement or any other
Transaction Document, the Sellers Representative shall not be liable to any
Seller in the absence of gross negligence, willful misconduct or Fraud on the
part of the Sellers Representative. Each Seller shall severally (based on
such Sellers Pro Rata Allocation), and not jointly, indemnify and hold
harmless the Sellers Representative from and against any loss, liability or
expense incurred without gross negligence, willful misconduct or Fraud on the
part of the Sellers Representative and arising out of or in connection with
the acceptance or administration of his, her or its duties hereunder,
including any out-of-pocket costs and expenses and legal fees and other legal
costs reasonably incurred by the Sellers Representative (the " _Sellers 
Representative Expenses_"). Neither Parent, Merger Sub nor the Company shall
have any liability for the Sellers Representative Expenses.

 



 

Section 9.10 _Waiver; Privilege_.

 



 

(a) _Acknowledgment of Prior Representation_. Each of the Parties acknowledges
and agrees that Womble Bond Dickinson (US) LLP (" _WBD_ ") has acted as
counsel to the Sellers in connection with the negotiation of this Agreement
and consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, and in that

(b) _Consent to Future Representation_. Parent and Merger Sub hereby consent
and agree to, and agree to cause the Surviving Company following the Closing
to consent and agree to, WBD representing the Sellers Representative and/or
any of the Sellers (collectively, the " _Represented Parties_ ") after the
Closing, including with respect to disputes in which the interests of the
Represented Parties may be directly adverse to Parent and its Affiliates
(including the Company), and even though WBD may have represented the Company
in a matter substantially related to any such dispute, or may be handling
ongoing matters for the Company. Parent and Merger Sub further consent and
agree to, and agree to cause the Surviving Company and their respective
Affiliates following the Closing to further consent and agree to, the
communication by WBD to the Represented Parties in connection with any such
representation of any fact that became known to WBD in connection with its
representation of the Company.

 



 

(c) _Waiver of Conflicts_. In connection with the foregoing, Parent and Merger
Sub hereby irrevocably waive and agree not to assert, and agree to cause the
Surviving Company and their respective Affiliates following the Closing to
irrevocably waive and agree not to assert, any conflict of interest arising
from or in connection with (i) WBDs prior representation of the Company and
(ii) WBDs representation of, as applicable, a Represented Party prior to and
after the Closing.

 



 

(d) _Attorney-Client Privilege_. The Parties acknowledge and agree that all
communications prior to the Closing between the Company, Sellers, and the
Sellers Representative, on the one hand, and WBD, on the other hand,
regarding the evaluation, analysis and/or negotiation of this Agreement and/or
the other Transaction Documents shall remain the sole property of the Sellers
(the " _Transaction Related Communications and Documents_ "), and the Sellers
shall hold attorney-client privilege with respect to all such communications.
Parent and Merger Sub shall be entitled to possession of all documents, books,
records, agreements and financial data of any sort belonging to the Company;
provided, however, in no event shall Parent or Merger Sub be provided access
to or possession to the Transaction Related Communications

 



     

 

 



 

and Documents without the prior written consent of the Sellers
Representative, unless Sellers are determined to have waived such attorney-
client privilege by a court of competent jurisdiction.

proceed with the Transaction. Parent and Merger Sub understand and acknowledge
the disclaimer set forth in _Section 3.25_. In connection with Parents and
Merger Subs investigation of the Company, Parent and/or Merger Sub has
received certain future projections, including future projected statements of
operating revenues and income from operations of the Company and certain
future business plan information. Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge that there
are uncertainties inherent in attempting to make such future estimates,
projections and other forecasts and plans, and that Parent and Merger Sub is
familiar with such uncertainties. Accordingly, Parent and Merger Sub hereby
acknowledge that neither the Sellers nor the Company are making any
representation or warranty with respect to such future estimates, projections
and other forecasts and plans, including the reasonableness of the assumptions
underlying such future estimates, projections and forecasts except as set
forth in _Article III_ (and the related Disclosure Schedules), and each of
Parent and Merger Sub hereby disclaims any reliance on such future estimates,
projections and other forecasts and plans.

 



 

Section 9.13 _Signature in Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in
separate counterparts (whether transmitted by facsimile or other electronic
means) none of which need

 



     

 

 



 

contain the signatures of all Parties, each of which shall be deemed to be an
original, and all of which taken together constitute one and the same
instrument. It shall not be necessary in making proof of this Agreement to
produce or account for more than the number of counterparts containing the
respective signatures of, or on behalf of, all of the parties hereto.

instrument entered into in connection with this Agreement, and any amendments
hereto or thereto, to the extent delivered by means of a facsimile machine or
electronic mail (any such delivery, an " _Electronic Delivery_ "), shall be
treated in all manner and respects as an original agreement or instrument and
shall be considered to have the same binding legal effect as if it were the
original signed version thereof delivered in person. At the request of any
party hereto or to any such agreement or instrument, each other party hereto
or thereto shall re execute original forms thereof and deliver them to all
other Parties. No Party hereto or to any such agreement or instrument shall
raise the use of Electronic Delivery to deliver a signature or the fact that
any signature or agreement or instrument was transmitted or communicated
through the use of Electronic Delivery as a defense to the formation of a
contract, and each such Party forever waives any such defense, except to the
extent such defense related to lack of authenticity.
