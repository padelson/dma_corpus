REGISTRATION RIGHTS

SECTION 2.01. _Shelf Registration_.

(a) The Company shall prepare and file an Automatic Shelf Registration
Statement with the SEC as promptly as practicable after the Closing Date (but
in no event no more than ten days after the Closing Date) covering the
Registrable Shares, which shall automatically become effective upon filing
with the SEC pursuant to Rule 462(e) under the Securities Act and contain a
Prospectus in such form as to permit any Holder to sell its Registrable Shares
at any time beginning on or after the filing thereof with the SEC pursuant to
Rule 415 under the Securities Act or any successor or similar rule that may
be adopted by the SEC. If the Company is not eligible to use an Automatic
Shelf Registration Statement at any time of determination of eligibility, the
Company shall promptly post-effectively amend the Automatic Shelf
Registration Statement or file a new Registration Statement on Form S-3, in
either case to permit any Holder to sell its Registrable Shares pursuant to
Rule 415 under the Securities Act or any successor or similar rule that may
be adopted by the SEC. The term " _Shelf Registration Statement_ " as used
herein means the Automatic Shelf Registration Statement or any post-effective
amendment thereto or a new Registration Statement so filed pursuant to this
_Section 2.01_.

(b) Subject to _Section 2.01(e)_, the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to keep such Shelf Registration Statement continuously effective
(including by filing any necessary post-effective amendments to such Shelf
Registration Statement or a new Shelf Registration Statement) until the
earlier of (x) the date on which all Registrable Shares have been sold
pursuant to such Shelf Registration Statement or another shelf registration
statement filed under

 



4  the Securities Act (but in no event prior to the applicable period referred
to in Section 4(3) of the Securities Act and Rule 174 thereunder) and (y) such
time as the Registrable Shares are no longer outstanding or otherwise no
longer constitute Registrable Shares. A Holder shall provide notice to the
Company prior to any use of the Shelf Registration Statement by such Holder,
and shall provide the information required by, and comply with the
obligations under, _Section 2.05(f)_.

(c) If at any time following the filing of any Shelf Registration Statement,
the Majority Holder desires to sell all or any portion of its Registrable
Shares under such Shelf Registration Statement in an Underwritten Offering
(any such sale, a " _Shelf Demand Offering_ "), the Majority Holder shall (i)
notify (such notice, the " _Shelf Demand Notice_ ") the Company of such intent
at least ten Business Days prior to such proposed sale and (ii) simultaneously
with delivery of the Shelf Demand Notice to the Company, deliver written
notice of such Shelf Demand Offering to (A) if delivery of the Shelf Demand
Notice is on or before the date that is 180 days after the Closing Date, each
other Holder (if any) that holds Registrable Shares on the date that such
Shelf Demand Notice is delivered to the Company, or (B) if delivery of the
Shelf Demand Notice is more than 180 days after the Closing Date, each other
One Percent Holder (if any) that holds Registrable Shares on the date that
such Shelf Demand Notice is delivered to the Company. The Shelf Demand Notice
shall specify the aggregate number of Registrable Shares requested to be sold
in such Shelf Demand Offering.

 

(d) The Company shall include in the Shelf Demand Offering covered by such
Shelf Demand Notice all Registrable Shares of each Holder with respect to
which the Company has received a written request for inclusion therein from
such Holder within ten Business Days after the Company has received the Shelf
Demand Notice; _provided_ , _however_ , that only One Percent Holders
are entitled to make a written request for inclusion if the applicable Shelf
Demand Notice was delivered to the Company more than 180 days after the
Closing Date. The Company shall promptly prepare and file a prospectus
supplement, post-effective amendment to the Shelf Registration Statement
and/or Exchange Act reports incorporated by reference into the Shelf
Registration Statement and take such other actions as reasonably necessary or
appropriate to permit the consummation of such Shelf Demand Offering. The
applicable Holder having notified or directed the Company to commence a Shelf
Demand Offering or to include any of their Registrable Shares therein shall
have the right to withdraw such notice or direction by giving written notice
to the Company. A Shelf Demand Notice withdrawn by the Majority Holder shall
count as one of the permitted Shelf Demand Offerings pursuant to _Section
2.03_ unless such withdrawal shall have been caused by the occurrence of an
event or series of related events that has a material adverse effect on the
business, assets, condition or results of operations of the Company.

(e) For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Suspension Period_ " shall
mean (i) the period beginning on the Closing Date and continuing until the
date that the Automatic Shelf Registration Statement is filed with the SEC
and made available for the sale of Registrable Shares (the " _Delay Period_ ")
or (ii) any period during which the Company has required the Holders to
suspend the use of a Prospectus for sales of Registrable Shares under a Shelf
Registration Statement or a Demand Registration Statement (as defined below).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
Company shall be entitled, from time to time on or after the Closing Date, to
declare a Suspension Period, if the

 



5  Company shall determine that the use of a Prospectus for sales of
Registrable Shares would (i) have an adverse effect on a bona fide business or
financing transaction of the Company or any Company Subsidiary or (ii)
require disclosure of material non-public information that, if disclosed at
such time, would be harmful to the Company or its stockholders; _provided_
that such Suspension Period is for a reasonable period of time not to exceed
45 days in succession (other than the Delay Period) or 120 days in the
aggregate in any 12-month period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company
shall have the right, exercisable two times from and after the Closing Date
under either this _Section 2.01(e)_ or _Section 2.02(c)_, to extend the
successive 45-day or aggregate 120-day Suspension Period limitation for up to
an additional 15 days if (y) the Company has a proposal or plan with respect
to a material acquisition, merger, consolidation, tender offer, business
combination or other strategic transaction and (z) in the CompanyÂ’s good faith
judgment, the HoldersÂ’ use of Prospectus for sales of Registrable Shares
would adversely affect or interfere with such proposal or plan. Immediately
upon receipt of such notice, the Holders covered by the Shelf Registration
Statement (if any) shall discontinue the disposition of Registrable Shares
under such Shelf Registration Statement until notified by the Company in
writing. Each Holder shall keep confidential any communications received by it
from the Company regarding the suspension of, or the use of the Shelf
Registration Statement, except as required by applicable law or court order,
and, if so directed by the Company, shall deliver to the Company any copies
then in its possession of any Prospectus or Prospectus supplement. The Company
shall not provide any material non-public information to the Holders
in connection with notice of a Suspension Period unless requested by the
Majority Holder.

(f) If any of the Registrable Shares to be registered pursuant to a Shelf
Demand Offering are to be sold in a firm commitment underwritten offering and
the managing underwriter(s) of such underwritten offering advise the Holders
in writing that it is their opinion that the total number or dollar amount of
the Company Common Stock proposed to be sold in such offering exceeds the
total number or dollar amount of such securities that can be sold without
having an adverse effect on the price, timing or distribution of the
Registrable Shares to be so included, then there shall be included in such
firm commitment underwritten offering the number or dollar amount of the
Company Common Stock that in the opinion of such managing underwriter(s) can
be sold without so adversely affecting such offering, and such number of
shares of the Company Common Stock shall be allocated (i) first, to the
Holders pro rata based on the number of Registrable Shares beneficially owned
by each such Holder, and (ii) second, to any other Persons (including the
Company).

SECTION 2.02. _Demand Registration_.

 

(a) If the Company is unable to file, cause to be effective or maintain the
effectiveness of a Shelf Registration Statement as required under _Section
2.01_, the Majority Holder shall have the right by delivering a written notice
to the Company (a " _Demand Notice_ ") to require the Company to, pursuant to
the terms of this Agreement, register under and in accordance with the
provisions of the Securities Act all or any portion of its Registrable Shares
(a " _Demand Registration_ "). A Demand Notice shall specify the approximate
aggregate number of Registrable Shares requested by the Majority Holder to be
sold in such Demand Offering and the expected method or methods of disposition
of the applicable Registrable Shares. Simultaneously with delivery of a Demand
Notice to the Company, the Majority Holder shall deliver written notice of
such Demand Notice to (A) if delivery of the Demand Notice is on or

 



6  before the date that is 180 days after the Closing Date, each other Holder
(if any) that holds Registrable Shares on the date that such Demand Notice is
delivered to the Company, or (B) if delivery of the Demand Notice is more
than 180 days after the Closing Date, each other One Percent Holder (if any)
that holds Registrable Shares on the date that such Demand Notice is delivered
to the Company. The Company shall include in the Demand Offering covered by
such Demand Notice all Registrable Shares of each Holder with respect to which
the Company has received a written request for inclusion therein from such
Holder within ten Business Days after the Company has received the
Demand Notice; _provided_ , _however_ , that only One Percent Holders are
entitled to make a written request for inclusion if the applicable Demand
Notice was delivered to the Company more than 180 days after the Closing Date.
Following receipt of a Demand Notice, the Company shall use its reasonable
best efforts to file as promptly as reasonably practicable, but not later than
90 days after receipt by the Company of such Demand Notice (subject to
paragraph (c) of this  _Section 2.02_), a Registration Statement relating to
the offer and sale of the Registrable Shares requested to be included therein
by the Holders thereof in accordance with the methods of distribution elected
by such Holders (a " _Demand Registration Statement_ ") and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause such Registration Statement to be declared
effective under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after the filing
thereof. At any time prior to the effective date of such Registration
Statement, Holders may withdraw the Demand Notice or direction to the Company
to include them in the registration, as applicable, by giving written notice
to the Company. A Demand Notice withdrawn by the Majority Holder shall count
as one of the permitted Demand Registrations pursuant to _Section 2.03_
unless such withdrawal shall have been caused by the occurrence of an event or
series of related events that has a material adverse effect on the business,
assets, condition or results of operations of the Company.

(b) If any of the Registrable Shares to be registered pursuant to a Demand
Registration are to be sold in a firm commitment underwritten offering and the
managing underwriter(s) of such underwritten offering advise the Holders in
writing that it is their opinion that the total number or dollar amount of
the Company Common Stock proposed to be sold in such offering exceeds the
total number or dollar amount of such securities that can be sold without
having an adverse effect on the price, timing or distribution of the
Registrable Shares to be so included, then there shall be included in such
firm commitment underwritten offering the number or dollar amount of the
Company Common Stock that in the opinion of such managing underwriter(s) can
be sold without so adversely affecting such offering, and such number of the
Company Common Stock shall be allocated (i) first, to the Holders pro rata
based on the number of Registrable Shares beneficially owned by each such
Holder, and (ii) second, to any other Persons (including the Company).

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
Company shall be entitled, from time to time on or after the Closing Date, to
declare a Suspension Period, if the Company shall determine that the use of a
Prospectus for sales of Registrable Shares would (i) have an adverse effect on
a bona fide business or financing transaction of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary or (ii) require disclosure of material non-public information that,
if disclosed at such time, would be harmful to the Company or its
stockholders; _provided_ that such Suspension Period is for a reasonable
period of time not to exceed 45 days in succession (other than the Delay
Period) or 120 days in the aggregate in any 12-month period. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Company shall have the right, exercisable 

 



7  two times from and after the Closing Date under either _Section 2.01(e)_ or
this _Section 2.02(c)_, to extend the successive 45-day or aggregate 120-day
Suspension Period limitation for up to an additional 15 days if (y) the
Company has a proposal or plan with respect to a material acquisition, merger,
consolidation, tender offer, business combination or other strategic
transaction and (z) in the CompanyÂ’s good faith judgment, the HoldersÂ’ use of
Prospectus for sales of Registrable Shares would adversely affect or interfere
with such proposal or plan. Immediately upon receipt of such notice, the
Holders covered by the Demand Registration Statement shall discontinue the
disposition of Registrable Shares under such Demand Registration Statement
until notified by the Company in writing. Each Holder shall keep confidential
any communications received by it from the Company regarding the suspension
of, or the use of the Demand Registration Statement, except as required by
applicable law or court order, and, if so directed by the Company, shall
deliver to the Company any copies then in its possession of any Prospectus or
Prospectus supplement. The Company shall not provide any material non-public
information to the Holders in connection with notice of a Suspension Period
unless requested by the Majority Holder.

 

SECTION 2.03. _Limitation on Shelf Demand Offerings and Demand Registrations_.
The Company shall be obligated to effect a total of only three Shelf Demand
Offerings or Demand Registrations pursuant to _Sections 2.01_ and _2.02_ , in
the aggregate; _provided_ , _however_ , that (a) any such Shelf Demand
Offerings or Demand Registrations shall in no event be in an amount less than
$100,000,000 and (b) a registration shall not count as a Demand Registration
unless the Holders included in such registration are able to register and sell
at least 75% of the Registrable Shares requested to be included in such
registration. The Holders (as applicable) shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to coordinate the timing of any Shelf Demand Notices or Demand Notices
under _Section 2.01_ or _Section 2.02_ so as to not unduly burden the
Company in connection with its fulfilling its obligations under this _Article
II_.

plan or a transaction to which Rule 145 of the Securities Act is applicable, a
Registration Statement on Form S-4, S-8 or any successor form thereto or
another form not available for registering the Registrable Shares for sale to
the public or a registration to effect any block trade, overnight offering or
similar sale effected in the absence of any marketing period), whether for
its own account or for the account of one or more stockholders of the Company
and the form of Registration Statement to be used may be used for any
registration of Registrable Shares (a " _Piggyback Registration_ "),

reasonably practicable to the Majority Holder and all One Percent Holders of
its intention to effect such a registration and, subject to __

 



8   _Section _ _2.04(b)_ and _Section 2.04(c)_, shall include in such
registration all Registrable Shares with respect to which the Company has
received written requests for inclusion from the Majority Holder and the One
Percent Holders within five days after the CompanyÂ’s notice has been given to
each such holder. The Company may postpone or withdraw the filing or the
effectiveness of a Piggyback Registration at any time in its sole discretion.
A Piggyback Registration shall not be considered a Demand Registration for
purposes of _Section 2.03_.

(b) If a Piggyback Registration is initiated as a primary underwritten
offering on behalf of the Company, and the managing underwriter(s) of such
offering advise the Company in writing that it is their opinion that the
total number or dollar amount of the Company Common Stock proposed to be sold
in such offering exceeds the total number or dollar amount of shares of the
Company Common Stock that can be sold in such offering without having
an adverse effect on the price, timing or distribution of the Common Stock to
be sold in such offering, then the Company shall include in such registration

managing underwriter(s) of such offering advise the Company in writing that it
is their opinion that the total number or dollar amount of the Company
Common Stock proposed to be included in such offering exceeds the number or
dollar amount of shares of Company Common Stock that can be sold in such
offering without having an adverse effect on the price, timing or distribution
of the Company Common Stock to be sold in such offering, then the Company
shall include in such registration (i) first, the number of shares of the
Company Common Stock requested to be included therein by the holder(s)
requesting such registration and by the Holders, allocated pro rata among
such holders on the basis of the number of shares of the Company Common Stock
owned by all such holders; and (ii) second, the number of shares of the
Company Common Stock requested to be included therein by other holders of the

qualification or exception from qualification of any Registrable Shares for
sale in any jurisdiction or the initiation or threat of any proceeding for
such purpose; and (5) any event that makes any statement made in such
Registration Statement or related Prospectus or any document incorporated or
deemed to be incorporated therein by reference or any Issuer Free Writing
Prospectus related thereto untrue in any material respect or that requires
the making of any changes in such Registration Statement, Prospectus,
documents or Issuer Free Writing Prospectus so that, in the case of the
Registration Statement, it will not contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein, not misleading, and that
in the case of any Prospectus or Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, it will not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading;

 

(vii) (A) promptly notify in writing each Holder, at any time when a
Prospectus relating thereto is required to be delivered under the Securities
Act, upon discovery that the Prospectus included in such Registration
Statement, as then in effect, includes an untrue statement of a material fact
or omits to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and (B) promptly
prepare and furnish to such Holder a reasonable number of copies of a
supplement to or an amendment of such Prospectus as may be necessary so that,
as thereafter delivered to the purchasers of such Registrable Shares, such
Prospectus shall not include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading;

(viii) use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the withdrawal of any order
suspending the effectiveness of such Registration Statement, or the lifting
of any suspension of the qualification (or exemption from qualification) of
any of the Registrable Shares for sale in any jurisdiction at the reasonably
earliest practical date; 

(ix) cooperate with the Holders and the managing underwriter(s), if any, to
facilitate the timely preparation and delivery of certificates (which shall
not bear any restrictive legends) representing Registrable Shares to be sold
under any Registration Statement, and enable such Registrable Shares to be in
such denominations and registered in such names as the managing
underwriter(s) or selling Holders may request and keep available and make
available to the CompanyÂ’s transfer agent prior to the effectiveness of such
Registration Statement a supply of such certificates;

 



11 (x) in connection with an underwritten offering, enter into such
customary agreements (including underwriting and lock-up agreements in form,
scope and substance as is customary in underwritten offerings), and in
connection therewith, (i) make such representations and warranties to the
selling Holders and the managing underwriter(s), if any, with respect to the
business of the Company and its subsidiaries, and the Registration Statement,
Prospectus and documents, if any, incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by
reference therein, in each case, in form, substance and scope as are
customarily made by issuers in underwritten offerings, (ii) use its reasonable
best efforts to furnish to the managing underwriters, if any, 10b-5 statements
and opinions of counsel to the Company and updates thereof, addressed to the
managing underwriter(s), if any, covering the matters customarily covered by
10b-5 statements and in opinions requested in underwritten offerings, as the
case may be, (iii) use its reasonable best efforts to obtain "comfort"
letters and updates thereof from the independent certified public accountants
of the Company who have certified the financial statements included in such
Registration Statement, addressed to each selling Holder (unless
such accountants shall be prohibited from so addressing such letters by
applicable standards of the accounting profession, in which case an "agreed-
upon procedures" letter may be required) and each of the managing
underwriter(s), if any, such letters to be in customary form and covering
matters of the type customarily covered in "comfort" letters in connection
with underwritten offerings, (iv) if an underwriting agreement is entered
into, the same shall contain indemnification provisions and procedures
substantially to the effect set forth in _Section 2.07_ hereof with respect
to all parties to be indemnified pursuant to said Section, except as otherwise
agreed by the Majority Holder and the managing underwriter(s), and (v)
deliver such documents and certificates as may be reasonably requested by the
Majority Holder, its counsel and the managing underwriter(s), if any, to
evidence the continued validity of the representations and warranties made
pursuant to clause (i) above and to evidence compliance with any customary
conditions contained in the underwriting agreement. The above clauses (i)
through (v) shall be done at each closing under such underwriting agreement;

(xi) if requested by the managing underwriter(s), if any, or the Holders of a
majority of the Registrable Shares being sold in connection with an
underwritten offering, promptly include in a Prospectus supplement, post-
effective amendment or Issuer Free Writing Prospectus such information as the
managing underwriter(s), if any, or such Holders may reasonably request in
order to permit the intended method of distribution of such securities and
make all required filings of such Prospectus supplement, such post-effective
amendment or Issuer Free Writing Prospectus as soon as practicable after the
Company has received such request; and

(xii) upon the occurrence of any event described in _Section 2.05(a)(vi)(2)_
or _(5)_ , promptly prepare a supplement or post-effective amendment to the
Registration Statement or a supplement to the related Prospectus or any
document incorporated or deemed to be incorporated therein by reference or an
Issuer Free Writing Prospectus related thereto, or file any other required
document, as requested by the SEC or governmental entity (in the case of an
occurrence of an event described in _Section 2.05(a)(vi)(2)_) or so that, as
thereafter delivered to the selling Holders, such Registration Statement,
Prospectus or Issuer Free Writing Prospectus will not contain an untrue

 



12  statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading (in the case of an
occurrence of an event described in _Section 2.05(a)(v)(5)_).

(b) Without limiting the rights of the Company under _Sections 2.01(e)_ ,
_2.02(c)_ or _2.03_ , in connection with, and only in connection with, a
Registration Statement prepared pursuant to _Sections 2.01(c)_ or _2.02_
pursuant to which Registrable Shares will be offered and sold, the Company
shall use reasonable best efforts to make available upon reasonable notice for
inspection by any selling Holder, any underwriter participating in any
disposition pursuant to such Registration Statement and any attorney,
accountant or other agent retained by any such Holder or underwriter
(collectively, the " _Inspectors_ "), all financial and other records,
pertinent corporate documents and properties of the Company reasonably
requested by such Inspectors (collectively, the " _Records_ "), and cause the
CompanyÂ’s officers, directors and employees to supply all information
reasonably requested by any such Inspector in connection with
such Registration Statement.

(c) The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to qualify and remain
qualified to register securities under the Securities Act pursuant to a
Registration Statement on Form S-3 or any successor form thereto and take no
actions that would cause the Company to lose its status as a well-known
seasoned issuer (as defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act).

(d) The Company shall not include in any Shelf Demand Offering or Demand
Registration any securities that are not Registrable Shares without the prior
written consent of the Majority Holder, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed.

(e) Nothing in this Agreement shall require the Company to (i) qualify to do
business as a foreign corporation in any jurisdiction where it would not
otherwise be required to be so qualified, (ii) execute or file any general
consent to service of process under the laws of any jurisdiction, (iii) take
any action that would subject it to service of process in suits other than
those arising out of the offer and sale of the securities covered by the
registration statement in any jurisdiction where it is not already subject to
service of process, or (iv) subject itself to taxation in any jurisdiction
where it would not otherwise be obligated to do so.

 

(f) Each selling Holder agrees that, upon receipt of any notice from the
Company of the happening of any event of the kind described in  _Section
2.05(a)(vi)(2)_, _(3)_ , _(4)_ or _(5)_ hereof, such Holder will forthwith
discontinue disposition of such Registrable Shares covered by such
Registration Statement or Prospectus until such HolderÂ’s receipt of the
copies of the documents contemplated by _Section 2.05(a)(xii)_ hereof, or
until it is advised in writing by the Company that the use of the applicable
Prospectus may be resumed, and has received copies of any additional
or supplemental filings that are incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by
reference in such Prospectus.

(g) (i) Each Holder shall furnish to the Company in writing such information
regarding such Holder and its intended method of distribution of the
Registrable Shares as the Company may from time to time reasonably request,
including to the extent that such information is required in order for the
Company to comply with its obligations under all

 



13  applicable securities and other laws and to ensure that the Registration
Statement and Prospectus relating to such Registrable Shares conforms to the
applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the rules and regulations
thereunder. Each Holder shall promptly notify the Company in writing of any
inaccuracy or change in information previously furnished by such Holder to the
Company or of the occurrence of any event, in either case as a result of
which any Registration Statement or Prospectus relating to the Registrable
Shares contains or would contain an untrue statement of a material fact or
omits to state any material fact with respect to such Holder required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and promptly furnish
to the Company in writing any additional information required to correct and
update any previously furnished information or required so that such
prospectus shall not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading.

(ii) Any sale of any Registrable Shares by any Holder shall constitute a
representation and warranty by such Holder that the information relating to
such Holder and its plan of distribution is as set forth in the Prospectus
delivered by such Holder in connection with such disposition, that such
prospectus does not, as of the time of such sale, contain any untrue
statement of material fact relating to or provided by such Holder or its plan
of distribution and that such Prospectus does not, as of the time of such
sale, omit to state any material fact relating to or provided by such Holder
or its plan of distribution necessary to make the statements in such
Prospectus, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading.

 

(h) Without limiting any of the foregoing, in the event that any offering of
Registrable Shares is to be made by or through an underwriter, the investment
banker and managers that will administer the offering will be selected by the
Majority Holder, subject to approval by the Company, not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed.

 

(i) Each Holder agrees that upon receipt of any notice from the Company
pursuant to _Section 2.05(a)(vii)(A)_, such Holder shall forthwith (i)
discontinue such HolderÂ’s disposition of Registrable Shares pursuant to the
applicable Registration Statement and Prospectus relating thereto until (A)
such HolderÂ’s receipt of the copies of the supplemented or amended Prospectus
contemplated by _Section 2.05(a)(vii)(B)_ or (B) such Holder is advised in
writing by the Company that the use of the Prospectus may be resumed, and (ii)
if so directed by the Company, deliver to the Company (at the CompanyÂ’s
expense) all copies, other than permanent file copies, then in such HolderÂ’s
possession of the Prospectus covering Registrable Shares at the time of
receipt of such notice.

 

(j) As soon as reasonably practicable, but not less than six Business Days
before the expected filing date of each Registration Statement pursuant to
this Agreement, the Company shall notify each Holder who has timely provided
the requisite notice hereunder entitling the Holder to register Registrable
Shares in such Registration Statement of the information, documents and
instruments from such Holder that the Company or any underwriter reasonably
requests in connection with such Registration Statement, including a
questionnaire, custody agreement, power of attorney, lock-up letter and
underwriting agreement (the " _Requested Information_ "). If the Company has
not received, on or before the third day before the expected

 



14  filing date, the Requested Information from such Holder, the Company may
file the Registration Statement without including Registrable Shares of such
Holder. The failure to so include in any Registration Statement the
Registrable Shares of a Holder (with regard to that Registration Statement)
shall not in and of itself result in any liability on the part of the Company
to such Holder.

 

SECTION 2.06. _Registration Expenses_. The Company shall pay the fees and
disbursements of the CompanyÂ’s counsel and accountants in connection with any
registration of any Registrable Shares and all registration and filing fees
and printing costs, _provided_ that the Holders shall pay all of the fees and
expenses of their own counsel and each Holder shall bear all agent fees,
underwriting fees or discounts and any commissions associated with the sale of
Registrable Shares by such Holder.

SECTION 2.07. _Indemnification; Contribution_.

(a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, (i) each Holder and, as applicable, its affiliates,
officers, directors, employees, representatives and agents (collectively, the
" _Holder Indemnified Persons_ ") and (ii) each Person who controls (within
the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act and Section 20 of the Exchange
Act) any such Holder Indemnified Person, in each case, from and against all
losses, claims, actions, judgments, damages, liabilities, costs and expenses,
including reasonable expenses of investigation and reasonable attorneysÂ’ fees
and expenses (collectively, " _Losses_ ") caused by, arising out of, resulting
from, based on or relating to (A) any untrue statement or alleged untrue
statement of a material fact contained in any Registration Statement,
Prospectus or preliminary Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto,
or any documents incorporated therein by reference, or (B) any omission or
alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each
case, except insofar as the same are caused by any information furnished to
the Company by any Holder Indemnified Persons or Underwriter Indemnified
Person expressly for inclusion therein. In connection with an Underwritten
Offering and without limiting any of the CompanyÂ’s other obligations under
this Agreement, the Company shall also provide customary indemnities to (i)
such underwriters and their affiliates, officers, directors, employees,
representatives and agents (collectively, the " _Underwriter
Indemnified Persons_ ") and (ii) each Person who controls (within the meaning
of Section 15 of the Securities Act and Section 20 of the Exchange Act) any
such Underwriter Indemnified Person to the same extent as provided above with
respect to the indemnification (and exceptions thereto) of the Holder
Indemnified Person and the Person controlling such Holder Indemnified Persons,
except insofar as the same are caused by any information furnished to the
Company by any Holder Indemnified Persons or Underwriter Indemnified Person
expressly for inclusion therein.

(b) In connection with any Registration Statement in which a Holder of
Registrable Shares is participating, each participating Holder will furnish to
the Company in writing information regarding such HolderÂ’s ownership of
Registrable Shares and its intended method of distribution thereof and, to
the fullest extent permitted by law, shall, severally and not jointly,
indemnify (i) the Company and its affiliates, directors, officers, employees,
representatives and agents (collectively, the " _Company Indemnified Persons_
") and (ii) each Person who controls (within the meaning of Section 15 of the
Securities Act and Section 20 of the Exchange Act) any

 



15  such Company Indemnified Person against all Losses caused by (A) any untrue
statement of material fact contained in the Registration Statement, Prospectus
or preliminary Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any
documents incorporated therein by reference, or (B) any omission to state
therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading, but, in each case, only to the extent that
such untrue statement or omission is caused by any information furnished in
writing by such Holder Indemnified Person expressly for inclusion therein;
_provided_ , _however_ , that each HolderÂ’s obligation to indemnify the
Company hereunder shall, to the extent more than one Holder is subject to the
same indemnification obligation, be apportioned between each Holder based upon
the net amount received by each Holder from the sale of Registrable
Shares, as compared to the total net amount received by all of the Holders
holding Registrable Shares sold pursuant to such Registration Statement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Holder shall be liable to the Company for
amounts in excess of the lesser of (x) such apportionment and (y) the amount
received by such holder in the offering giving rise to such liability. In
connection with an Underwritten Offering and without limiting any of the other
obligations of the Holders under this Agreement, the Holders shall also
provide customary indemnities to (i) such Underwriter Indemnified Persons and
(ii) each Person who controls (within the meaning of Section 15 of the
Securities Act and Section 20 of the Exchange Act) any such Underwriter
Indemnified Person to the same extent as provided above with respect to the
indemnification (and exceptions thereto) of the Company Indemnified Person and
the Person controlling such Company Indemnified Persons.

 

(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under _Section 2.07(a) _or
_Section 2.07(b)_ of written notice of the commencement of any action or
proceeding for which indemnification under _Section 2.07(a) _or _Section
2.07(b)_ may be requested, such indemnified party shall notify the
indemnifying party in writing of the commencement of such action or
proceeding; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not
relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party in
respect of such action or proceeding hereunder unless the indemnifying party
was materially prejudiced by such failure of the indemnified party to give
such notice, and in no event shall such omission relieve the indemnifying
party from any other liability it may have to such indemnified party. In case
any such action or proceeding shall be brought against any indemnified party
and it shall notify an indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, such
indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent
that it shall determine, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly
notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory
to such indemnified party, and, after notice from the indemnifying party to
such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, such
indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party for any legal
or any other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in
connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs
of investigation; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) if the indemnifying party
fails to take reasonable steps necessary to defend diligently the action or
proceeding within 45 days after receiving notice from such indemnified party
that the indemnified party believes it has failed to do so; or (ii) if
representation of both parties by the same counsel is otherwise inappropriate
under applicable standards of professional conduct, then, in any such case,
the indemnified party shall have the right to assume or continue its own
defense as set forth above (but with no more than one firm of counsel for all
indemnified parties in each jurisdiction plus any necessary local counsel as
determined by the indemnified party) and the indemnifying party shall be
liable for any expenses

 



16  therefor (including, without limitation, any such reasonable counselÂ’s
fees). If the indemnifying party is not entitled to, or elects not to, assume
the defense of a claim, it will not be obligated to pay the fees and expenses
of more than one counsel for each indemnified party with respect to such
claim. The indemnifying party will not be subject to any liability for any
settlement made without its consent, not to be unreasonably withheld or
delayed. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the
indemnified party, compromise or consent to entry of any judgment or enter
into any settlement agreement with respect to any action or proceeding in
respect of which indemnification is sought under _Section 2.07(a) _or
_Section 2.07(b)_ (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or
potential party thereto), unless such compromise, consent or settlement is
solely for monetary damages and includes an unconditional release of the
indemnified party from all liability in respect of such claim or litigation,
and does not include a statement or admission of fault, culpability or a
failure to act, by or on behalf of the indemnified party.

(d) If recovery is not available or insufficient to hold harmless an
indemnified party in respect of any Losses under the foregoing
indemnification provisions for any reason or reasons other than as specified
therein, any Person who would otherwise be entitled to indemnification by the
terms thereof shall nevertheless be entitled to contribution with respect to
any Losses with respect to which such Person would be entitled to such
indemnification but for such reason or reasons. In determining the amount of
contribution to which the respective Persons are entitled, there shall be
considered the PersonsÂ’ relative fault, relative knowledge and access to
information concerning the matter with respect to which the claim was
asserted, the opportunity to correct and prevent any statement or omission and
other equitable considerations appropriate under the circumstances. It is
hereby agreed that it would not necessarily be equitable if the amount of such
contribution were determined by pro rata or per capita allocation. No Person
guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f)
of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any Person who
was not found guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, no Holder shall be required to make a contribution in excess of
the net amount received by such holder from its sale of Registrable Shares in
connection with the offering that gave rise to the contribution obligation.

SECTION 2.08. _Rule 144 Reporting_. With a view to making available to the
Holders of Registrable Shares the benefits of certain rules and regulations of
the SEC that may permit the sale of the Registrable Shares to the public
without registration, the Company agrees to use its reasonable best efforts
to:

(a) make and keep current public information available, within the meaning of
Rule 144 or any similar or analogous rule promulgated under the Securities
Act, at all times that it is subject to the reporting requirements of the
Exchange Act;

 

(b) file with the SEC, in a timely manner, all reports and other documents
required under the Securities Act and Exchange Act (at all times that it is
subject to such reporting requirements); and

(c) so long as any party hereto owns any Registrable Shares, furnish to such
Person forthwith upon request a written statement as to its compliance with
the reporting requirements of said Rule 144, the Securities Act and the
Exchange Act (at any time that it is subject to such 

 



17  reporting requirements); a copy of its most recent annual or quarterly
report; and such other reports and documents as such Person may reasonably
request in availing itself of any rule or regulation of the SEC allowing it
to sell any such securities without registration.

SECTION 2.09. _Delay of Registration_. No Holder shall have any right to
obtain or seek an injunction restraining or otherwise delaying any
registration as the result of any controversy that might arise with respect to
the interpretation or implementation of this  _Article 2_.

SECTION 2.10. _Grant of Registration Rights to Third Parties_. Nothing in this
Agreement shall limit the CompanyÂ’s ability to grant to any third party, in
its sole and absolute discretion, rights with respect to the registration of
any securities issued or to be issued by the Company.

 

ARTICLE III

 

STANDSTILL

 

SECTION 3.01. _Standstill_.

(a) Until the date that is two years after the Closing Date (such period being
the " _Standstill Period_ "), each Holder agrees that neither it nor any of
its controlled affiliates, acting alone or as part of a "group" (as defined
under the Exchange Act), will in any manner, directly or indirectly:

(i) make any public announcement with respect to, effect or seek, offer or
propose (whether publicly or otherwise) to effect, or cause or participate in
or assist any other Person to effect or seek, offer or propose (whether
publicly or otherwise) to effect or participate in, (A) any acquisition of any
securities (or "beneficial ownership" (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the
Exchange Act) thereof) of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, any warrant
or option to purchase such securities or all or a substantial portion of the
assets of the Company, any security convertible into any such securities, or
any right to acquire such securities; (B) any tender or exchange offer or
merger or other business combination involving the Company or any of its
subsidiaries; (C) any recapitalization, restructuring, liquidation,
dissolution or other extraordinary transaction with respect to the Company or
any of its subsidiaries; or (D) any "solicitation" of "proxies" (as such
terms are used in the proxy rules of the SEC) or consents to vote, or seek to
advise or influence any Person with respect to the voting of, any voting
securities of the Company; _provided_ that none of the actions contemplated
by clause (A) of this paragraph (i) shall be deemed to occur solely due to (x)
a stock split, reverse stock split, reclassification, reorganization or
other transaction by the Company affecting any class of the outstanding
capital stock of the Company generally or (y) a stock dividend or other pro
rata distribution by the Company to holders of its outstanding capital stock;

 

(ii) make any public announcement with respect to, or effect or seek, offer or
propose (whether publicly or otherwise) to effect, or cause or participate in
or assist any other Person to effect or seek, offer or propose (whether
publicly or otherwise) to effect or participate in any acquisition of all or a
material portion of the assets of the Company or any of its subsidiaries;

 



18 (iii) form, advise, join or in any way participate in a group in
connection with any of the types of matters set forth in paragraphs (i) or
(ii) above;

(iv) otherwise act, alone or in concert with others, to seek to control or
influence the management, Board of Directors or policies of the Company or any
of its subsidiaries;

(v) take any action which would reasonably be expected to require the Company
to make a public announcement regarding any of the types of matters set forth
in paragraphs (i) or (ii) above; or 

(vi) advise, assist or encourage, or enter into any discussions, agreements or
arrangements with, any third party with respect to any of the foregoing.

(b) Each Holder also agrees during the Standstill Period not to request
the Company (or its directors, officers, employees or agents), directly or
indirectly, to amend or waive any provision of this paragraph (including this
sentence).

(c) For purposes of this Agreement, a Person shall also be deemed to have "
_beneficial ownership_ " of any securities that are the subject of a
derivative transaction entered into by such Person, or derivative security
acquired by such Person, which gives such Person the economic equivalent of
ownership of an amount of such securities due to the fact that the value of
the derivative is explicitly determined by reference to the price or value of
such securities, without regard to whether (i) such derivative conveys any
voting rights in such securities to such Person, (ii) the derivative is
required to be, or capable of being, settled through delivery of such
securities or (iii) such Person may have entered into other transactions that
hedge the economic effect of such derivative.

ARTICLE IV

MISCELLANEOUS

SECTION 4.01. _Effectiveness and Termination_. The terms and conditions set
forth in this Agreement shall become effective as of the Closing Date and
shall continue in effect until all the Acquisition Shares have ceased to be
Registrable Shares; _provided_ , that the provisions of _Sections 2.06_ ,
_2.07_ and _3.01_ shall survive any such termination. If for any reason the
Purchase Agreement terminates, then this Agreement shall be of no force or
effect and there shall not be any liabilities of any kind hereunder.

SECTION 4.02.  _Successors and Assigns; Third Party Beneficiaries_.

(a) This Agreement and all of the provisions hereto shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns, but neither this Agreement nor
any of the rights, interests or obligations set forth herein shall be assigned
by any party hereto without the prior written consent of the other parties
hereto, except as set forth in _Section 4.02(b)_, and any purported
assignment without such consent shall be void. This Agreement shall be binding
upon a party hereto only upon the manual execution and delivery (which

19 (b) The rights to cause the Company to register Registrable Shares pursuant to
_Article II_ may be assigned (but only with all related obligations) by a
Holder to a Transferee of such securities that (a) is an affiliate,
subsidiary, parent, member, retired member partner, limited partner, retired
partner or stockholder of a Holder, or (b) is a HolderÂ’s family member or
trust for the benefit of an individual Holder, _provided_ : (i) the Company
is, substantially contemporaneously with such Transfer, furnished with written
notice of the name and address of such Transferee or assignee and the
securities with respect to which such registration rights are being assigned;
(ii) such Transferee or assignee agrees in writing to be bound by and subject
to the terms and conditions of this Agreement by duly executing and
delivering to the Company an Instrument of Adherence in the form attached as
_Exhibit A_ hereto (an " _Instrument of Adherence_ "); (iii) such assignment
shall be effective only if immediately following such Transfer the further
disposition of such securities by the Transferee or assignee is restricted
under the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws and (iv) such
Transfer may otherwise be and is effected in accordance with applicable
federal and state securities laws and any other applicable agreements or
instruments by which such Holder is bound.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, and

Registrable Shares after such Transfer, (i) such Holder must notify in writing
the Company, substantially contemporaneously with such Transfer, of the name
and address of such Transferee and the securities being so Transferred; (ii)
such Holder must cause such Transferee to be bound by and subject to the terms
and conditions of _Article III_ by requiring such Transferee to duly execute
and deliver to the Company a Standstill Instrument of Adherence in the form
attached as _Exhibit B_ hereto (a " _Standstill Instrument of Adherence_ ");
and (iii) such Transfer may otherwise be and is effected in accordance with
applicable federal and state securities laws and any other applicable
agreements or instruments by which such Holder is bound.

SECTION 4.03. _Amendments; Waiver_. This Agreement may be amended by the
Company and the Majority Holder at any time, but only by an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of each of the Company and the Majority Holder. Any
such amendment shall be binding on all other Holders, whether or not they
execute such amendment. Any failure of any of the parties to comply with any
obligation, covenant, agreement or condition herein may be waived at any time
by any of the parties entitled to the benefit thereof only by a written
instrument signed by each such party granting such waiver, but such waiver or
failure to insist upon strict compliance with such obligation, representation,
warranty, covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of
or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure.

contravention or invalidity shall not invalidate the entire Agreement. Such
provision shall be deemed to be modified to the extent necessary to render it
legal, valid and enforceable, and if no such modification shall render it
legal, valid and enforceable, then this Agreement shall be construed as if
not containing the provision held to be invalid, and the rights and
obligations of the parties shall be construed and enforced accordingly.

specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in any court of the
United States or any state having jurisdiction, this being in addition to any
other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.
