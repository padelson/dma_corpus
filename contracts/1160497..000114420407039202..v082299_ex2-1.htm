assets of  any  Company Group Plans;

 

 

(vi) Cash  (except for cash expressly included as Acquired Assets);

 

 

(vii) any  interest bearing securities;

 

 

(viii) the  corporate charters, minutes and stock record books and corporate
seals  and  statutory accounts and Tax Returns of each Asset Seller;

 

 

(ix) any  confidentiality or other agreements relating to the potential sale
of the  Business;

 

 

(x) any  capital stock of or any equity interest in any Person other than the
Sold  Companies (except for the capital stock of or equity interest in
joint  venture  companies to the extent that such joint venture companies
are designated  as Sold  Companies);

 

 

(xi) except  as  set forth in Section 2.2(b)(iv) and 2.2(b)(xvi), any
rights, privileges  and  claims under any insurance policy, program or
arrangement (including, for  the  avoidance of doubt, under any workers
compensation policy, program or  arrangement), except, for the avoidance of
doubt, for insurance policies  that  are owned by a Sold Company primarily
for the Business; and

 

 

(xii) all  rights, claims and credits to the extent arising out of or
primarily relating  to  any Excluded Asset or any Excluded Liability,
including claims in bankruptcy,  and any such items arising under guarantees,
warranties, offsets, indemnities  and all other intangible property rights or
claims and similar rights in  favor  of any Asset Seller or any of its
Affiliates arising out of or primarily  relating to any Excluded Asset or any

(d) On  the  Closing Date and subject to the terms and conditions set forth
in this  Agreement, the Stock Sellers will sell, convey, assign and transfer

of such Stock  Sellers' right, title and interest in and to the Sold Shares

other than such as may be created by or on  behalf  of the Buyers.

 

 

(e) Notwithstanding  anything in this Agreement to the contrary other than
expressly set forth  in  Section 2.4, this Agreement shall not constitute an
agreement to assign  any  asset or any claim or right or any benefit arising
under or resulting from  such  asset if an attempted assignment thereof,
without the Consent of a third  party,  would constitute a breach or other
contravention of the rights of such  third  party, would be ineffective with
respect to any party to an agreement concerning  such asset, or would
materially and adversely affect the rights of any  Asset  Seller or, upon
transfer, any Asset Buyer under such asset. If any transfer  or  assignment
by any Asset Seller to, or any assumption by any Asset Buyer  of, any 
interest in, or liability, obligation or commitment under, any asset
requires  the Consent of a third party, then such assignment or assumption
shall  be made  subject to such Consent being obtained. Without limiting the
Sellers' obligations hereunder, including under Section 5.4, if any such
Consent  is not  obtained prior to the Closing, the Asset Sellers, on the
one hand, and  the Asset  Buyers, on the other, shall cooperate with one
another in structuring and  documenting any lawful and reasonable arrangement
under which the Asset  Buyers  shall obtain the economic benefits of the
asset, claim or right with respect  to  which the Consent has not been
obtained in accordance with this Agreement.  Such  reasonable arrangement
may include (i) the subcontracting, sublicensing  or  subleasing to an Asset
Buyer of any and all rights of the Asset Sellers  against  the other party
to such third-party agreement, and (ii) the enforcement  by the  Asset
Sellers of such rights in respect of such asset.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(f) Wherever  required or appropriate under local Laws and practices, the
applicable  Buyers  and Sellers shall enter into appropriate local transfer
agreements, governed  by  local Laws, for the transfer of the relevant
Acquired Assets or Sold Shares.  Buyers and Sellers shall cooperate in good
faith in the identification  of all  such local requirements and the
preparation of such transfer  agreements.

work performed, by  or on  behalf of the Business before, on or after the

Buyer Tax Act, and (ii) for any period (or portion  thereof in the case of a
Straddle Period) ending on or prior to the Closing  Date  (but, with respect
to this clause (ii), only for the Taxes identified on  the  Final Statement
of Net Asset Value and only to the extent of the amounts  reflected on such

of employee  benefits to the extent expressly provided in Section 5.9;

 

 

(viii) to  the  maximum extent permitted by Law, all liabilities,

commitments  relating  to or arising under any Environmental, Safety and
Health Laws or relating  to  Hazardous Materials, to the extent such
liabilities, obligations and commitments  pertain to the Business, its
operations or its properties, in all cases,  regardless of when incurred and
regardless whether any event or condition  giving  rise to any such
liability, obligation or commitment occurred or existed  as of,  prior to,
or after the Closing Date; and

 

 

(xii) all  other  accrued liabilities (A) reflected as accrued liabilities
on the face of  the  Balance Sheet of the Business or (B) accrued by any
Asset Seller in the  ordinary  course of business consistent with past
practice and not in violation of  the  terms of this Agreement in respect of
the Business after December 31, 2006  (and  prior to the Closing Date)
which, if they had been accrued by such Asset  Seller  as of December 31,
2006 would have been so reflected on the face of the  Balance  Sheet using
the same methodology and criteria used in preparing the Balance  Sheet, as
such accrued liabilities exist as of the Closing Date or otherwise  incurred
outside the ordinary course of business but reflected on the Final  Statement
of Net Asset Value.

(iii) all  liabilities for Taxes, whether or not accrued, assessed or
currently due  and  payable, relating to the operation or ownership of the

Closing Date, except for  Taxes  identified on the Final Statement of Net
Asset Value but only to the extent  of  the amounts reflected on such Final

to asbestos  or silica  exposure but only with respect to any and all
amounts under subclauses  (x) and  (y) in the aggregate in excess of
$15,000,000, net of any insurance proceeds  received and paid to Buyers
pursuant to the following proviso; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  with  respect
to liabilities, obligations or commitments arising in this clause  (vi)  in
respect of any legal actions filed as of the date hereof, the Buyers  and
the  Sellers will use commercially reasonable efforts (excluding, however,
any  obligation to pay additional fees, premiums or other amounts to the
extent  the  other party does not agree in writing to promptly reimburse
such additional  fees, premiums or other amounts) to (A) continue after the
Closing any  existing  insurance coverage that may be provided by such
party's third-party insurance  policies for such liabilities, obligations or

that  Seller shall have the right to assume the defense of any such legal
actions  in  accordance with the terms set forth in Section 9.6 as if Seller

SECTION  2.3. _Consideration_

in this  Agreement, in consideration of the sale, assignment and transfer of
the  Sold  Shares and the Acquired Assets, the Buyers will pay to the
Sellers  $4,900,000,000 by wire transfer of immediately available funds in
U.S.  dollars,  free and clear of any withholdings or other deductions,
except to the extent  required by any U.S. local, state, federal or foreign
Laws, (subject to  the  subsequent sentence of this Section 2.3(a)), plus
Estimated Cash (the " _Initial  Purchase Price_ ," and  as  adjusted
pursuant to Section 2.3(b) and Section 2.6, the " _Purchase  Price_ "). 
The  parties agree that, to the extent required by applicable Law in any
non-U.S.  jurisdiction in which Acquired Assets or Sold Shares are being
transferred  on  the Closing Date, the applicable Buyer will pay the
applicable Seller the  applicable portion of the Initial Purchase Price (as
allocated pursuant  to  _Schedule  2.7_   or  otherwise agreed by the
parties) by wire transfer of immediately available  funds  in local
currency, at the then prevailing spot currency exchange rate as  published by
the Wall Street Journal on the Business Day prior to the Closing  Date.

 

 

(b) No  later  than two Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Sellers
shall deliver  to  Buyer Parents a good faith estimate of cash on the
balance sheets of the  Sold  Companies as of the Closing Date, net of any
Indebtedness of the Sold Companies  that is an Assumed Liability ("
_Closing  Date Cash_ ",  and  such estimate, the " _Estimated  Cash_ "). 
Pursuant to the procedures set forth in Section 2.6 in respect of the Net 
Asset  Value Statement, following the Closing the parties shall calculate
and  agree  upon Closing Date Cash. To the extent Estimated Cash exceeds
Closing Date  Cash,  the applicable Seller shall pay to the applicable Buyer
such excess in  U.S.  dollars at the spot currency exchange rate in effect
on the Closing Date  as  published by the Wall Street Journal. To the extent
Closing Date Cash exceeds  Estimated Cash, the applicable Buyer shall pay to
the applicable Seller  such  excess in U.S. dollars at the spot currency
exchange rate in effect on  the  Closing Date as published by the Wall
Street Journal. Such payment shall  be made  contemporaneously with payments
between the parties pursuant to Section  2.6(e). 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

SECTION  2.4. _The  Closing_

 

 

(a) Unless  this Agreement shall have been terminated pursuant to Article
VIII, and  subject  to satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in
Articles VI and  VII,  the closing (the " _Closing_ ")  of the 
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall take place at the offices 
of  Simpson Thacher and Bartlett LLP, 425 Lexington Avenue, New York City, on
a  day that is at least five Business Days following the satisfaction or
waiver  of  all of the conditions set forth in Articles VI and VII hereof
(the " _Closing  Date_ "),  or at  such other place and time as may be
agreed upon by IR and Buyer Parents.  The  parties will use reasonable
efforts to schedule the Closing Date for the  last  day of a calendar month.
Unless the parties agree otherwise, the Closing  will be  deemed to have
occurred at the close of business local time in each applicable  jurisdiction
on the Closing Date.

 

 

(b) Deferred  Items - Government Approvals.

 

 

(i) If,  on  the Closing Date:

 

 

(A)  (x)  (1) any Seller or applicable Buyer has not obtained any required
Consent  of a  Governmental Authority in India, the People's Republic of
China or the Czech  Republic or any shareholder approval in India legally
required in order  to  transfer (directly or indirectly) any Sold Shares or
any Acquired Assets  or (2)  the Sellers have not completed the necessary
restructuring steps to separate  the  Sellers' other Czech or Irish
businesses from the businesses that are included  in the Business
(collectively, the " _Restructurings_ ")  and  are prevented from
transferring (directly or indirectly) any Sold Shares  or  Acquired Assets
of such Czech or Irish Businesses (the Sold Shares and  Acquired  Assets
referred to in clauses (1) and (2), collectively, the " _Deferred  Items_
"),  and  (y) all other conditions precedent to the Closing have been
satisfied or  waived,  or

 

 

(B)  (x)  there is in effect any injunction, restraining order or decree of
any nature  of  any Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction in
India, the People's  Republic of China, the Czech Republic or the Republic of
Ireland or any  Law or  Order in India, the People's Republic of China, the
Czech Republic or the  Republic of Ireland that (1) restrains or prohibits
the transfer to the  applicable Buyer of the Deferred Items or (2) delays the
Restructurings,  in each  case, that is not permanent or remains appealable
(a " _Non-Final  Injunction_ "),  and  (y) all other conditions precedent
to the Closing have been satisfied or  waived.

 

 

such  Deferred Items shall be withheld from transfer on the Closing Date
without  any  reduction in the Initial Purchase Price (except as
contemplated below).  From and  after the Closing, the Sellers and the
Buyers shall continue to use commercially  reasonable efforts to obtain all
such Consents relating to the Deferred  Items or  the transfer thereof,
complete the Restructurings, and/or to cause all  Non-Final  Injunctions
relating to the Deferred Items or the transfer thereof to be  lifted.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(ii) From  and  after the Closing, and until such time as the Deferred Items
have been  transferred to the applicable Buyer pursuant to Section
2.4(b)(iii) or  Section  2.4(b)(iv) (each, a " _Deferred  Transfer_ "), 
the  Deferred Items shall be held for such Buyer's benefit and account and
shall be  managed and operated by the Sellers for such Buyer's benefit and
account, with  all gains, income, losses, Taxes and Tax benefits or other
items generated  thereby to be for such Buyer's account. The applicable
Seller(s) and Buyer(s)  shall use their respective commercially reasonable
efforts to allow the  Buyers  to maintain the uninterrupted use and benefit
of any Deferred Item to the  date  of its Deferred Transfer, and to protect
and preserve the value of the  Deferred  Items during such period. Except as
otherwise contemplated by this Section  2.4(b) or the other provisions of
this Agreement, the Deferred Items shall  be  operated on a basis consistent
with past practice and the Sellers' pre-Closing  obligations pursuant to
Section 5.1 under this Agreement shall continue  in force  with respect to
such Deferred Item until its Deferred Transfer occurs.  The  Buyers and the
Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts to minimize  any  Tax
liability resulting from Deferred Transfers. IR and its Affiliates  shall 
have no liability, obligation or commitment to any Buyer arising out of 
the  management or operation of Deferred Items other than for breach of
this  Agreement, gross negligence or willful misconduct, for which breach,
gross  negligence or willful misconduct IR and its Affiliates will indemnify
the  Buyers; _provided_ ,  that IR  and its Affiliates will have no
liability, obligation or commitment for  actions  taken in accordance with
the request or direction of Buyer Parents or their  Affiliates. Except (i) as
set forth in the immediately preceding sentence  or  (ii) to the extent
relating to or arising from a breach of this Agreement,  gross  negligence
or willful misconduct by the Sellers, the Buyers shall reimburse  the 
Sellers and shall indemnify and hold the Sellers harmless from and against 
all  liabilities, obligations and commitments, incurred or asserted as a
result  of  the Sellers' post-Closing direct or indirect ownership,
management or operation  of the Deferred Items, including, without
limitation, the amount of any  additional Taxes payable (or carried-forward
Tax losses or credits consumed)  by  the Sellers (whether currently or in
the future), after application of  the terms  of this Agreement, as a result
thereof in excess of the amount of Taxes  which  would have been payable by
the Sellers, after application of the terms  of this  Agreement, if the
Deferred Items had been transferred to the applicable  Buyer on  the Closing
Date.

 

 

(iii) If  the  Deferred Transfer of any Deferred Item shall not have
happened by December  31,  2007, Buyer Parents may, by delivery of written
notice to IR, request that  the  parties expeditiously identify alternative
means or structures by which  any  remaining Deferred Items (and/or the
benefits thereof) may be transferred  (or  otherwise made available) to the
applicable Buyer, and IR will cause the  applicable Seller(s) to effect such
transfer by such alternative means  or  structure as the Buyer Parents may
reasonably request; _provided_ ,  that  the applicable Seller and applicable
Buyer shall share equally any incremental  transfer costs and Taxes
associated with such alternative.

 

 

(iv) Subject  to Section 2.4(b)(v), the closing of a transfer of each
Deferred Item shall  be  effected on the fifth Business Day after receipt of
all applicable legally  required Consents, the completion of a Restructuring
and the lifting of  all  applicable Non-Final Injunctions, or at such other
time as the parties  may  agree.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(v) At  any  time on or after the date that is the first anniversary of the
Closing  Date, so  long as Buyer Parents' failure to comply with the last
sentence of Section  2.4(b)(i) is not the primary cause of the failure of any
Deferred Item  to be  transferred, Buyer Parents may, by delivery of written
notice to IR (each  an " _Abandonment  Notice_ "),  elect  to abandon the
purchase of the remaining Deferred Items. As promptly as  practicable
following the delivery of an Abandonment Notice, each of IR  and  Buyer
Parents shall use its reasonable best efforts to restore the other  party 
to the position it would have been in with respect to the remaining Deferred 
Items had such items been Excluded Assets, which efforts shall include, 
without  limitation, the following:

 

 

(A) IR  shall  pay to Buyer Parents by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to  an  account specified in writing by Buyer Parents an
amount equal to the amount  of  the Purchase Price allocated to the
remaining Deferred Items identified  in such  Abandonment Notice as set
forth on _Schedule  2.7_ ,  together with interest thereon  computed at the
Prime Rate for the period from the Closing Date to the  date of  such
payment;  and

 

 

(B) Buyer  Parents shall deliver to IR a statement reflecting the payments it
has  made to  IR (" _Payments_ ")  and  payments it has received from IR
(" _Receipts_ ")  in  respect of all gains, income, losses, Taxes and Tax
benefits or other items  generated by a remaining Deferred Item for the
applicable Buyer's account. If  aggregate Payments exceed aggregate Receipts,
IR shall promptly pay  to  Buyer Parents by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account  specified in writing by Buyer Parents an
amount equal to the amount by  which  aggregate Payments exceed aggregate
Receipts. If  aggregate Receipts exceed aggregate Payments, Buyer Parents
shall promptly  pay  to IR  by wire transfer of immediately available funds
to an account specified  in  writing by IR an amount equal to the amount by
which aggregate Receipts  exceed  aggregate Payments. Any disputes with
respect to the statement delivered  by  Buyer Parents hereunder shall be
resolved in the manner provided in Section  2.6  for resolution of disputes
relating to the Net Asset Value  Statement.

 

 

SECTION  2.5. _Deliveries  at the Closing_

 

 

(a) At  or  prior to the Closing, the Asset Sellers shall deliver or cause
to be delivered  or made available to the Asset Buyers the following:

(iv) with  respect to each parcel of Owned Real Property that is owned by an
Asset  Seller,  a duly executed and acknowledged special warranty deed (or
local legal  equivalent), in each case in proper recordable form and
sufficient to vest  in  the Buyer good and marketable title to each such
parcel of Owned Real Property,  in each case free and clear of all
Encumbrances other than Permitted  Encumbrances (collectively, the " _Deeds_

SECTION  2.6. _Post-Closing  Purchase Price Adjustment_

 

 

(a)  Within  30  days after the Closing Date, the Buyers shall make
available or deliver to  the  Sellers the working trial balances and related
books and records as of the  Closing Date for the Acquired Assets, Sold
Shares and Assumed Liabilities (to  the extent within Buyers' possession
after the Closing Date). Within 60 days  after all such materials described
in the preceding sentence have been received  by Sellers or made available to
the Sellers, the Sellers will prepare, or cause  to be prepared, a statement
containing a calculation of the Net Asset Value  as  of the Closing (the "
_Net  Asset Value Statement_ "),  which  shall be prepared in accordance
with the definition of Net Asset Value, and  related supplemental schedules
for the Acquired Assets, Sold Shares and Assumed  Liabilities. " _Net  Asset
Value_ " shall  mean the book value of the Acquired Assets (excluding any
Excluded Assets)  less  Assumed Liabilities (excluding any Excluded
Liabilities) of the Business, and  the book value of the assets and
liabilities of the Sold Companies, determined  on a combined basis in
accordance with Modified GAAP applied on a basis  consistent with, and
reflecting all categories of adjustments on, the Base  Statement of Net Asset
Value. The Buyers will assist and cooperate with the  Sellers in the
preparation of the Net Asset Value Statement, including by  providing the
Sellers and their accountants access to any information necessary  to prepare
the Net Asset Value Statement.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b)  The  Buyers shall, within 60 days after the delivery by the Sellers of
the Net Asset  Value Statement, complete their review of the Net Asset Value
Statement. The  Sellers shall make reasonably available to the Buyer all
relevant books and  records, any work papers (including those of its
accountants) and supporting  documentation relating to the Net Asset Value
Statement and all other items  reasonably required by the Buyers. In the
event that the Buyers determine that  the Net Asset Value Statement has not
been prepared on a basis consistent with  the requirements of Section 2.6(a),
the Buyers shall, on or before the last  day  of such 60-day period, inform
the Sellers in writing (the " _Objection_ "),  setting forth a specific
description of the basis of the Objection, the  adjustments to the Net Asset
Value Statement which the Buyers believe should  be  made, and the Buyers'
calculation of the Net Asset Value, and the Buyers shall  be deemed to have
accepted any items not specifically disputed in the Objection.  Failure to so
notify the Sellers shall constitute acceptance and approval of  the 
Sellers' calculation of the Net Asset Value.

 

 

(c)  If  the  Net Asset Value calculated by the Buyers and the Net Asset
Value calculated  by  the Sellers are both less than the Net Asset Value
Base Amount, the Sellers  shall pay an amount in cash equal to the sum of (w)
the amount of the deficiency  between the Net Asset Value Base Amount and the
Net Asset Value calculated  by  the Sellers plus (x) interest computed at
the rate declared from time to time  by  JPMorgan Chase Bank at its "base
rate" (the " _Prime  Rate_ ")  for  the period from the Closing Date to the
date of such payment of the deficiency  amount, in immediately available
funds to the Buyers no later than the third  Business Day following the
Sellers' receipt of the Buyers' Objection. If the Net  Asset Value calculated
by the Buyers and the Net Asset Value calculated by  the  Sellers are both
greater than the Net Asset Value Base Amount, the Buyers shall  pay the
Sellers an amount in cash equal to the sum of (y) the amount of the  excess
of the Net Asset Value calculated by the Buyers over the Net Asset Value 
Base Amount plus (z) interest computed at the Prime Rate for the period from 
the  Closing Date to the date of such payment of the excess amount, in
immediately  available funds to the Sellers no later than the third Business
Day following  the Sellers' receipt of the Buyers' Objection.

 

 

(d)  The  Sellers shall have 30 days following the date they receive the
Objection to  review and respond to the Objection. The Buyers will provide
the Sellers and  their accountants access to any relevant books and records
not in the possession  of Sellers, work papers and to any other information
necessary to evaluate  the  Objection. If the Sellers and the Buyers are
unable to resolve all of their  disagreements with respect to the
determination of the foregoing items by the  30th  day  following the
Sellers' response thereto, after having used their good faith  efforts to
reach a resolution, they shall refer their remaining differences  to a 
mutually acceptable accounting firm (the " _CPA  Firm_ "),  who  shall,
acting as experts in accounting and not as arbitrators, determine on  a 
basis consistent with the requirements of Section 2.6(a), and only with
respect  to the specific remaining accounting related differences so
submitted, whether  and to what extent the Net Asset Value Statement requires
adjustment. The  Sellers and the Buyers shall request the CPA Firm to use its
best efforts to  render its determination within 45 days. The CPA Firm's
determination shall be  conclusive and binding upon the Sellers and the
Buyers. The Sellers and the  Buyers shall make reasonably available to the
CPA Firm and each other all  relevant books and records, any work papers
(including those of the parties' respective accountants) and supporting
documentation relating to the Net Asset  Value Statement and all other items
reasonably requested by the CPA Firm. The  " _Final  Statement of Net Asset
Value_ " shall  be (i) the Net Asset Value Statement in the event that (x)
no Objection is  delivered to the Sellers during the initial 60-day period
specified above or  (y)  the Sellers and the Buyers so agree, (ii) the Net
Asset Value Statement,  adjusted in accordance with the Objection, in the
event that (x) Sellers do  not  respond to the Objection during the 30-day
period specified above following  receipt by the Sellers of the Objection or
(y) the Sellers and the Buyers so  agree or (iii) the Net Asset Value
Statement, as adjusted pursuant to the  agreement of the Buyers and the
Sellers or as adjusted by the CPA Firm together  with any other modifications
to the Net Asset Value Statement agreed upon by  Sellers and the Buyers. All
fees and disbursements of the CPA Firm shall be  borne equally by the
Sellers, on the one hand, and the Buyers, on the other  hand.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(e)  If  the  calculation of the Net Asset Value contained in the Final
Statement of Net  Asset  Value is less than the Net Asset Value Base Amount,
the Sellers shall pay an  amount in cash equal to the difference of (x) the
amount of such deficiency  minus (y) any amounts paid by the Sellers to the
Buyers pursuant to clause  (w)  of Section 2.6(c) (not including any
interest provided for in clause (x) of  Section 2.6(c)) (such difference, the
" _Remaining  Net Asset Value Deficiency_ "),  plus  (z) interest computed
at the Prime Rate for the period from the Closing Date  to  the date of such
payment on the Remaining Net Asset Value Deficiency, in  immediately
available funds to the Buyers within three (3) Business Days after  the
ultimate determination of the Final Statement of Net Asset Value as provided 
in this Section 2.6. If the calculation of the Net Asset Value contained in 
the  Final Statement of Net Asset Value is greater than the Net Asset Value
Base  Amount, the Buyers shall pay an amount in cash equal to the difference
of (1)  the amount of such excess minus (2) any amounts paid by the Buyers in
cash  to  the Sellers pursuant to clause (y) of Section 2.6(c) (not
including any interest  provided for in clause (z) of Section 2.6(c)) (such
difference, the " _Remaining  Net Asset Value Excess_ "),  plus  (3)
interest computed at the Prime Rate for the period from the Closing Date 
to  the date of such payment on the Remaining Net Asset Value Excess, in
immediately  available funds to the Sellers, within three (3) Business Days
after the  ultimate determination of the Final Statement of Net Asset Value
as provided  in  this Section 2.6.

 

 

SECTION  2.7. _Purchase  Price Allocation_

 

 

(a) The  Purchase Price (including Assumed Liabilities that are treated as
assumed for  Tax purposes) shall be allocated among (i) the Acquired Assets
and (ii) the  Sold  Shares, as set forth on _Schedule  2.7_ ,  unless 
the parties otherwise agree prior to the Closing. In the event an adjustment 
to  the Purchase Price is made pursuant to Section 2.3(b) or 2.6 or otherwise
under  this Agreement, the allocation of the Purchase Price (including
Assumed  Liabilities that are treated as assumed for Tax purposes) shall be
revised  to  allocate such adjustment to the Acquired Assets or Sold Shares,
as the case  may  be, based upon the item to which such adjustment is
attributable.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

23  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) The  Sellers shall prepare an allocation among the Acquired Assets in the
United  States (in accordance with _Schedule  2.7_   and  Section 1060 of
the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder)  and submit it
to the Buyers for their approval within 60 days of the final  purchase price
adjustment. If within 30 days of such submission the Buyers  and  the
Sellers are unable to agree upon the allocation after negotiating in good 
faith, the parties will submit any disputes to the CPA Firm. The CPA Firm
shall  resolve any such disputes within 30 days and its determination shall
be  conclusive and binding upon the Sellers and the Buyers.

 

 

(c) Except  as  otherwise provided by the immediately preceding paragraph or
as required by  applicable Law, the Sellers and the Buyers shall report the
Tax consequences  of  the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in a
manner consistent with  _Schedule  2.7_   and the  Purchase Price
allocation described therein, as it may be revised from time  to  time, and
shall not take any position inconsistent therewith in preparing any  Tax
Returns, IRS Form 8594 and any other Tax forms or filings, as well as in 
preparing any published financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, 
and  none of the Buyers or the Sellers shall take any position inconsistent
therewith  upon examination of any Tax Return, in any Tax refund claim, or in
any Tax  litigation or investigation, without the prior written consent of IR
or Buyer  Parents.

 

 

ARTICLE  III 

 

 

REPRESENTATIONS  AND WARRANTIES OF THE SELLERS

 

 

The  Sellers, jointly and severally, hereby represent and warrant to the
Buyers  as of  the date hereof and as of the Closing Date as follows:

 

 

SECTION  3.1. _Organization_. Each  of  the Sellers and each of the Sold
Companies is a corporation or other business  entity duly incorporated or

each of the Sold Companies has all requisite corporate or other  power and
authority to own its assets and to carry on its business as now being 
conducted and is duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in good 
standing in the jurisdictions in which the ownership of its property or the 
conduct of its business requires such qualification or license, except where 
the  failure to be so qualified or licensed would not reasonably be
expected,  individually or in the aggregate, to have a Company Material
Adverse  Effect.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

24  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

SECTION  3.2. _Authorization,  Enforceability_. Each  of  the Sellers has
the corporate or other power and authority to execute and  deliver this
Agreement and each Closing Agreement to which it is a party and  to  perform
its obligations hereunder and thereunder. Except as described on  _Schedule 
3.2_ ,  the  execution and delivery by each Seller of this Agreement and
each Closing  Agreement to which it is a party, and the performance by such
Seller of its  obligations hereunder and thereunder, have been duly
authorized by all necessary  corporate or other action on the part of such
Seller. This Agreement has been  duly executed and delivered by each of the
Sellers and each Seller shall duly  execute and deliver each Closing
Agreement to which it is a party and, assuming  due authorization, execution
and delivery by the Buyers, this Agreement  constitutes, and each Closing
Agreement shall constitute, a valid and binding  agreement of each of the
Sellers party thereto, enforceable against each of  them  in accordance with
its terms, subject to the effects of bankruptcy, insolvency,  fraudulent
conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and other similar Laws  relating to or
affecting creditors' rights generally and general equitable  principles
(whether considered in a Proceeding in equity or at  law).

outstanding Sold Shares are owned of record free and clear of  any 
Encumbrances by the Stock Seller identified on _Schedule  3.3_   as  owning
such Sold Shares. All of such issued and outstanding Sold Shares and  shares
of the other Sold Companies have been validly issued, are fully paid  and 
nonassessable and have not been issued in violation of any preemptive or
similar  rights. Except as set forth on _Schedule  3.3_ ,  there  are no
outstanding options, warrants, calls, rights or any other agreements 
relating to the sale, issuance or voting of any shares of the capital stock 
of  the Sold Companies, or any securities or other instruments convertible
into,  exchangeable for or evidencing the right to purchase any shares of
capital  stock  of the Sold Companies.

 

 

SECTION  3.4. _Subsidiaries_. No  Sold  Companies have any Subsidiaries or
own, or have any obligation to make or  acquire, any Investments, except as
set forth on _Schedule  3.4_.

(a) The  combined balance sheet of the Business as of December 31, 2006
(the " _Balance  Sheet_ ")  and  the related combined statement of income
of the Business for the year ended  December 31, 2006 (together with the
Balance Sheet, the " _Financial  Statements_ ")  are  attached hereto as
_Schedule  3.5(a)_.  The  Financial Statements have been prepared, and when
delivered, the Audited  Financial Statements will have been prepared, from
the books and records of  the  Business and in accordance with U.S. GAAP
applied on a consistent basis. The  Base Statement of Net Asset Value has

with  Modified GAAP.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

25  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) Section  3.5(a) is qualified by the fact that the Acquired Assets and
Sold Companies  comprising the Business have not operated as separate "stand
alone" entities  within IR. As a result, the Business, the Acquired Assets
and the Sold Companies  have been allocated certain charges and credits for
purposes of the preparation  of the Financial Statements. Such allocations of
charges and credits do not  necessarily reflect the amounts that would have
resulted from arms-length  transactions or the actual costs that would be
incurred if the Business operated  as an independent enterprise.

 

 

(c)  Since  December 31, 2006, there has been no change, occurrence or
development that  has  had or could reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate  with all other changes, a Company Material
Adverse Effect.

 

 

SECTION  3.6. _Absence  of Undisclosed Liabilities_. Except  as  set forth
in the Financial Statements, there are no liabilities, commitments  or 
obligations of any kind whatsoever (whether absolute, accrued, contingent or 
otherwise, and whether due or to become due) of the Business that are
required  to be reflected in a combined balance sheet of the Business
prepared in  accordance with Modified GAAP, other than liabilities and
obligations (i)  arising after December 31, 2006, in the ordinary course of
business and  consistent with past practices, (ii) disclosed on _Schedule
3.6_,  or  (iii) that constitute Excluded Liabilities.

 

 

SECTION  3.7. _No  Approvals or Conflicts_. Except  as  set forth on
_Schedule 3.7_,  the  execution, delivery and performance by the Sellers of
this Agreement and the  Closing Agreements and the consummation by the
Sellers of the transactions  contemplated hereby and thereby do not and will
not in any material respect  (i)  violate, conflict with or result in a
breach by any of the Sellers or any of  the  Sold Companies of the
organizational documents of any of the Sellers or the  Sold  Companies, (ii)
violate, conflict with or result in a breach of, or constitute  a  default
by any of the Sellers or the Sold Companies (or create an event which,  with
notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a default) under any 
Material Contract, (iii) violate or result in a breach of any Order or Law 
applicable to any of the Sellers or any of the Sold Companies or any of
their  respective properties, or (iv) except for applicable requirements of
the HSR  Act  and Other Competition Laws and as may be required solely by
reason of the  Buyers' (as opposed to any other third parties') participation
in the  transactions contemplated hereby, require any Consent of any
Governmental  Authority.

 

 

SECTION  3.8. _Compliance  with Law; Governmental Authorizations_. Except 
as  set forth on _Schedule 3.8_,  each of  the Sold Companies and each of
the Asset Sellers in respect of the Acquired  Assets and the conduct of the
Business are in compliance, in all material  respects, with the Orders and
Laws applicable to them and their respective  properties. Except as set forth
on _Schedule  3.8_ ,  to the  Knowledge of the Sellers, during the two
years prior to the date hereof, the  Business has been conducted and the
Acquired Assets have been used and operated  by the Sellers and their
Affiliates in compliance with the Orders and Laws  applicable to them and
their respective properties, except for incidents of  non-compliance that
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably  be  expected to
have a continuing material impact on the Business after the Closing.  The
Asset Sellers and the Sold Companies have all material licenses, permits, 
franchises, registrations and other governmental authorizations necessary to 
conduct the Business as presently conducted (" _Permits_ ").  This  Section
3.8 does not relate to matters with respect to (i) Taxes, which are  the 
subject of Section 3.11, (ii) ERISA and other Laws applicable to the benefit 
plans, which are the subject of Section 3.12, and (iii) environmental and
safety  matters, which are the subject of Section 3.16.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

26  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

SECTION  3.9. _Litigation_. Except  as  set forth on _Schedule 3.9_, 
there  is (a) no outstanding Order that is material individually or in the
aggregate,  against any Seller relating to the Business, any of the Sold
Companies or the  Sold Shares or any of the Acquired Assets, (b) no suit,
action or legal,  governmental, administrative, arbitration or regulatory
proceeding  (" _Proceeding_ ")  that  is material individually or in the
aggregate, and pending or, to the Knowledge  of the Sellers, threatened
against any Seller or Sold Company relating to the  Business, any of the Sold
Companies or the Sold Shares or any of the Acquired  Assets, and (c) no
investigation by any Governmental Authority that is material  individually or
in the aggregate, pending or, to the Knowledge of the Sellers,  threatened
against the Sellers or the Sold Companies relating to the Business,  any of
the Sold Companies or the Sold Shares or any of the Acquired Assets.  Except
as set forth in _Schedule  3.9_ ,  there  are no Proceedings pending or, to
the Knowledge of the Sellers, threatened  against any Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries that would reasonably be expected  to materially impede or delay
the ability of any Seller to consummate the  transactions as contemplated by
this Agreement. No Seller or any Sold Company  is  subject to any Order that
would reasonably be expected to materially impede  or  delay the ability of
any Seller to consummate the transactions as contemplated  by this Agreement.
This  Section 3.9 does not relate to matters with respect to Taxes, which are
the  subject of Section 3.11.

 

 

SECTION  3.10. _Ordinary  Course_. Except  as  set forth in _Schedule
3.10_  or as  specifically contemplated by this Agreement, from December 31,
2006 through  the  date of this Agreement, the Business has been conducted
in all material respects  in the ordinary course consistent with past
practice.

 

 

SECTION  3.11. _Tax  Matters_. Except  as  set forth in _Schedule 3.11_:

 

 

(a) All  material Tax Returns (including information returns) required to be
filed by  or  on behalf of the Sold Companies or in connection with the
Business or the  Acquired Assets have been, or will be by the Closing Date,
duly and timely  filed  (subject to permitted extensions applicable to such
filing), and such Tax  Returns are, or will be, correct and complete and all
material Taxes (whether  or  not shown as due and payable by withholding or
otherwise on such Tax Returns)  on  or prior to the Closing Date in respect
of the Business, the Acquired Assets  or  the Sold Companies (including, for
the avoidance of doubt, Taxes required to  be  withheld from the Sold
Companies' employees, independent contractors, creditors,  stockholders and
third parties) have been, or will be by the Closing Date,  fully, duly and
timely paid to the appropriate Governmental Authority in  compliance with all
Tax withholding and remitting provisions of applicable  Laws.  Any material
charges, accruals or reserves (if any) for Taxes payable by the  Sold
Companies accrued as of the Closing Date but not yet due and payable on  or 
prior to that date will be accurately reflected on the Final Statement of
Net  Asset Value.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

27  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) No  claim  for any unpaid material Taxes has become an Encumbrance
against the Acquired  Assets or any assets or property of the Sold Companies
except for Permitted  Encumbrances.

 

 

(c) There  are  no examinations, audits, actions, Proceedings,
investigations, disputes,  assessments or claims pending, asserted or
threatened in writing regarding  Taxes  relating directly to the Sold
Companies that would reasonably be expected to  result in a material increase
in Taxes relating to the Sold Companies for any  taxable period ending after
the Closing Date, other than with respect to any  IR  Federal and
Consolidated Income Tax. No written notice from any Taxing Authority  in a
jurisdiction in which Tax Returns are not filed by or on behalf of the 
Sold  Companies has been received stating that any of the Sold Companies is
or may  be  subject to taxation by that jurisdiction.

 

 

(d) There  are  no agreements or consents currently in effect for the waiver
of any statute  of  limitations or extension of time with respect to an
assessment or collection  of  any material Taxes of the Sold Companies,
other than an extension arising out  of  an extension of the due date for
filing a Tax Return, other than with respect  to  any IR Federal and
Consolidated Income Tax.

 

 

(e) No  Sold  Company is a party to or bound by any material Tax allocation,
Tax indemnity  or Tax  sharing agreement that will not be terminated on or
prior to the  Closing.

 

 

(f) None  of  the Sold Companies will be required to include any item of
income in, or exclude  any  item of  deduction from, taxable income (in
each case, which would result in a material  increase in Taxes) for any
taxable period (or portion thereof) ending after  the  Closing Date as a
result of any (i) change in method of accounting for a taxable  period (or
portion thereof) ending on or prior to the Closing Date, (ii)  disposition
made the proceeds of which were received on or prior to the Closing  Date or
(iii) prepaid amount received on or prior to the Closing  Date.

SECTION  3.12. _Employee  Benefits_.

 

 

(a) _Schedule  3.12(a)_   contains  a true and complete list of all
"employee benefit plans" (within the meaning of  Section 3(3) of ERISA),

provisions of the  Confidentiality Agreement shall continue in full force and
effect following  the  execution and delivery of this Agreement, and all
information obtained pursuant  to this Section 5.2 shall be kept confidential
in accordance with the  Confidentiality Agreement. During the Pre-Closing

to locate and identify to the  Buyer  (including providing copies thereof)

41  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) Each  of  Sellers and Buyers shall (i) as promptly as practicable file
with the United  States Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ ")  and  the
United States Department of Justice (the " _DOJ_ ")  the  notification and
report form, if any, required for the transactions contemplated  hereby and
any supplemental information requested in connection therewith  pursuant to
the HSR Act and (ii) as promptly as practicable make all filings  under
applicable Other Competition Laws, if any, required for the transactions 
contemplated hereby. However, notwithstanding the foregoing, the Sellers 
and  Buyers shall cooperate to apply for the necessary government approvals
in  the  People's Republic of China only at a time that is reasonably
expected to result  in such approvals being obtained as close to the Closing
Date as is reasonably  practicable. Any such antitrust notification and
report form or filing and  supplemental information shall be in substantial
compliance with the  requirements of the HSR Act or the applicable Other
Competition Laws, as  the  case may be. All other regulatory filings shall
be in substantial compliance  with the requirements of applicable Laws. Each
of the Buyers and Sellers  shall  furnish to the other such necessary
information and reasonable assistance  as the  other may request in
connection with its preparation of any filing or submission  that is
necessary under the HSR Act, applicable Other Competition Laws or  other 
applicable Laws and regulations, as the case may be. The Sellers and Buyers 
shall use best efforts to comply promptly with any inquiries or requests 
for  additional information from the FTC, the DOJ, other Governmental
Antitrust  Authorities and any other Governmental Authority having 
jurisdiction.

 

 

(c) Without  limiting the generality of the undertakings set forth in
subsections (a),  (b)  and (d) of this Section 5.3 and subject to any
appropriate confidentiality  protections, the Sellers and the Buyers shall
each furnish to the other such  necessary information and reasonable
assistance as the other party may request  in connection with the foregoing
and shall each promptly provide counsel  for the  other party with copies of
all filings made by such party, and all  correspondence between such party
(and its advisors) with any Governmental  Antitrust Authority or other
Governmental Authority and any other information  supplied by such party and
such party's Affiliates to a Governmental Antitrust  Authority or other
Governmental Authority in connection with this Agreement  and  the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each party shall, subject  to 
applicable Law, permit counsel for the other party to review in advance any 
proposed written and, if practicable, oral, communication to any
Governmental  Antitrust Authority or other Governmental Authority.

 

 

(d) Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Buyer shall
take, or cause to  be  taken, any and all actions, including the disposition
of assets, required  by any  Governmental Antitrust Authority as a condition
to the granting of any Consent  necessary for the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby or  as may  be required to avoid, lift,
vacate or reverse any legislative, administrative  or  judicial action that
would otherwise reasonably be expected to materially  impair  or delay the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.  Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, such actions may include,  but 
are not limited to: (i) divesting, selling or otherwise disposing of, or 
holding  separate and agreeing to sell or otherwise dispose of, any entities,
assets  or  facilities of the Business or any entity, facility or asset of
the Buyers  or  their Subsidiaries or Affiliates, (ii) terminating, amending
or assigning  such  existing relationships and contractual rights and
obligations (other than  termination that would result in a breach of a
contractual obligation to  a third  party), and (iii) amending, assigning or

termination that would result in a breach  of a  license or such other
agreement with a third party) and entering into such  new  licenses or other
agreements (and, in each case, entering into agreements  with  the relevant
Governmental Antitrust Authority giving effect thereto) in each  case with
respect to the foregoing clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) if such action  is 
necessary or reasonably advisable or as may be required by any Governmental 
Antitrust Authority, _provided_   that any  such action shall not be
required to be effective prior to the  Closing.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

42  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(e) The  filing fees under the HSR Act, Other Competition Laws and other
applicable  Laws  shall be borne by the party responsible for paying such
filing fees under  the  applicable Laws. The fees and disbursements of any
legal counsel or other  advisor jointly retained by the parties in connection
with any such filings  and  any other filings with Governmental Authorities,
shall be borne by the party  retaining such legal counsel or advisor;
_provided_ ,  if any  legal counsel or advisor is jointly retained by the
parties, then its fees  and  disbursements shall be borne equally by both
parties.

 

 

SECTION  5.4. _Third  Party Consents_. The  Buyers and Sellers shall use
all commercially reasonable efforts to obtain  any  Consent of any Person
(other than Governmental Authorities) required to  consummate and make
effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.  The parties agree
to cooperate reasonably in obtaining such Consents. To  the  extent that the
Sellers and the Buyers are unable to obtain any required  third  party
Consents prior to the Closing (such Consents, the " _Post-Closing  Consents_
"),  the  Buyers and Sellers shall use best efforts to make or obtain (or
cause to  be made  or obtained) as promptly as practicable all Post-Closing
Consents. For purposes  of this Section 5.4, the term "all commercially
reasonable efforts" shall not be  deemed to require any Person to pay or
commit to pay any amount to (or incur  any  obligation in favor of) any
Person from whom any consent or waiver may be  required (other than nominal
filing or application fees).

 

 

SECTION  5.5. _Tax  Matters_.

 

 

(a) The  Buyers and the Sellers agree to furnish or cause to be furnished to
each  other,  upon request, as promptly as practicable, such information and
assistance  relating directly to the Sold Companies or the Acquired Assets
(including  access  to books and records, employees, contractors and
representatives) as is  reasonably necessary for the filing of all Tax
Returns, the making of any  election related to Taxes, the preparation for
any audit by any Taxing  Authority, and the prosecution or defense of any
claim, suit or Proceeding  relating to any Tax Return; _provided_ , 
_however_ ,  that if  such requested information is contained within a
document containing any  unrelated information, only portions pertaining to
such relevant information  shall be furnished. The Buyers and the Sellers
shall retain all books and  records with respect to Taxes pertaining to the
Sold Companies and the Acquired  Assets until the expiration of all relevant
statutes of limitations (and,  to the  extent notified by the Buyers and the
Sellers, as the case may be, any  extensions thereof). At the end of such
period, each party shall provide  the  other with at least 30 days prior
written notice before destroying any such  books and records, during which
period the party receiving such notice can  elect  to take possession, at
its own expense, of such books and records.

 

 

(b) _Tax  Returns_.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

43  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(i) The  Sellers shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, all IR Federal and
Consolidated  Income Tax Returns in respect of the Sold Companies for all
taxable periods.  The  Sellers shall timely file, or cause to be filed, all
such IR Federal and  Consolidated Income Tax Returns. For the avoidance of
doubt, the Asset Sellers  shall include the income derived from the Acquired
Assets for the period  ending  on the Closing Date in their Income Tax
Returns for the taxable period that  includes the Closing Date (" _Asset 
Sellers ' Tax Returns_").  The  Sellers shall timely pay to the relevant
Taxing Authority all Taxes due in  connection with any such IR Federal and
Consolidated Income Tax  Returns and  Asset  Sellers' Tax Returns. Sellers
agree to inform the Buyers of any position taken  on any such IR Federal and
Consolidated Income Tax Return with respect to  the  Sold Companies or the
Acquired Assets that is contrary to past practice and  that  would have a
material adverse impact on the Sold Companies or the Acquired  Assets in a
taxable period after the Closing Date.

 

 

(ii) The  Buyers shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, all other Tax
Returns in respect  of the Sold Companies or the Acquired Assets required to
be filed after the  Closing Date (" _Buyer  Tax Returns_ ").  Such  Buyer
Tax Returns shall be filed on the basis that the relevant taxable period 
ended as of the close of business on the Closing Date (unless the relevant 
Taxing Authority will not accept a Tax Return filed on that basis). In the 
case  of any Buyer Tax Return that includes any period that begins prior to
the  Closing Date, including for any taxable year ending after the Closing
Date  which  begins before the Closing Date (a " _Straddle  Period_ "), 
such  Buyer Tax Return shall be prepared in a manner consistent with past
practices  (unless it is otherwise required by applicable Law). The Buyers
shall provide  IR  with a copy of a substantially final draft of each
Straddle Period Buyer  Tax  Return (and such additional information
regarding such Straddle Period Buyer  Tax  Return as may reasonably be
requested by IR) for its review and comment (A)  at  least 30 Days prior to
the filing of such Buyer Tax Return or (B) in the  case of  a Buyer Tax
Return that is required to be filed within 30 days of the Closing  Date, at
least 10 days prior to the date such Buyer Tax Return is required  to be 
filed; provided, that in the case of a Buyer Tax Return that is required  to
be  filed within 10 days of the Closing Date, the Buyers shall use their
reasonable  best efforts to afford the Sellers a reasonable opportunity to
review such  Buyer  Tax Return prior to filing such Buyer Tax Return. The
Buyers shall timely  pay to  the relevant Taxing Authority all Taxes due in
connection with any such Buyer  Tax Returns. In advance of the filing of such
Buyer Tax Returns, the Sellers  shall pay to the Buyers their share of any
such Taxes, determined in accordance  with Section 5.6 (the " _Sellers ' 
Tax Share_").  If,  and to the extent that, the Buyers and the Sellers fail
to agree with respect  to  any of the Sellers' comments on a draft Straddle
Period Tax Return, such  disagreement shall be submitted to the CPA Firm for
resolution as provided  in  Section 5.6(d). Buyers acknowledge that from and
after the Closing Date the  Sellers may not have the power and authority to
endorse certain of the refund  checks to which Buyers may be entitled and
that may be received by the Sellers  for the Tax periods prior to the Closing
Date. Therefore, at Sellers' request,  Buyers shall execute a limited power
of attorney for the purpose of allowing  the  Sellers to endorse certain
refund checks to which it may be entitled and  which  may be received by the
Sellers.

 

 

(c) _Tax  Elections_.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

44  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(i) Sellers  and Buyers agree that they shall use their reasonable best
efforts to take  all  steps necessary to make a timely, valid and
irrevocable election under Section  338(h)(10) of the Code and analogous
state and local tax provisions, arising  out  of the purchase and sale of
the shares of the capital stock of Clark Equipment  Company and Clark
Business Services Corporation, a Michigan corporation,  (together the "
_Section  338 Companies_ ")  (such  elections, collectively, the "
_Section  338 Elections_ "),  and  to file the Section 338 Elections in
accordance with applicable Tax Law.  The  Purchase Price for the shares of
Section 338 Companies shall be the price  as set  forth on _Schedule  2.7_
  (the " _Section  338 Purchase Price_ ").  At  least 10 days prior to
the Closing Date, Sellers and the Buyers shall agree  on  the form and
content of the IRS Form 8023 and analogous state and local tax  forms on
which the Elections shall be made (collectively, the " _Election  Forms_
").  At or  prior to the Closing, Sellers shall deliver to the Buyers
properly executed  and  mutually agreed upon Election Forms containing
information then available,  which  the Buyers shall file, or cause to be
filed, promptly after the Closing (and  with respect to which, Buyers shall
provide proof of mailing to Sellers).  The  Sellers shall, within 90 days
after the Final Statement of Net Asset Value  becomes or is deemed final and
binding on the parties, but in no event less  than  60 days prior to the
relevant due date, prepare and deliver to the Buyers  for  their review and
consent, the allocation of the deemed sales price of the  assets  of the
Section 338 Companies resulting from the Section 338 Elections (as  required
pursuant to Section 338(h)(10) of the Code and regulations promulgated 
thereunder) among such assets (the " _Section 338  Allocation_").  Buyers
shall, within 30 days of delivery of the Section 338 Allocation, prepare  and
deliver to the Sellers a written notice of any disputed items with respect 
to the Section 338 Allocation. If Buyers do not deliver to the Sellers such 
written notice within such time frame, the Section 338 Allocation shall be 
deemed final. Sellers and the Buyers shall negotiate in good faith to
resolve  any disputed items. If Sellers and the Buyers are unable to agree on
the  Section  338 Allocation within 60 days after the Sellers provide the
Section 338  Allocation, but in no event later than 30 days prior to the
relevant due  date,  they shall request the CPA Firm to decide any disputed
items, which shall  make  such decision within 30 days, but in no event less
than 10 days prior to  the  relevant due date. The costs of the CPA Firm
shall be borne equally by Sellers  and the Buyers. The Section 338 Allocation
shall be used in preparing IRS  Form  8883, and any similar forms under
applicable Tax Law. Sellers and the Buyers  shall (and shall cause their
Affiliates to) report and file all Tax Returns  (including amended Tax
Returns and claims for refund) consistent with the  Section 338 Purchase
Price and Section 338 Allocation, shall (and shall cause  their Affiliates
to) take no position contrary thereto or inconsistent therewith  (including,
without limitation, in any audits or examinations by any taxing  authority or
any other Proceeding) and shall use reasonable efforts to sustain  such
reporting of the transaction in any subsequent Tax dispute to the extent 
consistent with applicable Tax Law.

 

 

(ii) Except  as  provided in the preceding paragraph, the Buyers shall not
make any Tax election  under the Code (or the Tax Laws of any other
jurisdiction) with respect to  the  Sold Companies which would cause such
stock sale to be treated as an asset  sale  for Tax purposes, including, any
check-the-box elections or election pursuant  to  Section 338 of the Code
(or any comparable state, local or foreign provision).  In addition, Buyers
shall not amend any Tax Return, consent to the waiver  or  extension of the
statute of limitations relating to Taxes of the Sold Companies  or the
Acquired Assets, take any Tax position on any Tax Return, or compromise  or
settle any Tax liability, in each case if such action could (in the
Sellers' sole judgment) have the effect of increasing the Tax liability or
reducing  any  Tax asset of the Sellers (or otherwise disadvantaging the
Sellers in respect  of  Taxes) in respect of any taxable period (or portion
thereof) ending on or  before  the Closing Date, in each case without the
Sellers' written consent. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

45  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(iii) The  Buyer  acknowledges and agrees that it shall not take or cause or
permit to be taken  prior to January 1st  of the  calendar year following
the year in which the Closing occurs any action that  would result in Subpart
F income (as defined in Section 952 of the Code)  or a  Section 956
inclusion (as defined in Section 956 of the Code) to the Sellers,  including,
but not limited to, the payment of an actual or a constructive  dividend and
the making of loans by non-U.S. subsidiaries to U.S.  persons.

 

 

(iv) If  a Sold  Company that prior to the Closing Date was deemed to be a
controlled foreign  corporation (as defined in Section 957 of the Code) (a "
_CFC_ ")  is no  longer deemed to be a CFC following the stock purchase as a
result of the  Buyer's ownership, the Buyer shall make available to Sellers
the information  needed by the Sellers to timely and accurately file a Form
5471, Information  Return of U.S. Persons with Respect to Certain Foreign
Corporations (including  profit and loss balance sheets), for such Sold
Company for the Tax year in  which  the stock purchase occurs.

 

 

(v) If  a Sold  Company that prior to the Closing Date was deemed to be a
CFC continues to  be  deemed to be a CFC following the stock purchase as a
result of the Buyer's  ownership, the Buyer shall cause a Form 5471,
Information Return of U.S.  Persons  with Respect to Certain Foreign
Corporations (including profit and loss balance  sheets), to be timely and
accurately filed for such Sold Company for the  Tax  year in which the stock
purchase occurs. The Buyer shall provide copies of  the  Forms 5471 to the
Sellers no later than 10 Business Days prior to the due  date  for filing
such Forms 5471 for the Sellers' review and comment, and the Buyer  shall not
finalize any such Forms 5471 without the prior written consent  of the 
Sellers, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

 

 

(d) Prior  to  the  Closing Date, the Sellers shall initiate, and if
possible complete, the  termination of any profit or tax-sharing agreements
of the Sold  Companies.

 

 

SECTION  5.6. _Tax  Indemnity_.

 

 

(a) Except  as  provided in Section 2.4(b), the Sellers shall, jointly and
severally, indemnify  the Buyer Indemnified Persons and hold them harmless
against, without  duplication, all Losses with respect to (i) all Tax
liabilities of the Sellers  and their Affiliates (other than the Sold
Companies) for any period (but  specifically excluding Taxes, if any, imposed
on the Sellers and arising  out of  the Buyers' operation of the Business
following the Closing Date or on the  Closing Date following the Closing),
(ii) all Tax liabilities of, the Sold  Companies for all taxable periods (or
portions thereof in the case of a Straddle  Period) ending on or before the
Closing Date except to the extent of the  amounts  reflected on the Final
Statement of Net Asset Value; provided, that with  respect  to Goldwave
Limited, Sellers obligation to indemnify for any Taxes under  this  Section
5.6(a) shall be limited to any amounts that the Sellers receive as  an 
indemnity payment pursuant to the Agreement for the Sale and Purchase of 
Goldwave Limited, dated October 4, 2006, (iii) all liability (as a result 
of  Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 or otherwise) for IR Federal and 
Consolidated Income Taxes of Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than  a
Sold  Company), (iv) all Taxes that are Excluded Liabilities described in
Section  2.2(c)(iii) hereof, (v) all Tax liabilities arising solely out of or
due  to any  breach of any covenant or other agreement of the Sellers
contained in this  Agreement, (vi) any payments required to be made after the
Closing Date under  any Tax allocation, Tax indemnity or Tax sharing
agreement to which any of  the  Sold Companies was obligated, or was a party
on or prior to the Closing Date  and  (vii) all Tax liabilities arising
solely out of or due to any breach of  representations made in Sections
3.11(f)(i), 3.11(f)(ii) or 3.11(i). The  Tax  indemnity provided under this
Section 5.6(a) shall not cover Losses with  respect  to Tax liabilities (I)
resulting from any transaction of the Sold Companies  outside the ordinary
course of business and not contemplated by this Agreement  that occurs on the
Closing Date but after the Closing (and not solely as  a  consequence of
Closing or any Sold Company ceasing to be part of a joint,  consolidated or
unitary Tax filing or Tax sharing arrangement with any of  the  Sellers for
Tax purposes) or (II) resulting from any action taken after the  Closing by
the Buyers, any of their Affiliates, or any transferee of the  Buyers  or
their Affiliates (a " _Buyer  Tax Act_ ").  Buyer  Tax Acts hereunder shall
include, without limitation, the failure of IRCR  Manufacturing S.r.o. of the
Czech Republic to maintain, subsequent to the  Closing Date (or, in the event
of a delayed Closing with respect to the  aforesaid Sold Company, as from
that date) a minimum investment of 350m Czech  Koruny (comprised of at least
40% qualifying machinery) until August 28,  2008  provided that the
aforesaid minimum investment had been realized either by  the  Closing Date
or subsequently, and prior to October 17, 2007, in good faith  cooperation
between the Sellers and the Buyers.

(b) Subject  to the provisions set forth in this Agreement, the Buyers,
jointly and  severally, and the Sold Companies shall indemnify the IR
Indemnified Persons  and  hold them harmless against, without duplication,
all Losses with respect  to (i)  all Tax liabilities of the Sold Companies 
or with  respect to the Acquired Assets (A) resulting from any transaction of
the  Sold  Companies outside of the ordinary course of business and not
contemplated  by  this Agreement occurring on the Closing Date but after the
Closing, (B)  resulting from any Buyer Tax Act and (C) with respect to any
taxable period  (or  portions thereof in the case of a Straddle Period) that
begins after the  Closing  Date,  (ii)  all Taxes that are Assumed
Liabilities described in Section  2.2(b)(vi),  and  (iii) all Tax
liabilities arising out of or due to any breach of any covenant  or  other
agreement  of the  Buyers contained in this  Agreement.

 

 

(c) For  purposes of this Agreement, in the case of any Taxes that are
imposed on  a  periodic basis and are payable for a Straddle Period, the
portion of such  Tax  related to the portion of such Straddle Period ending
on and including the  Closing Date shall (i) in the case of any Taxes other
than gross receipts,  sales  or use taxes and Taxes based upon or related to
income, be deemed to be the  amount of such Tax for the entire taxable period
multiplied by a fraction,  the  numerator of which is the number of days in
the taxable period ending on  and  including the Closing Date and the
denominator of which is the number of  days in  the entire taxable period,
and (ii) in the case of any Tax based upon or  related  to income and gross
receipts, sales or use taxes, be deemed equal to the  amount  which would be
payable if the relevant taxable period ended on and included  the  Closing
Date. The portion of any credits relating to a Straddle Period shall  be 
determined as though the relevant taxable period ended on and included the 
Closing Date. All determinations necessary to give effect to the foregoing 
allocations shall be made in a manner consistent with the past practice of 
the  Sold Companies or the Asset Sellers.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

47  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(d) Payment  by the indemnitor of any amount due under this Section 5.6 shall
be made  within  ten (10) Business Days following written notice by the
indemnitee that payment  of such amounts to the appropriate Taxing Authority
is due; provided, that  the  indemnitor shall not be required to make any
payment earlier than five (5)  Business Days before it is due to the
appropriate Taxing Authority. In the  case  of any written notice by any of
the Buyers or their Affiliates indicating  that  Taxes are due for a
Straddle Period Buyer Tax Return, such notice shall set  forth in reasonable
detail the calculations regarding such Taxes and the  Sellers' share of such
Taxes, and if within ten (10) Business Days after receipt  of such notice,
the Sellers notify the Buyers in writing that they disagree  with  the
computation of their share of such Taxes, the Sellers and the Buyers  shall 
proceed in good faith to determine such Taxes and the Sellers' share thereof.
If  the Sellers and Buyers cannot agree in good faith on such share within
thirty  (30) days after the Sellers' receipt of such notice, the Sellers'
liability for  such Taxes shall be resolved by the CPA Firm, whose fees and
expenses shall  be  shared equally between the Sellers and the Buyers, and
the Sellers' payment to  the Buyers shall be due five (5) Business Days after
the amount payable by  the  Sellers is determined by agreement between the
Sellers and the Buyers or  by the  CPA Firm, subject to the proviso in the
first sentence of this Section 5.6(d).  In the case of a Tax that is
contested in accordance with the provisions  of  Section 5.7 below, payment
of the Tax to the appropriate Taxing Authority  shall  not be considered to
be due earlier than the date a final determination to  such  effect is made
by the appropriate Taxing Authority or court.

 

 

(e) Notwithstanding  any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, (i) the
representations  and  warranties set forth in Section 3.11 shall not survive
the Closing except  that  the representations and warranties in Section
3.11(f)(i), 3.11(f)(ii) and  3.11(i) shall survive until 5:00 p.m. (New York
City time) on the third (3rd)  anniversary of the Closing Date and (ii) the
obligations of a party to indemnify  and hold harmless another party pursuant
to this Section 5.6, other than,  for  the avoidance of doubt, pursuant to
Section 5.6(a)(vii), shall terminate  at the  close of business on the 60th
day following the expiration of the applicable  statute of limitations with
respect to the Tax liabilities in question (giving  effect to any waiver,
mitigation or extension thereof); provided, that, in  each  case, such
representations, warranties and obligations that survive the Closing  shall
survive beyond such period with respect to any claim of indemnity  hereunder
if specific written notice thereof shall have been duly given within  such
period in accordance with the provisions of this Section 5.6.

 

 

SECTION  5.7. _Procedures  Relating to Indemnity of Tax Claims_

 

 

(a) The  Sellers shall promptly notify the Buyers, and the Buyers shall
promptly notify  the Sellers, in writing upon receipt of notice of any
pending Tax audits  or  assessments relating to the Acquired Assets or to
income, properties or  operations of the Sold Companies. If a claim shall be
made against the Buyers  or  the Sellers, as the case may be, or any of
their Affiliates by any Taxing  Authority, which, if successful, would result
in an indemnity payment to  the  Buyers or the Sellers, as the case may be,
or one of their Affiliates pursuant  to Section 5.6(a) or (b) (a "Tax
Claim"), the Buyers or the Sellers, as the case  may be, shall promptly
notify the Sellers, or the Buyers, as the case may  be, in  writing of such
Tax Claim stating the nature and basis of such Tax Claim  and the  amount
thereof, to the extent known or ascertainable by the Buyers or the  Sellers,
as the case may be. If notice of a Tax Claim is not given to the  Sellers or
the Buyers, as the case may be, within a sufficient period of  time to 
allow the Sellers or the Buyers, as the case may be, to effectively contest 
such  Tax Claim, or in reasonable detail to apprise the Sellers or the
Buyers,  as the  case may be, of the nature of the Tax Claim, in each case
taking into account  the facts and circumstances with respect to such Tax
Claim, the Sellers or  the  Buyers, as the case may be, shall not be liable
to the Buyers or the Sellers,  as  the case may be, or any of their
Affiliates to the extent that the Sellers' or  the Buyers', as the case may
be, ability to effectively contest such Tax Claim  is materially prejudiced
as a result thereof.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

48  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) With  respect to any Tax Claim that relates to a Tax which would result
in an  indemnity payment to any Buyer Indemnified Person pursuant to Section
5.6(a),  the Sellers shall control at their expense all Proceedings taken in
connection  with such Tax Claim (including selection of counsel) and, without
limiting  the  foregoing, may in their sole discretion pursue or forego any
and all  administrative appeals, Proceedings, hearings and conferences with
any Taxing  Authority with respect thereto and may, in their sole discretion,
either  pay the  Tax claimed and sue for a refund where applicable Law
permits such refund  suits  or contest the Tax Claim in any permissible
manner. With respect to any Tax  matter, other than an IR Federal and
Consolidated Income Tax matter, covered  by  the preceding sentence, the
Sellers shall keep the Buyers reasonably informed  and shall afford the
Buyers the opportunity to participate (at Buyer's sole cost  and expense), as
may be reasonably requested by the Buyers, in any such audit  or  Proceeding
to the extent that an adverse determination in any such audit  or 
Proceeding would result in a material Tax liability of a Buyer, the Sold 
Companies or any of their Affiliates, and no such audit or Proceeding may 
be  settled or resolved without the written consent of the Buyers, such
consent  not  to be unreasonably withheld or delayed; provided that if
Buyers do not consent  then any indemnification obligations of Sellers with
respect to such Tax  Claim  shall be limited to the amount Sellers would
have been obligated to indemnify  had such consent been given. The Buyers'
consent shall be deemed given in the  absence of the Sellers' receipt of the
Buyers' response within ten (10) Business  Days of the consent having been
requested in writing by the Sellers. 

 

 

(c) Buyers  shall have the right to control the conduct of any Tax  Claim 
that relates to a Straddle Period; _provided_ ,  that if  the Closing occurs
in 2007, then Sellers shall have the right to control  such  matters as
specified in Section 5.7(b). The Buyers shall  not, without the prior written
consent  of the Sellers (such consent not to be  unreasonably withheld or
delayed), agree or consent to compromise or settle,  either administratively
or after the commencement of litigation, any issue  or  claim arising in
such Proceeding, or otherwise agree or consent to any Tax  liability, to the
extent that any such compromise, settlement, consent or  agreement may
materially increase (i) the Tax liability of the Sellers or  any of  their
Affiliates (other than any Sold Company) or (ii) the IR Federal and 
Consolidated Income Tax liability of any Sold Company, unless the Buyers 
indemnify the Sellers for the increase in such Taxes resulting from such 
compromise, settlement, consent or agreement; _provided_   that if  Sellers
do not consent then any indemnification obligations of Buyers with  respect
to such Tax Claim shall be limited to the amount Buyers would have  been 
obligated to indemnify had such consent been given. The Sellers' consent
shall  be deemed given in the absence of the Buyers' receipt of the Sellers'
response  within ten (10) Business Days of the consent having been requested
in writing  by  the Buyers.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

49  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(d) The  parties agree to cooperate and act in good faith with respect to the
prosecution  and defense of any audit, Tax Claim or other Proceeding arising
hereunder,  including without limitation, timely responding to any notices or
reasonable  requests received from the other party.

 

 

(e) Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary contained or implied in this
Agreement, after the  Closing Date, neither the Buyers nor any Affiliate of
the Buyers (including  the  Sold Companies) shall, without the prior written
consent of the Sellers (which  consent shall not be unreasonably withheld),
file or cause to be filed any  amended Tax Return or claim for Tax refund
with respect to the Sold Companies  (or relating to its income, properties or
operations) if any such filing  could  have the effect (in the Sellers' sole
judgment) of (i) increasing the Tax  liability of the Sellers or their
respective Affiliates (other than any Sold  Company) (or, in each case,
otherwise disadvantaging such party) or (ii)  increasing the IR Federal and
Consolidated Income Tax liability of any Sold  Company.

 

 

(f) Anything  to the contrary contained herein notwithstanding, in respect of
all Losses  and  claims under Sections 5.5, 5.6, 5.7 and 5.8 hereof, other
than with respect  to  IR Federal and Consolidated Income Taxes, none of the
Buyer Indemnified Persons  (as defined herein) shall be entitled to recover
from the Sellers, except  to the  extent the aggregate amount of all such
Losses with respect to any Sold Company  (considered separately) for any
taxable year exceeds $250,000 for such taxable  year, in which case, for the
avoidance of doubt, the amount of such any such  recovery shall be limited to
the amount by which such Losses exceed  $250,000.

 

 

SECTION  5.8. _Refunds  and Tax Benefits_ _;  Bulk  Transfer Laws_.

 

 

(a) Any  Tax  refunds that are received by the Buyers, or the Sold
Companies, and any amounts  credited against Tax (including  any offsetting
adjustments in connection with any audits, examinations or  Tax 
Proceedings) to which the Buyers or the Sold Companies become entitled, that 
relate to Excluded  Assets or Excluded Liabilities or to taxable periods (or
portions thereof  in the  case of a Straddle Period) ending on or before the
Closing Date **** shall  be  for the account of the Sellers, except to the
extent that amounts in respect  of  the right to such refund are reflected
(either as an Asset or in reducing  a  Liability) in the Final Statement of
Net Asset Value, and the Buyers shall  pay  over to the Sellers the net 
amount (after taking into account any costs or expenses of the Buyers or 
the  Sold Companies relating to the receipt thereof) of  any  such refund
or any such credit within fifteen (15) days after the receipt  or 
entitlement thereto. The  Buyers agree that they shall not, without the
Sellers' consent  (such  consent not to be unreasonably withheld), cause or
permit the Sold Companies  to  carry back to any taxable period ending on or
prior to the Closing Date any  net  operating loss, loss from operations or
other Tax attribute, and further  agree  that the  Sellers have no
obligation under this Agreement to return or remit any refund  or  other Tax
benefit attributable to a breach by the Buyers of the foregoing  undertaking.
Any Tax refunds that are received by the Sellers and any amounts  credited
against Tax to which the Sellers become entitled, that relate to  **[**
taxable  periods (or portions thereof in the case of a Straddle Period)
ending after  the  Closing Date (except to the extent that amounts in
respect of the right to  such  refund were paid by the Sellers) **** shall 
be  for the account of the Buyers, and the Sellers shall pay over to the
Buyers  the  net amount (after taking into account any costs or expenses of
the Sellers  relating to the receipt thereof) of any such refund or any such
credit within  fifteen (15) days after receipt or entitlement thereto.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

50  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) Buyers  hereby waive compliance by Sellers and any Affiliates of Sellers
with the  provisions of any so-called "bulk transfer laws" of any
jurisdiction in  connection with the sale of the Business and Acquired
Assets.

 

 

SECTION  5.9. _Employees;  Benefit Plans_. 

 

 

(a) _Employees  and Offers of Employment_.

 

 

(i) The  Sellers and Buyers agree to reasonably cooperate during the period
prior  to the  Closing Date to ensure the continuity of the workforce of the
Business. In  furtherance thereof, prior to, or in connection with, the
Closing, the Buyers  shall take no action to cause the Sellers or the Sold
Companies to terminate  the  employment of any Business Employee, and the
Sellers and the Sold Companies  shall be under no obligation to terminate any
Business Employee prior to  the  Closing. Prior to the Closing Date, all
general communications between the  Buyers and any group of Business
Employees shall be coordinated with the  Sellers; _provided_ ,  that 
Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with the
Buyers  to maintain continuity of the workforce of the Business prior to the
Closing  and  will not intentionally take any action to prevent the transfer
of or otherwise  cause a Business Employee not to transfer to the Buyer.
Subject to applicable  Laws or the provisions of collective bargaining
agreements and works council  agreements, (x) Sellers shall cooperate with
Buyers to publish and distribute  a  notice (in either paper or electronic
format) in a manner reasonably expected  to  be received by Business
Employees within a reasonable period of time (but  not  later than 60 days)
following the date hereof informing the Business Employees  that those
Business Employees who decline the Buyer's offer of employment will  be
terminated by the Sellers as of the Closing and (y) Sellers shall terminate 
the employment, as of the Closing, of any Business Employee who does not 
become  a Transferred Employee. As  soon  as reasonably practicable
following the date of this Agreement, the Buyers  and  Sellers shall
cooperate to arrange for meetings with the Seller's key employees  and
Business Employees at which the Buyers shall have an opportunity to describe 
its expectations regarding the integration of the Business (including the 
Sold  Companies) and prospective employment of the Business Employees with
the  Buyers.  Such meetings shall be scheduled at such times so as not to
unreasonably  interfere with the ongoing operation of the Business.

 

 

(ii) Prior  to  the Closing Date, one or more of the Buyers shall offer
employment, with  comparable job responsibilities as those performed prior to
the Closing Date,  to  each Business Employee (other than an employee of the
Sold Companies, all  of  whom shall continue employment with such Sold
Company as of the Closing Date  by  operation of Law) who is either actively
employed by a Seller as of the Closing  Date or is absent from work as of the
Closing Date by reason of any leave  of  absence (including, without
limitation, vacation, injury, sick leave, long-term  disability, short-term
disability, maternity leave, military service or other  leave of absence from
which an employee's return to active employment is  protected by Law or
Order).

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

51  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(iii) Such  offers of employment described in Section 5.9(a)(ii) shall
include an offer  of  base salary (or wages), commission  rates (if
applicable), target  annual  cash  bonus  opportunity (exclusive of any
stay bonuses, success bonuses and similar  arrangements of IR, any Seller or
Sold Company or any Affiliate of  any of  them in  connection with the
transactions contemplated herein), long-term incentive  opportunities, and
overall employee benefits that, in the  aggregate  (subject  to applicable
Laws, works council and collective bargaining  agreements),  are not  less
than the compensation and employee benefits, as in effect with respect  to 
such Business Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date, and otherwise 
shall be consistent with this Section 5.9. 

 

 

(iv) Buyers'  offers of employment shall not require any Business Employee to
relocate  during  the one year period following the Closing to a work
location more than 20  miles from  such  Business Employee's work location
immediately prior to the Closing. 

 

 

(v) As  of the  Closing Date or, with respect to any Business Employee on an
leave of absence,  as of the date such Business Employee commences active
employment with the  Buyers or returns to active employment with a Sold
Company, each Business  Employee who accepts Buyers' offer of employment,
each Business Employee whose  employment automatically transfers to a Buyer
by operation of local Law,  and  each employee of the Sold Companies (herein
collectively referred to as " _Transferred  Employees_ ")  shall  become
an employee of one or more of the Buyers (or the Sold Companies, as 
applicable).

 

 

(vi) During  the one  year  period from and after the Closing, the Buyers
shall provide to the Transferred  Employees overall employee benefits
(exclusive of any stay bonuses, success  bonuses and similar arrangements of
IR, any Seller or Sold Company or any  Affiliate of any of them in connection
with the transactions contemplated  herein  and any equity, phantom equity
or other equity-based compensation plan,  including the Performance Share
Plan) that are no less favorable, in the  aggregate, than those provided on
average to Transferred Employees immediately  prior to the Closing Date;
_provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that  any specific provision regarding employee
benefits set forth elsewhere in  this  Section 5.9 shall take precedence
over the foregoing general obligation with  respect to the benefits that are
the subject of such specific  provision.

 

 

(vii) Notwithstanding  anything herein to the contrary, nothing in this
Agreement shall alter the  at-will nature of any Transferred Employee's
employment (with the exception of  Transferred Employees who have employment
agreements as disclosed on  _Schedule  5.9(j)_ ,  all of  which shall be
assumed by the Buyer). Nothing in this Agreement shall restrict,  limit or
interfere with the ability (after the Closing) of the Sellers, Buyers  or
their respective Affiliates to terminate, amend or replace any particular 
agreement, plan or program, to alter the terms and conditions of employment 
or  terminate the employment of any person, provided that the requirements
of  this  Section 5.9 are otherwise satisfied.

 

 

(b) _Prior  Service; Deductibles_.  The  Buyers shall, or shall cause their
respective Affiliates to, recognize each  Transferred Employee's service with
the Sellers, the Sold Companies, or any of  their respective Affiliates or
their respective predecessors as of the Closing  Date as service with the
Buyers, the Sold Companies or any of their respective  Affiliates, as
applicable, for all purposes (including, without limitation,  eligibility,
vesting, eligibility waiting periods, benefit accruals but  excluding for
benefit accrual purposes under a defined benefit pension plan  (other  than
a defined benefit pension plan as to which the Buyers are assuming or 
receiving a transfer of assets pursuant to the terms of this Agreement)) 
in  the  Buyers', the Sold Companies' or any of their respective Affiliates'
employee  benefit plans, agreements, policies or other arrangements, to the
extent  that  such service was credited for such purpose under a comparable
plan of the  Sellers, the Sold Companies or any of their respective
Affiliates, (unless  such credit would result in a duplication of benefits
for the same period).  In  addition, to the extent pre-existing condition
limitations have been met  or are  otherwise inapplicable with respect to
Transferred Employees under Sellers' employee welfare benefits plans as of
the Closing Date, the Buyers shall,  or  shall cause their respective
Affiliates to, waive any such pre-existing  condition limitations under
Buyers' employee welfare benefit plans applicable to  Transferred Employees
or their respective spouses or dependents and shall  recognize (or cause to
be recognized) the dollar amount of all expenses incurred  by Transferred
Employees and their respective spouses or dependents during  the  calendar
year in which the Closing occurs for purposes of satisfying the  deductibles
and co-payment or out-of-pocket limitations for such calendar  year  under
the relevant employee welfare benefit plans of the Buyers, the Sold 
Companies and their respective Affiliates, as applicable,  to the  extent
taken into account for such purpose under a comparable plan of the  Sellers,
the Sold Companies or any of their Affiliates.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

52  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(c) _Accrued  Vacation/Repatriation/Relocation_.

 

 

(i) The  Buyers shall, or shall cause their respective Affiliates to, credit
each  Transferred Employee with the accrued and unused vacation days and any
personal  and sickness days accrued in accordance with the vacation and
personnel policies  and labor agreements of the Sellers, the Sold Companies
or any of their  respective Affiliates in effect as of the Closing Date.

 

 

(ii)   For a  period of one (1) year following the Closing, the Buyers
expressly agree  to  honor, and to cause their Affiliates and the Sold
Companies to honor, the  repatriation and relocation programs, policies and
agreement set forth in  _Schedule  5.9(c)(ii)_ ,  for all  Transferred
Employees who participate in such programs, policies and agreements  as of
the Closing Date.

 

 

(d) _Severance  Obligations._

 

 

(i) The  Buyers shall be responsible for any and all severance or similar
liabilities  associated with any Business Employee who declines Buyers' offer
of employment  (each, a " _Non-Transferring  Employee_ ");  _provided_  
that  Seller terminates such Non-Transferring Employee within thirty (30)
days  after  the Closing Date. The Buyers acknowledge and agree that
employees of the  Sold  Companies and all employees otherwise transferring
to the Buyers by operation  of  Law shall not have the ability to decline
employment with Buyers, and all  of  such employees shall be the sole
obligation of the Buyers from and after  the  Closing.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

53  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(ii) Effective  as of the Closing and continuing until the second anniversary
of the Closing,  the Buyers shall, or shall cause their respective Affiliates
to, provide,  where  applicable, each Transferred Employee severance
benefits that are no less  favorable than the severance benefits provided to
such Transferred Employee  under the terms of the Seller's severance plans
identified on _Schedule  5.9(d)(ii)_ ,  as in  effect immediately prior to
the date hereof.

 

 

(e) _Annual  Incentive Matrix Bonus; Performance Share Plan Award; and
Success  Bonus_. 

 

 

(i) No  later  than 90 days after the Closing, Sellers shall prepare, or
cause to be prepared,  a statement (the " _AIM  Calculations Statement_ ") 
containing Sellers' determination of (A) the amount (the " _AIM  Program
Payment Amount_ ")  equal  to the pro rata portion as of 11:59 P.M. local
time on the Closing Date of  the  annual bonuses payable to Transferred
Employees pursuant to the Annual Incentive  Matrix Bonus Program, where
applicable, for the calendar year 2007 as in  effect  on the date hereof
(the " _AIM  Program_ "),  determined in accordance with the terms of the
AIM Program and based upon  financial performance and/or results determined
by Sellers and employee  performance determined by the Sellers and (B) the
federal, state, local and  foreign payroll and other similar Taxes other than
Social Security Taxes  payable  by the Buyers as a result of the payment to
Transferred Employees of bonuses  under the AIM Program in the amount of AIM
Program Payment Amount (the " _Payroll  Tax Amount_ ").  Upon  final
determination of the AIM Program Payment Amount and the Payroll Tax  Amount 
pursuant to this Section 5.9(e)(i), but in no event more than three (3)
business  days thereafter, Sellers shall pay by wire transfer of immediately
available  funds to an account or accounts which are designated by Buyers not
more than  two  (2) business days following Sellers' notice to Buyers of
such final  determination, cash in an amount equal to: (a) the AIM Program
Payment Amount  plus (b) the Payroll Tax Amount. The amount of the AIM
Program Payment Amount  wired by the Sellers to the Buyers shall be used
exclusively for the purpose  of  providing payment to each Transferred
Employee of his or her allocated amount  under the AIM Program. For the
avoidance of doubt, the Final Statement of  Net  Asset Value shall not
include any provision or accrual for any AIM bonus  amount.

 

 

(ii) The  Sellers shall bear the cost of any written "success bonus,"
transaction bonus or  similar arrangement applicable to any Business Employee
to the extent the  consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement is a condition  precedent to payment of any benefits thereunder,
and shall ensure that such  payments and benefits are paid in accordance with
their terms in effect as  of  the Closing Date.

 

 

(iii) The  Sellers shall be solely responsible for all payments and costs
under the  Performance Share Plan, any stock option or other equity, phantom
equity  or  equity-based compensation plan of Sellers or any of its
Affiliates and shall  be  solely responsible for all obligations thereunder
with respect to awards  granted  to Business Employees.

 

 

(f) _Defined  Benefit Plans_. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

54  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(i) (A)  As of  the Closing Date, the Sellers shall cause the trustees of
the _Transferred  Defined Benefit Plans_   (as set  forth on _Schedule 
5.9(f)(i)(A)_ )  to  segregate and transfer to a successor pension plan or
plans of the Buyers,  or  one of their designated Affiliates, in accordance
with the spinoff provisions  set forth under Section 414(l) of the Code,
Treasury  Regulation 1.414(l)-1 and Section 208 of ERISA, assets in a form
mutually  acceptable to Sellers and Buyers equal to the Transfer Amount (as
defined  below),  of the  applicable plan as specified on _Schedule 
5.9(f)(i)_ _(A)_ ,  and  shall make any and all filings and submissions to
the appropriate Governmental  Authority arising in connection with such
segregation and transfer of assets  and  all necessary amendments to
Transferred Defined Benefit Plans and related  trust  agreement to provide
for the segregation of assets and transfer of assets  as  described below.
As soon as practicable after the Closing, the Buyers, or  one of  their
designated Affiliates, shall establish or designate a defined benefit 
pension plan or plans for the benefit of Transferred Employees and Former 
Employees covered by Transferred Defined Benefit Plans and shall make any 
and  all filings and submissions to the appropriate Governmental Authority
required  or desired to be made by it in connection with the transfer of
assets described  below.

 

 

         |  

(B)

    |  

As  soon as practicable after the Closing, Buyers shall procure either  a 
favorable determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service  regarding 
the qualified status of such successor defined benefit plan as  amended to 
the date of transfer, or an opinion of counsel to Buyers reasonably 
satisfactory to the Sellers that the terms of the successor defined  benefit
plan satisfy the applicable requirements of Section 401  of the  Code.

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 

         |  

(C)

Plan.

using  the Sellers' assumptions and methodologies set forth in _Schedule 
5.9(m)(iii)_.

contained  herein;

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

73  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) In  the  event of termination by Sellers or Buyers pursuant to this
Section 8.1, written  notice thereof shall forthwith be given to the other

relating to certain expenses, (iii) Section 8.1 and this Section 8.2 and

and provisions  of  this Agreement; _provided_ ,  that no  party hereto
shall be entitled to recover any special, indirect, incidental,  punitive or
consequential damages whatsoever in respect of such breach by the  other
party, except (x) in the event of fraud or willful misconduct, and (y)  in

(a) Subject  to the limits set forth in this Article IX, from and after the
Closing, the  Sellers agree, jointly and severally, to indemnify, defend and
hold harmless  each Buyer and each of their Affiliates (including, after the
Closing, the  Sold  Companies) and their respective officers, directors,
stockholders, employees,  agents and representatives (the " _Buyer 
Indemnified Persons_ ")  against and in respect of any and all Losses that
they may incur arising out  of  or due to (i) any breach of any
representation or warranty of the Sellers  contained in this Agreement (other
than the Tax representations and warranties  contained in Section 3.11, which
are addressed separately in the Tax indemnity  set forth in Section 5.6, and
other than the representations and warranties  contained in Sections 3.1, 3.2
and 3.3, 3.18 (as it relates to title) and 3.19  (as it relates to title)
(such parts of Article III being referred to  collectively as, the " _Title 
Representations_ ")),  or  in any certificates delivered in connection
herewith, (ii) any breach of any  Title Representations, (iii) any failure of
Sellers to perform any covenant  or  other agreement of the Sellers
contained in this Agreement, and (iv) any  Excluded Asset or Excluded
Liability (other than any Taxes that are Excluded  Liabilities).

 

 

(b) Anything  to the contrary contained herein notwithstanding, in respect of
all Losses  and  claims under clause (i) of Section 9.1(a) (other than with
respect to any breach  of the representation and warranties contained in
Section 3.22), none of the  Buyer Indemnified Persons shall be entitled to
recover from the Sellers any  Losses until the total of all Losses,
regardless of amount, collectively exceed  $50,000,000 (the " _Deductible_
")  and  then only for the amount by which such Losses collectively exceed
the  Deductible.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

74  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(c) Anything  to the contrary contained herein notwithstanding, in respect of
all Losses  and  claims under clause (i) of Section 9.1(a) (other than with
respect to any breach  of the representation and warranties contained in
Section 3.22), the Buyer  Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to
recover more, in the aggregate,  than $700,000,000 (the " _Cap_ ")  from 
the Sellers with respect to all such Losses.

 

 

(d) Anything  to the contrary contained herein notwithstanding, Buyer
Indemnified Parties  shall not be entitled to recover any amount for any
individual Loss and claim  under clause (i) of Section 9.1(a) (other than
with respect to any breach of  the  representation and warranties contained
in Section 3.22) that is less than  $250,000; _provided_ ,  _however_ , 
that in  the event such individual Losses or claims arise from or relate to a
set of  same  or common events, facts or circumstances, such individual
Losses or claims  shall  be aggregated for purposes of calculating Losses
under this Section 9.1. 

 

 

(e) For  the  avoidance of doubt, it is understood and agreed that the
Deductible and the  Cap  shall in no event apply to any Losses or claims
under clauses (ii) through  (iv)  of Section 9.1(a).

 

 

SECTION  9.2. _Indemnification  by the Buyers_. From  and  after the
Closing, the Buyers agree, jointly and severally, to indemnify, defend  and
hold each Seller and each of their Affiliates and their respective officers, 
directors, stockholders, employees, agents and representatives (the " _IR 
Indemnified Persons_ ")  harmless from and in respect of any and all Losses
that they may incur arising  out of or due to (i) any failure of Buyers to
perform any covenant or other  agreement of the Buyers contained in this
Agreement, (ii) any breach of Buyers' representations and warranties
contained in this Agreement and (iii) any  Acquired Asset or Assumed
Liability.

 

 

(b) Anything  to the contrary contained herein notwithstanding, in respect of
all Losses  and  claims under clause (ii) of Section 9.2(a), none of the IR
Indemnified Persons  shall be entitled to recover from the Buyers any Losses
until the total of  all  Losses, regardless of amount, collectively exceed
an amount equal to the  Deductible, and then only for the amount by which
such Losses collectively  exceed the Deductible.

 

 

(c) Anything  to the contrary contained herein notwithstanding, in respect of
all Losses  and  claims under clause (ii) of Section 9.2(a),the IR
Indemnified Parties shall  not  be entitled to recover more, in the
aggregate, than the amount of the Cap from  the Buyers with respect to all
such Losses.

 

 

(d) Anything  to the contrary contained herein notwithstanding, IR
Indemnified Parties shall  not be entitled to recover any amount for any
individual Loss and claim under  clause (ii) of Section 9.2(a) that is less
than $250,000; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that in  the event such
individual Losses or claims arise from or relate to a set of  same  or
common events, facts or circumstances, such individual Losses or claims 
shall  be aggregated for purposes of calculating Losses under this Section
9.2. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

75  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(e) For  the  avoidance of doubt, it is understood and agreed that the
Deductible and the  Cap  shall in no event apply to any Losses or claims
under clauses (i) and (iii)  of  Section 9.2(a).

 

 

SECTION  9.3. _Indemnification  as Exclusive Remedy_. Except  as 
otherwise expressly provided in Article V, and except for claims or actions 
for  fraud, the indemnification provided in this Article IX, subject to the 
limitations set forth herein, shall be the exclusive post-Closing remedy 
available to any party in connection with any Losses arising out of or
resulting  from this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. The
foregoing  notwithstanding, nothing in this Section 9.3 shall limit or
restrict the ability  or right of any party hereto to seek injunctive or
other equitable relief for  any breach or alleged breach of any provision of
Articles II, V or X of this  Agreement; _provided_ ,  that  any procedures
in respect of and limitations on Losses or liabilities in this  Article IX
shall in no event be diminished or circumvented by such  relief.

 

 

SECTION  9.4. _Indemnification  Calculations_.

 

 

(a) The  amount of any Losses for which indemnification is provided under
this Agreement  shall be computed net of any insurance proceeds received by
the indemnified  party in connection with such Losses. If an indemnified
party receives insurance  proceeds in connection with Losses for which it has
received indemnification,  such party shall refund to the indemnifying party
the amount of such insurance  proceeds when received, up to the amount of
indemnification received. An  indemnified party shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to pursue  insurance claims with respect to any Losses. If
the amount with respect to  which  any claim is made under this Agreement
(including under Section 5.6) (an " _Indemnity  Claim_ ")  gives  rise to
a Tax Benefit (as defined below) to the party making the claim, the 
indemnity payment shall be reduced by the amount of such Tax Benefit
available  to the party making the claim. For purposes of this Section
9.4(a), a " _Tax  Benefit_ " to  a  party means an amount by which the
tax liability of such party (or group of  Affiliates including such party) is
or is deemed to be reduced as a result  of  its receipt of payment for such
Indemnity Claim or its payment of the liability  giving rise to such
Indemnity Claim, such amount or deemed amount to be  determined at an assumed
marginal tax rate equal to the highest marginal tax  rate then in effect for
corporate taxpayers in the relevant jurisdiction. The  parties agree that any
indemnification payments made pursuant to this Agreement  shall be treated
for Tax purposes as an adjustment to the Purchase Price, unless  otherwise
required by applicable Law.

 

 

(b) Indemnifiable  Losses shall in no event include any special, indirect,
incidental, punitive  or  consequential damages whatsoever, except (i) in
the event of fraud, gross  negligence or willful misconduct and (ii) in the
event that a third party has  been awarded special, indirect, incidental,
punitive or consequential  damages.

 

 

SECTION  9.5. _Survival_. The  representations and warranties of the parties
contained in this Agreement or  in  any instrument delivered pursuant hereto
will survive the Closing and will  remain in full force and effect thereafter
until 5:00 p.m. (New York City time)  on April 15, 2009; provided, that (i)
the survival of the representations and  warranties contained in Section 3.11
shall be governed by Section 5.6(e), (ii)  the Title Representations shall
expire at 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on  the  tenth (10th)  anniversary
of the Closing Date, and (iii) the representations and warranties  shall
survive beyond the respective periods set forth in this Section 9.5 with 
respect to any breach thereof if written notice thereof shall have been duly 
given within such period in accordance with Section 9.6 hereof.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

76  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

SECTION  9.6. _Notice  and Opportunity to Defend_. If  there  occurs an
event which a party asserts is an indemnifiable event pursuant to  Section
9.1 or 9.2, the party or parties seeking indemnification shall  notify the
other party or parties obligated to provide indemnification (the  "
_Indemnifying  Party_ ")  promptly. If such event involves any claim or the
commencement of any action  or  Proceeding by a third person, the party
seeking indemnification will give such  Indemnifying Party prompt written
notice of such claim or the commencement  of  such action or Proceeding.
However, the failure to provide prompt notice as  provided herein will
relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder  only if, and to
the extent that, such failure actually and materially prejudices  the
Indemnifying Party hereunder. In case any such action shall be brought 
against any party seeking indemnification and it shall notify the
Indemnifying  Party of the commencement thereof, the Indemnifying Party shall
be entitled  to  assume the defense thereof, with counsel selected by the
Indemnifying Party  and,  after notice from the Indemnifying Party to such
party or parties seeking  indemnification of such election so to assume the
defense thereof, the  Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to the party or
parties seeking  indemnification hereunder for any legal expenses of other
counsel or any other  expenses subsequently incurred by such party or parties
in connection with  the  defense thereof. The Indemnifying Party and the
party seeking indemnification  agree to cooperate fully with each other and
their respective counsel in  connection with the defense, negotiation or
settlement of any such action or  asserted liability. The party or parties
seeking indemnification shall have  the  right to participate at their own
expense in the defense of such action or  asserted liability. If the
Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of an action,  no settlement or
compromise thereof may be effected (i) by the Indemnifying  Party without the
written consent of the indemnified party (which consent shall  not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed) unless all relief provided is paid  or 
satisfied in full by the Indemnifying Party or (ii) by the indemnified party 
without the consent of the Indemnifying Party. In no event shall an
Indemnifying  Party be liable for any settlement effected without its
written  consent.

 

 

SECTION  9.7. _Tax  Indemnity_. Other  than as specifically set forth in
Section 9.4, indemnification with respect  to  Taxes shall be governed
exclusively by Section 5.5, Section 5.6, Section  5.7 and Section 5.8.

 

 

SECTION  9.8. _Other  Limitations on Indemnification_. Notwithstanding 
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no Buyer Indemnified 
Person shall be entitled to indemnification under Article IX for any Losses 
to  the extent that such Losses are reflected as a liability of the Business
on  the  Final Statement of Net Asset Value.

ARTICLE  X 

 

 

MISCELLANEOUS

 

 

SECTION  10.1. _Governing  Law_. This  Agreement shall be construed under
and governed by the Laws of the State of  New  York.

 

 

SECTION  10.2. _Projections_. In  connection with the Buyers' investigation
of the Sold Companies and the  Business, the Buyers may have received, or may
receive, from the Sellers and/or  their respective representatives certain
projections and other forecasts for  the  Business, and certain business
plan and budget information. The Buyers  acknowledge that (i) there are
uncertainties inherent in attempting to make  such  projections, forecasts,
plans and budgets, (ii) the Buyers are familiar with  such uncertainties,
(iii) the Buyers are taking full responsibility for making  their own
evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of all estimates, projections, 
forecasts, plans and budgets so furnished to them, and (iv) the Buyers will 
not assert any claim against the Sellers or any of their respective
directors,  officers, employees, Affiliates or representatives, or hold the
Sellers or  any  such Persons liable, with respect to such projections,
forecasts, business  plans  and budget information. Accordingly, the Buyers
acknowledge that the Sellers  make no representation or warranty with respect
to such projections, forecasts,  business plans or budget information and
that the Sellers make only those  representations and warranties explicitly
set forth in Article III.

 

 

SECTION  10.3. _Materiality;  Schedules_.

 

 

(a) As  used  in this Agreement, unless the context would require otherwise,
the terms "material" and the concept of the "material" nature of an effect
upon the Sold  Companies or the Business shall be measured relative to the
entire Business,  taken as a whole, as such business is currently being
conducted.

 

 

(b) There  have been included in the Schedules and may be included elsewhere
in this  Agreement items which are not "material" within the meaning of the
immediately  preceding sentence for informational purposes and in order to
avoid any  misunderstanding, and such inclusion shall not be deemed to be an
agreement  by  the Sellers that such items are "material" or to further
define the meaning of  such term for purposes of this Agreement. With respect
to the Schedules hereto,  no disclosures made on any Schedule with respect to
any representation or  warranty shall be deemed to be made with respect to
any other representation  or  warranty unless expressly made in a schedule
related to such other  representation and warranty (by cross-reference or
otherwise) or unless, and  only to the extent that, it is readily apparent on
the face of such disclosure  that such disclosure contains information which
also modifies another  representation and warranty herein.

 

 

SECTION  10.4. _Amendment_. This  Agreement may not be amended, modified or
supplemented except upon the execution  and delivery of a written agreement
executed by the parties hereto.

 

 

SECTION  10.5. _Waiver_. Any  of  the terms or conditions of this
Agreement, which may be lawfully waived, may  be  waived in writing at any
time by each party which is entitled to the benefits  thereof. Any waiver of
any of the provisions of this Agreement by any party  hereto shall be binding
only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed  on  behalf of such
party. No failure to enforce any provision of this Agreement  shall be deemed
to or shall constitute a waiver of such provision and no waiver  of any of
the provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed to or shall  constitute a
waiver of any other provision hereof (whether or not similar)  nor  shall
such waiver constitute a continuing waiver.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

78  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

SECTION  10.6. _Assignment_. This  Agreement and the rights and obligations
hereunder shall not be assignable  or  transferable by any Buyer or any
Seller (including by operation of law in  connection with a merger or
consolidation of any Buyer or any Seller) without  the prior written consent
of the other parties hereto. Notwithstanding the  foregoing, (a) prior to
Closing, a Buyer may assign its right to purchase the  Acquired Assets or any
of its other rights or any portion thereof hereunder  to  one or more
Affiliates of such Buyer without the prior written consent of  Sellers;
_provided_ ,  that  such assignment shall not relieve any Buyer of its
obligations hereunder and  further _provided_ ,  that  such assignment does
not adversely impact or delay the obtaining of any material  Consent required
by this Agreement to be obtained, and (b) a Buyer may assign  its rights
hereunder by way of security for indebtedness necessary to fund  the 
Buyers' obligations hereunder and such secured party may assign such rights
by  way of exercise of remedies; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that no 
assignment shall relieve any Buyer of its obligations hereunder. Any
attempted  assignment in violation of this Section 10.6 shall be void. The
Buyer may  request consultation with the Seller regarding the feasibility,
costs and Tax  consequences for either party of any acquisition of a Sold
Company effected  through a reverse merger of any Sold Company into an
Affiliate of the Buyer  or  Buyer, and the Seller shall not unreasonably
withhold its consent and  cooperation thereto, given compensation by the
Buyer to the Seller for any  related Seller's Losses under the form of an
increased purchase  price **.**

 

 

SECTION  10.7. _Notices_. Any  notice, demand, or communication required or

exchange regulation, in which case the  party proposing to issue such

SECTION  10.14. _Consent  to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial_. Each 
of  the parties irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
United  States District Court for the Southern District of New York located

not have  jurisdiction, the Supreme Court of the State of New York, New York
County,  for  the purposes of any suit, action or other Proceeding arising
out of this  Agreement or any transaction contemplated hereby. Each of the
parties hereto  irrevocably and fully waives the defense of an inconvenient
forum to the  maintenance of such suit, action or Proceeding. Each of the
parties further  agrees that service of any process, summons, notice or
document to such party's  respective address listed above in one of the
manners set forth in Section  10.7  hereof shall be deemed in every respect
effective service of process in any  such  suit, action or Proceeding.
Nothing herein shall affect the right of any Person  to serve process in any

unconditionally waives any objection to the laying of  venue of any action,
suit or Proceeding arising out of this Agreement or the  transactions

unconditionally waive trial by jury  in  any legal action or Proceeding
relating to this Agreement or any other agreement  entered into in connection
therewith and for any counterclaim with respect  thereto.

 

 

SECTION  10.15. _Enforcement  of Agreement_. Each  party acknowledges and
agrees that the other party would be irreparably damaged  if any of the
provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance  with  their
specific terms and that any breach of this Agreement by a Seller or Buyer 
could not be adequately compensated in all cases by monetary damages alone. 
Accordingly, in addition to any other right or remedy to which any party may 
be  entitled at law or in equity, prior to Closing it shall be entitled to
enforce  any provision of this Agreement by a decree of specific performance
and to  temporary, preliminary and permanent injunctive relief to prevent
breaches  or  threatened breaches of any of the provisions of this
Agreement, without posting  any bond or other undertaking.
