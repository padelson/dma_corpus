(d) if the Second Closing has occurred, then, on April 1, 2015,
Buyer shall deliver or cause to be delivered to Seller the following
aggregate consideration (the " _Deferred Consideration_ " and together with
the Buyer Note and the Second Closing Cash Consideration, the " _Closing
Consideration_ "):

  



  

(i) cash in an amount equal to $125 million, plus, if applicable, an
amount equal to the 2015 Excess Stock Amount; and

  



  

(ii) as determined by Buyer in its sole discretion, either:

  



  

(x) 8,397,857 validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares (the "
_Buyer Shares_ ") of Class A common stock, par value $0.001, of Buyer (the "
_Buyer Class A Stock_ "), provided, however, if such number of shares is
greater than a number representing nineteen and nine tenths percent (19.9%)
of the shares of Buyer Class A Stock outstanding as of March 31, 2015 (such
number, the " _2015 Stock Threshold_ "), then such number of Buyer Shares to
be delivered pursuant to this Section 1.2(d)(ii)(x) shall be reduced to the
2015 Stock Threshold; or

  



  

(y) cash in the amount equal to $200 million.

  



  

For purposes hereof, (i) " _2015 Excess Stock Amount_ " shall mean the number
of shares of Buyer Class A Stock in excess of the 2015 Stock Threshold that
would have been issued under _Section 1.2(d)(ii)(x)_ but for the proviso
thereto, multiplied by the 2015 Buyer VWAP, and (ii) the " _2015 Buyer VWAP_
" shall mean the intraday volume weighted average price of one share of Buyer
Class A Stock, as reported by Bloomberg, LP, over the ten (10) trading days
ending on the trading day immediately preceding April 1, 2015.

  



  

(e) if the Second Closing has occurred, then, subject to _Section
1.2(f)_ , following the Second Closing, and as additional consideration for
the Acquired Interests, Buyer shall pay or cause to be paid an earn-out
payment or special earn-out payment, if any, in accordance with the terms and
conditions set forth in _Annex A_ hereto (the " _Contingent Consideration_ ").
The Contingent Consideration, if any, will be paid in cash and/or shares of
Buyer Class A Stock in accordance with _Annex A_ hereto.

  



  

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if, at the time
Seller is entitled to receive the Deferred Consideration pursuant to
_Section 1.2(d)_ , the sum of (i) the Gross Income that would be recognized
by Seller attributable to the receipt of such Deferred Consideration in the
tax year (such Gross Income determined based on the fair market value of the
Buyer Shares at the time of their issuance), plus (ii) any other Gross Income
that is reasonably expected to be recognized by Seller in the same tax year
and that would not qualify as Gross Income under Section 856(c)(3) of the
Code (the " _Nonqualifying Income_ "), is reasonably expected to exceed 22.5%
of the total Gross Income to be recognized by Seller in such tax year (the "
_Nonqualifying Income Limitation_ "), the amount of Deferred Consideration
that exceeds the amount of Deferred Consideration Seller could receive
pursuant to _Section 1.2(d)_ and not exceed the Nonqualifying Income
Limitation shall be deferred (the " _Deferred Nonqualifying Consideration_
") and Seller shall not be entitled to receive such Deferred Nonqualifying
Consideration until the subsequent tax year. If the receipt of the Deferred
Nonqualifying Consideration by Seller in such subsequent tax year would
reasonably cause Seller to violate the Nonqualifying Income Limitation if
applied to such subsequent tax year, the principles of the prior sentence
shall be applied to the Deferred Nonqualifying Consideration in order to
further defer the receipt by Seller of a sufficient amount of the
Deferred Nonqualifying Consideration to subsequent tax years. The Deferred
Nonqualifying Consideration payable pursuant to the prior two sentences shall
be paid by Buyer to Seller within 5 days after the beginning of the tax year
to which such Deferred Nonqualifying Consideration has been deferred. The
Buyer shall not redeem, except as otherwise permitted under the Buyer Note,
and Seller shall not transfer all or a portion of the Buyer Note in any tax
year to the extent the Gross Income that would be recognized by Seller from
such redemption or transfer if included in the Nonqualifying Income for such
tax year, would cause the total Gross Income to be recognized by Seller in
such tax year to exceed the Nonqualifying Income Limitation. The calculations
required by this paragraph shall be reasonably determined by Seller in
consultation with its external tax accountants. Seller shall notify and
provide to Buyer in writing, no later than 5 days prior to the date of a
scheduled payment of Deferred Consideration, a copy of such calculations and
such notification shall set forth the amount, if any, of such Deferred
Consideration that is Deferred Nonqualifying Consideration to be paid in a
subsequent taxable year. Buyer shall have no liability to Seller, and shall be
held harmless by Seller, in the event that the calculations prepared by
Seller are erroneous.

Section 1.3 _Purchase Price Allocation_. Buyer and Seller agree
that the Closing Consideration and the Contingent Consideration, if any, shall
be allocated among the assets of CCP, the stock of CCA and the Non-
Competition and Exclusivity Agreement in accordance with Section 1060 of the
Code (the " _Allocation Statement_ "). Buyer and Seller shall cooperate to
determine the Allocation Statement within 30 days following the date on which
the Final Closing Statement has been determined in accordance with
_Section 2.1(b)_ , subject to adjustment in the event of a payment of
Contingent Consideration occurring after such determination. If the parties
are unable to reach an agreement regarding the allocation, any disagreements
shall be resolved by the Auditor and the determination by the Auditor shall
be final and binding on the parties. The fees and expenses of the Auditor
shall be shared equally by Seller and Buyer. The parties will report, act and
file Tax Returns (including IRS Form 8594) in all respects and for all Tax
purposes consistent with the Allocation Statement, and the parties and their
respective Affiliates will not take any position inconsistent with the
Allocation Statement for tax, accounting or financial reporting purposes,
unless required to do so by applicable Law.

Article II

  



  

 _WORKING CAPITAL ADJUSTMENT_

  



  

Section 2.1 _Working Capital Adjustment_.

  



  

(a) No less than three (3) Business Days prior to the Second Closing
Date, Seller shall prepare and deliver to Buyer a written closing statement
(the " _Estimated Closing Statement_ ") of the Estimated Closing Net Working
Capital, including the resulting Estimated Closing Net Working Capital
Overage (if any) or Estimated Closing Net Working Capital Shortage (if any),
which Estimated Closing Statement shall be prepared in good faith in
accordance with GAAP applied on a basis consistent with Seller's
accounting principles, policies and methodologies used in connection with the
preparation of the Financial Statements.

  



  

(b) No more than forty-five (45) days after the Second Closing Date,
Buyer shall prepare and deliver to Seller a written statement (the " _Final
Closing Statement_ "), as of the Second Closing Date, of the Final Closing Net
Working Capital, including the resulting Final Closing Net Working Capital
Overage (if any) or Final Closing Net Working Capital Shortage (if any), and
including a reasonably detailed breakdown of the various amounts of each
component of Net Working Capital, which Final Closing Statement shall be
prepared in good faith in accordance with GAAP applied on a basis consistent
with Seller's accounting principles, policies and methodologies used in
connection with the preparation of the Financial Statements.

  



  

(c) No less than five (5) Business Days following the date hereof,
Seller shall prepare and deliver to Buyer an illustrative example of the
Final Closing Statement (including calculations of Net Working Capital),
calculated as if the Second Closing Date were June 30, 2014.

  



  

(d) If Seller disagrees with the calculation of any amounts on the
Final Closing Statement, Seller shall, within thirty (30) days after receipt
of the Final Closing Statement, notify Buyer of such disagreement in writing,
setting forth in detail the particulars of such disagreement. Buyer will
provide Seller with reasonable access upon reasonable notice to any of Buyer's
records and relevant employees not otherwise available to Seller as a result
of the transactions contemplated hereby, to the extent reasonably related to
Seller's review of the Final Closing Statement. If Seller does not provide
such notice of disagreement within the thirty (30)-day period, Seller shall
be deemed to have accepted the Final Closing Statement and the calculation of
all amounts set forth thereon, which shall be final, binding and conclusive
for purposes of this Agreement and not subject to any further recourse by
Seller or its Affiliates. If any such notice of disagreement is timely
provided, Seller and Buyer shall use reasonable best efforts for a period of
five (5) Business Days (or such longer period as they may mutually agree) to
resolve any disagreements with respect to the calculation of any and all
amounts set forth on the Final Closing Statement. If, at the end of such
period, Seller and Buyer are unable to fully resolve the disagreements, the
Auditor shall resolve any remaining disagreements. The Auditor shall be
instructed to (i) consider only such matters as to which there is a
disagreement, (ii) determine, as promptly as practicable, whether the
disputed amounts set forth on the Final Closing Statement were prepared in
accordance with the standards set forth in this Agreement, and (iii) deliver,
as promptly as practicable, to Seller and Buyer its determination in writing.
The resolution for each disputed item contained in the Auditor's
determination shall be made subject to the definitions and principles set
forth in this Agreement, and shall be consistent with either the position of
Seller or Buyer. Seller and Buyer shall bear their own expenses in the
preparation and review of the Estimated Closing Statement and Final Closing
Statement. The fees and expenses of the Auditor shall be allocated between
Seller on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand, in inverse proportion as
they may prevail on the matters resolved by the Auditor, which proportionate
allocation shall be calculated on an aggregate basis based on the relative
dollar values of the amounts in dispute and shall be determined by the Auditor
at the time the determination of such firm is rendered on the merits of the
matters submitted. The determination of the Auditor shall be final, binding
and conclusive for purposes of this Agreement and not subject to any further
recourse by Seller, Buyer or their respective Affiliates. Any dispute with
respect to the Final Closing Statement will not affect any undisputed amounts
in the Final Closing Statement. For purposes of this Agreement, the date on
which the amounts set forth on the Final Closing Statement are finally
determined in accordance with this _Section 2.1(d)_ shall be the "
_Determination Date_."

--- 

    



  

(e) Promptly after the Determination Date, the Closing Consideration
shall be adjusted by an amount (the " _Adjustment Amount_ ") equal to the sum
of (i) the Final Closing Net Working Capital Overage (if any) minus (ii) the
Final Closing Net Working Capital Shortage (if any). The Adjustment Amount
may be a positive or negative number. If the Adjustment Amount is a positive
number, then the Closing Consideration shall be increased by the absolute
value of the Adjustment Amount and Buyer shall pay to Seller an amount in
cash equal to the Adjustment Amount, together with interest thereon from and
including the Second Closing Date through and including the date immediately
prior to the payment date at a rate of 1.7% per annum, such payment to be made
by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by
Seller no later than five (5) Business Days after the Determination Date. If
the Adjustment Amount is a negative number, then the Closing Consideration
shall be decreased by the absolute value of the Adjustment Amount, and Seller
shall pay to Buyer an amount in cash equal to such absolute value, together
with interest thereon from and including the Second Closing Date through and
including the date immediately prior to the payment date at a rate of 1.7% per
annum, such payment to be made by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to an account designated by Buyer no later than five (5) Business Days
after the Determination Date.

and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware. Each
Acquired Company is a corporation or limited liability company duly
incorporated or organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation or organization. Each Acquired
Company has all requisite corporate or limited liability company power and
authority to own or lease all of its properties and assets and to carry on its
Business as it is now being conducted, and is duly licensed or qualified to
do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the Business conducted
by it or the character or location of the properties and assets owned or
leased by it makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except for
failures to be so licensed or qualified, as the case may be, that would not,
individually or in the aggregate, be material to the Acquired Companies and
their respective Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

  



  

(b) Each Acquired Company's Subsidiary (i) is duly organized and
validly existing under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization, (ii) is
duly qualified to do business and in good standing in all jurisdictions
(whether federal, state, local or foreign) where its ownership or leasing of
property or the conduct of its Business requires it to be so qualified and
(iii) has all requisite corporate or limited liability company power and
authority to own or lease its properties and assets and to carry on its
business as now conducted, except for failures to be so qualified or in good
standing or have such requisite powers, as the case may be, that would not,

their respective Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

  



  

(c) Other than each Acquired Company's Subsidiaries, the Acquired
Companies do not hold any interests, either directly or indirectly, in any
other entities. The following constitute the only material Subsidiaries of the

Subsidiary's treasury. As of the date of this Agreement, no Equity Interests
of any Acquired Company or any of its Subsidiaries were reserved for
issuance. All of the issued and outstanding Equity Interests of each Acquired
Company have been duly authorized and validly issued and, as applicable, are
fully paid, nonassessable, free and clear of all Liens (other than Permitted
Liens), and not subject to preemptive rights. Except pursuant to this
Agreement, the Acquired Companies do not have and are not bound by any
outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants, calls, commitments or agreements
of any character calling for the purchase or issuance of any Equity Interests
of any Acquired Company or any securities representing the right to purchase
or otherwise receive any such Equity Interests. Neither the Acquired Companies
nor any of their respective Subsidiaries have issued or awarded, or
authorized the issuance or award of any, and there are currently no
outstanding, options or other equity-based awards under the Acquired Company
Benefit Plans or otherwise for the purchase or issuance of any Equity
Interests of any Acquired Company. There are no outstanding bonds,
debentures, notes or other Indebtedness of any Acquired Company or
any Subsidiary of an Acquired Company having the right to vote (or
convertible into, or exchangeable for, securities having the right to vote)
on any matter on which holders of Equity Interests in any Acquired Company or
such Subsidiary may vote.

  



  

(b) All of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock or
other Equity Interests of each Subsidiary of an Acquired Company are owned by
such Acquired Company, directly or indirectly, free and clear of any liens,
claims, mortgages, encumbrances, pledges, security interests, equities or
charges of any kind (other than liens for property Taxes not yet due and
payable, collectively, " _Liens_ "), other than Permitted Liens (which shall
be released in full at or prior to the Second Closing) and all of such shares
or Equity Interests are duly authorized and validly issued and are fully
paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive rights. No such Subsidiary has or
is bound by any outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants, calls,
commitments or agreements of any character calling for the purchase or
issuance of any shares of capital stock or other Equity Interest of such
Subsidiary or any securities representing the right to purchase or otherwise
receive any shares of capital stock or any other Equity Interest of such
Subsidiary. No Subsidiary of any Acquired Company owns any Equity Interests
in any Acquired Company.

parties thereto) constitute valid and binding obligations of Seller,
enforceable against Seller in accordance with their respective terms (except

any Acquired Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, or by which they
or any of their respective properties or assets may be bound or affected,
except for such violations, conflicts, breaches or defaults with respect to
clause (ii)(B) that are not reasonably likely to have, either individually or
in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Seller.

laws of the State of Delaware and has the requisite organizational power and
authority and any necessary governmental authorization to own, lease and, to
the extent applicable, operate its properties and to carry on its business as
it is now being conducted. Buyer is duly qualified or licensed to do
business, and is in good standing, in each jurisdiction where the
character of the properties owned, operated or leased by it or the nature of
its business makes such qualification, licensing or good standing necessary,
except for failures to be so licensed, qualified or in good standing, as the
case may be, that would not, individually or in the aggregate, be material to
Buyer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

  



  

Section 4.2 _Capital Structure_

  



  

(a) The authorized capital stock of Buyer consists of (i)
100,000,000 shares of Buyer Class A Stock, (ii) 10,000,000 shares of Class
B common stock, $0.001 par value (the " _Buyer Class B Stock_ ") and (iii)

options, restricted stock or other equity-based awards under any Buyer
Benefit Plan or otherwise, and there are no options, restricted stock or other
equity-based awards issued by Buyer or any Subsidiary of Buyer currently
outstanding under the Buyer Benefit Plans or otherwise. All issued and
outstanding shares of the capital stock of Buyer are duly authorized, validly
issued, fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive rights. There are no
outstanding bonds, debentures, notes or other Indebtedness of Buyer having the
right to vote (or convertible into, or exchangeable for, securities having

stock may vote.

their respective terms (except as may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,
moratorium, reorganization or similar Laws affecting the rights of creditors
generally and the availability of equitable remedies).

exhibits included or incorporated by reference therein at the time they were
filed (or, if amended or superseded by a subsequent filing, as of the date of
the last such amendment or superseding filing prior to the date hereof),
contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading.

consolidated financial position of Buyer and its consolidated subsidiaries at
the respective dates thereof and the consolidated results of Buyer's
operations and cash flows for the periods indicated therein, in each case in

regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP.

  



  

(d) Buyer has established and maintains a system of "disclosure
controls and procedures" (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the

by Buyer in the reports that it files or furnishes under the Exchange Act is
made known to the chief executive officer and chief financial officer of
Buyer.

  



  

(e) Buyer does not have outstanding (nor has it arranged or
modified) any "extensions of credit" (within the meaning of Section 402 of
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002) to its directors or executive officers (as
defined in Rule 3b-7 under the Exchange Act).

of its Subsidiaries, or any of their respective properties, at law or in
equity, or (ii) Orders against Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries, in each case
of clause (i) or (ii), which would, individually or in the aggregate, be
material to Buyer and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

would not, individually or in the aggregate, be material to Buyer and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole, each of Buyer and its Subsidiaries is, and

organization has been, in compliance with and is not in default under or in
violation of any applicable Law.

there has not been a Material Adverse Effect on Buyer.

included in the Buyer SEC Documents, (ii) liabilities incurred in connection
with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and (iii)

practice since December 31, 2013, neither Buyer nor any of its Subsidiaries

Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

to the exchange of information, each party shall, and shall cause
its Subsidiaries to, afford to the officers, employees, accountants, counsel
and other representatives of the other party, reasonable access, during
normal business hours during the period from the date of this Agreement to the
Second Closing, to all of such party's properties, books, contracts,
commitments and records, and, during such period, each of the parties shall,
and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, make available to the other party all
other information concerning such party's business, properties and personnel
as the other party may reasonably request. None of the parties and their
Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or to disclose
information where such access or disclosure would jeopardize the attorney-
client privilege of such party or its Subsidiaries or contravene any Law,
rule, regulation, order, judgment, decree, fiduciary duty or binding agreement
entered into prior to the date of this Agreement. The parties shall make
appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which
the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply.

  



  

(b) All information and materials provided pursuant to or in
connection with this Agreement shall be subject to the provisions of the
Confidentiality Agreement, entered into between Seller GP and Buyer on
September 3, 2014 (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "). From and after the
Second Closing, Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates and
representatives to, keep confidential and not use for any purpose all
nonpublic information regarding the Business or any of the Acquired Companies
or their respective Subsidiaries of which Seller or such Affiliates or
representatives may be aware (" _Business Information_ "), subject only
to the exceptions to the confidentiality and non-use obligations of Seller
and such Affiliate and representatives in the Confidentiality Agreement, as
applied _mutatis mutandis_ to Seller and such Affiliates and representatives
with respect to Business Information.

prior to the Second Closing (i) true and complete copies of combined audited
balance sheets for the Acquired Companies and their respective Subsidiaries as
of December 31, 2012 and 2013 and the related combined statements of
operations, statements of stockholder's equity and statements of cash flows
for the years then ended and (ii) the unaudited combined balance sheets of the
Acquired Companies and their respective Subsidiaries as of the most recent
quarter required to be filed in reports with the SEC, and the related combined
statements of operations, statements of stockholder's equity and statements
of cash flows for the quarter then ended. These audited financial
statements and interim financial statements shall be prepared in accordance
with GAAP consistently applied and fairly present, in all material respects,
the combined financial condition, results of operations, stockholder's equity
and cash flows of the Acquired Companies and their respective Subsidiaries as
of the applicable dates or for the applicable periods, in such form as may be
required for filing with the SEC. In addition, promptly following Buyer's

be required to be included in Seller's filings with the SEC.

  



  

Section 6.4 _Legal Conditions_. Subject to _Section 6.1(b)_ , each
of the parties shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use their
reasonable best efforts (i) to take, or cause to be taken, all actions
necessary, proper or advisable to comply promptly with all legal requirements
that may be imposed on such party or its Subsidiaries with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and, subject to the conditions
set forth in _Article VII_ , to consummate such transactions, and (ii) to
obtain (and to cooperate with the other parties to obtain) any material
consent, authorization, order or approval of, or any exemption by, any
Governmental Entity and any other third party that is required to be obtained
by such party or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

Section 6.5 _Employee Matters_.

  



  

(a) Immediately prior to the Second Closing, Seller shall (i) cause
the Retained Employees to be employed by Seller or an Affiliate of Seller
other than any Acquired Company or Subsidiary of an Acquired Company and (ii)
cause the Acquired Companies or their Subsidiaries to, terminate or assign
and transfer to an Affiliate of Seller other than any Acquired Company or
Subsidiary of an Acquired Company each Acquired Company Benefit Plan and all
assets thereof, other than any Acquired Company Benefit Plan listed on
_Section 6.5(a)_  of the Seller Disclosure Letter (each such listed plan an "
_Assumed Benefit Plan_ ").

  



  

(b) On or following the First Closing, Buyer shall, or shall cause
one if its Affiliates to, make an offer of employment to each of
the employees listed in _Section 6.5(b)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter (the
" _Designated Employees_ "), which employment, with respect to each
Designated Employee, shall be effective upon such Designated Employee's
acceptance of such offer (or another date prior to the Second Closing as
designated by Buyer). Seller shall reasonably cooperate with Buyer and
any such Designated Employee that accepts such offer of employment with
regard to the termination of such Designated Employee's employment with an
Acquired Company or any Subsidiary of an Acquired Company. In the event that
this Agreement terminates prior to the consummation of the Second Closing,
(i) any such offers of employment that have not been accepted by a Designated
Employee, or under which a Designated Employee has not yet commenced
employment with Buyer, shall be revoked and rescinded, and upon
such revocation and rescission, such offers shall have no further force or
effect; and (ii) Buyer shall cause the employment of any Designated Employee
hired and employed by Buyer or one of its Affiliates to be terminated
effective upon the termination of this Agreement, and Seller shall cause the
Acquired Company or Subsidiary of an Acquired Company that previously employed
such Designated Employee to offer employment to such Designated Employee upon
the same terms as applied to such Designated Employee prior to the First
Closing.

  



  

(c) From and after the Second Closing, any individual who remains
employed with an Acquired Company or any Subsidiary of an Acquired Company as
of the Second Closing, and from and after the date a Designated Employee
begins employment with Buyer or one of its Affiliates with respect to those
Designated Employees to whom an offer was made in accordance with _Section
6.5(b)_ and accepted (such employees collectively, the " _Business Employees_
") will participate and be covered or be offered participation and coverage,
as applicable, under the applicable Buyer Benefit Plans; _provided_ , that
continued participation and coverage following the Second Closing under any
Assumed Benefit Plan as in effect immediately prior to the Second Closing
shall be deemed to satisfy the obligations under this sentence.

  



  

   

24

(d) Buyer shall cause each Buyer Benefit Plan in which Business
Employees are eligible to participate to take into account for purposes
of eligibility, vesting and benefit accruals under the Buyer Benefit Plans
(other than benefit accruals under any of Buyer's tax-qualified and non-
qualified defined benefit pension plans) the service of such Business
Employees with the Acquired Companies and their Subsidiaries (and any
predecessor entities) to the same extent as such service was credited for such
purpose by the Acquired Companies and their Subsidiaries under a comparable
Acquired Company Benefit Plan; _provided_ , _however_ , that such
service shall not be recognized to the extent that such recognition would
result in a duplication of benefits with respect to the same period of
service or with respect to newly implemented plans for which prior service is
not taken into account or with respect to plans for which participation,
service and/or benefit accrual is frozen. Nothing herein shall limit the
ability of Buyer to amend or terminate any of the Assumed Benefit Plans or
Buyer Benefit Plans in accordance with their terms at any time.

  



  

(e) At and following the Second Closing, Buyer will honor the
accrued and vested obligations of the Acquired Companies and their
Subsidiaries as of the Second Closing under the provisions of the Assumed
Benefit Plans, _provided_ , that this provision shall not prevent Buyer from
amending, suspending or terminating any such plans or agreements to the extent
permitted by the respective terms of such plans or agreements. Nothing
contained in this Agreement shall constitute or be deemed to be an amendment
to any Acquired Company Benefit Plan (including any Assumed Benefit Plan),
Buyer Benefit Plan or any other compensation or benefit plan, program or
arrangement of Buyer, Seller, the Acquired Companies and their respective
Subsidiaries.

  



  

(f) If Business Employees become eligible to participate in a
medical, dental or other health care insurance plan of Buyer, Buyer
shall cause each such plan to (i) waive any preexisting condition limitations
to the extent such conditions are covered under the applicable medical,
health or dental plans of Buyer, (ii) honor under such plans any deductible,
co-payment and out-of-pocket expenses incurred by such employees and their
beneficiaries during the portion of the calendar year prior to such
participation and (iii) waive any waiting period limitation or evidence of
insurability requirement which would otherwise be applicable to such employee
on or after the Second Closing for the year in which the Second Closing or
participation in such medical, dental or other health care insurance plan of
Buyer, as applicable, occurs, in each case to the extent such employee had
satisfied any similar limitation or requirement under an analogous medical,
dental or other health care insurance plan of Seller, the Acquired Companies
and their respective Subsidiaries prior to the Second Closing for the year in
which the Second Closing or participation in such medical, dental or health
care insurance plan of Buyer, as applicable, occurs.

  



  

(g) To the extent any employee of an Acquired Company or a
Subsidiary of an Acquired Company (including any Designated Employee),
other than a Retained Employee, does not become a Business Employee, Buyer
shall be solely responsible for, and Seller shall have no responsibility,
liability or obligation for, any and all cash severance amounts payable to
such employees in connection with their termination of employment from an
Acquired Company or Affiliate of an Acquired Company, as applicable, other
than amounts payable with respect to the termination or accelerated vesting
of any equity-related rights (i.e., restricted stock) held by such
employees as of the date of termination.

  



  

(h) Without limiting the generality of _Section 10.9_ , this
_Section 6.5_ shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of each
party to this Agreement, and nothing in this _Section 6.5_ , express or
implied, is intended to confer upon any other Person, including any current
or former director, officer or employee the Acquired Companies and their
respective Subsidiaries, any rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever
under or by reason of this _Section 6.5_.

  



  

Section 6.6 _Additional Agreements_. In case at any time after the
Second Closing any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement or to vest Buyer with full title to all properties,
assets, rights, approvals, immunities and franchises of any of the Acquired
Companies or their respective Subsidiaries, the proper officers and
directors of each party and its Subsidiaries shall take all such necessary
action as may be reasonably requested by, and at the sole expense of, Buyer.

  



  

Section 6.7 _Advice of Changes_. Each party shall promptly advise
the other parties of any change or event (i) having or reasonably likely to
have a Material Adverse Effect on Seller or Material Adverse Effect on Buyer,
as the case may be, or (ii) that it believes would or would be reasonably
likely to cause or constitute a material breach of any of such party's
representations, warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement;

  



  

   

25 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

 _provided_ ,  _however_ , that no such notification shall affect the
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties (or
remedies with respect thereto) or the conditions to the obligations of the
parties under this Agreement; _provided_ ,  _further_ , that a failure to
comply with this _Section 6.7_ shall not constitute (i) the failure of any
condition set forth in _Article VII_ to be satisfied unless the underlying
Material Adverse Effect on Seller or Material Adverse Effect on Buyer, as
applicable, or material breach would independently result in the failure of a
condition set forth in _Article VII _ to be satisfied or (ii) a breach of
covenant or agreement pursuant to _Section 8.2(a)(y)_ or _Section 8.2(b)(y)_.

  



  

Section 6.8 _General Release of Claims_. Effective as of the
Second Closing, Seller, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates (other than
the Acquired Companies and their respective Subsidiaries) (collectively, the "
_Releasing Persons_ "), hereby irrevocably releases and forever discharges
each of the Acquired Companies and their respective Subsidiaries (for the
benefit of Buyer and its respective Subsidiaries (including the Acquired
Companies) and their respective parents, subsidiaries, Affiliates, divisions
and predecessors and their respective past and present directors, managers,
officers, employees and agents, and each of their respective successors,
heirs, assigns, executors and administrators (collectively, the " _Released
Persons_ ")) of and from all manner of action and actions, cause and causes
of action, suits, rights, debts, dues, sums of money, accounts, bonds, bills,
covenants, contracts, controversies, omissions, promises, variances,
trespasses, losses, judgments, executions, claims and demands whatsoever, in
Law or in equity that any of the Releasing Persons ever had, now has or which
it hereafter can, shall or may have, against the Released Persons, whether
known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, matured or unmatured, fixed or
contingent, for, upon or by reason of any matter or cause arising at any time
prior to the Second Closing, other than as provided in or contemplated by
this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement (it being expressly understood and
agreed that there shall be no release or waiver with respect to any of the
matters set forth in _Section 10.1_ ).

  



  

Section 6.9 _Tax Matters_.

  



  

(a) _Tax Indemnification by Seller_. From and after the Second
Closing, Seller shall pay or cause to be paid, and shall indemnify Buyer and
each of its Affiliates (including the Acquired Companies and their
Subsidiaries after the Closing Date) (collectively, the " _Buyer Tax
Indemnified Parties_ ") and hold each Buyer Tax Indemnified Party harmless
from and against: (A) any Taxes imposed on the Acquired Companies or any of
their Subsidiaries for any Pre-Closing Period; (B) any Taxes of Seller or any
of its affiliates (other than the Acquired Companies or any of their

any similar provision of state, local or foreign Law); (C) any and all Taxes
of any Person imposed on an Acquired Company or its Subsidiaries as a result
of any Tax Sharing Agreement or Tax allocation agreement, arrangement, or
understanding entered into by such Acquired Company or its Subsidiaries prior
to the Second Closing; (D) any Taxes resulting from any transfer of assets or
employees or restructuring in anticipation of or in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Restructuring
Transactions contemplated by _Section 6.10_ ); (E) any Taxes arising out of
or relating to any breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty
contained in _Section 3.9(m)_ ; (F) any Taxes arising out of or relating to
any breach of any covenant or agreement of Seller contained in this
Agreement; (G) any Transfer Taxes for which Seller is responsible under
_Section 6.9(i)_ ; and (H) any costs and expenses, including reasonable legal
fees and expenses attributable to any item described in clauses (A) to (G) in
each case except to the extent a liability or reserve for such Taxes was
reflected in the calculation of the Final Acquired Companies' Indebtedness or
the Final Closing Net Working Capital.

  



  

(b) _Tax Indemnification by Buyer_. From and after the Second
Closing, Buyer shall pay or cause to be paid, and shall indemnify Seller and

26 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

including) the Second Closing Date. To the extent not so permitted or
required by applicable Law, for purposes of this Agreement, in the case of
any Straddle Period, (i) Taxes of an Acquired Company and its Subsidiaries
imposed on a periodic basis and not based on income, or any transaction or
event (such as real or personal property Taxes) allocable to the Pre-Closing
Period shall be equal to the amount of such Taxes for the entire Straddle
Period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of
calendar days during the Straddle Period that are in the Pre-Closing Period
and the denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the entire
Straddle Period, and (ii) in the case of all other Taxes of an Acquired
Company and its Subsidiaries allocable to the Pre-Closing Period, such Taxes
shall be computed as if such taxable period ended as of the end of the day on

that are calculated on an annual basis (including, but not limited
to, depreciation and amortization deductions) shall be allocated between the
period ending on the Second Closing Date and the period beginning after the
Second Closing Date in proportion to the number of days in each period.

  



  

(d) _Tax Returns_.

  



  

(i) Seller shall prepare or shall cause to be prepared any Tax
Return that is required to be filed by or with respect to an Acquired
Company or its Subsidiaries for any taxable period that ends on or before the
Second Closing Date (a " _Pre-Closing Tax Return_ "). Seller shall (x)
prepare such Pre-Closing Tax Returns in a manner consistent with the past Tax
accounting practices, methods, elections and conventions of the relevant
entity and in compliance with applicable Laws, and (y) deliver to Buyer for
its review and comment a copy of any such Pre-Closing Tax Return required to

such Pre-Closing Tax Returns all reasonable comments received from Buyer not
later than fifteen (15) days before the due date thereof (taking into account
any extensions). Seller shall timely file or cause to be timely filed any
Pre-Closing Tax Return that is required to be filed (taking into account any
extensions) on or before the Second Closing Date. Seller shall deliver, or
cause to be delivered, to Buyer all Pre-Closing Tax Returns that are required
to be filed after the Second Closing Date at least five (5) days prior to the
due date for filing such Tax Returns (taking into account any extensions),
together with payment by Seller of the amount of any Taxes shown as due

to be timely filed such Tax Returns.

  



  

(ii) Buyer shall prepare and timely file or cause to be prepared and
timely filed all Tax Returns and in compliance with applicable Laws
with respect to an Acquired Company or its Subsidiaries for any Straddle
Period. In the case of any such Tax Return for a Straddle Period (a "
_Straddle Period Tax Return_ "), such Tax Returns shall be prepared in a
manner consistent with past practice of the Acquired Companies and Buyer
shall deliver to Seller for its review and comment a copy of such Straddle
Period Tax Returns at least thirty (30) days prior to the due date thereof
(taking into account any extensions) and Buyer shall reflect on such
Tax Returns all reasonable comments received from Seller not later than
fifteen (15) days before the due date thereof (taking into account any
extensions) to the extent such comments relate to the Pre-Closing Period.
Seller shall pay to Buyer at least five (5) days prior to the due date for
filing such Straddle Period Tax Returns (taking into account any extensions)
the amount of any Taxes shown as due thereon allocable (as determined under
_Section 6.9(c)_ ) to the Pre-Closing Period (other than to the extent a
liability or reserve for such Taxes was reflected in the calculation of the
Final Acquired Companies' Indebtedness or the Final Closing Net Working
Capital).

  



  

(e) _Tax Contests_.

  



  

(i) If any Taxing Authority asserts a Tax Claim, then the party to
this Agreement first receiving notice of such Tax Claim promptly
shall provide written notice thereof to the other party to this Agreement;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the failure of such party to give such prompt
notice shall not relieve the other party of any of its obligations under this
_Section 6.9_ , except to the extent that the other party is actually
prejudiced by such failure. Such notice shall specify in reasonable detail the
basis for such Tax Claim and shall include a copy of the relevant portion of
any correspondence received from the Taxing Authority.

  



  

(ii) In the case of a Tax Proceeding of or with respect to an
Acquired Company or its Subsidiaries for any taxable period ending on

such Tax Proceeding; provided, however, that Seller shall (x) keep Buyer
reasonably informed with respect

  



  

   

27 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

to such Tax Proceeding, (y) consult Buyer before taking any significant
action in connection with such Tax Proceeding, and (z) to the extent that a
settlement or compromise of such Tax Proceeding could reasonably be expected
to have an adverse effect on Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries (including the
Acquired Companies or any of their Subsidiaries), not settle or compromise
such Tax Proceeding without the prior written consent of Buyer, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld.

  



  

(iii) In the case of a Tax Proceeding of or with respect to an
Acquired Company or its Subsidiaries for any Straddle Period, Buyer
shall have the right to control such Tax Proceeding; provided, however, that
Buyer shall (x) keep Seller reasonably informed with respect to such Tax
Proceeding, (y) consult Seller before taking any significant action in
connection with such Tax Proceeding, and (z) to the extent that a settlement
or compromise of such Tax Proceeding could reasonably be expected to have an
adverse effect on Seller or any of its Subsidiaries, not settle or compromise
such Tax Proceeding without the prior written consent of Seller,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

  



  

(iv) Buyer shall have the exclusive right to control any Tax
Proceeding other than any Tax Proceeding described in _Section 6.9(e)(ii)_
 and _Section 6.9(e)(iii)_.

  



  

(f) _Cooperation and Exchange of Information_.

  



  

(i) Each party to this Agreement shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates to, provide to the other party to this Agreement such
cooperation, documentation and information as either of them reasonably may
request in (i) filing any Tax Return, amended Tax Return or claim for refund,
(ii) determining a liability for Taxes or an indemnity obligation under this
_Section 6.9_ or a right to refund of Taxes, or (iii) conducting any Tax

powers of attorney, copies of all relevant portions of relevant Tax Returns,
together with all relevant portions of relevant accompanying schedules and
relevant work papers, relevant documents relating to rulings or other
determinations by Taxing Authorities and relevant records concerning the
ownership and Tax basis of property and other information, which any such
party may possess. Each party shall make its employees reasonably available
on a mutually convenient basis at its cost to provide an explanation of any
documents or information so provided.

  



  

(ii) Each party shall retain all Tax Returns, schedules and work
papers, and all material records and other documents relating to Tax
matters, of the relevant entities for their respective Tax periods ending on
or prior to the Second Closing Date until the later of (x) the expiration of
the statute of limitations for the Tax periods to which the Tax Returns and
other documents relate, or (y) eight (8) years following the due date
(without extension) for such Tax Returns. Thereafter, the party holding such
Tax Returns or other documents may dispose of them after offering the other
party reasonable notice and opportunity to take possession of such Tax
Returns and other documents at such other party's own expense.

  



  

(g) After the Second Closing, all refunds received by Buyer or any
of its affiliates (including the Acquired Companies and their
Subsidiaries) for Taxes of an Acquired Company or any of its Subsidiaries for
any Pre-Closing Period (other than (i) any refund of Taxes attributable to,
or resulting from, a carry back of any item of loss, deduction, credit or
other similar item arising in a Post-Closing Period or, in the case of a
refund of Taxes for a Straddle Period, the use of the prorated amount of any
such item that arises in a Post-Closing Period and (ii) any refund reflected
as an asset in the Final Closing Net Working Capital) shall be for the account
of Seller and shall be paid by Buyer to Seller, net of expenses and net of
any Taxes imposed on or resulting from the receipt of such refund. The amount
of any other refund of Taxes shall be for the account of Buyer. To the extent
that a refund that gives rise to a payment to Seller hereunder is
subsequently disallowed or otherwise reduced, Seller shall pay to Buyer the
amount of such disallowed or reduced refund.

  



  

(h) _Tax Treatment of Payments_. Except to the extent otherwise
required pursuant to a Determination, Seller, Buyer, the Acquired Companies
and their respective Subsidiaries and their respective Affiliates shall treat
any and all payments under this _Section 6.9_ , _Section 1.2(e)_ , _Section
2.1(e)_ , and _Article VIII_ as an adjustment to the consideration for income
Tax purposes.

  



  

(i) _Transfer Taxes_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, each of Seller and Buyer shall pay and be responsible for
fifty percent (50%) of any sales, use, transfer, documentary, stamp, value

  



  

   

28 
--- 

 


--- 

    

  



  

added or similar Taxes and related fees imposed on or payable with respect to
the transactions contemplated hereby (" _Transfer Taxes_ "). Such Transfer
Taxes shall be paid by the party responsible under applicable Law to pay such
Transfer Taxes (with the other party indemnifying the party that is legally
responsible to pay the Tax, its share of such Tax at least three (3) days
before the Tax payment due date). Both parties shall, and shall cause their
respective Affiliates to, cooperate in the execution of the Tax Returns and
other filings relating to such Transfer Taxes.

  



  

(j) _Timing of Payments_. Any indemnity payment required to be made
pursuant to this Section 6.9 shall be made within ten (10) days after the
indemnified party makes written demand upon the indemnifying party, but in no
case earlier than five (5) days prior to the date on which the relevant Taxes
or other amounts are required to be paid to the applicable Taxing Authority.

  



  

(k) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
indemnification with respect to Taxes and the procedures relating thereto
shall be governed exclusively by this _Section 6.9_ , _Section 8.3_ and
_Section 8.4_ , and the provisions of _Article VIII_  (other than _Section
8.3_ and _Section 8.4_ ) shall not apply. The covenants and agreements in this
_Section 6.9_  and the representations and warranties contained in _Section
3.9(m)_ shall survive the Second Closing until the date that is six (6)
months after the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations;
provided, however, that any claim for indemnity made by a party hereto on or
prior to such date shall survive until such claim is finally resolved. The
representations and warranties contained in _Section 3.9_ (other than in
_Section 3.9(m)_ ) shall not survive, and shall terminate at, the Second
Closing.

  



  

Section 6.10 _Certain Pre-Closing Transactions_. Prior to the Second
Closing, Seller shall complete each of the following transactions
(collectively, the " _Restructuring Transactions_ "), in each case pursuant to
documentation in form and substance satisfactory to Seller and Buyer:

  



  

(a) distribute or cause the distribution of all of the Equity
Interests of CREI Advisors, LLC to Seller or an Affiliate of Seller (other
than any Acquired Company or Subsidiary of any Acquired Company); and

  



  

(b) cause the Designated FFandE to be transferred to an Acquired
Company or a Subsidiary of an Acquired Company.

  



  

Section 6.11 _Change of Name_. Effective upon the Second Closing,
Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, cease all use of the name
"Cole" and any derivative thereof for marketing, promotion or sales purposes
to customers or the general public, except (solely with respect to the
general public) for a transition period not to exceed forty-five (45) days
immediately following the Second Closing Date.

  



  

  

Section 6.12 _Subsidiary Advisory Agreement_. Seller agrees that,
after the Second Closing, it or one of its Affiliates will enter into a sub-
advisory agreement with the advisor of each of Cole Credit Property Trust VI,
Inc., a Maryland corporation, and Cole Office and Industrial REIT (CCIT III),
Inc., a Maryland corporation, each of which as of the date of this Agreement
has not been formed (the " _Designated Formation Funds_ "), as promptly as
practicable after the formation of each such Designated Formation Fund (the "
_Formation Fund Sub-Advisory Agreement_ "). Seller and Buyer agree that the
advisory agreement to be entered into with each of the Designated Formation
Funds (the " _Formation Fund Advisory Agreement_ ") will be materially in the
same form as the advisory agreement for the prior Designated Fund in such
series, subject only to such changes as may be required by
Governmental Entities, as do not materially adversely affect Seller or as are
agreed to by Seller and Buyer (the " _Permitted Changes_ "), and that the
Formation Fund Sub-Advisory Agreement (other than to reflect the fee schedule
set forth in _Section 6.12_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter) will be
substantially in the same form as the Formation Fund Advisory Agreement, with
such changes as are necessary to conform to the Permitted Changes or as are
agreed to by Seller and Buyer. Except for the Designated Funds and the
Designated Formation Funds, neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates will
serve as sub-advisor to any fund sponsored by Buyer, unless Seller and Buyer
otherwise agree.

  



  

Section 6.13 _Reaffirmation of Advisory Agreement_. On or before the
Second Closing, Seller shall use, and shall cause its applicable Affiliates to
use, commercially reasonable best efforts to assist Buyer and the Acquired
Companies in reaffirming or renewing, or causing to be reaffirmed or renewed,
any advisory contract, investment management contract, property management
contract, dealer manager agreement, soliciting dealer agreement and any
similar agreement which relates to the Business.

Section 6.14 _No Negotiation_. During the period commencing on the
date hereof and ending on the earlier of the Second Closing Date or the
date on which this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Article IX_ , Seller
shall not, shall not authorize or permit any of its Affiliates to, and shall

or arising out of (x) any inaccuracy in any representation or breach of
warranty of Seller contained in _Article III_ (other than _Section 3.9_ ,

_Seller Indemnified Party_ "), against any and all Damages incurred, asserted

all Damages with respect to its Breaches in excess of $10 million;

  



  

   

34 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(ii) the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any single claim
or series of related claims with respect to such Breaches which result in
Damages of $250,000 or less (and such claims shall not be aggregated for
purposes of aggregating Damages pursuant to clause  _Section 8.2(c)(i)_ );
and

  



  

(iii) the Indemnifying Party's maximum aggregate liability for all
such Breaches shall not exceed $75 million;

  



  

 _provided_ , _further_ , that the limitations on indemnifiable Damages set
forth in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) above shall not apply with respect to the
representations and warranties of Seller set forth in _Section 3.1_ ,
_Section 3.2_ , _Section 3.3(a)_ and _Section 3.6_ or the representations and
warranties of Buyer set forth in _Section 4.1_ , _Section 4.2_ , _Section
4.3(a)_ and _Section 4.5_.

  



  

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in
no event shall the Indemnifying Party be liable to an Indemnified Party for
any exemplary, punitive, special or consequential damages, including lost
profits or diminution of value or any loss of goodwill or possible business
after the Second Closing, except for any such damages to the extent paid to a
third party, including a Governmental Entity.

  



  

(e) With respect to any claim brought by a Buyer Indemnified Party
against Seller under this Agreement or otherwise relating to this
Agreement, Seller expressly waives any right of subrogation, contribution,
advancement, indemnification or other claim against any Acquired Company or
any Subsidiary of any Acquired Company with respect to any amounts owed by
Seller pursuant to this Agreement.

  



  

(f) Seller or Buyer, as the case may be, agrees to give prompt
notice (a " _Notice of Claim_ ") to the Indemnifying Party, in the event
indemnity is sought by a Buyer Indemnified Party or a Seller Indemnified
Party, as the case may be, under this _Section 8.2_ , of the assertion of any
claim, or the commencement of any suit, action or proceeding in respect of
which indemnity may be sought under this _Section 8.2_ (each, a " _Claim_ ")
and will provide the Indemnifying Party such information with respect thereto
in the possession of Seller or Buyer, as the case may be, that the
Indemnifying Party may reasonably request. The failure to so notify the
Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations
hereunder, unless (and solely to the extent) such failure shall have actually
materially prejudiced the Indemnifying Party's defense of such Claim.

  



  

(g) The Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in the
defense of any claim asserted by a third party (each, a " _Third Party Claim_
") and, subject to the limitations set forth in this _Section 8.2_ , shall
have fifteen (15) days after the date on which Notice of Claim is given (or
such lesser number of days set forth in the Notice of Claim as may be required
by court proceedings in the event of a litigated matter) to notify the party
giving such Notice of Claim in writing of its election to control and appoint
lead counsel for such defense, in each case at its expense.

  



  

(h) If the Indemnifying Party shall assume the control of the
defense of any Third Party Claim in accordance with the provisions of this 
_Section 8.2_ , the Indemnifying Party shall obtain the prior written consent
of Seller or Buyer, as the case may be, before entering into any settlement
of such Third Party Claim, if the settlement does not unconditionally release
the Indemnified Parties from all liabilities and obligations with respect to
such Third Party Claim, the settlement includes a statement or admission
of fault, culpability or failure to act by or on behalf of any Indemnified
Party, or the settlement imposes injunctive or other equitable relief against
any Indemnified Party, and any Indemnified Party shall be entitled to
participate in the defense of such Third Party Claim and to employ separate
counsel of its choice for such purpose. The fees and expenses of such separate
counsel shall be paid by the Indemnified Party; _provided_ that in the event
that the Indemnified Party determines in good faith that representation by
counsel to the Indemnifying Party of both such Indemnifying Party and the
Indemnified Party could reasonably be expected to present such counsel with a
conflict of interest, then the Indemnified Party may employ separate counsel
to represent or defend it in any such Action and the Indemnifying Party shall
pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel; _provided_ , _however_
, that the Indemnifying Party shall not, in connection with any proceeding or
related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and
expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (in addition to local
counsel) at any time for all Indemnified Parties. If the Indemnifying Party
does not elect to defend such Third Party Claim or does not defend such Third
Party Claim in good faith, the Indemnified Party shall have the right in
addition to any other right or remedy it may have hereunder, at the
Indemnifying Party's expense, to defend such Third Party Claim; _provided_ ,

  



  

   

35 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

 _however_ , that (i) the Indemnified Party's defense of or participation in
the defense of any such Third Party Claim shall not in any way diminish or
lessen the obligations of the Indemnifying Party under the agreements of
indemnification set forth in this _Article VIII_ , and (ii) the
Indemnified Party may not settle any such Third Party Claim without the
consent of the Indemnifying Party (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

  



  

(i) At the Indemnifying Party's expense, each party shall cooperate,
and cause their respective Affiliates to cooperate, in the defense or
prosecution of any Third Party Claim and shall furnish or cause to be
furnished such records, information and testimony, and attend such
conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals, as may be
reasonably requested in connection therewith.

  



  

(j) At the Indemnifying Party's expense, each Indemnified Party
shall use reasonable efforts to collect any amounts available under insurance
coverage, or from any other person alleged to be responsible, for any Damages
payable under this _Section 8.2_.

  



  

(k) Except for Third Party Claims being defended in good faith, an
Indemnifying Party shall satisfy its obligations under this _Article VIII_ in
respect of a claim for indemnification hereunder which is not contested by the
Indemnifying Party in good faith as promptly as practical but in any event no
later than thirty (30) days after the date on which the Notice of Claim in
respect thereof is given.

  



  

Section 8.3 _Calculation of Damages_. The amount of any Damages
payable under _Section 6.9_ and/or _Section 8.2_ by the Indemnifying
Party shall be: (i) net of any amounts actually previously recovered by the
Indemnified Party under applicable insurance policies in respect of the
Damages giving rise to the right of indemnification (net of any increase in
premiums to be paid by the Indemnified Party arising from the insurance
carrier's payment of such claim); (ii) increased by any Tax cost actually
incurred by the Indemnified Party arising from the receipt or accrual of the
indemnity payment; and (iii) decreased by any cash Tax savings
actually realized by the Indemnified Party arising in the taxable year in
which such Damages are incurred or, if later, at the time the indemnity
payment is made. If the Indemnified Party receives any amounts in respect of
the Damages giving rise to the right of indemnification under applicable
insurance policies subsequent to an indemnification payment in respect of such
Damages by the Indemnifying Party, then such Indemnified Party shall, to the
extent fully indemnified for the applicable Damages (after giving effect to
the following reimbursement obligation), promptly reimburse the Indemnifying
Party for any payment made or expense incurred by such Indemnifying Party in
connection with providing such indemnification payment up to the amount so
received by the Indemnified Party, net of any expenses incurred by such
Indemnified Party in collecting such amount (including any increase in
premiums arising from the payment by an insurance carrier of such amount).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller shall not be required to pay
Damages pursuant to this _Section 8.3_ if, and solely to the extent,
liability for such Damages is reflected in the calculation of the Final
Closing Net Working Capital.

  



  

Section 8.4 _Exclusivity_. After the Second Closing, _Section 6.9_
and this _Article VIII_ shall provide the exclusive remedy for any claim

(i) any Person or "group" other than the holder of Class B Common
Stock as of the date hereof, any of its members, and/or any of their

the Persons that "beneficially owned," directly or indirectly, securities of

outstanding securities of such Person and (y) the Persons that
"beneficially owned," directly or indirectly, equity securities of Buyer,

indirectly, immediately after giving effect to such transaction outstanding
equity securities of the continuing or surviving or transferee Person (or any

outstanding equity securities of such Person; or

  



  

(iii) a transaction, or series of related transactions, in which the
holder of Class B Common Stock as of the date hereof or any of its members,
and/or any of their Affiliates ceases to "beneficial own," directly or

of all the outstanding securities of Buyer; or

of the Board of Directors of Buyer cease for any reason (other than due to

Directors of Buyer regarding mandatory retirement age) to be Incumbent
Directors (for the purposes

  



  

   

46 
---

hereof, the term " _Incumbent Directors_ " shall mean (i) any of Nicholas S.
Schorsch, Mark Auerbach, Jeffrey J. Brown, Peter M. Budko, William M. Kahane,
C. Thomas McMillen, Michael Weil and Doug Wood and (ii) any director whose
election, or nomination for election by Buyer's stockholders, was approved by
a vote of at least a majority of the then Incumbent Directors);

  



  

provided, however, that the exercise by the Buyer of its right to repurchase
the issued and outstanding share of the Buyer Class B Stock shall
not constitute, or be deemed to give rise to, a Change in Control.

  



  

(d) " _Earn-Out Auditor_ " means an independent accounting firm of
recognized national standing selected by Buyer and reasonably acceptable to
Seller.

  



  

(e) " _Earn-Out Multiple_ " means 7.40 times (7.40x).

  



  

(f) " _Excess EBITDA_ " means the amount (expressed in U.S.
dollars), if any, by which Actual EBITDA exceeds Target EBITDA.

  



  

(g) " _Performance Period_ " means the calendar year commencing on
January 1, 2015 and ending on December 31, 2015.

  



  

(h) " _Special Earn-Out Event_ " means any of the following

(i) a Change in Control of Buyer (or entry into a definitive
agreement by Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries providing for such a Change of
Control); or

  



  

(ii) a Cole Sale.

  



  

(i) " _Special Earn-Out Payment_ " means a payment (i) in cash or
(ii) in cash and shares of Buyer Class A Stock, in lieu of the Earn-
Out Payment, determined in the same manner as the Earn-Out Payment, except
that for the portion of calendar year 2015 (if any) after the occurrence of
the Special Earn-Out Trigger Date, instead of Actual EBITDA, a projection of
such Actual EBITDA (and of each component thereof), determined as provided in
_Section 1.7(b)_ of this _Annex A_ , shall be used; _provided_ , _however_
, that in no event shall the Special Earn-Out Payment be less than $50
million.

  



  

(j) " _Target EBITDA_ " means $75.0 million.

  



  

(k) " _Test Date_ " means December 31, 2015.

  



  

Section 1.2 _Contingent Consideration_.

  



  

(a) Promptly (and in any event within two (2) Business Days)
following a Final Earn-Out Payment Statement being deemed final and binding
pursuant to _Section 1.3(e)_ of this _Annex A_ , Buyer shall pay to Seller
(by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated in
writing by Seller) an amount (not to exceed $130 million) in cash equal to
one-half (1/2) of the product of (i) Excess EBITDA, multiplied by (ii) the
Earn-Out Multiple (such amount, the " _Earn-Out Payment_ "). For
illustration purposes only, (A) if Actual EBITDA was $100 million, then the
Earn-Out Payment would be $92.5 million (representing one-half of the product
of (i) $25 million, multiplied by (ii) 7.40), and (B) if Actual EBITDA was
$200 million, then the Earn-Out Payment would be $130 million because the
Earn-Out Payment is capped at $130 million.

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, and so long as shares of Buyer
Class A Stock are listed on a national securities exchange, Buyer may, as
determined by Buyer in its sole discretion, pay to Seller the Earn-Out
Payment as follows, and such payment, if elected, shall be made promptly (and
in any event within two (2) Business Days) following the Final Earn-Out
Payment Statement referred to in _Section 1.2(a)_  of this _Annex A_ being
deemed final and binding:

  



  

   

47 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(i) an amount in cash (by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to an account designated in writing by Seller) equal to one-half (1/2)
of the Earn-Out Payment; and

  



  

(ii) in satisfaction of the other one-half (1/2) of the Earn-Out
Payment, the issuance by Buyer to Seller of such number of validly
issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of the Buyer Class A Stock
determined by dividing (x) fifty percent (50%) of the Earn-Out Payment by (y)
the intraday volume weighted average price of one share of Buyer Class A
Stock, as reported by Bloomberg, LP, over the ten (10) trading days ending on
the trading day immediately preceding the date on which the Final Earn-Out
Payment Statement is deemed final (the " _Earn-Out Buyer VWAP_ "); provided,
however, if the foregoing number of shares, together with the Buyer Shares,
is greater than a number representing nineteen and nine tenths percent (19.9%)
of the shares of Buyer Class A Stock outstanding as of such date (such
number, the " _Earn-Out Stock Threshold_ "), then the number of shares of
Buyer Class A Stock to be delivered pursuant to this _Section 1.2(b)(ii)_ of
this _Annex A_ shall be reduced to the Earn-Out Stock Threshold and, in such
event, Buyer shall pay to Seller the Earn-Out Excess Stock Amount in cash (by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated in
writing by Seller). For purposes hereof, " _Earn-Out Excess Stock Amount_ "
shall mean the number of shares of Buyer Class A Stock in excess of the Earn-
Out Stock Threshold that would have been issued under the preceding sentence
but for the proviso thereto, multiplied by the Earn-Out Buyer VWAP.

  



  

Section 1.3 _Contingent Consideration Statements_.

  



  

(a) Buyer shall engage the Earn-Out Auditor for the purposes of
determining the Earn-Out Payment. Within thirty (30) days following the
Test Date, Buyer shall prepare and deliver to Seller a written statement that
sets forth in reasonable detail its calculation of Actual EBITDA, and the
components thereof, and the Earn-Out Payment (such statement, an " _Initial
Contingent Consideration Statement_ "), along with reasonable support
documentation for such calculations.

  



  

(b) Seller shall review the Initial Contingent Consideration
Statement during the thirty (30) day period commencing on the date that
Buyer delivers such Initial Contingent Consideration Statement. Buyer shall
give Seller reasonable access to Buyer's records, personnel and the Earn-Out
Auditor for purposes of such review. In the event Seller disagrees with such
Initial Contingent Consideration Statement, Seller may, prior to the end of
such thirty (30)-day period, deliver a written notice to Buyer (a " _Notice
of Contingent Consideration Statement Disagreement_ ") setting out Seller's
objections and specifying in reasonable detail the adjustments that, in
Seller's opinion, should be made to such Initial Contingent Consideration
Statement (collectively, the " _Proposed Contingent Consideration Statement
Adjustments_ "). In the event a Notice of Contingent Consideration Statement
Disagreement is delivered in accordance with the terms of this _Annex A_ ,
Seller and Buyer shall seek in good faith to resolve within ten (10) days any
differences in relation to the Proposed Contingent Consideration Statement
Adjustments and to reach agreement in writing on whether to address, and if
so, how to address, each such Proposed Contingent Consideration
Statement Adjustment.

  



  

(c) If Seller is satisfied with the applicable Initial Contingent
Consideration Statement (either as originally submitted or after
adjustments are agreed upon by Seller and Buyer in accordance with _Section
1.3(b)_ of this _Annex A_ ) or Seller fails to deliver a Notice of Contingent
Consideration Statement Disagreement with respect to such Initial Contingent
Consideration Statement within the thirty (30) day period specified in
_Section 1.3(b)_ of this _Annex A_ ), then such Initial Contingent
Consideration Statement (incorporating, if applicable, any agreed
adjustments) shall be deemed final and constitute the applicable "
_Final Contingent Consideration Statement_ " for purposes of the Agreement.

  



  

(d) If any of the Proposed Contingent Consideration Statement
Adjustments are not resolved or otherwise agreed to (or deemed agreed to) in
accordance with _Section 1.3(b)_ or _Section 1.3(c)_ of this _Annex A_ (the "
_Unresolved Contingent Consideration Statement Adjustments_ ") within ten
(10) days after Buyer's receipt of a Notice of Contingent Consideration
Statement Disagreement, then the Unresolved Contingent Consideration
Statement Adjustments may be submitted for resolution at the request of Buyer
or Seller to the Auditor as set forth in _Section 2.1(d)_ of the Agreement,
_mutatis mutandis_ ( _provided_  that in the event that the Auditor is the
same as the Earn-Out Auditor, Buyer and Seller shall select a different
independent accounting firm of recognized national standing).

--- 

    



  

(e) When (A) pursuant to _Section 1.3(b)_ or _Section 1.3(c)_ of
this _Annex A_ , the Initial Contingent Consideration Statement is deemed to
constitute the Final Contingent Consideration Statement for purposes of the
Agreement, (B) Seller and Buyer reach agreement in writing with respect to
the Initial Contingent Consideration Statement or (C) the Initial Contingent
Consideration Statement is finally determined in accordance with the
procedures set forth in _Section 1.3(b)_ of this _Annex A_ , the Initial
Contingent Consideration Statement as so agreed (or deemed agreed) or
determined shall be the applicable " _Final Earn-Out Payment Statement_ " for
purposes of the Agreement and shall be final and binding on the parties and
shall be used for determination of the Earn-Out Payment, if any.

  



  

Section 1.4 _Certain Changes to the Business; Remedies_.

  



  

(a) In the event of any transaction, other than a Cole Sale,
resulting in the sale or other disposition or transfer of any portion of the
Business or the assets of the Acquired Companies or any of their respective
Subsidiaries to any Person other than Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries,
whether effected through a transfer of assets or equity interests, a merger, a
reorganization, a consolidation or any other transaction (for the avoidance
of doubt, not to include any transfer of personnel of the Business), Buyer and
Seller shall work in good faith to agree upon an equitable adjustment to the
manner in which Actual EBITDA (or any component thereof) shall be calculated
such that Seller shall have substantially the same ability to receive the
Earn-Out Payment that Seller had prior to such transaction. If Buyer and
Seller are unable to agree on such adjustments, they will jointly refer the
matter to a financial advisor of recognized national standing to provide such
adjustments. Seller and Buyer will use their respective reasonable best
efforts to cause such financial advisor to submit its adjustments within
thirty (30) calendar days of its engagement for these purposes. The
adjustments determined by such financial advisor shall be deemed final and
binding on the parties. The fees and expenses of such financial advisor shall
be allocated between Seller on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand in
inverse proportion as they may prevail on the matters resolved by such
financial advisor, which proportionate allocation shall be calculated on
an aggregate basis based on the relative dollar values of the amounts in
dispute and shall be determined by such financial advisor at the time the
determination of such firm is rendered on the merits of the matters submitted.

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Annex A_ or
the Agreement, (i) the sole and exclusive liability and responsibility of
Buyer and its Affiliates for any breach of _Section 1.2(b)_ of the Agreement
and the terms contained in this _Annex A_ , and the sole and exclusive remedy
of Seller with respect to any of the foregoing, shall be the payment of the
Contingent Consideration, subject to an adjustment to such Contingent
Consideration, taking into account the Actual EBITDA (and the components
thereof) that would have resulted had such breach not occurred and other
adjustments to the calculation of the Contingent Consideration to be mutually
agreed by Buyer and Seller, and (ii) upon payment of the Contingent
Consideration as so adjusted, any and all obligations of the parties under
this _Section 1.4_ shall thereafter terminate and cease to have any further
force or effect. In the event that Buyer and Seller are not able to mutually
agree to adjustments to the Contingent Consideration within ten (10) Business
Days after the party alleging such breach has given notice of alleged breach
to Buyer (in the event of a breach alleged by Seller) or to Seller (in the
event of a breach alleged by Buyer), then such adjustments shall be submitted
for resolution at the request of the party alleging such breach to the
Auditor as set forth in _Section 2.1(d)_ of the Agreement, _mutatis mutandis_
( _provided_  that in the event that the Auditor is the same as the Earn-Out
Auditor, the party alleging such breach shall select a different independent
accounting firm of recognized national standing reasonably acceptable to the
party alleged to have breached).

  



  

Section 1.5 _Tax Treatment of Contingent Consideration_. The
parties agree that for federal, state and local income tax purposes, the
Contingent Consideration shall be treated by the parties as additional
consideration for the purchase by Buyer of the Acquired Interests, and the
parties shall cause such payment to be reported in good faith in accordance
herewith.

  



  

Section 1.6 _Certain Covenants of Buyer_. From and after the
Second Closing Date through the Test Date, Buyer will (a) maintain a separate
set of accounts for the Acquired Companies and their Subsidiaries as if they
were a stand-alone company separate from the other Subsidiaries of Buyer, (b)
operate in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice and
not take any action outside the ordinary course of business the primary
purpose of which is to eliminate or reduce the Earn-Out Payment, (c) except
for a Cole Sale, not liquidate or otherwise dissolve any of the Acquired
Companies or their Subsidiaries, (d) not effect any transaction
(including any allocation of corporate expense) between Buyer or any
Affiliate thereof (other than any Acquired Company or

  



  

   

49 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

Subsidiary thereof), on the one hand, and an Acquired Company or a Subsidiary
thereof, on the other hand, on a basis less favorable in any material respect
to such Acquired Company or Subsidiary than would be the case if such
transaction had been at arms'-length with an unrelated third party.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller acknowledges and agrees that (i) the
Earn-Out Payment, if any, is speculative and not guaranteed and subject to
numerous factors outside the control of Buyer, (ii) neither Buyer nor any of
its Affiliates has promised or projected any payments under this _Annex A_ or
any amount of Actual EBITDA for any period following the Second Closing Date,
(iii) other than the express covenants and agreements contained in this _Annex
A_ , neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates (including, following the Second
Closing, the Acquired Companies) owes any duties (express or implied) to
Seller, (iv) the parties solely intend the express provisions of this _Annex
A_ and the Agreement to govern their contractual relationship, and (v)
subject to compliance with the provisions of this _Annex A_ and the Agreement,
Buyer shall have sole discretion with respect to all matters relating to the
operation of the Acquired Companies, their Subsidiaries and their
respective businesses, and shall have no obligation to operate any such
Person or business in order to achieve any Earn-Out Payment or to maximize
the amount thereof. From and after the Second Closing until December 31, 2015,
no later than thirty (30) days after the end of each calendar month, Buyer
shall prepare and deliver to Seller a written statement that sets forth in
reasonable detail its calculation of the combined earnings before interest,
tax, depreciation and amortization of the Acquired Companies, calculated in
accordance with GAAP applied on a basis consistent with Seller's accounting
principles, policies and methodologies used in connection with the
preparation of the Financial Statements, for the previous calendar month and,
beginning in January 1, 2015, for the year to date.

  



  

Section 1.7 _Special Earn-Out Events_.

  



  

(a) Buyer shall provide Seller with twenty (20) days' prior written
notice of a Special Earn-Out Event. If a Special Earn-Out Event occurs,
Seller will have the right to require, in lieu of the Contingent Consideration
payable pursuant to this _Annex A_ , a special payment in accordance with
this _Section 1.7_ of _Annex A_. Seller may exercise such right within 60 days
after obtaining actual knowledge that such Special Earn-Out Event has
occurred (the date of such occurrence, the " _Special Earn-Out Trigger Date_
") by providing written notice to Buyer of such request, which notice shall
also describe the reasons supporting the request (a " _Special Earn-Out
Notice_ ").

  



  

(b) If a Special Earn-Out Event occurs and Seller delivers a Special
Earn-Out Notice in accordance with this _Section 1.7_ , the
following provisions shall apply:

  



  

(1) Upon receipt of a Special Earn-Out Notice, each of Seller and
Buyer shall engage a financial advisor of recognized national standing to
prepare a calculation of the Special Earn-Out Payment, which will incorporate
such financial advisor's good faith projection of Actual EBITDA from the
Special Earn-Out Trigger Date through the end of the Performance Period. Each
party's financial advisor shall submit its calculation of the Special Earn-
Out Payment within 20 Business Days of receipt by Buyer of the Special Earn-
Out Notice, along with reasonable supporting documentation for such
calculations (each, a " _Special Earn-Out Statement_ "). Buyer shall give
each financial advisor reasonable access to its records, personnel and
independent accountants for purposes of the financial advisors' calculations
of the Special Earn-Out Payment.

  



  

(2) If the higher calculation of the Special Earn-Out Payment
contained in the two Special Earn-Out Statements is not more than 110% of the
calculation of the Special Earn-Out Payment contained in the other Special
Earn-Out Statement (such calculations collectively, the " _Special Earn-Out
Payment Calculations_ " and each individually a " _Special Earn-Out Payment
Calculation_ "), then the calculation of the Special Earn-Out Payment will be
calculated based on an average of the two Special Earn-Out
Payment Calculations.

  



  

(3) If the higher calculation of the Special Earn-Out Payment
Calculations is more than 110% of the lower Special Earn-Out Payment
Calculation, then Buyer's and Seller's financial advisors shall select and
engage on behalf of Buyer and Seller a third financial advisor of recognized
national standing, within ten (10) Business Days after the submission of the
Special Earn-Out Statements pursuant to _Section 1.7(b)(1)_. The third

its decision as to which of the two Special Earn-Out Payment Calculations is
more accurate within thirty (30) days of the engagement of such third

access to its records, personnel and independent accountants for purposes of
the financial advisor's calculations of the Special Earn-Out Payment.

  



  

(4) Buyer and Seller agree that, upon the determination of the
average of the Special Earn-Out Payment Calculations pursuant to
_Section 1.7(b)(2)_ , or upon the rendering of the decision of the third
financial advisor pursuant to Section 1.7(b)(3), as applicable, Buyer and
Seller shall be bound to such average or such decision which shall be deemed
final and binding on the parties to the Agreement (such average or such
Special Earn-Out Payment Calculation decided as the more accurate by the third
financial advisor, the " _Final Special Earn-Out Payment_ "). The Final
Special Earn-Out Payment shall be paid by Buyer to Seller (by wire transfer
of immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by Seller)
promptly after the determination of the Final Special Earn-Out Payment in
accordance with this _Section 1.7(b)(4)_.

  



  

The fees and expenses of the third financial advisor shall be allocated
between Seller on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand in inverse
proportion as they may prevail on the matters resolved by such financial
advisor, which proportionate allocation shall be calculated on an aggregate
basis based on the relative dollar values of the amounts in dispute and shall
be determined by such financial advisor at the time the determination of
such firm is rendered on the merits of the matters submitted.

quarterly in arrears to the Persons who are registered Holders of the
Notes at close of business on Record Date immediately preceding the
applicable Interest Payment Date.

  



  

4.3 _Default Interest_. During the continuance of an Event of
Default, the Issuer shall pay to the Holder interest at the Default Rate
on the outstanding principal amount of the Notes and on any other amount
payable by the Issuer hereunder (including accrued but unpaid interest to the
extent permitted under applicable Law). Interest payable at the Default Rate
shall be payable upon demand and in cash.

  



  

4.4 _Computation of Interest_. All computations of interest shall
be made on the basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 days in the case of a
leap year), and the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day
but excluding the last day).

  



  

4.5 _Interest Rate Limitation_. If at any time and for any reason
whatsoever, the interest rate payable on the Notes shall exceed the
maximum rate of interest permitted to be charged under applicable Law, such
interest rate shall be reduced automatically to the maximum rate of interest
permitted to be charged under applicable Law and that portion of each sum paid
attributable to that portion of such interest rate that exceeds the maximum
rate of interest permitted by applicable Law shall be deemed a voluntary
prepayment of principal.

  



  

5. _Note Register; Payment Mechanics_.

  



  

5.1 _Note Register_.

  



  

(a) The Issuer shall cause to be kept at its principal office a register
for the registration and transfer of each of the Notes (the "Note Register").
The names and addresses of the Holders of Notes, the transfer of Notes, and
the names and addresses of the transferees of the Notes shall be registered
in the Note Register.

  



  

(b) The Person in whose name any registered Note shall be registered
shall be deemed and treated as the owner and holder thereof for all purposes
of this Note, and the Issuer shall not be affected by any notice to the
contrary, until due presentment of such Note for registration of

  



  



  

  

6 Insert date of the First Closing Date as defined in the Equity Purchase
Agreement.

  



  

   

10 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

transfer so provided in this Section 5.1. Payment of or on account of the
principal, and interest on any registered Notes shall be made to or upon the
written order of such registered holder.

  



  

(c) When Notes are presented to the Issuer with a request to register the
transfer of such Notes or to exchange such Notes for an equal principal
amount of Notes of other authorized denominations, the Issuer shall register
the transfer or make the exchange as requested if requirements set for under
Section 5.6 herein, are met.

  



  

(d) The Person in whose name any Note is registered on the Note Register
at the close of business on any Record Date with respect to any Interest
Payment Date shall be entitled to receive the interest payable on such
Interest Payment Date. Interest shall be payable at the office or agency of
the Issuer maintained by the Issuer for such purposes. The Notes will be
payable both as to principal and interest by Federal funds wire transfer of
lawful money of the United States to each Holder's account in any bank in the
United States as may be designated and specified in writing by such Holder at
least two Business Days prior thereto.

  



  

5.2 _Delivery Expenses_. If a Holder surrenders any Note to the
Issuer for any reason, the Issuer agrees to pay the cost of delivering
to such Holder's home office or to the office of such Holder's designee from
the Issuer, the Note(s) issued in substitution, replacement or exchange for,
the surrendered Note.

  



  

5.3 _Direct Payment_.

  



  

(a) The Issuer will pay or cause to be paid all amounts payable with
respect to any Note (without any presentment of such Note and without any
notation of such payment being made thereon) by crediting (before 1:00 p.m.,
New York time), by intra-bank or Federal funds bank wire transfer in same day
funds in U.S. Dollars to each Holder's account in any bank in the United
States as may be designated and specified in writing by such Holder at least
two Business Days prior thereto.

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Notes, if
any principal amount payable with respect to a Note is payable, at
maturity, upon redemption, or otherwise, on a day which is not a Business
Day, then the Issuer shall pay such amount on the next succeeding Business
Day, and interest shall accrue on such amount until the date on which such
amount is paid and payment of such accrued interest shall be made
concurrently with the payment of such amount; provided that the Issuer may
elect to pay in full (but not in part) any such amount on the last Business
Day prior to the date such payment otherwise would be due, and no such
additional interest shall accrue on such amount. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in the Notes, if any interest payable with respect to
a Note is payable on a day which is not a Business Day, then the Issuer may
elect to pay in full (but not in part) any such interest on the last Business
Day prior to the date such payment otherwise would be due, and such diminution
in time shall be included in the computation of the interest payment.

  



  

   

11 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

5.4 _Lost, etc. Notes_. If a mutilated Note is surrendered to the
Issuer or if the Holder of a Note claims and submits an affidavit or other
evidence, reasonably satisfactory to the Issuer to the effect that the Note
has been lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken, the Issuer shall issue a
replacement Note if the customary requirements relating to replacement
securities are reasonably satisfied. If required by the Issuer, such Holder
must provide an indemnity bond, or other form of indemnity, sufficient in the
reasonable judgment of the Issuer to protect the Issuer from any loss which
it may suffer if a Note is replaced. The affidavit of such Holder at the time
of loss, setting forth the fact of loss, theft or destruction and of its
ownership of the Note at the time of such loss, theft or destruction shall be
accepted as satisfactory evidence thereof, and no further indemnity shall be
required as a condition to the execution and delivery of a new Note other
than the unsecured written agreement of such Holder reasonably
satisfactory to the Issuer to indemnify the Issuer or, at the option of the
Issuer, an indemnity bond in the amount of the Note remaining
outstanding. Every replacement Note is an obligation of the Issuer.

  



  

5.5 _Other Covenants_. The Issuer further covenants and agrees not
to, and to ensure that no affiliate (as defined in Rule 501(b) of
the Securities Act) of the Issuer will, sell, offer for sale or solicit
offers to buy or otherwise negotiate in respect of any security (as defined
in the Securities Act) that would be integrated with the issuance of the Notes
in a manner that would require the registration under the Securities Act of
the issuance of the Note under the Equity Purchase Agreement.

  



  

5.6 _Transfer Restrictions_. No transfer or sale (including,
without limitation, by pledge or hypothecation) of Notes by any Holder
which is otherwise permitted hereunder, other than a transfer or sale to the
Issuer, shall be effective unless such transfer or sale is made (i) pursuant
to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act and a valid
qualification under applicable state securities or "blue sky" laws or (ii)
without such registration or qualification as a result of the availability of
an exemption therefrom, and if reasonably requested by the Issuer, counsel for
such transferee (who may be in-house) shall have furnished the Issuer with an
opinion, reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to the Issuer, to the
effect that no such registration is required because of the availability of
an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that with respect to transfers by Holders to their
Affiliates, no such opinion shall be required. For the avoidance of doubt,
all transfers or sales of Notes shall be subject to Section 10.15.

  



  

5.7 _Replacements Notes_. All Notes issued by the Issuer shall be
in form and substance identical to this Note other than the principal
amount and the Holder thereof and otherwise to the extent set forth in
Section 10.9(d). Any Note

  



  

   

12 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

issued by the Issuer in connection with one or more assignments or
redemptions of this Note as permitted hereunder will be in the principal
amount of One Thousand Dollars ($1,000) (except in the case of any redemption
following which the aggregate principal amount remaining is less than
$1,000) or integral multiplies of One Thousand Dollars ($1,000) or excess
thereof.

  



  

6. _Affirmative Covenants_. So long as any of the Notes remain unpaid and outstanding, the Issuer covenants to the Holders of the outstanding Notes as follows:

  



  

(a) Do or cause to be done all things necessary to preserve and keep in
full force and effect its corporate existence; and

  



  

(b) Provide prompt notice of the occurrence of, after the Issuer becomes
aware of any such event, any Default or Event of Default hereunder.

  



  

7. _Events of Default_. The occurrence and continuance of any of the following shall constitute an "Event of Default" hereunder:

  



  

(a) default in any payment of interest on this Note or any other amount
(other than principal) payable hereunder when due and payable, and the
default continues for a period of five (5) days;

  



  

(b) default in the payment of principal of this Note when due and payable
on the Maturity Date, upon any required redemption, upon declaration of
acceleration or otherwise;

  



  

(c) failure by the Issuer to issue a Mandatory Change of Control Offer in
accordance with Section 3.3, and such failure is not cured within five (5)
days after the due date for such notice;

  



  

(d) failure by any Permitted Issuer Transferee to comply with the
covenants set forth in Sections 5 and 6 of the Assumption Agreement (as
defined below);

  



  

(e) failure by the Issuer to comply with any of its other covenants or
agreements contained in the Note and such failure shall continue for thirty
(30) days from receipt by the Issuer of written notice thereof from the
Holder;

  



  

(f) default by the Issuer with respect to any mortgage, agreement or
other instrument under which there may be outstanding, or by which there may
be secured or evidenced, any indebtedness for money borrowed in excess of
Twenty-Eight Million Seven Hundred and Fifty Thousand Dollars ($28,750,000)
(or its foreign currency equivalent) in the aggregate of the Issuer whether
such indebtedness now exists or shall hereafter be created (i) resulting in
such indebtedness becoming or being declared due and payable or (ii)
constituting a failure to pay the principal or interest of any such debt when
due and payable at its stated maturity, upon required repurchase, upon
declaration of acceleration or otherwise;

  



  

   

13 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(g) a final judgment for payment of Twenty-Eight Million Seven Hundred
and Fifty Thousand Dollars ($28,750,000) (or its foreign currency equivalent)
or more (excluding any amounts covered by insurance) rendered against the
Issuer, which judgment is not discharged or stayed within sixty (60) days
after (i) the date on which the right to appeal thereof has expired if no such
appeal has commenced or (ii) the date on which all rights to appeal have
extinguished;

  



  

(h) the Issuer shall commence a voluntary case or other proceeding
seeking liquidation, reorganization or other relief with respect to the
Issuer or its debts under bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar Law now or
hereafter in effect or seeking the appointment of trustee, receiver,
liquidator, custodian or other similar official of the Issuer or any
substantial part of its property, or shall consent to any such relief or to
the appointment of or taking possession by any such official in an involuntary
case or other proceeding commenced against it, or shall make a general
assignment for the benefit of creditors, or shall fail generally to pay its
debts as they become due; or

  



  

(i) an involuntary case or other proceeding shall be commenced against
the Issuer seeking liquidation, reorganization or other relief with respect
to the Issuer or debts under any bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar Law
now or hereafter in effect or seeking the appointment of trustee, receiver,
liquidator, custodian or other similar official of the Issuer or any
substantial part of its property, and such involuntary care or other
proceeding shall remain undismissed and unstayed for a period of ninety (90)
consecutive days.

  



  

8. _Remedies._

  



  

8.1 _Acceleration of Notes_.

  



  

(a) Subject to Section 8.1(c), if an Event of Default (other than an
Event of Default specified in clause (g) or (h) of Section 7 occurs and is
continuing), the Majority Holders, by notice to the Issuer (a copy of which
shall be provided to each other Holder;  _provided_ that such copy shall not
constitute a notice for the purpose thereof), may declare the unpaid principal
of and any accrued interest on all the Notes to be due and payable, and
immediately upon such declaration, the principal and interest shall be due
and payable. If an Event of Default specified in clause (g) or (h) of Section
7 occurs, such an amount shall  _ipso facto_ become and be immediately due
and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of any Holder.

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding Section 8.1(a), but subject to Section 8.1(c), if an
Event of Default specified in clauses (a) or (b) of Section 7 occurs and is
continuing, any Holder, by notice to the Issuer (a copy of which shall be
provided to each other Holder; _provided_  that such copy shall not
constitute a notice for the purpose thereof), may declare the unpaid principal
of and any accrued interest on all the Notes it holds to be due and payable,
and immediately upon such declaration, the principal and interest shall be
due and payable.

  



  

(c) The Holder by notice to the Issuer (a copy of which shall be provided
to each other Holder; _provided_ that such copy shall not constitute a notice
for the purpose thereof) may rescind

  



  

   

14 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

an acceleration and its consequences if the rescission would not
conflict with any judgment or decree and if all existing Events of Default
have been cured or waived except nonpayment of principal or interest that
have become due solely because of the acceleration.

  



  

8.2 _Other Remedies_.

  



  

(a) If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Majority Holders
or, if a Payment Default occurs and is continuing, any Holder, may pursue any
rights and remedies available under the Notes and the applicable law to
collect the payment of principal or interest on the Notes or to enforce the
performance of any provision of the Notes.

  



  

(b) A delay or omission by any Holder of any Notes in exercising any
right or remedy accruing upon an Event of Default shall not impair the right
or remedy or constitute a waiver of or acquiescence in the Event of Default.
All remedies are cumulative to the extent permitted by law.

  



  

8.3 _Waiver of Past Defaults_. The Majority Holders by notice to
the Issuer (a copy of which shall be provided to each other Holder; _provided_
 that such copy shall not constitute a notice for the purpose thereof) may
waive an existing Default or Event of Default under the Notes and its
consequences except a continuing Payment Default.

  



  

8.4 _Rights of Holders to Receive Payment_. Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Note, the right of any Holder of a Note to
receive payment of principal and interest on the Note, on or after the
respective due dates expressed in the Note, or to bring suit for the
enforcement of any such payment on or after such respective dates, shall not
be impaired or affected without the consent of such Holder.

  



  

9. _Taxes; Tax Assurances_.

  



  

(a) The Issuer shall make all payments, whether on account of principal,
interest or otherwise, free of and without deduction or withholding for any
present or future taxes, duties or other charges ("Taxes"), unless otherwise
required by Law.

  



  

(b) The Issuer and each Holder acknowledges that it is intended that the
Notes not be readily tradable on an "established securities market" and each
of Holder and the Issuer agrees that he or it will not take any action that
would result in a Note being traded on an established securities market. Any
transfer of a Note on an established securities market shall be null and
void. As used herein, "established securities market" means (i) a national
securities exchange which is registered under Section 6 of the Exchange Act
(15 U.S.C. 78f), (ii) an exchange which is exempted from registration under
Section 5 of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78e) because of its limited volume
of transactions, and (iii) any over-the-counter market (within the meaning
of Treasury Regulations Section 1.453-3(d)(4)).

(c) Until January 31, 2017, the Issuer shall not redeem the Notes held by
the Initial Holder or any of its Affiliates and the Initial Holder shall not
transfer all or any portion of its Note(s) in any tax year to the extent the
Gross Income that would be recognized by the Initial Holder from such
redemption or transfer if included in the Nonqualifying Income (as defined in
the Equity Purchase Agreement) for such tax year, would cause the total Gross
Income to be recognized by the Initial Holder in such tax year to exceed the
Nonqualifying Income Limitation (as defined in the Equity Purchase Agreement)
in accordance with Section 1.2(f) of the Equity Purchase Agreement. The
Initial Holder shall notify the Issuer (the "Limitation Notice") within five
(5) Business Days after a Redemption Notice if redemption of the Notes would
not be permitted. From and after the date of any Limitation Notice until the
earlier of January 31, 2017 or the date on which the Initial Holder notifies
the Issuer in writing that that Issuer may again effect a redemption, any
Note held by the Initial Holder or any of its Affiliates shall bear interest
at a rate of one percent (1%) per annum. Nothing in this Section 9(c) shall
affect the Issuer's right to redeem, or the interest payable on, Notes held
by any other Holders.

10.2 _Successors and Assigns_. This Note shall inure to the benefit
of and be binding upon the successors and permitted assigns of each of
the parties. The Issuer's rights or obligations hereunder or any interest
herein may not be assigned or delegated by the Issuer to any Person without
the prior written consent of each Holder (and any attempted assignment or
transfer by the Issuer without such consent shall be null and void),
_provided_ that the Issuer may assign all (but not part) or its rights and
obligations under this Note (for the avoidance of doubt any such transfer
shall be with respect to all of the Notes then outstanding) to a Permitted
Issuer Transferee (whether or not an Affiliate of the Issuer and whether or
not in connection with a spinoff, corporate reorganization or otherwise) so
long as (a) the Issuer shall provide not less than thirty (30) days

  



  

   

17 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

prior written notice of such proposed assignment to each Holder, together
with such Permitted Issuer Transferee's most recent audited (or in the
case of a Permitted Issuer Transferee that is an Affiliate of the Issuer and
for which an audit has not been conducted, unaudited) annual and unaudited
quarterly financial statements (each in accordance with GAAP), (b) each Holder
shall have received all other information and documentation (including,
without limitation, certificates of good standing, organizational documents
and legal opinions) pertaining to such Permitted Issuer Transferee and the
proposed assignment, as reasonably requested by each Holder, (c) such
Permitted Issuer Transferee shall execute and deliver an assumption agreement
with respect to this Note in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B (the
"Assumption Agreement"), pursuant to which it shall agree to be bound by all
of the terms hereof as the Issuer, and (d) both as of the date of such
assignment and immediately after giving effect thereto (for the avoidance of
doubt, pertaining to Permitted Issuer Transferee whether or not an Affiliate
of the Issuer), each of the representations and warranties contained in the
Assumption Agreement shall be true and correct in all material respects; (e)
whether or not an Affiliate of the Issuer, no Default or Event of Default
shall have occurred and be continuing, and (f) such proposed assignment shall
not be for the purpose of avoiding a Change of Control. Upon any such
assignment by the Issuer, the Issuer shall have no further obligations under
this Note.

  



  

10.3 _GOVERNING LAW; SUBMISSION TO JURISDICTION_. The Notes shall be
governed by and constructed in accordance with the internal laws of the state
of New York including, without limitation, Sections 5-1401 and 5-1402 of the
New York General Obligations Law and Rule 327(b) of the New York Civil
Practice Laws and Rules. The Issuer and each of the Holders hereby
irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of any New York State Court sitting in
the borough of Manhattan in the city of New York or any Federal Court Sitting
in the borough of Manhattan in the City of New York in respect of any suit,
action or proceeding arising out of or relating to the Notes, and irrevocably
accept for itself and in respect of its property, generally and
unconditionally, jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts. The Issuer, and each
of the Holders irrevocably waive, to the fullest extent they may
effectively do so under applicable law, any objection which they may now or
hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such suit, action or
proceeding brought in any such court and any such claim that any such suit,
action or proceeding brought

  



  

   

18 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

in any such court has been brought in any inconvenient forum. Nothing herein
shall affect the right of any holder of a note to serve process in any other
manner permitted by law or to commence legal proceedings or otherwise proceed
against the Issuer in any other jurisdiction.

  



  

10.4 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. The Issuer and each Holder waives, TO
THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A
TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT
OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE NOTES.

  



  

10.5 _Independence of Covenants_. All covenants hereunder shall be
given in any jurisdiction independent effect so that if a particular
action or condition is not permitted by any of such covenants, the fact that
it would be permitted by an exception to, or be otherwise within the
limitations of, another covenant shall not avoid the occurrence of a Default
or an Event of Default if such action is taken or condition exists.

  



  

10.6 _Notes Solely Corporate Obligations_. No recourse for the
payment of the principal of or accrued and unpaid interest on any Note,
nor for any claim based thereon or otherwise in respect thereof, and no
recourse under or upon any obligation, covenant or agreement of the Issuer
under any Note shall be had against any stockholder, employee, agent, officer,
member of the Board of Directors or subsidiary, as such, past, present or
future, of the Issuer or of any successor corporation, either directly or
through the Issuer or any successor corporation whether by virtue of any
constitution, statue or rule of law, or by the enforcement of any
assessment or penalty or otherwise; it being expressly understood that all
such liability is hereby expressly waived and released as a condition of, and
as a consideration for, the issue of the Notes.

  



  

10.7 _Revival and Reinstatement of Obligations_. If the Holder
repays, refunds, restores, or returns in whole or in part, any payment or
property previously paid or transferred to the Holder in full or partial
satisfaction of any obligation evidenced by a Note, because the payment,
transfer, or the incurrence of the obligation so satisfied is asserted or
declared to be void, voidable, or otherwise recoverable under any Law
relating to creditors' rights, including provisions of the Bankruptcy Code
relating to fraudulent transfers, preferences, or other voidable or
recoverable obligations or transfers (each, a "Voidable Transfer"), or
because the Holder elects to do so on the reasonable advice of its counsel in
connection with a claim that the payment, transfer, or incurrence is or may
be a Voidable Transfer, then, as to any such Voidable Transfer, or the amount
thereof that the Holder elects to repay, restore, or return (including
pursuant to a settlement of any claim in respect thereof), and as to all
reasonable costs, expenses, and attorneys' fees of the Holder related
thereto, the liability of

  



  

   

19 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

the Issuer with respect to the amount or property paid, refunded, restored,
or returned will automatically and immediately be revived, reinstated, and
restored and will exist.

  



  

10.8 _Waiver of Notice_. The Issuer hereby waives demand for
payment, presentment for payment, protest, notice of payment, notice of
dishonor, notice of nonpayment, notice of acceleration of maturity and
diligence in taking any action to collect sums owing hereunder.

  



  

10.9 _Amendments and Waivers_.

  



  

(a) _With Consent of Holders_. The Issuer, with the written consent of
the Majority Holders (a copy of which shall be provided to each other
Holder), may amend the Notes, provided that each Holder shall have received
prior notice and a draft of such proposed amendment. The Majority Holders may
waive compliance by the Issuer with any provision of the Notes by a written
consent (a copy of which shall be provided to each Holder), provided that
each Holder shall have received prior notice and a draft of such proposed
waiver. Without the consent of each Holder affected, however, no amendment
may (with respect to any Notes held by a nonconsenting Holder of Notes):

  



   | (i)| reduce the principal amount of Notes;  
---|---|--- 
  



   | (ii)| reduce the principal of or change the fixed maturity of any
Note, or alter the provisions with respect to the redemption of the Notes;  
---|---|--- 
  



   | (iii)| reduce the rate of interest on any Note;  
---|---|--- 
  



   | (iv)| make any change in the provisions of this Note relating to
waivers of past Defaults or the rights of Holders of Notes to receive payments
of principal of, or interest on the Notes;  
---|---|--- 
  



   | (v)| make any change to the definition of "Majority Holders"; or  
---|---|--- 
  



   | (vi)| make any change in the foregoing amendment provisions.  
---|---|--- 
  



  

(b) It shall not be necessary for the consent of the Holders under
Section 10.9(a) to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment or
waiver, but it shall be sufficient if such consent approves the substance
thereof. After an amendment or waiver under Section 10.9(a) becomes
effective, the Issuer shall mail to all other Holders a notice briefly
describing the amendment or waiver and a copy of the fully executed amendment
or waiver. Any failure of the Issuer to mail such notice and copy, or
any defect therein, shall not, however, in any way impair or affect the
validity of any such amendment or waiver.

  



  

(c) In connection with any amendment under Section 10.9(a), the Issuer
may offer, but shall not be obligated to offer, to any Holder who consents to
such amendment or waiver, consideration for such Holder's consent.

(d) _Revocation and Effectiveness of Consents_. Until an amendment or
waiver becomes effective, a consent to it by a Holder is a continuing consent
by the Holder and every subsequent Holder of a Note or portion of a Note that
evidence that same debt as the consenting Holder's Note, even if notation of
the consent is not made on any Note. However, any such Holder or subsequent
Holder may revoke the consent as to his Note or portion of his Note by notice
to the Issuer received before the date on which the Majority Holders have
consented (and not theretofore revoked such consent) to the amendment or
waiver.

  



  

The Issuer may, but shall not be obligated to, fix a record date for the
purpose of determining the Holders entitled to consent to any amendment or
waiver, which record date shall be at least 30 days prior to the first
solicitation of such consent. If a record date is fixed, then notwithstanding
the last sentence of the immediately preceding paragraph, those Persons who
were Holders at such record date (or their duly designated proxies), and only
those Persons, shall be entitled to revoke any consent previously given,
whether or not such Persons continue to be Holders after such record date. No
such consent shall be valid or effective for more than 90 days after such
record date.

  



  

After an amendment or waiver becomes effective, it shall bind every Holder,
unless it makes a change described in any of the clauses (i) though (vi) of
Section 10.9(a), in which case, the amendment or waiver shall bind only each
Holder of a Note who consented to it and every subsequent Holder of a Note or
portion of a Note that evidences the same debt as the consenting
Holder's Note; provided that any such waiver shall not impair or affect the
right of any Holder to receive payment of principal of, premium (if any) and
interest on a Note, on or after the respective due dates expressed in such
Note, or to bring suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after
such respective dates.

  



  

In determining whether the Holders of the required principal amount of Notes
have concurred in any direction, waiver, consent or amendment, Notes owned by
the Issuer or any Affiliate of the Issuer shall be considered as though not
outstanding.

  



  

(e) _Notation on or Exchange of Notes_. If an amendment or waiver
changes the terms of a Note, the Issuer may require the Holder of the Note to
deliver it to the Issuer so that it may place an appropriate notation on the
Note about the changed terms and return it to the Holder.

  



  

10.10   _Headings_. The headings of the various Sections and
subsections herein are for reference only and shall not define,
modify, expand or limit any of the terms or provisions hereof.

  



  

10.11   _No Waiver; Cumulative Remedies_. No failure to exercise and
no delay in exercising on the part of the Holder, of any right, remedy, power
or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single
or partial exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder
preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other
right, remedy, power or privilege. The rights, remedies, powers and
privileges herein provided are

  



  

   

21 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

cumulative and not exclusive of any rights, remedies, powers and privileges
provided by Law.

  



  

10.12   _Electronic Execution_. The words "execution", "signed",
"signature", and words of similar import in the Notes shall be deemed to
include electronic or digital signatures or the keeping of records in
electronic form, each of which shall be of the same effect, validity and
enforceability as manually executed signatures or a paper-based
recordkeeping system, as the case may be, to the extent and as provided for
under applicable Law, including the Electronic Signatures in Global and
National Commerce Act of 2000 (15 USC § 7001 _et seq_.), the Electronic
Signatures and Records Act of 1999 (N.Y. State Tech. Law §§ 301-309), or any
other similar state Laws based on the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act.

  



  

10.13   _Severability_. If any term or provision of the Note is
invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, such
invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other term or
provision of the Notes or invalidate or render unenforceable such term or
provision in any other jurisdiction.

  



  

10.14   _Expenses_. The Issuer agrees to pay all reasonable out-of-
pocket expenses incurred by the Holder in connection with the
administration of this Note or in connection with any amendments,
modifications or waivers of the provisions hereof or thereof or incurred
by the Holder in connection with the enforcement or protection of its rights
under this Note, including in connection with any refinancing or
restructuring of the credit arrangements provided under this Note in the
nature of a "work-out" or pursuant to any insolvency or bankruptcy
proceedings the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of one New York
counsel (and counsel in each other relevant local jurisdiction) for the
Holder. The agreements in this Section 10.14 shall survive repayment of all
of the indebtedness evidenced by this Note. All amounts due under this Section
10.14 shall be paid promptly following receipt by the Issuer of an invoice
relating thereto setting forth such expenses in reasonable detail.

  



  

10.15 _ Right of First Offer_.

  



  

(a) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, and subject to the
terms and conditions specified in this Section 10.15, unless any Event of
Default occurs and is continuing at the time of such Transfer, the Issuer
shall have a right of first offer with respect to any sale, assignment,
exchange or other transfer, whether involuntarily or voluntarily (each, a
"Transfer"), of all or any part of this Note by the Initial Holder or any of
its Affiliates (the Initial Holder and any such Affiliate, each a
"Transferor") other than to a Permitted Transferee.

  



  

(b) If a Transferor proposes to Transfer this Note, the Transferor shall
first make an offer of this Note to the Issuer in accordance with the
following provisions:

  



  

   

22 
--- 

 


--- 

    



   | (i)| The Transferor shall deliver a notice (the "RFO Notice") to the
Issuer stating (i) the Transferor's bona fide intention to Transfer this Note
and (ii) the price and terms upon which it proposes to Transfer this Note.  
---|---|--- 
  



   | (ii)| Within thirty (30) calendar days after delivery of the RFO
Notice, the Issuer may elect, upon written notice to the Transferor, to
purchase, at the price and on the terms specified in the RFO Notice, this
Note. If the Issuer elects to purchase this Note, such purchase shall be
completed promptly following such notice from the Issuer to the Transferor.  
---|---|--- 
  



   | (iii)| If the Issuer does not notify the Transferor of its election
to purchase this Note in accordance with Section 10.15(b)(ii), the
Transferor may, during the ninety (90) day period following the expiration of
the thirty (30)-day period provided in Section 10.15(b)(ii) hereof, Transfer
this Note to any person or persons at a price not less than, and upon terms no
more favorable to the offeree than, those specified in the RFO Notice. If the
Transferor does not Transfer this Note within such period, the right
provided hereunder shall be deemed to be revived and this Note shall not be
Transferred unless first reoffered to the Issuer in accordance with this
Section 10.15.  
---|---|--- 
  



  

10.16   _Effectiveness of Note_. This Note shall become effective at and as
of the Second Closing Date (as defined in the Equity Purchase Agreement).

ASSUMPTION AGREEMENT

  

(UNSECURED PROMISSORY NOTE DUE [DECEMBER 16, 201])

  



  

[•] [•], 20__

  



  

Reference is made to the Unsecured Promissory Note Due [December 16, 2021],
dated as of [•], 2014 (as amended, restated, amended and restated,
supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the "Note") issued by
RCS Capital Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Initial Issuer") in
favor of ARC Properties Operating Partnership, L.P., a Delaware limited
partnership and its registered assigns (the "Holder"). Capitalized terms used
but not defined herein shall have the meanings given to them in the Note.

  



  

WITNESSETH:

  



  

WHEREAS, the Initial Issuer wishes to assign its rights and obligations under
the Note to [•], [•] (the "New Issuer") and the New Issuer agrees to such
assignment on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein.

  



  

WHEREAS, pursuant to Section 10.2(d) of the Note, each New Issuer is required
to become the Issuer under the Note by executing this assumption agreement
(the "Assumption Agreement").

  



  

NOW, THEREFORE, the Initial Issuer and the New Issuer hereby agree as
follows:

  



  

1. Assignment and Assumptions. For an agreed consideration, the Initial Issuer hereby irrevocably sells and assigns to the New Issuer, and the New Issuer hereby irrevocably purchases and assumes from the Assignor, subject to and in accordance with the terms of this Assumption Agreement and the Note, as of the Effective Date (as defined below) all of the Initial Issuer's rights and obligations in its capacity as the Issuer under the Note and any other documents or instruments delivered pursuant thereto to the extent related to the Note. The New Issuer hereby agrees to all the terms and provisions of the Note applicable to it as the Issuer thereunder. Each reference to the Issuer in the Credit Agreement shall be deemed to refer to the New Issuer.

  



  

2. _Joinder_. The New Issuer by its signature below becomes the Issuer under the Note with the same force and effect as if originally named therein as the Issuer. As of the Effective Date the Initial Issuer shall not have any rights, and shall be released from its obligations, under the Note in a capacity as the Issuer.

  



  

3. _Effective Date_. __ This Assumption Agreement shall become effective on the date (the "Effective Date") when it shall be duly executed and delivered by each party thereto. Upon its effectiveness, this Assumption Agreement shall constitute a part of the Note and all references to the Note therein shall be deemed references to the Note as supplemented by this Assumption Agreement.

  



  

4. _Representations and Warranties_. The New Issuer hereby represents and warrants as of the Effective Date as follows:

  



  

   

1 
--- 

 


--- 

    



   | a)| _Organization and Qualification_. The New Issuer is duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
jurisdiction of its organization. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | b)| _Power and Authority_. The New Issuer is duly authorized to
execute, deliver and perform the Assumption Agreement and, by virtue of this
Assumption Agreement, the Note. The execution, delivery and performance of
this Assumption Agreement and, by virtue of this Assumption Agreement, the
Note have been duly authorized by all necessary action, and do not (i) require
any consent or approval of any equity holders of the New Issuer, other than
those already obtained; (ii) contravene the organizational documents of the
New Issuer; (iii) violate or cause a default under any law, rule or regulation
or any decree, order or judgment applicable to it (the "Applicable Law") or
material contract to which it is a party; or (iv) result in or require the
imposition of any Lien on any of its property. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | c)| _Enforceability_. Each of this Assumption Agreement and the Note
is a legal, valid and binding obligation of the New Issuer, enforceable in
accordance with its terms, except as enforceability may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency or similar laws affecting the enforcement of
creditors\' rights generally. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | d)| _Title to Properties; Priority of Liens_. The New Issuer has good
and marketable title to (or valid leasehold interests in) all of its real
estate, and good title to all of its personal property. The New Issuer has
paid and discharged all lawful claims that, if unpaid, could become a Lien on
its properties. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | e)| _Financial Statements; Solvency_. The consolidated balance
sheets, and related statements of income, cash flow and
shareholder\'s equity, of the New Issuer and its Subsidiaries that have been
and are hereafter delivered to the Holder, are prepared in accordance with
GAAP, and fairly present the financial positions and results of operations of
the New Issuer and its Subsidiaries at the dates and for the periods
indicated. Since the latest balance sheet date set forth in such financial
statements, there has been no material adverse change in the condition,
financial or otherwise, of the New Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole. No financial statement delivered to the Holder at any time contains
any untrue statement of a material fact, nor fails to disclose any
material fact necessary to make such statement not materially misleading. The
New Issuer is solvent. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | f)| _Taxes_. The New Issuer has filed all federal, state and local
tax returns and other reports that it is required by law to file, and has
paid, or made provision for the payment of, all Taxes upon it, its income and
its properties that are due and payable, except to the extent being properly
contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings promptly instituted and
diligently pursued and appropriate reserves have been established
in accordance with GAAP. The provision for Taxes on the books of the New
Issuer is adequate for all years not closed by applicable statutes, and for
its current fiscal year.  
---|---|--- 
  



   | g)| _Governmental Approvals_. The New Issuer has, is in compliance
with, and is in good standing with respect to, all approvals by the
applicable Governmental Authorities necessary to conduct its business and to
own, lease and operate its properties. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | h)| _Compliance with Laws_. The New Issuer has duly complied, and its
properties and 
---|---|--- 
  



  

   


--- 

 


--- 

    



    | | business operations are in compliance, in all material respects
with all Applicable Law. There have been no citations, notices or orders of
material noncompliance issued to the Issuer under any Applicable Law. 
---|---|--- 
   



   | i)| _Litigation_. [Except as shown on Schedule [●] hereto,] there
are no proceedings or investigations pending or, to the New Issuer\'s
knowledge, threatened against the New Issuer or its Subsidiary, or any of
their businesses, operations, properties or conditions, that (a) relate to
this Assumption Agreement, the Note or transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby; or (b) would have a material adverse effect on the New Issuer or
any of its Subsidiary. The New Issuer or Subsidiary is not in default with
respect to any order, injunction or judgment of any Governmental Authority.  
---|---|--- 
  



   | j)| _No Defaults_. After giving effect to the assignment and
assumption contemplated herein, no event or circumstance has occurred or
exists with respect to the New Issuer that constitutes a Default or Event of
Default. Neither the New Issuer nor any of its Subsidiaries are in default,
and no event or circumstance has occurred or exists that with the passage of
time or giving of notice would constitute a default, under any material
contract to which it is a party. To the New Issuer's knowledge, there is no
basis upon which any party (other than the New Issuer or any of its
Subsidiaries) could terminate a material contract to which it is a party prior
to its scheduled termination date.  
---|---|--- 
  



   | k)| _Not a Regulated Entity_. The New Issuer is not (a) an
"investment company" or a "person directly or indirectly controlled by or
acting on behalf of an investment company" within the meaning of the
Investment Company Act of 1940; or (b) subject to regulation under any other
Applicable Law regarding its authority to incur Indebtedness. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | l)| _Margin Stock_. Neither the New Issuer nor any of its
Subsidiaries are engaged, principally or as one of their respective important
activities, in the business of extending credit for the purpose of purchasing
or carrying any "margin stock" (as that term is defined in Regulation U of the
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System). No proceeds of the Note
will be used by the New Issuer to purchase or carry, or to reduce or
refinance any Indebtedness incurred to purchase or carry, any "margin stock"
(as that term is defined in Regulation U of the Board of Governors of the
Federal Reserve System) or for any related purpose governed by Regulations T,
U or X of the Board of Governors.  
---|---|--- 
  



  

5. _Financial Covenants_.

  



   | a)| _Debt Service Coverage Ratio_. The New Issuer shall not permit
the Debt Service Coverage Ratio as of the last day of any fiscal quarter of
the New Issuer to be less than 1.3:1.0. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | b)| _Minimum Stockholders ' Equity_. The New Issuer  shall not
permit the Stockholders' Equity as of the last day of any fiscal quarter  of
the New Issuer to be less than [$400 million]1/[$250 million]2. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

  



  

1 If the New Issuer is not an Affiliate of the Initial Issuer.

  

2 If the New Issuer is an Affiliate of the Initial Issuer.

  



   


--- 

 


--- 

    

  



  

6. _Reporting Requirements_. The New Issuer shall furnish to the Holder:

  



   | a)| as soon as available, and in any event within 90 days after the
close of each fiscal year, balance sheets as of the end of such fiscal year
and the related statements of income, cash flow and Shareholders\' Equity for
such fiscal year, on consolidated bases for the New Issuer and its
Subsidiaries, which consolidated statements shall be audited and
certified (without qualification) by a firm of independent certified public
accountants of recognized standing selected by the New Issuer and acceptable
to the Holder, and shall set forth in comparative form corresponding figures
for the preceding fiscal year and other information reasonably acceptable to
the Holder; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | b)| as soon as available, and in any event within 30 days after the
end of each quarter (but within 60 days after the last quarter in a fiscal
year), unaudited balance sheets as of the end of such quarter and the related
statements of income and cash flow for such quarter and for the portion of
the fiscal year then elapsed, on consolidated bases for the New Issuer and
its Subsidiaries, setting forth in comparative form corresponding figures for
the preceding fiscal year and certified by the chief financial officer of the
New Issuer as prepared in accordance with GAAP and fairly presenting the
financial position and results of operations for such quarter and period,
subject to normal year-end adjustments and the absence of footnotes; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | c)| concurrently with delivery of financial statements under clauses
(a) and (b) above, a compliance certificate executed by the chief financial
officer of the New Issuer Agent, certifying (i) compliance by the New Issuer
with the financial covenants set forth in Section 5 hereof and providing
supporting calculations in the form reasonably acceptable to the Holder and
(ii) that no Default or an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing as
of such date. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

7. _Severability_. If any term or provision of this Assumption Agreement is invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other term or provision of this Assumption Agreement or invalidate or render unenforceable such term or provision in any other jurisdiction.

  



  

8. _Counterparts_. This Assumption Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which shall constitute an original. Delivery of an executed signature page to this Assumption Agreement by facsimile transmission or other electronic means (including ".pdf" or ".tif" format) shall be as effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Assumption Agreement.

---

 _FORM OF WHOLESALING AGREEMENT_

  



  

[ ], 2014

  

Realty Capital Securities, LLC

  

One Beacon Street 
 14th Floor 
 Boston, MA 02108

  



  

Ladies and Gentlemen:

  



  

Cole Capital Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Dealer Manager"), with
its address at 2325 East Camelback Road, Suite 1100, Phoenix, AZ 85016, has
entered into an agreement dated as of September 17, 2013 (the "Dealer Manager
Agreement"), with Cole Office and Industrial REIT (CCIT II), Inc. (the
"Company"). Under the Dealer Manager Agreement, the Dealer Manager serves as
the Company's exclusive Dealer Manager in connection with a public offering
(the "Offering") of the Company's common stock. The shares of the Company's
stock (the "Offered Shares") are being issued and sold to the public on
a "best efforts" basis through the Dealer Manager and the broker-dealers and
other appropriately licensed firms participating in the Offering (the
"Participating Broker-Dealers"), pursuant to Participating Broker-Dealer
Agreements between the Dealer Manager and each Participating Broker-Dealer
(each, a "Participating Broker-Dealer Agreement"). The Dealer-Manager shall
provide to the Wholesaler the form of the Participating Broker-Dealer
Agreement used by the Dealer Manager. Capitalized terms used herein but not
otherwise defined shall have the respective meanings ascribed to them in the
Dealer Manager Agreement.

  



  

In consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements contained herein,
intending to be legally bound, the parties hereby agree to the following terms
and conditions set forth in this Wholesaling Agreement (this "Agreement"):

  



   | 1.| Appointment and Acceptance of the Wholesaler  
---|---|--- 
  



  

Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, the
Dealer Manager hereby appoints Realty Capital Securities, LLC, a Delaware
limited liability company (the "Wholesaler"), and the Wholesaler hereby
accepts such appointment, as the Dealer Manager's distribution agent to
assist, through the Wholesaler's employees, agents, contractors, registered
representatives and all other representatives who will perform services
hereunder (collectively, the "RCS Service Providers"), the Dealer Manager with
the sale of Offered Shares through the recruitment of, and the provision of
assistance to, Participating Broker-Dealers, and the Wholesaler desires to
accept such engagement; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing herein shall be
construed to: (i) contravene the Company's appointment of the Dealer Manager
as its exclusive agent and dealer manager during the Offering Period, and
the Dealer Manager's acceptance of such appointment, pursuant to _Section
3.1_ of the Dealer Manager Agreement; or (ii) imply that the Dealer Manager
shall not have sole discretion to accept or reject any subscription for the
Offered Shares in whole or in part.

  



   | 2.| Undertakings of the Wholesaler  
---|---|--- 
  



  

(a) The Wholesaler will use diligent efforts to recruit certain
broker-dealers and other appropriately licensed firms to serve as
Participating Broker-Dealers, each of which shall be a member of the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. ("FINRA") in good standing, to
agree to offer and sell the Offered Shares on a best efforts basis without any
commitment on the Participating Broker-Dealers' part to purchase any Offered
Shares pursuant to a Participating Broker-Dealer Agreement with the Dealer
Manager.

  



  

(b) The Wholesaler will use diligent efforts to assist the Dealer
Manager in providing certain services to Participating Broker-Dealers in
connection with the Offering, which will consist primarily of:

  



  

   


--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(i) providing training and education regarding the Company and the
offering of the Offered Shares to Participating Broker-Dealers;

  



  

(ii) providing marketing and sales support for Participating Broker-
Dealers,; and

  



  

(iii) such other assistance to Participating Broker-Dealers and their
registered representatives in marketing the Offered Shares and
otherwise participating in the Offering as shall be reasonably determined to
be appropriate by the Dealer Manager.

  



  

(c) The Wholesaler acknowledges that it is familiar with FINRA Rule
2310 and that it will comply in all material respects with all the terms
thereof to the extent FINRA Rule 2310 applies to the conduct contemplated
herein. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, the Wholesaler shall not be
responsible for the obligations of the Dealer Manager under the Dealer Manager
Agreement and _Section 6(i)_ to assure compliance with the organization and
offering expenses limitations of FINRA Rule 2310(b)(4).

  



   | 3.| Compensation and Expense Reimbursement  
---|---|--- 
  



  

(a) In consideration for the Wholesaler performing its obligations
under this Agreement, the Dealer Manager shall pay the Wholesaler a sourcing
fee (the "Sourcing Fee") equal to 1.80% of the Selling Price of each of the
Offered Shares sold by Participating Broker-Dealers who entered into dealer
agreements with the Dealer Manager primarily as a result of the efforts
of RCS Service Providers ("RCS Sales"); _provided_ , _however_ , the Sourcing
Fee shall be payable solely from that portion of the Dealer Manager Fee that
is (i) actually received by the Dealer Manager from the Company pursuant to
_Section 3,3_ of the Dealer Manager Agreement, and (ii) not reallowed to any
Participating Broker-Dealer pursuant to _Section 3.3_  of the Dealer Manager
Agreement (a "Sourcing Fee Reallowance") in respect of any RCS Sales.

  



  

(b) The Sourcing Fee shall be paid substantially concurrently with
the receipt of corresponding payments to the Dealer Manager from the Company
pursuant to _Section 3.3_ of the Dealer Manager Agreement, but in no event no
later than five business days thereafter.

  



  

(c) The Dealer Manager also will reimburse the Wholesaler for all
costs and expenses incurred that are: (i) in connection with _bona fide_ due
diligence activities; and (ii) incident to the Offering, but only to the
extent such costs or expenses (A) are permitted pursuant to prevailing rules
and regulations of FINRA, (B) would have been incurred by the Dealer Manager
if the Wholesaler had not incurred them, and (C) are otherwise eligible for
reimbursement from the Company pursuant to _Section 3.6_ of the
Dealer Manager Agreement. The Wholesaler will present the Dealer Manager with
itemized and detailed invoices for all incurred costs and expenses that are
reimbursable pursuant to this _Section 3(c)_. The Dealer Manager will submit
such request to the Company within five business days following receipt of
such invoices and will reimburse the Wholesaler within five business days
following receipt of funds from the Company for such reimbursement.

  



   | 4.| Representations and Warranties of the Dealer Manager  
---|---|--- 
  



  

(a) The Dealer Manager is a corporation duly organized and validly
existing under the laws of the State of Delaware, with full power
and authority to conduct its business and to enter into this Agreement and to
perform the transactions contemplated hereby.

  



  

(b) This Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered
by the Dealer Manager, constitutes a legal, valid and binding agreement of
the Dealer Manager, enforceable against the Dealer Manager in accordance with
its terms, except as enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,

to carry out the services related to the Offering as contemplated by this
Agreement and the Dealer Manager Agreement or to perform its obligations
hereunder and thereunder. With respect to its participation in the offer and
sale of the Offered Shares (including, without limitation any resales and

respects with all applicable requirements of (1) the Securities Act of 1933,
as amended (the "Securities Act"), and the applicable rules and regulations

with federal and state governmental and regulatory agencies required to

and the Dealer Manager Agreement, except where the inability of such
Governmental Licenses to be in full force and effect would not have a
material adverse effect on the business, properties, financial position,
results of operations or cash flows of the Dealer Manager or as otherwise may
be disclosed in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus. The
performance of the obligations of the Dealer Manager under this Agreement and
the Dealer Manager Agreement will not (A) violate or result in a breach of
any provisions of its articles of incorporation or by-laws (or similar
instruments or documents) or any order, law or regulation binding upon it,
and (B) result in a material breach of any provisions of any agreement or
instrument to which it is a party or which is otherwise binding upon it.

(d) The Wholesaler is familiar with Rule 15c2-8 under the Exchange

Authorized Sales Materials to be used by the Wholesaler and the
Participating Broker-Dealers in connection with the Offering. If the
Wholesaler elects to use such Authorized Sales Materials in connection

that such material shall not be used by it in connection with the Offering
and that it will direct Participating Broker-Dealers not to make such use of
any Authorized Sales Materials unless accompanied or preceded by the
Prospectus. If the Wholesaler elects to use such Authorized Sales Materials in

time and resume offering and sale of the Offered Shares upon subsequent
request of the Company if required to do so in connection with the
performance of its obligations hereunder.

  



  

(g) The Wholesaler will provide to the Company and the Dealer
Manager as soon as practicable upon receipt by the Wholesaler copies of

Offering (including, but not limited to, the manner in which the Offered
Shares are offered by any Participating Broker-Dealer), the Offered Shares or
the Company.

  



  

(h) Other than with respect to use of Authorized Sales Materials or
the Prospectus or otherwise pursuant to or in connection with this

the " Cole " name, brand, logo or trademark or any reasonably similar
variant or derivative thereof.

  



  

(i) The Wholesaler shall under no circumstances engage in any
activities hereunder in any jurisdiction (i) in which the Dealer Manager has

Offered Shares are qualified for sale or are exempt under the applicable
securities or Blue Sky laws thereof, or (ii) in which the Wholesaler may not
lawfully engage.

   | 8.| Indemnification; Contribution  
---|---|--- 
  



  

(a) The Dealer Manager will indemnify, defend (subject to _Section
4_ of the Dealer Manager Agreement) and hold harmless the Wholesaler, its
affiliates and their respective officers, directors, shareholders, members,
partners, other equity-holders and control persons (collectively, the "Other
Indemnified Parties"), from and against any losses, claims (including the
reasonable costs of investigation and legal fees), damages or liabilities (or
actions in respect thereof), to which the Wholesaler, its affiliates or their
respective Other Indemnified Parties may become subject under the Securities
Act or the Exchange Act, or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims,
damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are
based upon: (i) any inaccuracy in or breach of a representation or warranty
contained herein by the Dealer Manager, any breach of a covenant or agreement
contained herein of the Dealer Manager, or any failure by the Dealer Manager
to comply with state or federal securities law applicable to the Offering;
(ii) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact
contained in the information relating to the Dealer Manager that appears in
the Dealer Manager Sections of the Prospectus or any amendment thereof, or
arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state in
the Dealer Manager Sections a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading; and (iii) any unauthorized use of sales
materials or use of unauthorized verbal representations concerning the Offered
Shares by the Dealer Manager. The Dealer Manager will reimburse the
Wholesaler and its Other Indemnified Parties for any legal or other expenses
reasonably incurred by such Wholesaler, its affiliates and their respective
Other Indemnified Parties in connection with investigating or defending such
loss, claim, damage, liability or action.

  



  

(b) The Wholesaler will indemnify, defend and hold harmless the
Dealer Manager, the Company and their respective Other Indemnified
Parties, from and against any losses, claims (including the reasonable costs
of investigation and legal fees), damages or liabilities (or actions in
respect thereof), to which the Dealer Manager, the Company and any of their
respective Other Indemnified Parties may become subject under the Securities
Act or the Exchange Act, or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims
(including the reasonable costs of investigation and legal fees), damages or
liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based
upon: (i) any inaccuracy in or breach of a representation or warranty
contained herein by the Wholesaler, any breach of a covenant or agreement
contained herein of the Wholesaler, or any failure by the Wholesaler to comply
with state or federal securities laws applicable to the Offering; and (ii)
any unauthorized use of sales materials or use of unauthorized verbal
representations concerning the Shares by the Wholesaler.

  



  

(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party of notice of the
commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in
respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party, notify the
indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the failure so
to notify the indemnifying party (i) will not relieve it from liability under
this _Section 8_ unless and to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such
action and such failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying
party of substantial rights and defenses and (ii) will not, in any event,
relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified party
other than the indemnification obligation provided in this Agreement. The
indemnifying party shall be entitled to appoint counsel of the indemnifying
party's choice at the indemnifying party's expense to represent the
indemnified party in any action for which indemnification is sought (in which
case the indemnifying party shall not thereafter be responsible for the fees
and expenses of any separate counsel retained by the indemnified party or
parties except as set forth below); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that such
counsel shall be subject to approval by the indemnified party, not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed. Notwithstanding the indemnifying party's
election to appoint counsel to represent the indemnified party in an action,
the indemnified party shall have the right to employ and select separate
counsel (including local counsel), subject to approval by the indemnifying
party not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed, and the indemnifying party
shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel
if (i) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the
indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest,
(ii) the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, any such action
include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the
indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal
defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different
from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, (iii) the
indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel for the indemnified
party (subject to approval by the indemnified party not to be unreasonably
withheld

  



  

   

7 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

or delayed) to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after
notice of the institution of such action or (iv) the indemnifying party shall
authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of
the indemnifying party. An indemnifying party may settle or compromise or
consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or
threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which
indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder but may not do so
without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, unless such
settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of each
indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit
or proceeding.

  



  

(d) If the right to indemnification provided for in this _Section 8_
would by its terms be available to a person hereunder, but is held to be
unavailable by a court of competent jurisdiction for any reason, then each
indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate amount paid or payable
by such indemnified party as a result of such Losses and expenses in respect
thereof, as incurred, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the
relative fault of the Dealer Manager and the Wholesaler, as applicable,
in connection with the statements, omissions or other circumstances which
resulted in such Losses or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable
considerations. The relative fault of the Dealer Manager and the Wholesaler,
as applicable, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, the
parties' relative intent, knowledge, and access to information. It is
understood that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant
to this _Section 8(d_ ) were determined by pro rata allocation or by any
other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable
considerations referred to above in this _Section 8(d)_. Notwithstanding the
provisions of this _Section 8(d)_ , the Dealer Manager shall not be required
to contribute any amount in excess of the total price of the Offering Shares
sold by it. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the
meaning of _Section 11(f)_ of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to
contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent
misrepresentation. For purposes of this _Section 8(d)_ , each Other
Indemnified Party affiliate of the Dealer Manager shall have the same rights
to contribution as the Dealer Manager and each Other Indemnified Party of the
Wholesaler shall have the same rights to contribution as the Wholesaler.

  



   | 9.| Relationship of Wholesaler, Participating Broker-Dealers and the
Dealer Manager  
---|---|--- 
  



  

(a) The obligations of each of the Wholesaler and the Participating
Broker-Dealers are several and not joint. Nothing herein contained shall
constitute the Wholesaler and the Participating Broker-Dealers, or any of
them, as an association, partnership, unincorporated business or other
separate entity. The Dealer Manager and the Company shall be under no
liability to the Wholesaler except for lack of good faith and for obligations
expressly assumed by the Dealer Manager and the Company in this Agreement.

  



  

(b) The parties hereto acknowledge that, other than as expressly set
forth herein, the Wholesaler is not authorized to act as agent of the Dealer
Manager or the Company in any connection or transaction, and the Wholesaler
agrees that it will not so act or purport to so act.

  



  

(c) The parties hereto acknowledge that the Wholesaler's obligations
under this Agreement, including without limitation the Wholesaler Exclusivity
have no impact on, and in no way release the Dealer Manager from, the Dealer
Manager's obligations and rights to act as the dealer manager for the Company
pursuant to _Section 3.1_ of the Dealer Manager Agreement.

  



   | 10.| Termination  
---|---|--- 
  



  

This Agreement shall terminate upon the earlier to occur of (i) termination
of the Offering, (ii) the Second Closing (as defined in the Equity Purchase
Agreement (the "Equity Purchase Agreement"), dated as of September 30, 2014,
by and between ARC Properties Operating Partnership, L.P. and RCS Capital
Corporation), (iii) termination of the Equity Purchase Agreement or (iv)
December 31, 2014.

  



  

(a) Wholesaler may terminate this Agreement at any time by giving
ten days' prior written notice thereof to the other parties hereto.
This Agreement automatically shall terminate with no further action by any
party hereto if the

  



  

   

8 
--- 

 


--- 

    

  



  

Wholesaler or the Dealer Manager ceases to be a member in good standing of
FINRA, or with the securities commission of the state in which its principal
office is located. The Wholesaler will notify the Dealer Manager immediately
if the Wholesaler ceases to be a member in good standing of FINRA or with the
securities commission of any state in which the Wholesaler is currently
registered or licensed. The Dealer Manager will notify the Wholesaler
immediately if the Dealer Manager ceases to be a member in good standing of
FINRA or with the securities commission of any state in which the Dealer
Manager is currently registered or licensed.

  



  

(b) In the event of termination under _Section 11(b)_ , the Dealer
Manager will continue to pay any Sourcing Fees with respect to RCS Sales to
the Wholesaler and reimburse costs and expenses incurred, to the extent
reimbursable under _Section 3(c)_ , for so long as Offered Shares remain
outstanding (it being understood and agreed that the calculation of the
Sourcing Fees in such event shall take into account the number of Offered
Shares sold primarily from the efforts of RCS Service Providers in the
Offering). Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, the Dealer Manager will
not continue to pay the Sourcing Fee to the Wholesaler and reimburse costs
and expenses related to the Offering incurred by the Wholesaler pursuant to
_Section 3(c)_ subsequent to the termination of the Offering to the extent,
but only to the extent, that such payments or reimbursements would cause the
total underwriting compensation (as defined in accordance with applicable
FINRA rules) paid with respect to the Offering to exceed 10% of the
gross proceeds from the sale of the Offered Shares calculated as of the
termination of the Offering.

  



  

(c) The termination of this Agreement for any reason shall not
affect (i) the Wholesaler's obligations under the second sentence of _Section
10(a)_ , (ii) the indemnification obligations under _Section 8_ , or (iii)
this _Section 10_. Without limiting the foregoing, the provisions of this
Agreement shall survive the termination of this Agreement with respect to any
matter arising while this Agreement was in effect.

  



   | 11.| Amendment  
---|---|--- 
  



  

(a) The Dealer Manager has the right, subject to written consent
from the other parties hereto which shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed, to amend this Agreement as necessary, in the reasonable opinion of
outside counsel to the Dealer Manager, to comply with applicable law or the
requirements of any governmental or self-regulatory body or agency.

  



  

(b) This Agreement may not otherwise be amended, supplemented or
waived except by the express written consent of the parties hereto. No waiver
of any provision of this Agreement may be implied from any course of dealing
between or among any of the parties hereto or from any failure by any party
hereto to assert its rights under this Agreement on any occasion or series of
occasions.

  



   | 12.| Miscellaneous

consent of the other parties. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure
to the benefit of the respective successors and permitted assigns of the
parties hereto.

  



  

(b) All notices, requests, demands, approvals, consents, waivers and
other communications required or permitted to be given under this Agreement
(each, a "Notice") shall be in writing and shall be (i) delivered personally,

[ ], 2014

  

Realty Capital Securities, LLC 
 One Beacon Street 
 14th Floor 
 Boston, MA 02108

  



  

Ladies and Gentlemen:

  



  

Cole Capital Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Dealer Manager"), with
its address at 2325 East Camelback Road, Suite 1100, Phoenix, AZ 85016, has
entered into an agreement dated as of August 26, 2013 (the "Dealer Manager
Agreement"), with Cole Real Estate Income Strategy (Daily NAV), Inc. (the
"Company"). Under the Dealer Manager Agreement, the Dealer Manager serves
as the Company's exclusive Dealer Manager in connection with a public
offering (the "Offering") of the Company's common stock. The shares of the
Company's stock (the "Offered Shares") are being issued and sold to the
public on a "best efforts" basis through the Dealer Manager and the broker-
dealers and other appropriately licensed firms participating in the Offering
(the "Participating Broker-Dealers"), pursuant to Participating Broker-Dealer
Agreements between the Dealer Manager and each Participating Broker-Dealer
(each, a "Participating Broker-Dealer Agreement"). The Dealer-Manager shall
provide to the Wholesaler the form of the Participating Broker-Dealer
Agreement used by the Dealer Manager. Capitalized terms used herein but not
otherwise defined shall have the respective meanings ascribed to them in the
Dealer Manager Agreement.

  



  

In consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements contained herein,
intending to be legally bound, the parties hereby agree to the following terms
and conditions set forth in this Wholesaling Agreement (this "Agreement"):

  



   | 1.| Appointment and Acceptance of the Wholesaler  
---|---|--- 
  



  

Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, the
Dealer Manager hereby appoints Realty Capital Securities, LLC, a Delaware
limited liability company (the "Wholesaler"), and the Wholesaler hereby
accepts such appointment, as the Dealer Manager's distribution agent to
assist, through the Wholesaler's employees, agents, contractors, registered
representatives and all other representatives who will perform services
hereunder (collectively, the "RCS Service Providers"), the Dealer Manager with
the sale of Offered Shares through the recruitment of, and the provision of
assistance to, Participating Broker-Dealers, and the Wholesaler desires to
accept such engagement; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing herein shall be
construed to: (i) contravene the Company's appointment of the Dealer Manager
as its exclusive agent and dealer manager during the Offering Period, and
the Dealer Manager's acceptance of such appointment, pursuant to _Section
3.1_ of the Dealer Manager Agreement; or (ii) imply that the Dealer Manager
shall not have sole discretion to accept or reject any subscription for the
Offered Shares in whole or in part.

  



   | 2.| Undertakings of the Wholesaler  
---|---|--- 
  



  

(a) The Wholesaler will use diligent efforts to recruit certain
broker-dealers and other appropriately licensed firms to serve as
Participating Broker-Dealers, each of which shall be a member of the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. ("FINRA") in good standing, to
agree to offer and sell the Offered Shares on a best efforts basis without any
commitment on the Participating Broker-Dealers' part to purchase any Offered
Shares pursuant to a Participating Broker-Dealer Agreement with the Dealer
Manager.

  



  

(b) The Wholesaler will use diligent efforts to assist the Dealer
Manager in providing certain services to Participating Broker-Dealers in
connection with the Offering, which will consist primarily of:

  



  

   


--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(i) providing training and education regarding the Company and the
offering of the Offered Shares to Participating Broker-Dealers;

  



  

(ii) providing marketing and sales support for Participating Broker-
Dealers,; and

  



  

(iii) such other assistance to Participating Broker-Dealers and their
registered representatives in marketing the Offered Shares and
otherwise participating in the Offering as shall be reasonably determined to
be appropriate by the Dealer Manager.

  



  

(c) The Wholesaler acknowledges that it is familiar with FINRA Rule
2310 and that it will comply in all material respects with all the terms
thereof to the extent FINRA Rule 2310 applies to the conduct contemplated
herein. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, the Wholesaler shall not be
responsible for the obligations of the Dealer Manager under the Dealer Manager
Agreement and _Section 6(i)_ to assure compliance with the organization and
offering expenses limitations of FINRA Rule 2310(b)(4).

  



   | 3.| Compensation and Expense Reimbursement  
---|---|--- 
  



  

(a) In consideration for the Wholesaler performing its obligations
under this Agreement, the Dealer Manager shall pay the Wholesaler a sourcing
fee (the "Sourcing Fee") equal to 3.375% of the Selling Price of each of the
Offered Shares sold by Participating Broker-Dealers who entered into dealer
agreements with the Dealer Manager primarily as a result of the efforts
of RCS Service Providers ("RCS Sales"); _provided_ , _however_ , the Sourcing
Fee shall be payable solely from that portion of the Dealer Manager Fee that
is (i) actually received by the Dealer Manager from the Company pursuant to
_Section 3,3_ of the Dealer Manager Agreement, and (ii) not reallowed to any
Participating Broker-Dealer pursuant to _Section 3.3_  of the Dealer Manager
Agreement (a "Sourcing Fee Reallowance") in respect of any RCS Sales.

  



  

(b) The Sourcing Fee shall be paid substantially concurrently with
the receipt of corresponding payments to the Dealer Manager from the Company
pursuant to _Section 3.3_ of the Dealer Manager Agreement, but in no event no
later than five business days thereafter.

  



  

(c) The Dealer Manager also will reimburse the Wholesaler for all
costs and expenses incurred that are: (i) in connection with _bona fide_ due
diligence activities; and (ii) incident to the Offering, but only to the
extent such costs or expenses (A) are permitted pursuant to prevailing rules
and regulations of FINRA, (B) would have been incurred by the Dealer Manager
if the Wholesaler had not incurred them, and (C) are otherwise eligible for
reimbursement from the Company pursuant to _Section 3.5_ of the
Dealer Manager Agreement. The Wholesaler will present the Dealer Manager with
itemized and detailed invoices for all incurred costs and expenses that are
reimbursable pursuant to this _Section 3(c)_. The Dealer Manager will submit
such request to the Company within five business days following receipt of
such invoices and will reimburse the Wholesaler within five business days
following receipt of funds from the Company for such reimbursement.

  



   | 4.| Representations and Warranties of the Dealer Manager  
---|---|--- 
  



  

(a) The Dealer Manager is a corporation duly organized and validly
existing under the laws of the State of Delaware, with full power
and authority to conduct its business and to enter into this Agreement and to
perform the transactions contemplated hereby.

  



  

(b) This Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered
by the Dealer Manager, constitutes a legal, valid and binding agreement of
the Dealer Manager, enforceable against the Dealer Manager in accordance with
its terms, except as enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting creditors' rights
generally and by general equitable principles relating to the availability of
remedies, and except to the extent that the enforceability of the
indemnity provisions contained in this Agreement may be limited under

to carry out the services related to the Offering as contemplated by this
Agreement and the Dealer Manager Agreement or to perform its obligations
hereunder and thereunder. With respect to its participation in the offer and
sale of the Offered Shares (including, without limitation any resales and

respects with all applicable requirements of (1) the Securities Act of 1933,
as amended (the "Securities Act"), and the applicable rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder (the "Securities Act Regulations"), the Exchange Act

"Exchange Act Regulations") and all other federal rules and regulations
applicable to the Offering and the sale of the Offered Shares, (2) applicable
state securities or "blue sky" laws, and (3) the rules set forth in the FINRA
rulebook applicable to the Offering, which currently consists of rules

(d) The Dealer Manager and its representatives have all required
Governmental Licenses and have made all filings and registrations
with federal and state governmental and regulatory agencies required to
conduct their business and to perform their obligations under this Agreement
and the Dealer Manager Agreement, except where the inability of such
Governmental Licenses to be in full force and effect would not have a
material adverse effect on the business, properties, financial position,
results of operations or cash flows of the Dealer Manager or as otherwise may
be disclosed in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus. The
performance of the obligations of the Dealer Manager under this Agreement and
the Dealer Manager Agreement will not (A) violate or result in a breach of
any provisions of its articles of incorporation or by-laws (or similar
instruments or documents) or any order, law or regulation binding upon it,
and (B) result in a material breach of any provisions of any agreement or
instrument to which it is a party or which is otherwise binding upon it.

(i) The Dealer Manager shall comply, in all material respects, with
all applicable laws, and the applicable rules and regulations of FINRA, the

   | 8.| Indemnification; Contribution  
---|---|--- 
  



  

(a) The Dealer Manager will indemnify, defend (subject to _Section
4_ of the Dealer Manager Agreement) and hold harmless the Wholesaler, its
affiliates and their respective officers, directors, shareholders, members,
partners, other equity-holders and control persons (collectively, the "Other
Indemnified Parties"), from and against any losses, claims (including the
reasonable costs of investigation and legal fees), damages or liabilities (or
actions in respect thereof), to which the Wholesaler, its affiliates or their
respective Other Indemnified Parties may become subject under the Securities
Act or the Exchange Act, or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims,
damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are
based upon: (i) any inaccuracy in or breach of a representation or warranty
contained herein by the Dealer Manager, any breach of a covenant or agreement
contained herein of the Dealer Manager, or any failure by the Dealer Manager
to comply with state or federal securities law applicable to the Offering;
(ii) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact
contained in the information relating to the Dealer Manager that appears in
the Dealer Manager Sections of the Prospectus or any amendment thereof, or
arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state in
the Dealer Manager Sections a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading; and (iii) any unauthorized use of sales
materials or use of unauthorized verbal representations concerning the Offered
Shares by the Dealer Manager. The Dealer Manager will reimburse the
Wholesaler and its Other Indemnified Parties for any legal or other expenses
reasonably incurred by such Wholesaler, its affiliates and their respective
Other Indemnified Parties in connection with investigating or defending such
loss, claim, damage, liability or action.

  



  

(b) The Wholesaler will indemnify, defend and hold harmless the
Dealer Manager, the Company and their respective Other Indemnified
Parties, from and against any losses, claims (including the reasonable costs
of investigation and legal fees), damages or liabilities (or actions in
respect thereof), to which the Dealer Manager, the Company and any of their
respective Other Indemnified Parties may become subject under the Securities
Act or the Exchange Act, or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims
(including the reasonable costs of investigation and legal fees), damages or
liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based
upon: (i) any inaccuracy in or breach of a representation or warranty
contained herein by the Wholesaler, any breach of a covenant or agreement
contained herein of the Wholesaler, or any failure by the Wholesaler to comply
with state or federal securities laws applicable to the Offering; and (ii)
any unauthorized use of sales materials or use of unauthorized verbal
representations concerning the Shares by the Wholesaler.

  



  

(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party of notice of the
commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in
respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party, notify the
indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the failure so
to notify the indemnifying party (i) will not relieve it from liability under
this _Section 8_ unless and to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such
action and such failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying
party of substantial rights and defenses and (ii) will not, in any event,
relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified party
other than the indemnification obligation provided in this Agreement. The
indemnifying party shall be entitled to appoint counsel of the indemnifying
party's choice at the indemnifying party's expense to represent the
indemnified party in any action for which indemnification is sought (in which
case the indemnifying party shall not thereafter be responsible for the fees
and expenses of any separate counsel retained by the indemnified party or
parties except as set forth below); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that such
counsel shall be subject to approval by the indemnified party, not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed. Notwithstanding the indemnifying party's
election to appoint counsel to represent the indemnified party in an action,
the indemnified party shall have the right to employ and select separate
counsel (including local counsel), subject to approval by the indemnifying
party not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed, and the indemnifying party
shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel
if (i) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the
indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest,
(ii) the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, any such action
include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the
indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal
defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different
from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, (iii) the
indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel for the indemnified
party (subject to approval by the indemnified party not to be unreasonably
withheld

  



  

   

7 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

or delayed) to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after
notice of the institution of such action or (iv) the indemnifying party shall
authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of
the indemnifying party. An indemnifying party may settle or compromise or
consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or
threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which
indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder but may not do so
without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, unless such
settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of each
indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit
or proceeding.

  



  

(d) If the right to indemnification provided for in this _Section 8_
would by its terms be available to a person hereunder, but is held to be
unavailable by a court of competent jurisdiction for any reason, then each
indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate amount paid or payable
by such indemnified party as a result of such Losses and expenses in respect
thereof, as incurred, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the
relative fault of the Dealer Manager and the Wholesaler, as applicable,
in connection with the statements, omissions or other circumstances which
resulted in such Losses or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable
considerations. The relative fault of the Dealer Manager and the Wholesaler,
as applicable, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, the
parties' relative intent, knowledge, and access to information. It is
understood that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant
to this _Section 8(d_ ) were determined by pro rata allocation or by any
other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable
considerations referred to above in this _Section 8(d)_. Notwithstanding the
provisions of this _Section 8(d)_ , the Dealer Manager shall not be required
to contribute any amount in excess of the total price of the Offering Shares
sold by it. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the
meaning of _Section 11(f)_ of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to
contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent
misrepresentation. For purposes of this _Section 8(d)_ , each Other
Indemnified Party affiliate of the Dealer Manager shall have the same rights
to contribution as the Dealer Manager and each Other Indemnified Party of the
Wholesaler shall have the same rights to contribution as the Wholesaler.

  



   | 9.| Relationship of Wholesaler, Participating Broker-Dealers and the
Dealer Manager  
---|---|--- 
  



  

(a) The obligations of each of the Wholesaler and the Participating
Broker-Dealers are several and not joint. Nothing herein contained shall
constitute the Wholesaler and the Participating Broker-Dealers, or any of
them, as an association, partnership, unincorporated business or other
separate entity. The Dealer Manager and the Company shall be under no
liability to the Wholesaler except for lack of good faith and for obligations
expressly assumed by the Dealer Manager and the Company in this Agreement.

  



  

(b) The parties hereto acknowledge that, other than as expressly set
forth herein, the Wholesaler is not authorized to act as agent of the Dealer
Manager or the Company in any connection or transaction, and the Wholesaler
agrees that it will not so act or purport to so act.

  



  

(c) The parties hereto acknowledge that the Wholesaler's obligations
under this Agreement, including without limitation the Wholesaler Exclusivity
have no impact on, and in no way release the Dealer Manager from, the Dealer
Manager's obligations and rights to act as the dealer manager for the Company
pursuant to _Section 3.1_ of the Dealer Manager Agreement.

  



   | 10.| Termination  
---|---|--- 
  



  

This Agreement shall terminate upon the earlier to occur of (i) termination
of the Offering, (ii) the Second Closing (as defined in the Equity Purchase
Agreement (the "Equity Purchase Agreement"), dated as of September 30, 2014,
by and between ARC Properties Operating Partnership, L.P. and RCS Capital
Corporation), (iii) termination of the Equity Purchase Agreement or (iv)
December 31, 2014.

  



  

(a) Wholesaler may terminate this Agreement at any time by giving
ten days' prior written notice thereof to the other parties hereto.
This Agreement automatically shall terminate with no further action by any
party hereto if the

  



  

   

8 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

Wholesaler or the Dealer Manager ceases to be a member in good standing of
FINRA, or with the securities commission of the state in which its principal
office is located. The Wholesaler will notify the Dealer Manager immediately
if the Wholesaler ceases to be a member in good standing of FINRA or with the
securities commission of any state in which the Wholesaler is currently
registered or licensed. The Dealer Manager will notify the Wholesaler
immediately if the Dealer Manager ceases to be a member in good standing of
FINRA or with the securities commission of any state in which the Dealer
Manager is currently registered or licensed.

  



  

(b) In the event of termination under _Section 11(b)_ , the Dealer
Manager will continue to pay any Sourcing Fees with respect to RCS Sales to
the Wholesaler and reimburse costs and expenses incurred, to the extent
reimbursable under _Section 3(c)_ , for so long as Offered Shares remain
outstanding (it being understood and agreed that the calculation of the
Sourcing Fees in such event shall take into account the number of Offered
Shares sold primarily from the efforts of RCS Service Providers in the
Offering). Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, the Dealer Manager will
not continue to pay the Sourcing Fee to the Wholesaler and reimburse costs
and expenses related to the Offering incurred by the Wholesaler pursuant to
_Section 3(c)_ subsequent to the termination of the Offering to the extent,
but only to the extent, that such payments or reimbursements would cause the
total underwriting compensation (as defined in accordance with applicable
FINRA rules) paid with respect to the Offering to exceed 10% of the
gross proceeds from the sale of the Offered Shares calculated as of the
termination of the Offering.

  



  

(c) The termination of this Agreement for any reason shall not
affect (i) the Wholesaler's obligations under the second sentence of _Section
10(a)_ , (ii) the indemnification obligations under _Section 8_ , or (iii)
this _Section 10_. Without limiting the foregoing, the provisions of this
Agreement shall survive the termination of this Agreement with respect to any
matter arising while this Agreement was in effect.

delayed, to amend this Agreement as necessary, in the reasonable opinion of

Ladies and Gentlemen:

  



  

Cole Capital Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Dealer Manager"), with
its address at 2325 East Camelback Road, Suite 1100, Phoenix, AZ 85016, has
entered into an agreement dated as of February 10, 2011 (the "Dealer Manager
Agreement"), with Cole Corporate Income Trust, Inc. (the "Company"). Under
the Dealer Manager Agreement, the Dealer Manager serves as the
Company's exclusive Dealer Manager in connection with a public offering (the
"Offering") of the Company's common stock. The shares of the Company's stock
(the "Offered Shares") are being issued and sold to the public on a "best
efforts" basis through the Dealer Manager and the broker-dealers and other
appropriately licensed firms participating in the Offering (the
"Participating Broker-Dealers"), pursuant to Participating Broker-Dealer
Agreements between the Dealer Manager and each Participating Broker-Dealer
(each, a "Participating Broker-Dealer Agreement"). The Dealer-Manager shall
provide to the Wholesaler the form of the Participating Broker-Dealer
Agreement used by the Dealer Manager. Capitalized terms used herein but not
otherwise defined shall have the respective meanings ascribed to them in the
Dealer Manager Agreement.

  



  

In consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements contained herein,
intending to be legally bound, the parties hereby agree to the following terms
and conditions set forth in this Wholesaling Agreement (this "Agreement"):

  



   | 1.| Appointment and Acceptance of the Wholesaler  
---|---|--- 
  



  

Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, the
Dealer Manager hereby appoints Realty Capital Securities, LLC, a Delaware
limited liability company (the "Wholesaler"), and the Wholesaler hereby
accepts such appointment, as the Dealer Manager's distribution agent to
assist, through the Wholesaler's employees, agents, contractors, registered
representatives and all other representatives who will perform services
hereunder (collectively, the "RCS Service Providers"), the Dealer Manager with
the sale of Offered Shares through the recruitment of, and the provision of
assistance to, Participating Broker-Dealers, and the Wholesaler desires to
accept such engagement; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing herein shall be
construed to: (i) contravene the Company's appointment of the Dealer Manager
as its exclusive agent and dealer manager during the Offering Period, and
the Dealer Manager's acceptance of such appointment, pursuant to _Section
3.1_ of the Dealer Manager Agreement; or (ii) imply that the Dealer Manager
shall not have sole discretion to accept or reject any subscription for the
Offered Shares in whole or in part.

  



   | 2.| Undertakings of the Wholesaler  
---|---|--- 
  



  

(a) The Wholesaler will use diligent efforts to recruit certain
broker-dealers and other appropriately licensed firms to serve as
Participating Broker-Dealers, each of which shall be a member of the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. ("FINRA") in good standing, to
agree to offer and sell the Offered Shares on a best efforts basis without any
commitment on the Participating Broker-Dealers' part to purchase any Offered
Shares pursuant to a Participating Broker-Dealer Agreement with the Dealer
Manager.

  



  

(b) The Wholesaler will use diligent efforts to assist the Dealer
Manager in providing certain services to Participating Broker-Dealers in
connection with the Offering, which will consist primarily of:

--- 

    



  

(i) providing training and education regarding the Company and the
offering of the Offered Shares to Participating Broker-Dealers;

  



  

(ii) providing marketing and sales support for Participating Broker-
Dealers,; and

  



  

(iii) such other assistance to Participating Broker-Dealers and their
registered representatives in marketing the Offered Shares and
otherwise participating in the Offering as shall be reasonably determined to
be appropriate by the Dealer Manager.

  



  

(c) The Wholesaler acknowledges that it is familiar with FINRA Rule
2310 and that it will comply in all material respects with all the terms
thereof to the extent FINRA Rule 2310 applies to the conduct contemplated
herein. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, the Wholesaler shall not be
responsible for the obligations of the Dealer Manager under the Dealer Manager
Agreement and _Section 6(i)_ to assure compliance with the organization and
offering expenses limitations of FINRA Rule 2310(b)(4).

  



   | 3.| Compensation and Expense Reimbursement  
---|---|--- 
  



  

(a) In consideration for the Wholesaler performing its obligations
under this Agreement, the Dealer Manager shall pay the Wholesaler a sourcing
fee (the "Sourcing Fee") equal to 1.80% of the Selling Price of each of the
Offered Shares sold by Participating Broker-Dealers who entered into dealer
agreements with the Dealer Manager primarily as a result of the efforts
of RCS Service Providers ("RCS Sales"); _provided_ , _however_ , the Sourcing
Fee shall be payable solely from that portion of the Dealer Manager Fee that
is (i) actually received by the Dealer Manager from the Company pursuant to
_Section 3,3_ of the Dealer Manager Agreement, and (ii) not reallowed to any
Participating Broker-Dealer pursuant to _Section 3.3_  of the Dealer Manager
Agreement (a "Sourcing Fee Reallowance") in respect of any RCS Sales.

  



  

(b) The Sourcing Fee shall be paid substantially concurrently with
the receipt of corresponding payments to the Dealer Manager from the Company
pursuant to _Section 3.3_ of the Dealer Manager Agreement, but in no event no
later than five business days thereafter.

  



  

(c) The Dealer Manager also will reimburse the Wholesaler for all
costs and expenses incurred that are: (i) in connection with _bona fide_ due
diligence activities; and (ii) incident to the Offering, but only to the
extent such costs or expenses (A) are permitted pursuant to prevailing rules
and regulations of FINRA, (B) would have been incurred by the Dealer Manager
if the Wholesaler had not incurred them, and (C) are otherwise eligible for
reimbursement from the Company pursuant to _Section 3.6_ of the
Dealer Manager Agreement. The Wholesaler will present the Dealer Manager with
itemized and detailed invoices for all incurred costs and expenses that are
reimbursable pursuant to this _Section 3(c)_. The Dealer Manager will submit
such request to the Company within five business days following receipt of
such invoices and will reimburse the Wholesaler within five business days
following receipt of funds from the Company for such reimbursement.

  



   | 4.| Representations and Warranties of the Dealer Manager  
---|---|---

(b) This Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered
by the Dealer Manager, constitutes a legal, valid and binding agreement of
the Dealer Manager, enforceable against the Dealer Manager in accordance with
its terms, except as enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,

hereunder and thereunder. With respect to its participation in the offer and
sale of the Offered Shares (including, without limitation any resales and

Governmental Licenses to be in full force and effect would not have a
material adverse effect on the business, properties, financial position,
results of operations or cash flows of the Dealer Manager or as otherwise may
be disclosed in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus. The
performance of the obligations of the Dealer Manager under this Agreement and
the Dealer Manager Agreement will not (A) violate or result in a breach of
any provisions of its articles of incorporation or by-laws (or similar
instruments or documents) or any order, law or regulation binding upon it,
and (B) result in a material breach of any provisions of any agreement or
instrument to which it is a party or which is otherwise binding upon it.

   | 8.| Indemnification; Contribution  
---|---|--- 
  



  

(a) The Dealer Manager will indemnify, defend (subject to _Section
4_ of the Dealer Manager Agreement) and hold harmless the Wholesaler, its
affiliates and their respective officers, directors, shareholders, members,
partners, other equity-holders and control persons (collectively, the "Other
Indemnified Parties"), from and against any losses, claims (including the
reasonable costs of investigation and legal fees), damages or liabilities (or
actions in respect thereof), to which the Wholesaler, its affiliates or their
respective Other Indemnified Parties may become subject under the Securities
Act or the Exchange Act, or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims,
damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are
based upon: (i) any inaccuracy in or breach of a representation or warranty
contained herein by the Dealer Manager, any breach of a covenant or agreement
contained herein of the Dealer Manager, or any failure by the Dealer Manager
to comply with state or federal securities law applicable to the Offering;
(ii) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact
contained in the information relating to the Dealer Manager that appears in
the Dealer Manager Sections of the Prospectus or any amendment thereof, or
arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state in
the Dealer Manager Sections a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading; and (iii) any unauthorized use of sales
materials or use of unauthorized verbal representations concerning the Offered
Shares by the Dealer Manager. The Dealer Manager will reimburse the
Wholesaler and its Other Indemnified Parties for any legal or other expenses
reasonably incurred by such Wholesaler, its affiliates and their respective
Other Indemnified Parties in connection with investigating or defending such
loss, claim, damage, liability or action.

  



  

(b) The Wholesaler will indemnify, defend and hold harmless the
Dealer Manager, the Company and their respective Other Indemnified
Parties, from and against any losses, claims (including the reasonable costs
of investigation and legal fees), damages or liabilities (or actions in
respect thereof), to which the Dealer Manager, the Company and any of their
respective Other Indemnified Parties may become subject under the Securities
Act or the Exchange Act, or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims
(including the reasonable costs of investigation and legal fees), damages or
liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based
upon: (i) any inaccuracy in or breach of a representation or warranty
contained herein by the Wholesaler, any breach of a covenant or agreement
contained herein of the Wholesaler, or any failure by the Wholesaler to comply
with state or federal securities laws applicable to the Offering; and (ii)
any unauthorized use of sales materials or use of unauthorized verbal
representations concerning the Shares by the Wholesaler.

  



  

(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party of notice of the
commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in
respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party, notify the
indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the failure so
to notify the indemnifying party (i) will not relieve it from liability under
this _Section 8_ unless and to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such
action and such failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying
party of substantial rights and defenses and (ii) will not, in any event,
relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified party
other than the indemnification obligation provided in this Agreement. The
indemnifying party shall be entitled to appoint counsel of the indemnifying
party's choice at the indemnifying party's expense to represent the
indemnified party in any action for which indemnification is sought (in which
case the indemnifying party shall not thereafter be responsible for the fees
and expenses of any separate counsel retained by the indemnified party or
parties except as set forth below); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that such
counsel shall be subject to approval by the indemnified party, not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed. Notwithstanding the indemnifying party's
election to appoint counsel to represent the indemnified party in an action,
the indemnified party shall have the right to employ and select separate
counsel (including local counsel), subject to approval by the indemnifying
party not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed, and the indemnifying party
shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel
if (i) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the
indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest,
(ii) the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, any such action
include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the
indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal
defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different
from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, (iii) the
indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel for the indemnified
party (subject to approval by the indemnified party not to be unreasonably
withheld

--- 

    



  

or delayed) to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after
notice of the institution of such action or (iv) the indemnifying party shall
authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of
the indemnifying party. An indemnifying party may settle or compromise or
consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or
threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which
indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder but may not do so
without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, unless such
settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of each
indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit
or proceeding.

  



  

(d) If the right to indemnification provided for in this _Section 8_
would by its terms be available to a person hereunder, but is held to be
unavailable by a court of competent jurisdiction for any reason, then each
indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate amount paid or payable
by such indemnified party as a result of such Losses and expenses in respect
thereof, as incurred, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the
relative fault of the Dealer Manager and the Wholesaler, as applicable,
in connection with the statements, omissions or other circumstances which
resulted in such Losses or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable
considerations. The relative fault of the Dealer Manager and the Wholesaler,
as applicable, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, the
parties' relative intent, knowledge, and access to information. It is
understood that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant
to this _Section 8(d_ ) were determined by pro rata allocation or by any
other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable
considerations referred to above in this _Section 8(d)_. Notwithstanding the
provisions of this _Section 8(d)_ , the Dealer Manager shall not be required
to contribute any amount in excess of the total price of the Offering Shares
sold by it. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the
meaning of _Section 11(f)_ of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to
contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent
misrepresentation. For purposes of this _Section 8(d)_ , each Other
Indemnified Party affiliate of the Dealer Manager shall have the same rights
to contribution as the Dealer Manager and each Other Indemnified Party of the
Wholesaler shall have the same rights to contribution as the Wholesaler.

  



   | 9.| Relationship of Wholesaler, Participating Broker-Dealers and the
Dealer Manager  
---|---|--- 
  



  

(a) The obligations of each of the Wholesaler and the Participating
Broker-Dealers are several and not joint. Nothing herein contained shall
constitute the Wholesaler and the Participating Broker-Dealers, or any of
them, as an association, partnership, unincorporated business or other
separate entity. The Dealer Manager and the Company shall be under no
liability to the Wholesaler except for lack of good faith and for obligations
expressly assumed by the Dealer Manager and the Company in this Agreement.

  



  

(b) The parties hereto acknowledge that, other than as expressly set
forth herein, the Wholesaler is not authorized to act as agent of the Dealer
Manager or the Company in any connection or transaction, and the Wholesaler
agrees that it will not so act or purport to so act.

  



  

(c) The parties hereto acknowledge that the Wholesaler's obligations
under this Agreement, including without limitation the Wholesaler Exclusivity
have no impact on, and in no way release the Dealer Manager from, the Dealer
Manager's obligations and rights to act as the dealer manager for the Company
pursuant to _Section 3.1_ of the Dealer Manager Agreement.

  



   | 10.| Termination  
---|---|--- 
  



  

This Agreement shall terminate upon the earlier to occur of (i) termination
of the Offering, (ii) the Second Closing (as defined in the Equity Purchase
Agreement (the "Equity Purchase Agreement"), dated as of September 30, 2014,
by and between ARC Properties Operating Partnership, L.P. and RCS Capital
Corporation), (iii) termination of the Equity Purchase Agreement or (iv)
December 31, 2014.

  



  

(a) Wholesaler may terminate this Agreement at any time by giving
ten days' prior written notice thereof to the other parties hereto.
This Agreement automatically shall terminate with no further action by any
party hereto if the

--- 

 


--- 

    



  

Wholesaler or the Dealer Manager ceases to be a member in good standing of
FINRA, or with the securities commission of the state in which its principal
office is located. The Wholesaler will notify the Dealer Manager immediately
if the Wholesaler ceases to be a member in good standing of FINRA or with the
securities commission of any state in which the Wholesaler is currently
registered or licensed. The Dealer Manager will notify the Wholesaler
immediately if the Dealer Manager ceases to be a member in good standing of
FINRA or with the securities commission of any state in which the Dealer
Manager is currently registered or licensed.

  



  

(b) In the event of termination under _Section 11(b)_ , the Dealer
Manager will continue to pay any Sourcing Fees with respect to RCS Sales to
the Wholesaler and reimburse costs and expenses incurred, to the extent
reimbursable under _Section 3(c)_ , for so long as Offered Shares remain
outstanding (it being understood and agreed that the calculation of the
Sourcing Fees in such event shall take into account the number of Offered
Shares sold primarily from the efforts of RCS Service Providers in the
Offering). Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, the Dealer Manager will
not continue to pay the Sourcing Fee to the Wholesaler and reimburse costs
and expenses related to the Offering incurred by the Wholesaler pursuant to
_Section 3(c)_ subsequent to the termination of the Offering to the extent,
but only to the extent, that such payments or reimbursements would cause the
total underwriting compensation (as defined in accordance with applicable
FINRA rules) paid with respect to the Offering to exceed 10% of the
gross proceeds from the sale of the Offered Shares calculated as of the
termination of the Offering.

  



  

(c) The termination of this Agreement for any reason shall not
affect (i) the Wholesaler's obligations under the second sentence of _Section
10(a)_ , (ii) the indemnification obligations under _Section 8_ , or (iii)
this _Section 10_. Without limiting the foregoing, the provisions of this
Agreement shall survive the termination of this Agreement with respect to any
matter arising while this Agreement was in effect.

from the other parties hereto which shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed, to amend this Agreement as necessary, in the reasonable opinion of

requirements of any governmental or self-regulatory body or agency.

  



  

(b) This Agreement may not otherwise be amended, supplemented or
waived except by the express written consent of the parties hereto. No waiver
of any provision of this Agreement may be implied from any course of dealing

hereto to assert its rights under this Agreement on any occasion or series of
occasions.

Realty Capital Securities, LLC

  

One Beacon Street 
 14th Floor 
 Boston, MA 02108

  



  

Ladies and Gentlemen:

  



  

Cole Capital Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Dealer Manager"), with
its address at 2325 East Camelback Road, Suite 1100, Phoenix, AZ 85016, has
entered into an agreement dated as of January 26, 2012 (the "Dealer Manager
Agreement"), with Cole Credit Property Trust IV, Inc. (the "Company"). Under
the Dealer Manager Agreement, the Dealer Manager serves as the
Company's exclusive Dealer Manager in connection with a public offering (the
"Offering") of the Company's common stock. The shares of the Company's stock
(the "Offered Shares") are being issued and sold to the public on a "best
efforts" basis through the Dealer Manager and the broker-dealers and other
appropriately licensed firms participating in the Offering (the
"Participating Broker-Dealers"), pursuant to Participating Broker-Dealer
Agreements between the Dealer Manager and each Participating Broker-Dealer
(each, a "Participating Broker-Dealer Agreement"). The Dealer-Manager shall
provide to the Wholesaler the form of the Participating Broker-Dealer
Agreement used by the Dealer Manager. Capitalized terms used herein but not
otherwise defined shall have the respective meanings ascribed to them in the
Dealer Manager Agreement.

  



  

In consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements contained herein,
intending to be legally bound, the parties hereby agree to the following terms
and conditions set forth in this Wholesaling Agreement (this "Agreement"):

  



   | 1.| Appointment and Acceptance of the Wholesaler  
---|---|--- 
  



  

Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, the
Dealer Manager hereby appoints Realty Capital Securities, LLC, a Delaware
limited liability company (the "Wholesaler"), and the Wholesaler hereby
accepts such appointment, as the Dealer Manager's distribution agent to
assist, through the Wholesaler's employees, agents, contractors, registered
representatives and all other representatives who will perform services
hereunder (collectively, the "RCS Service Providers"), the Dealer Manager with
the sale of Offered Shares through the recruitment of, and the provision of
assistance to, Participating Broker-Dealers, and the Wholesaler desires to
accept such engagement; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing herein shall be
construed to: (i) contravene the Company's appointment of the Dealer Manager
as its exclusive agent and dealer manager during the Offering Period, and
the Dealer Manager's acceptance of such appointment, pursuant to _Section
3.1_ of the Dealer Manager Agreement; or (ii) imply that the Dealer Manager
shall not have sole discretion to accept or reject any subscription for the
Offered Shares in whole or in part.

  



   | 2.| Undertakings of the Wholesaler  
---|---|--- 
  



  

(a) The Wholesaler will use diligent efforts to recruit certain
broker-dealers and other appropriately licensed firms to serve as
Participating Broker-Dealers, each of which shall be a member of the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. ("FINRA") in good standing, to
agree to offer and sell the Offered Shares on a best efforts basis without any
commitment on the Participating Broker-Dealers' part to purchase any Offered
Shares pursuant to a Participating Broker-Dealer Agreement with the Dealer
Manager.

  



  

(b) The Wholesaler will use diligent efforts to assist the Dealer
Manager in providing certain services to Participating Broker-Dealers in
connection with the Offering, which will consist primarily of:

(i) providing training and education regarding the Company and the
offering of the Offered Shares to Participating Broker-Dealers;

  



  

(ii) providing marketing and sales support for Participating Broker-
Dealers,; and

  



  

(iii) such other assistance to Participating Broker-Dealers and their
registered representatives in marketing the Offered Shares and
otherwise participating in the Offering as shall be reasonably determined to
be appropriate by the Dealer Manager.

  



  

(c) The Wholesaler acknowledges that it is familiar with FINRA Rule
2310 and that it will comply in all material respects with all the terms
thereof to the extent FINRA Rule 2310 applies to the conduct contemplated
herein. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, the Wholesaler shall not be
responsible for the obligations of the Dealer Manager under the Dealer Manager
Agreement and _Section 6(i)_ to assure compliance with the organization and
offering expenses limitations of FINRA Rule 2310(b)(4).

  



   | 3.| Compensation and Expense Reimbursement  
---|---|--- 
  



  

(a) In consideration for the Wholesaler performing its obligations
under this Agreement, the Dealer Manager shall pay the Wholesaler a sourcing
fee (the "Sourcing Fee") equal to 1.80% of the Selling Price of each of the
Offered Shares sold by Participating Broker-Dealers who entered into dealer
agreements with the Dealer Manager primarily as a result of the efforts
of RCS Service Providers ("RCS Sales"); _provided_ , _however_ , the Sourcing
Fee shall be payable solely from that portion of the Dealer Manager Fee that
is (i) actually received by the Dealer Manager from the Company pursuant to
_Section 3,3_ of the Dealer Manager Agreement, and (ii) not reallowed to any
Participating Broker-Dealer pursuant to _Section 3.3_  of the Dealer Manager
Agreement (a "Sourcing Fee Reallowance") in respect of any RCS Sales.

  



  

(b) The Sourcing Fee shall be paid substantially concurrently with
the receipt of corresponding payments to the Dealer Manager from the Company
pursuant to _Section 3.3_ of the Dealer Manager Agreement, but in no event no
later than five business days thereafter.

  



  

(c) The Dealer Manager also will reimburse the Wholesaler for all
costs and expenses incurred that are: (i) in connection with _bona fide_ due
diligence activities; and (ii) incident to the Offering, but only to the
extent such costs or expenses (A) are permitted pursuant to prevailing rules
and regulations of FINRA, (B) would have been incurred by the Dealer Manager
if the Wholesaler had not incurred them, and (C) are otherwise eligible for
reimbursement from the Company pursuant to _Section 3.6_ of the
Dealer Manager Agreement. The Wholesaler will present the Dealer Manager with
itemized and detailed invoices for all incurred costs and expenses that are
reimbursable pursuant to this _Section 3(c)_. The Dealer Manager will submit
such request to the Company within five business days following receipt of
such invoices and will reimburse the Wholesaler within five business days
following receipt of funds from the Company for such reimbursement.

  



   | 4.| Representations and Warranties of the Dealer Manager  
---|---|--- 
  



  

(a) The Dealer Manager is a corporation duly organized and validly
existing under the laws of the State of Delaware, with full power
and authority to conduct its business and to enter into this Agreement and to
perform the transactions contemplated hereby.

  



  

(b) This Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered
by the Dealer Manager, constitutes a legal, valid and binding agreement of
the Dealer Manager, enforceable against the Dealer Manager in accordance with
its terms, except as enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,

to carry out the services related to the Offering as contemplated by this

hereunder and thereunder. With respect to its participation in the offer and
sale of the Offered Shares (including, without limitation any resales and

respects with all applicable requirements of (1) the Securities Act of 1933,
as amended (the "Securities Act"), and the applicable rules and regulations

Governmental Licenses and have made all filings and registrations
with federal and state governmental and regulatory agencies required to

and the Dealer Manager Agreement, except where the inability of such
Governmental Licenses to be in full force and effect would not have a
material adverse effect on the business, properties, financial position,
results of operations or cash flows of the Dealer Manager or as otherwise may
be disclosed in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus. The
performance of the obligations of the Dealer Manager under this Agreement and
the Dealer Manager Agreement will not (A) violate or result in a breach of
any provisions of its articles of incorporation or by-laws (or similar
instruments or documents) or any order, law or regulation binding upon it,

instrument to which it is a party or which is otherwise binding upon it.

by the Dealer Manager and the Company; and (iv) the Wholesaler's own
internal privacy policies and procedures, each as may be amended from time to
time.

  



  

(c) To the extent the Wholesaler directly sells Offered Shares in
connection with the performance of its obligations hereunder, the
Wholesaler will only offer and sell Offered Shares in Qualified
Jurisdictions. No Offered Shares shall be offered or sold for the account of
the Company in any other states or foreign jurisdictions.

  



  

(d) The Wholesaler is familiar with Rule 15c2-8 under the Exchange
Act, relating to the distribution of preliminary and final Prospectuses, and
confirms that it will, to the extent applicable to the Wholesaler in
connection with the performance of its obligations hereunder, comply with
Rule 15c2-8 under the Exchange Act.

  



  

(e) The Dealer Manager will provide the Wholesaler with certain
Authorized Sales Materials to be used by the Wholesaler and the
Participating Broker-Dealers in connection with the Offering. If the
Wholesaler elects to use such Authorized Sales Materials in connection
with the performance of its obligations hereunder, then the Wholesaler agrees
that such material shall not be used by it in connection with the Offering
and that it will direct Participating Broker-Dealers not to make such use of
any Authorized Sales Materials unless accompanied or preceded by the
Prospectus. If the Wholesaler elects to use such Authorized Sales Materials in
connection with the performance of its obligations hereunder, the Wholesaler
will only use Authorized Sales Materials provided by the Dealer Manager. The
Wholesaler shall not give or provide any information or make any
representation other than those contained in the Prospectus or the Authorized
Sales Materials. The Wholesaler will not use any "broker-dealer use only"
Authorized Sales Materials with members of the public in connection with
offers or sales or the Offered Shares.

  



  

(f) The Wholesaler will suspend or terminate the offering and sale
of the Offered Shares by the Wholesaler upon request of the Company at any
time and resume offering and sale of the Offered Shares upon subsequent
request of the Company if required to do so in connection with the
performance of its obligations hereunder.

  



  

(g) The Wholesaler will provide to the Company and the Dealer
Manager as soon as practicable upon receipt by the Wholesaler copies of
any written or otherwise documented customer complaints received by the
Wholesaler from Participating Broker-Dealers relating in any way to the
Offering (including, but not limited to, the manner in which the Offered
Shares are offered by any Participating Broker-Dealer), the Offered Shares or
the Company.

  



  

(h) Other than with respect to use of Authorized Sales Materials or
the Prospectus or otherwise pursuant to or in connection with this
Agreement, the Wholesaler will not, without the Company's prior written
consent, make a source-identifying use of (i) the Company's name, brand, logo
or trademark or any reasonably similar variant or derivative thereof or (ii)
the " Cole " name, brand, logo or trademark or any reasonably similar
variant or derivative thereof.

  



  

(i) The Wholesaler shall under no circumstances engage in any
activities hereunder in any jurisdiction (i) in which the Dealer Manager has
not informed the Wholesaler that counsel's advice has been received that the
Offered Shares are qualified for sale or are exempt under the applicable
securities or Blue Sky laws thereof, or (ii) in which the Wholesaler may not
lawfully engage.

  



  

(j) The Wholesaler shall comply, in all material respects, with all
applicable laws, and the applicable rules and regulations of FINRA, the SEC,
state securities administrators and any other applicable regulatory body in
connection with the Offering.

   | 8.| Indemnification; Contribution  
---|---|--- 
  



  

(a) The Dealer Manager will indemnify, defend (subject to _Section
4_ of the Dealer Manager Agreement) and hold harmless the Wholesaler, its
affiliates and their respective officers, directors, shareholders, members,
partners, other equity-holders and control persons (collectively, the "Other
Indemnified Parties"), from and against any losses, claims (including the
reasonable costs of investigation and legal fees), damages or liabilities (or
actions in respect thereof), to which the Wholesaler, its affiliates or their
respective Other Indemnified Parties may become subject under the Securities
Act or the Exchange Act, or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims,
damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are
based upon: (i) any inaccuracy in or breach of a representation or warranty
contained herein by the Dealer Manager, any breach of a covenant or agreement
contained herein of the Dealer Manager, or any failure by the Dealer Manager
to comply with state or federal securities law applicable to the Offering;
(ii) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact
contained in the information relating to the Dealer Manager that appears in
the Dealer Manager Sections of the Prospectus or any amendment thereof, or
arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state in
the Dealer Manager Sections a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading; and (iii) any unauthorized use of sales
materials or use of unauthorized verbal representations concerning the Offered
Shares by the Dealer Manager. The Dealer Manager will reimburse the
Wholesaler and its Other Indemnified Parties for any legal or other expenses
reasonably incurred by such Wholesaler, its affiliates and their respective
Other Indemnified Parties in connection with investigating or defending such
loss, claim, damage, liability or action.

  



  

(b) The Wholesaler will indemnify, defend and hold harmless the
Dealer Manager, the Company and their respective Other Indemnified
Parties, from and against any losses, claims (including the reasonable costs
of investigation and legal fees), damages or liabilities (or actions in
respect thereof), to which the Dealer Manager, the Company and any of their
respective Other Indemnified Parties may become subject under the Securities
Act or the Exchange Act, or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims
(including the reasonable costs of investigation and legal fees), damages or
liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based
upon: (i) any inaccuracy in or breach of a representation or warranty
contained herein by the Wholesaler, any breach of a covenant or agreement
contained herein of the Wholesaler, or any failure by the Wholesaler to comply
with state or federal securities laws applicable to the Offering; and (ii)
any unauthorized use of sales materials or use of unauthorized verbal
representations concerning the Shares by the Wholesaler.

  



  

(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party of notice of the
commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in
respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party, notify the
indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the failure so
to notify the indemnifying party (i) will not relieve it from liability under
this _Section 8_ unless and to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such
action and such failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying
party of substantial rights and defenses and (ii) will not, in any event,
relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified party
other than the indemnification obligation provided in this Agreement. The
indemnifying party shall be entitled to appoint counsel of the indemnifying
party's choice at the indemnifying party's expense to represent the
indemnified party in any action for which indemnification is sought (in which
case the indemnifying party shall not thereafter be responsible for the fees
and expenses of any separate counsel retained by the indemnified party or
parties except as set forth below); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that such
counsel shall be subject to approval by the indemnified party, not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed. Notwithstanding the indemnifying party's
election to appoint counsel to represent the indemnified party in an action,
the indemnified party shall have the right to employ and select separate
counsel (including local counsel), subject to approval by the indemnifying
party not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed, and the indemnifying party
shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel
if (i) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the
indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest,
(ii) the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, any such action
include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the
indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal
defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different
from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, (iii) the
indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel for the indemnified
party (subject to approval by the indemnified party not to be unreasonably
withheld

  



  

   

7 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

or delayed) to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after
notice of the institution of such action or (iv) the indemnifying party shall
authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of
the indemnifying party. An indemnifying party may settle or compromise or
consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or
threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which
indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder but may not do so
without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, unless such
settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of each
indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit
or proceeding.

  



  

(d) If the right to indemnification provided for in this _Section 8_
would by its terms be available to a person hereunder, but is held to be
unavailable by a court of competent jurisdiction for any reason, then each
indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate amount paid or payable
by such indemnified party as a result of such Losses and expenses in respect
thereof, as incurred, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the
relative fault of the Dealer Manager and the Wholesaler, as applicable,
in connection with the statements, omissions or other circumstances which
resulted in such Losses or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable
considerations. The relative fault of the Dealer Manager and the Wholesaler,
as applicable, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, the
parties' relative intent, knowledge, and access to information. It is
understood that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant
to this _Section 8(d_ ) were determined by pro rata allocation or by any
other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable
considerations referred to above in this _Section 8(d)_. Notwithstanding the
provisions of this _Section 8(d)_ , the Dealer Manager shall not be required
to contribute any amount in excess of the total price of the Offering Shares
sold by it. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the
meaning of _Section 11(f)_ of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to
contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent
misrepresentation. For purposes of this _Section 8(d)_ , each Other
Indemnified Party affiliate of the Dealer Manager shall have the same rights
to contribution as the Dealer Manager and each Other Indemnified Party of the
Wholesaler shall have the same rights to contribution as the Wholesaler.

  



   | 9.| Relationship of Wholesaler, Participating Broker-Dealers and the
Dealer Manager  
---|---|--- 
  



  

(a) The obligations of each of the Wholesaler and the Participating
Broker-Dealers are several and not joint. Nothing herein contained shall
constitute the Wholesaler and the Participating Broker-Dealers, or any of
them, as an association, partnership, unincorporated business or other
separate entity. The Dealer Manager and the Company shall be under no
liability to the Wholesaler except for lack of good faith and for obligations
expressly assumed by the Dealer Manager and the Company in this Agreement.

  



  

(b) The parties hereto acknowledge that, other than as expressly set
forth herein, the Wholesaler is not authorized to act as agent of the Dealer
Manager or the Company in any connection or transaction, and the Wholesaler
agrees that it will not so act or purport to so act.

  



  

(c) The parties hereto acknowledge that the Wholesaler's obligations
under this Agreement, including without limitation the Wholesaler Exclusivity
have no impact on, and in no way release the Dealer Manager from, the Dealer
Manager's obligations and rights to act as the dealer manager for the Company
pursuant to _Section 3.1_ of the Dealer Manager Agreement.

  



   | 10.| Termination  
---|---|--- 
  



  

(a) This Agreement shall terminate upon the earlier to occur of (i)
termination of the Offering, (ii) the Second Closing (as defined in the
Equity Purchase Agreement (the "Equity Purchase Agreement"), dated as of
September 30, 2014, by and between ARC Properties Operating Partnership, L.P.
and RCS Capital Corporation), (iii) termination of the Equity Purchase
Agreement or (iv) December 31, 2014.

  



  

(b) Wholesaler may terminate this Agreement at any time by giving
ten days' prior written notice thereof to the other parties hereto.
This Agreement automatically shall terminate with no further action by any
party hereto if the

  



  

   

8 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

Wholesaler or the Dealer Manager ceases to be a member in good standing of
FINRA, or with the securities commission of the state in which its principal
office is located. The Wholesaler will notify the Dealer Manager immediately
if the Wholesaler ceases to be a member in good standing of FINRA or with the
securities commission of any state in which the Wholesaler is currently
registered or licensed. The Dealer Manager will notify the Wholesaler
immediately if the Dealer Manager ceases to be a member in good standing of
FINRA or with the securities commission of any state in which the Dealer
Manager is currently registered or licensed.

  



  

(c) In the event of termination under _Section 11(b)_ , the Dealer
Manager will continue to pay any Sourcing Fees with respect to RCS Sales to
the Wholesaler and reimburse costs and expenses incurred, to the extent
reimbursable under _Section 3(c)_ , for so long as Offered Shares remain
outstanding (it being understood and agreed that the calculation of the
Sourcing Fees in such event shall take into account the number of Offered
Shares sold primarily from the efforts of RCS Service Providers in the
Offering). Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, the Dealer Manager will
not continue to pay the Sourcing Fee to the Wholesaler and reimburse costs
and expenses related to the Offering incurred by the Wholesaler pursuant to
_Section 3(c)_ subsequent to the termination of the Offering to the extent,
but only to the extent, that such payments or reimbursements would cause the
total underwriting compensation (as defined in accordance with applicable
FINRA rules) paid with respect to the Offering to exceed 10% of the
gross proceeds from the sale of the Offered Shares calculated as of the
termination of the Offering.

  



  

(d) The termination of this Agreement for any reason shall not
affect (i) the Wholesaler's obligations under the second sentence of _Section
10(a)_ , (ii) the indemnification obligations under _Section 8_ , or (iii)
this _Section 10_. Without limiting the foregoing, the provisions of this
Agreement shall survive the termination of this Agreement with respect to any
matter arising while this Agreement was in effect.

  



   | 11.| Amendment  
---|---|--- 
  



  

(a) The Dealer Manager has the right, subject to written consent
from the other parties hereto which shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed, to amend this Agreement as necessary, in the reasonable opinion of
outside counsel to the Dealer Manager, to comply with applicable law or the
requirements of any governmental or self-regulatory body or agency.

  



  

(b) This Agreement may not otherwise be amended, supplemented or
waived except by the express written consent of the parties hereto. No waiver
of any provision of this Agreement may be implied from any course of dealing
between or among any of the parties hereto or from any failure by any party
hereto to assert its rights under this Agreement on any occasion or series of
occasions.

  



   | 12.| Miscellaneous

consent of the other parties. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure
to the benefit of the respective successors and permitted assigns of the
parties hereto.

  



  

(b) All notices, requests, demands, approvals, consents, waivers and
other communications required or permitted to be given under this Agreement
(each, a "Notice") shall be in writing and shall be (i) delivered personally,

 _WHOLESALING AGREEMENT_

  



  

[ ], 2014

  

Realty Capital Securities, LLC

  

One Beacon Street 
 14th Floor 
 Boston, MA 02108

  



  

Ladies and Gentlemen:

  



  

Cole Capital Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Dealer Manager"), with
its address at 2325 East Camelback Road, Suite 1100, Phoenix, AZ 85016, has
entered into an agreement dated as of March 17, 2014 (the "Dealer Manager
Agreement"), with Cole Credit Property Trust V, INC. (the "Company"). Under
the Dealer Manager Agreement, the Dealer Manager serves as the
Company's exclusive Dealer Manager in connection with a public offering (the
"Offering") of the Company's common stock. The shares of the Company's stock
(the "Offered Shares") are being issued and sold to the public on a "best
efforts" basis through the Dealer Manager and the broker-dealers and other
appropriately licensed firms participating in the Offering (the
"Participating Broker-Dealers"), pursuant to Participating Broker-Dealer
Agreements between the Dealer Manager and each Participating Broker-Dealer
(each, a "Participating Broker-Dealer Agreement"). The Dealer-Manager shall
provide to the Wholesaler the form of the Participating Broker-Dealer
Agreement used by the Dealer Manager. Capitalized terms used herein but not
otherwise defined shall have the respective meanings ascribed to them in the
Dealer Manager Agreement.

  



  

In consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements contained herein,
intending to be legally bound, the parties hereby agree to the following terms
and conditions set forth in this Wholesaling Agreement (this "Agreement"):

  



   | 1.| Appointment and Acceptance of the Wholesaler  
---|---|--- 
  



  

Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, the
Dealer Manager hereby appoints Realty Capital Securities, LLC, a Delaware
limited liability company (the "Wholesaler"), and the Wholesaler hereby
accepts such appointment, as the Dealer Manager's distribution agent to
assist, through the Wholesaler's employees, agents, contractors, registered
representatives and all other representatives who will perform services
hereunder (collectively, the "RCAP Service Providers"), the Dealer Manager
with the sale of Offered Shares through the recruitment of, and the provision
of assistance to, Participating Broker-Dealers, and the Wholesaler desires to
accept such engagement; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing herein shall be
construed to: (i) contravene the Company's appointment of the Dealer Manager
as its exclusive agent and dealer manager during the Offering Period, and
the Dealer Manager's acceptance of such appointment, pursuant to _Section
3.1_ of the Dealer Manager Agreement; or (ii) imply that the Dealer Manager
shall not have sole discretion to accept or reject any subscription for the
Offered Shares in whole or in part.

  



   | 2.| Undertakings of the Wholesaler  
---|---|--- 
  



  

(a) The Wholesaler will use diligent efforts to recruit certain
broker-dealers and other appropriately licensed firms to serve as
Participating Broker-Dealers, each of which shall be a member of the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. ("FINRA") in good standing, to
agree to offer and sell the Offered Shares on a best efforts basis without any
commitment on the Participating Broker-Dealers' part to purchase any Offered
Shares pursuant to a Participating Broker-Dealer Agreement with the Dealer
Manager.

  



  

(b) The Wholesaler will use diligent efforts to assist the Dealer
Manager in providing certain services to Participating Broker-Dealers in
connection with the Offering, which will consist primarily of:

  



  

   


--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(i) providing training and education regarding the Company and the
offering of the Offered Shares to Participating Broker-Dealers;

  



  

(ii) providing marketing and sales support for Participating Broker-
Dealers,; and

  



  

(iii) such other assistance to Participating Broker-Dealers and their
registered representatives in marketing the Offered Shares and
otherwise participating in the Offering as shall be reasonably determined to
be appropriate by the Dealer Manager.

  



  

(c) The Wholesaler acknowledges that it is familiar with FINRA Rule
2310 and that it will comply in all material respects with all the terms
thereof to the extent FINRA Rule 2310 applies to the conduct contemplated
herein. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, the Wholesaler shall not be
responsible for the obligations of the Dealer Manager under the Dealer Manager
Agreement and _Section 6(i)_ to assure compliance with the organization and
offering expenses limitations of FINRA Rule 2310(b)(4).

  



   | 3.| Compensation and Expense Reimbursement  
---|---|--- 
  



  

(a) In consideration for the Wholesaler performing its obligations
under this Agreement, the Dealer Manager shall pay the Wholesaler a sourcing
fee (the "Sourcing Fee") equal to 1.80% of the Selling Price of each of the
Offered Shares sold by Participating Broker-Dealers who entered into dealer
agreements with the Dealer Manager primarily as a result of the efforts
of RCAP Service Providers ("RCAP Sales"); _provided_ , _however_ , the
Sourcing Fee shall be payable solely from that portion of the Dealer Manager
Fee that is (i) actually received by the Dealer Manager from the Company
pursuant to _Section 3,3_ of the Dealer Manager Agreement, and (ii) not
reallowed to any Participating Broker-Dealer pursuant to _Section 3.3_  of
the Dealer Manager Agreement (a "Sourcing Fee Reallowance") in respect of any
RCAP Sales.

  



  

(b) The Sourcing Fee shall be paid substantially concurrently with
the receipt of corresponding payments to the Dealer Manager from the Company
pursuant to _Section 3.3_ of the Dealer Manager Agreement, but in no event no
later than five business days thereafter.

  



  

(c) The Dealer Manager also will reimburse the Wholesaler for all
costs and expenses incurred that are: (i) in connection with _bona fide_ due
diligence activities; and (ii) incident to the Offering, but only to the
extent such costs or expenses (A) are permitted pursuant to prevailing rules
and regulations of FINRA, (B) would have been incurred by the Dealer Manager
if the Wholesaler had not incurred them, and (C) are otherwise eligible for
reimbursement from the Company pursuant to _Section 3.6_ of the
Dealer Manager Agreement. The Wholesaler will present the Dealer Manager with
itemized and detailed invoices for all incurred costs and expenses that are
reimbursable pursuant to this _Section 3(c)_. The Dealer Manager will submit
such request to the Company within five business days following receipt of
such invoices and will reimburse the Wholesaler within five business days
following receipt of funds from the Company for such reimbursement.

  



   | 4.| Representations and Warranties of the Dealer Manager  
---|---|--- 
  



  

(a) The Dealer Manager is a corporation duly organized and validly
existing under the laws of the State of Delaware, with full power
and authority to conduct its business and to enter into this Agreement and to
perform the transactions contemplated hereby.

  



  

(b) This Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered
by the Dealer Manager, constitutes a legal, valid and binding agreement of
the Dealer Manager, enforceable against the Dealer Manager in accordance with
its terms, except as enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting creditors' rights
generally and by general equitable principles relating to the availability of
remedies, and except

  



  

   

2 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

to the extent that the enforceability of the indemnity provisions contained
in this Agreement may be limited under applicable securities laws.

  



  

(c) The Dealer Manager (A) is duly registered as a broker-dealer
pursuant to the provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
(the "Exchange Act"), (B) is a member of FINRA in good standing, (C) is a
broker or dealer registered as such in those states and jurisdictions where
the Dealer Manager is required to be registered in order to provide the
services contemplated by this Agreement and the Dealer Manager Agreement, and
(D) it and those of its employees and representatives who are required to
have approvals, licenses or registrations to act under this Agreement have all
applicable required approvals, licenses and registrations to act under this
Agreement. There is no provision in the Dealer Manager's FINRA membership
agreement that would prohibit or restrict the ability of the Dealer Manager
to carry out the services related to the Offering as contemplated by this
Agreement and the Dealer Manager Agreement or to perform its obligations
hereunder and thereunder. With respect to its participation in the offer and
sale of the Offered Shares (including, without limitation any resales and
transfers of Offered Shares), the Dealer Manager shall comply in all material
respects with all applicable requirements of (1) the Securities Act of 1933,
as amended (the "Securities Act"), and the applicable rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder (the "Securities Act Regulations"), the Exchange Act
and the applicable rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the
"Exchange Act Regulations") and all other federal rules and regulations
applicable to the Offering and the sale of the Offered Shares, (2) applicable
state securities or "blue sky" laws, and (3) the rules set forth in the FINRA
rulebook applicable to the Offering, which currently consists of rules
promulgated by FINRA, the National Association of Securities Dealers
("NASD") and the New York Stock Exchange (collectively, the "FINRA Rules"),
specifically including, but not in any way limited to, FINRA Rule 2310, FINRA
Rule 5110, FINRA Rule 5141, NASD Rule 2340 and NASD Rule 2420.

  



  

(d) The Dealer Manager and its representatives have all required
Governmental Licenses and have made all filings and registrations
with federal and state governmental and regulatory agencies required to
conduct their business and to perform their obligations under this Agreement
and the Dealer Manager Agreement, except where the inability of such
Governmental Licenses to be in full force and effect would not have a
material adverse effect on the business, properties, financial position,
results of operations or cash flows of the Dealer Manager or as otherwise may
be disclosed in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus. The
performance of the obligations of the Dealer Manager under this Agreement and
the Dealer Manager Agreement will not (A) violate or result in a breach of
any provisions of its articles of incorporation or by-laws (or similar
instruments or documents) or any order, law or regulation binding upon it,
and (B) result in a material breach of any provisions of any agreement or
instrument to which it is a party or which is otherwise binding upon it.

---|---|--- 
  



  

The Wholesaler represents and warrants to the Dealer Manager:

validly existing under the laws of the State of Delaware, with full power and
authority to conduct its business and to enter into this Agreement and to
perform the transactions contemplated hereby.

  



  

(b) This Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered
by the Wholesaler and, assuming due authorization, execution and delivery of
this Agreement by the Dealer Manager, constitutes a legal, valid and binding
agreement of the Wholesaler, enforceable against the Wholesaler in accordance
with its terms, except as enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting creditors'
rights generally and by general equitable principles relating to the

(iv) it and those of its employees and representatives who are required to
have approvals, licenses or registrations to act under this Agreement have all
applicable required approvals, licenses and registrations to act under this

participation in the offer and sale of the Offered Shares (including, without

incorporation or by-laws (or similar instruments or documents) or any
agreement, instrument, order, law or regulation binding upon it.

  



  

(e) To the extent required by applicable law in connection with the
transactions contemplated in this Agreement, the Wholesaler represents that

("AML Program") in accordance with applicable law, including applicable FINRA
Rules, Exchange Act Regulations, the USA PATRIOT Act and implementing
regulations, specifically including, but not limited to, _Section 352_ of the
International Money Laundering Abatement and Anti-Terrorist Financing Act of
2001 (the "Money Laundering Abatement Act," and together with the USA PATRIOT
Act, the "AML Rules") reasonably expected to detect and cause the reporting
of suspicious transactions in connection with the offering and sale of the
Offered Shares. The Wholesaler further represents that it is currently in
compliance with all AML Rules, specifically including, but not limited to,
the Customer Identification Program requirements under _Section 326_ of the
Money Laundering Abatement Act; has Know Your Customer (KYC) policies and
procedures in place; that the AML Program has been adopted by a person with
sufficient authority to oversee the AML policies and procedures; that the AML
Program has education and/or training programs for officers and employees
regarding AML policies and procedures; and that the Wholesaler will remain in
compliance with such requirements. The Wholesaler shall, upon request by the
Dealer Manager or the Company, provide a certification that, as of the date of
such certification, (i) its AML Program then in effect is consistent with the
AML Rules and (ii) it is currently in compliance with its AML Program and all
AML Rules, specifically including, but not limited to, the Customer
Identification Program requirements under _Section 326_ of the Money
Laundering Abatement Act.

   | 8.| Indemnification; Contribution  
---|---|--- 
  



  

(a) The Dealer Manager will indemnify, defend (subject to _Section
4_ of the Dealer Manager Agreement) and hold harmless the Wholesaler, its
affiliates and their respective officers, directors, shareholders, members,
partners, other equity-holders and control persons (collectively, the "Other
Indemnified Parties"), from and against any losses, claims (including the
reasonable costs of investigation and legal fees), damages or liabilities (or
actions in respect thereof), to which the Wholesaler, its affiliates or their
respective Other Indemnified Parties may become subject under the Securities
Act or the Exchange Act, or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims,
damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are
based upon: (i) any inaccuracy in or breach of a representation or warranty
contained herein by the Dealer Manager, any breach of a covenant or agreement
contained herein of the Dealer Manager, or any failure by the Dealer Manager
to comply with state or federal securities law applicable to the Offering;
(ii) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact
contained in the information relating to the Dealer Manager that appears in
the Dealer Manager Sections of the Prospectus or any amendment thereof, or
arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state in
the Dealer Manager Sections a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading; and (iii) any unauthorized use of sales
materials or use of unauthorized verbal representations concerning the Offered
Shares by the Dealer Manager. The Dealer Manager will reimburse the
Wholesaler and its Other Indemnified Parties for any legal or other expenses
reasonably incurred by such Wholesaler, its affiliates and their respective
Other Indemnified Parties in connection with investigating or defending such
loss, claim, damage, liability or action.

  



  

(b) The Wholesaler will indemnify, defend and hold harmless the
Dealer Manager, the Company and their respective Other Indemnified
Parties, from and against any losses, claims (including the reasonable costs
of investigation and legal fees), damages or liabilities (or actions in
respect thereof), to which the Dealer Manager, the Company and any of their
respective Other Indemnified Parties may become subject under the Securities
Act or the Exchange Act, or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims
(including the reasonable costs of investigation and legal fees), damages or
liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based
upon: (i) any inaccuracy in or breach of a representation or warranty
contained herein by the Wholesaler, any breach of a covenant or agreement
contained herein of the Wholesaler, or any failure by the Wholesaler to comply
with state or federal securities laws applicable to the Offering; and (ii)
any unauthorized use of sales materials or use of unauthorized verbal
representations concerning the Shares by the Wholesaler.

  



  

(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party of notice of the
commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in
respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party, notify the
indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the failure so
to notify the indemnifying party (i) will not relieve it from liability under
this _Section 8_ unless and to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such
action and such failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying
party of substantial rights and defenses and (ii) will not, in any event,
relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified party
other than the indemnification obligation provided in this Agreement. The
indemnifying party shall be entitled to appoint counsel of the indemnifying
party's choice at the indemnifying party's expense to represent the
indemnified party in any action for which indemnification is sought (in which
case the indemnifying party shall not thereafter be responsible for the fees
and expenses of any separate counsel retained by the indemnified party or
parties except as set forth below); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that such
counsel shall be subject to approval by the indemnified party, not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed. Notwithstanding the indemnifying party's
election to appoint counsel to represent the indemnified party in an action,
the indemnified party shall have the right to employ and select separate
counsel (including local counsel), subject to approval by the indemnifying
party not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed, and the indemnifying party
shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel
if (i) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the
indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest,
(ii) the actual or potential defendants in, or

  



  

   

7

--- 

    



  

targets of, any such action include both the indemnified party and the
indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably
concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other
indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available
to the indemnifying party, (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have
employed counsel for the indemnified party (subject to approval by the
indemnified party not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) to represent the
indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of
such action or (iv) the indemnifying party shall authorize the
indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of the
indemnifying party. An indemnifying party may settle or compromise or
consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or
threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which
indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder but may not do so
without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, unless such
settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of each
indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit
or proceeding.

  



  

(d) If the right to indemnification provided for in this _Section 8_
would by its terms be available to a person hereunder, but is held to be
unavailable by a court of competent jurisdiction for any reason, then each
indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate amount paid or payable
by such indemnified party as a result of such Losses and expenses in respect
thereof, as incurred, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the
relative fault of the Dealer Manager and the Wholesaler, as applicable,
in connection with the statements, omissions or other circumstances which
resulted in such Losses or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable
considerations. The relative fault of the Dealer Manager and the Wholesaler,
as applicable, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, the
parties' relative intent, knowledge, and access to information. It is
understood that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant
to this _Section 8(d_ ) were determined by pro rata allocation or by any
other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable
considerations referred to above in this _Section 8(d)_. Notwithstanding the
provisions of this _Section 8(d)_ , the Dealer Manager shall not be required
to contribute any amount in excess of the total price of the Offering Shares
sold by it. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the
meaning of _Section 11(f)_ of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to
contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent
misrepresentation. For purposes of this _Section 8(d)_ , each Other
Indemnified Party affiliate of the Dealer Manager shall have the same rights
to contribution as the Dealer Manager and each Other Indemnified Party of the
Wholesaler shall have the same rights to contribution as the Wholesaler.

  



   | 9.| Relationship of Wholesaler, Participating Broker-Dealers and the
Dealer Manager  
---|---|--- 
  



  

(a) The obligations of each of the Wholesaler and the Participating
Broker-Dealers are several and not joint. Nothing herein contained shall
constitute the Wholesaler and the Participating Broker-Dealers, or any of
them, as an association, partnership, unincorporated business or other
separate entity. The Dealer Manager and the Company shall be under no
liability to the Wholesaler except for lack of good faith and for obligations
expressly assumed by the Dealer Manager and the Company in this Agreement.

  



  

(b) The parties hereto acknowledge that, other than as expressly set
forth herein, the Wholesaler is not authorized to act as agent of the Dealer
Manager or the Company in any connection or transaction, and the Wholesaler
agrees that it will not so act or purport to so act.

  



  

(c) The parties hereto acknowledge that the Wholesaler's obligations
under this Agreement, including without limitation the Wholesaler Exclusivity
have no impact on, and in no way release the Dealer Manager from, the Dealer
Manager's obligations and rights to act as the dealer manager for the Company
pursuant to _Section 3.1_ of the Dealer Manager Agreement.

  



   | 10.| Termination  
---|---|--- 
  



  

(a) This Agreement shall terminate upon the earlier to occur of (i)
termination of the Offering, (ii) the Second Closing (as defined in the
Equity Purchase Agreement (the "Equity Purchase Agreement"), dated as of
September

  



  

   

8 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

30, 2014, by and between ARC Properties Operating Partnership, L.P. and RCS
Capital Corporation), (iii) termination of the Equity Purchase Agreement or
(iv) December 31, 2014.

  



  

(b) Wholesaler may terminate this Agreement at any time by giving
ten days' prior written notice thereof to the other parties hereto.
This Agreement automatically shall terminate with no further action by any
party hereto if the Wholesaler or the Dealer Manager ceases to be a member in
good standing of FINRA, or with the securities commission of the state in
which its principal office is located. The Wholesaler will notify the Dealer
Manager immediately if the Wholesaler ceases to be a member in good standing
of FINRA or with the securities commission of any state in which the
Wholesaler is currently registered or licensed. The Dealer Manager
will notify the Wholesaler immediately if the Dealer Manager ceases to be a
member in good standing of FINRA or with the securities commission of any
state in which the Dealer Manager is currently registered or licensed.

  



  

(c) In the event of termination under _Section 11(b)_ , the Dealer
Manager will continue to pay any Sourcing Fees with respect to RCAP Sales to
the Wholesaler and reimburse costs and expenses incurred, to the extent
reimbursable under _Section 3(c)_ , for so long as Offered Shares remain
outstanding (it being understood and agreed that the calculation of the
Sourcing Fees in such event shall take into account the number of Offered
Shares sold primarily from the efforts of RCAP Service Providers in the
Offering). Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, the Dealer Manager will
not continue to pay the Sourcing Fee to the Wholesaler and reimburse costs
and expenses related to the Offering incurred by the Wholesaler pursuant to
_Section 3(c)_ subsequent to the termination of the Offering to the extent,
but only to the extent, that such payments or reimbursements would cause the
total underwriting compensation (as defined in accordance with applicable
FINRA rules) paid with respect to the Offering to exceed 10% of the
gross proceeds from the sale of the Offered Shares calculated as of the
termination of the Offering.

  



  

(d) The termination of this Agreement for any reason shall not
affect (i) the Wholesaler's obligations under the second sentence of _Section
10(a)_ , (ii) the indemnification obligations under _Section 8_ , or (iii)
this _Section 10_. Without limiting the foregoing, the provisions of this
Agreement shall survive the termination of this Agreement with respect to any
matter arising while this Agreement was in effect.

  



   | 11.| Amendment  
---|---|--- 
  



  

(a) The Dealer Manager has the right, subject to written consent
from the other parties hereto which shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed, to amend this Agreement as necessary, in the reasonable opinion of
outside counsel to the Dealer Manager, to comply with applicable law or the
requirements of any governmental or self-regulatory body or agency.

  



  

(b) This Agreement may not otherwise be amended, supplemented or
waived except by the express written consent of the parties hereto. No waiver
of any provision of this Agreement may be implied from any course of dealing
between or among any of the parties hereto or from any failure by any party
hereto to assert its rights under this Agreement on any occasion or series of
occasions.

OP (or any of its Affiliates) compensation or benefit plan or program,

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual agreements herein made and
intending to be legally bound, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:

  



  

ARTICLE I 
 INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES 
  
 

  

1.1 _Committees_.

  



  

(a) The parties agree that ARCP shall establish and maintain an
investment allocation committee (the " _Allocation Committee_ "), which shall
allocate Proposed Property Acquisitions as set forth in this _Article I_. The
members of the Allocation Committee shall be appointed by ARCP's Chief
Executive Officer, and shall serve at the pleasure of ARCP's Chief Executive
Officer; provided, however, that RCAP shall have the right to appoint one
member to the Allocation Committee. ARCP's Chief Executive Officer also may
appoint one or more alternates for each Allocation Committee member who shall
be authorized to act in such Allocation Committee member's absence.

  



  

(b) The parties agree that ARCP shall establish and maintain a
portfolio strategy committee (the " _Portfolio Committee_ "), which shall
review the allocations made by the Allocation Committee. The members of the
Portfolio Committee shall be appointed by ARCP's Chief Executive Officer, and
shall serve at the pleasure of ARCP's Chief Executive Officer; provided,
however, that RCAP shall have the right to appoint one member to the
Portfolio Committee.

  



  

1.2 _Investment Allocation Process_.

  



  

(a) The Allocation Committee shall endeavor to meet on a weekly
basis. Members of the Allocation Committee may participate by means
of conference telephone or other communications equipment if all persons
participating in the meeting can hear each other at the same time. The
Advisors shall be provided with, on a quarterly basis upon request, certified
copies of the minutes of all meetings of the Allocation Committee.

  



  

(b) When a Proposed Property Acquisition is introduced to the
Allocation Committee for review, the Allocation Committee shall analyze
the following factors in determining whether a Proposed Property Acquisition
is most appropriate for ARCP or a particular Fund (each, an " _Entity_ "):
(i) how the Proposed Property Acquisition fits into each Entity's respective
investment objectives; (ii) which Entity has available cash to acquire the
Proposed Property Acquisition, the amount of such available cash, and how
long such cash has been available for investment; (iii) the anticipated
operating cash flows and cash requirements of each Entity, respectively; (iv)
how the Proposed Property Acquisition would affect the tenant, industry and
geographic concentrations in each Entity, respectively; and (v) how the size,
income tax effect, potential leverage and projected cash flow of the
Proposed Property Acquisition would affect each Entity, respectively. If the
Allocation Committee determines that a Proposed Property Acquisition is
equally appropriate for one or more Entities, the Allocation Committee

  



  

   

3 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

shall first offer such Proposed Property Acquisition to the Entity that has
had the longest period of time elapse since it was allocated an investment
opportunity of a similar size and type (e.g., office, industrial or single
tenant or multi-tenant retail).

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the Allocation
Committee, in accordance with _Section 1.2(b)_ above, allocates a
Proposed Property Acquisition with a value greater than one hundred million
dollars ($100,000,000) to any of CCIT II, CCPT V, CCIT III or CCPT VI, then
ARCP shall have the right to veto such allocation and allocate such Proposed
Property Acquisition to ARCP.

  



  

1.3 _Review by Portfolio Committee_.

  



  

(a) The Portfolio Committee shall meet on a monthly basis to review the
allocations made by the Allocation Committee. Members of the Portfolio
Committee may participate by means of conference telephone or other
communications equipment if all persons participating in the meeting can hear
each other at the same time.

  



  

(b) If there have been no subsequent developments associated with a
particular Proposed Property Acquisition or the Entity to which the
Proposed Property Acquisition was initially allocated by the Allocation
Committee, the Portfolio Committee will confirm the allocation of the
Proposed Property Acquisition to the selected Entity. If, in the judgment of
the Portfolio Committee, a subsequent development has caused any such
Proposed Property Acquisition to be more appropriate for an Entity other than
an Entity to which the Proposed Property Acquisition was initially allocated,
the Portfolio Committee may override the Allocation Committee and specify that
the Proposed Property Acquisition should be made available to such other
Entity. In making this determination, the Portfolio Committee shall examine
the factors set forth in _Section 1.2(b)_ above. For the avoidance of doubt,
the Portfolio Committee may not re-allocate a Proposed Property Acquisition
with respect to which ARCP exercised its veto right set forth in _Section
1.2(b)_  above. The re-allocation decisions, if any, made by the Portfolio
Committee shall be recorded and the record retained by ARCP.

  



  

1.4 _Compliance with this Agreement_. Any determination of a
failure to comply with this Agreement shall be reported immediately to the
Allocation Committee and to members of senior management of ARCP.

  



  

1.5 _Miscellaneous_.

  



  

(a) The Portfolio Committee shall meet on a quarterly basis with the
Allocation Committee to report to the Allocation Committee on the prior
quarter's allocations and to discuss potential investments that are in the
pipeline, as well as the Portfolio Committee's then-current thinking on
future allocations.

  



  

(b) The Allocation Committee shall be responsible for establishing
and updating the policies and rules set forth herein as it deems appropriate,
taking into account all contractual and legal requirements it deems
applicable, and shall suggest any amendments to this Agreement

  



  

   

4 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

as necessary to comply with applicable law. The Allocation Committee shall,
notwithstanding any contrary provision or policy, follow the
Portfolio Committee's guidance and directives.

  



  

(c) The covenants and agreements set forth in this _Article I_ shall
not apply to the extent inconsistent with the constituent documents of any of
the Funds or ARCP (or any of its Affiliates), or applicable law.

shall provide the Seller with written notice thereof (together with a
reasonable description of such service and the approximate actual cost
thereof to the Buyer (without markup) to provide such service). Upon receipt
of such notice, the Seller may request that the Buyer, and the Buyer shall,
provide or cause to be provided such service upon the Seller's agreement to
bear such incremental costs; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Buyer shall not
be required to provide such service to the extent it is required to hire any
additional employees (other than temporary employees) beyond the number of
employees necessary to provide such service prior to the date hereof.

  



  

(e) The Seller may request in writing that the Buyer provide
additional services not otherwise provided hereunder, which request must
include a description of the services requested to be performed and, if any,
the associated business specifications. The Buyer shall consider such request
by the Seller in good faith and if the Buyer agrees to perform such additional
services, then the performance of such additional services shall be subject
to the terms and conditions of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , the
Buyer shall have no obligation to provide such additional services to the
Seller.

  



  

5. _Standard of Care_.

  



  

(a) The duties to be performed by the Providing Party pursuant to
this Agreement may be performed by it or by its officers, members
or directors or by Affiliates of the foregoing under the direction of the
Providing Party or delegated to unaffiliated third parties under the
Providing Party's direction. If any duties to be performed hereunder are
delegated by the Providing Party to an unaffiliated third party, then the
Providing Party shall provide the Receiving Party with written notice of such
delegation.

  



  

(b) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, and provided
that the Providing Party is not restricted by an existing contract with
a third party or by Law, the Providing Party agrees to perform, or cause to
be performed, the services hereunder such that the standard of care at which
such services are performed shall be substantially the same as the standard of
care that the Providing Party provides to its Affiliates with respect to such
services. In the event there is any restriction on the Providing Party by an
existing contract with a third party or by Law that would restrict the
standard of care applicable to delivery of the services to be provided by the
Providing Party to the Receiving Party, the Providing Party shall use its
commercially reasonable best efforts in good faith to provide such services
in a manner as closely as possible to the standards described in this _Section
5(b)_.

  



  

(c) Each Party hereto shall be responsible for its own compliance
with any and all Laws applicable to its performance under this Agreement. No
Party will take any action in violation of any such applicable Law that would
reasonably be likely to result in liability being imposed on the other Party.

(d) Except as expressly set forth herein, the Parties acknowledge
and agree that the services hereunder are provided as-is, that the
Receiving Party assumes all risks and liability arising from or relating to
its use of and reliance upon such services and the Providing Party makes no
representation or warranty with respect thereto. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH
HEREIN, THE PROVIDING PARTY HEREBY EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL REPRESENTATIONS
AND WARRANTIES REGARDING THE SERVICES HEREUNDER, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,
INCLUDING ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY IN REGARD TO QUALITY, PERFORMANCE,
NON-INFRINGEMENT, COMMERCIAL UTILITY, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS OF THE
SERVICES HEREUNDER FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

  



  

6. _Premises_. Subject to obtaining the prior written consent of 24TH AND CAMELBACK PHASE II L.L.C. (the " _Landlord_ "), the Seller shall provide the Buyer with exclusive use of, and access to, the Premises, and the use of the equipment located at the Premises that has been previously used by the Seller or its Affiliates prior to the date hereof, in each case in substantially the same manner as such space and equipment was used or accessed in the conduct of the Acquired Business prior to the date hereof (collectively, the " _Premises License_ "). The Premises License shall terminate upon the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms. Promptly following the date hereof, the Seller and the Buyer shall use their reasonable efforts (a) to negotiate a sublease (the " _Sublease_ ") with respect to the Premises ( _provided_ that the terms of the Sublease shall in no way increase the cost of the use and access of the Premises and the related service provided hereunder by the Seller or any of its Affiliates to the Buyer or any of its Affiliates), or (b) assist the Buyer to negotiate a lease of the premises directly with the Landlord. To the extent not obtained prior to the date hereof, the Seller shall use its best efforts to obtain the written consent of the Landlord to (i) the use and access of the Premises by the Buyer pursuant to this _Section 6_ and (ii) the execution by the Seller and the Buyer of the Sublease. The Buyer shall not use the Premises in a manner, or take, cause or allow to be taken, an action with respect to the Premises that would cause the Seller to be in violation of the terms of the Premises Lease.

  



  

7. _Fees and Other Compensation of the Seller_. The Seller or its designees shall be entitled to receive from the Buyer its actual costs and expenses incurred (with costs and expenses in connection with the services provided by Seller's Representatives calculated based on hourly rates set forth on _Annex A_ ). The Seller shall invoice the Buyer monthly in arrears for all costs and expenses due pursuant to this _Section 7_. The Buyer (or the Buyer's Affiliates on behalf of the Buyer) shall pay to the Seller all invoiced amounts by wire transfer within thirty (30) days of the date of receipt of such invoice as instructed by the Seller.

  



  

8. _Fees and Other Compensation of the Buyer_. The Buyer or its designees shall be entitled to receive from the Seller its actual costs and expenses incurred (with costs and expenses in connection with the services provided by Buyer's Representatives calculated based on hourly rates set forth on _Annex B_ ). The Buyer shall invoice the Seller monthly in arrears for all costs and expenses due pursuant to this _Section 8_. The Seller (or the Seller's Affiliates on behalf of the Seller) shall pay to the Buyer all invoiced amounts by wire transfer within thirty (30) days of the date of receipt of such invoice as instructed by the Buyer.

Upon the termination of this Agreement, each Party will cooperate with the other Party and take all reasonable steps requested to assist such other Party in making an orderly transition of the services provided hereunder. From and after the effective date of termination of this Agreement, neither Party shall be entitled to compensation for further services provided hereunder, but shall be paid all compensation and reimbursed for all expenses accrued through the date of termination within thirty (30) days of such termination.

  



  

12. _Force Majeure_. Each Party will be excused for any failure or delay in performing any of its obligations under this Agreement (other than payment obligations) if such failure or delay is caused by any act of God, accident, explosion, fire, act of terrorism, storm, earthquake, flood, strike, labor dispute or similar extraordinary circumstance or event outside the reasonable control of the non-performing Party (each a " _Force Majeure Event_ "). Following notice of a Force Majeure Event by a Party, the Parties shall consult to assess the Force Majeure Event and any ways in which the same may be avoided or mitigated. During the pendency of a Force Majeure Event, the affected Providing Party shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to minimize the effect of Force Majeure Event on and to resume the performance of its obligations under this Agreement with the least practicable delay.

  



  

13. _No Partnership or Joint Venture_. The Buyer and the Seller are not partners or joint venturers with each other and nothing herein shall be construed to make them partners or joint venturers or impose any liability as such on either of them.

indemnify the Providing Party and its Affiliates for any loss arising out of

Party or any of its Affiliates, as applicable.

  



  

(b) The Receiving Party shall not indemnify the Providing Party or
its Affiliates for any loss or liability suffered by the Providing Party or

--- 

    



  

Providing Party or its Affiliates determined in good faith that the course of
conduct which caused the loss or liability was in the best interests of the
Receiving Party (and/or its Affiliates, as applicable), (ii) the Providing
Party or its Affiliates were acting on behalf of the Receiving Party or
its Affiliates or performing services for the Receiving Party or its
Affiliates, (iii) such liability or loss or expense was not the result of
gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the Providing Party or
its Affiliates and (iv) such indemnification or agreement to hold harmless
shall be recoverable only out of the net assets of the Receiving Party and its
Affiliates and not from the stockholders, partners or members of the
Receiving Party and its Affiliates.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in _Section 14(b)_
above, the Receiving Party shall not indemnify the Providing Party or its
Affiliates or any persons acting as a broker-dealer for any losses,
liabilities or expenses arising from or out of an alleged violation
of federal or state securities Laws by such party unless one or more of the
following conditions are met: (i) there has been a successful adjudication on
the merits of each count involving alleged securities Law violations as to the
particular indemnitee, (ii) such claims have been dismissed with prejudice on
the merits by a court of competent jurisdiction as to the particular
indemnitee or (iii) a court of competent jurisdiction approves a settlement
of the claims against a particular indemnitee and finds that
indemnification of the settlement and related costs should be made, and the
court considering the matter has been advised of the position of the SEC and
the published position of any state securities regulatory authority as to
indemnification for violations of securities Law.

  



  

(d) The Receiving Party will advance amounts to the Providing Party
or its Affiliates for legal expenses and other costs incurred as a result of
any legal action for which indemnification is being sought is permissible only
if all of the following conditions are satisfied: (i) the legal action
relates to acts or omissions with respect to the performance of duties or
services on behalf of the Receiving Party or its Affiliates, (ii) the legal
action is initiated by a third party who is not a stockholder or is
initiated by a stockholder acting in his or her capacity as such and a court
of competent jurisdiction specifically approves the advancement and (iii) the
Providing Party or its Affiliates undertake in writing to repay the advanced
funds to the Receiving Party or its Affiliates, as applicable, together with
the applicable legal rate of interest thereon, in cases in which the Providing
Party or its Affiliates are found not to be entitled to indemnification.

Each of the obligations in this Agreement is an entire, separate and independent restriction, despite the fact that they may be contained in the same phrase, and if any part is found to be invalid or unenforceable the remainder will remain valid and enforceable. While the restrictions are considered by the parties to be fair and reasonable under the circumstances, the Parties hereto agree that, if any court of competent jurisdiction determines that a specified time period, a specified geographical area, a specified business limitation or any other relevant feature of this Agreement is unreasonable, arbitrary or against public policy, then a lesser period of time, geographical area, business limitation or other relevant feature which is determined by such court to be reasonable, not arbitrary and not against public policy may be enforced against the applicable Party.

  



  

8.   _Binding Effect; Assignment_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties hereto and their respective successors, permitted assigns and legal representatives, including any successor to the Company or Seller GP by merger, purchase or otherwise or any acquirer of all or substantially all of the Company or Seller GP, as applicable. This Agreement is not assignable by the Seller GP Executives. The Company may assign its rights, but not its obligations, hereunder, without the Consent of any Party hereto, to any Affiliate of the Company, any successor thereof and to any other person or entity which acquires all or substantially all of the assets of the Company. Seller GP may assign its rights, but not its obligations, hereunder, without the Consent of any Party hereto to any Affiliate of Seller GP, any successor thereof and to any other person or entity which acquires all or substantially all of the assets of Seller GP.

  



  

9.   _Entire Agreement; Recitals_. This Agreement (including the documents and the instruments referred to in this Agreement), constitutes the entire agreement and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, between the Parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement. The recitals set forth above are incorporated herein and made a part of this Agreement as if set forth at length herein.

  



  

10. _Amendments_. Subject to compliance with applicable law, the provisions of this Agreement may not be amended, modified or supplemented without the prior written consent of each of the Parties. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the Parties. Any waiver of compliance with any provision of this Agreement shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by the Party to be bound thereby.

  



  

11. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become effective when counterparts have been signed by each of the Parties and delivered to the other Parties, it being understood that each Party need not sign the same counterpart.

12. _Injunctive Relief._ Each Party acknowledges that compliance with this Agreement is necessary to protect the goodwill and other proprietary interests of the other Parties. Each Party acknowledges that a breach of this Agreement may result in irreparable and continuing damage to the other Parties and/or their respective Affiliates and their respective businesses, for which there may be no adequate remedy at law. Each Party further agrees that in the event of any breach of this Agreement, the other Parties and their respective successors and assigns shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief and to such other and further relief, including damages, as may be proper without any requirement of the posting of any bond or similar security.

Process in any such suit, action or proceeding may be served on any Party anywhere in the world, whether within or without the jurisdiction of any such court.

ARTICLE 2 _Registration Rights_

  



  

Section 2.01 _ Registration Statement_

  



  

   

4 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(a) On or prior to the Filing Date, the Company shall prepare and
file with the SEC a Registration Statement or, if a Registration Statement is
then effective, a supplement to the Prospectus, in either case covering the
resale of all Registrable Securities for an offering to be made on a
continuous basis pursuant to Rule 415 (or any successor provision) (the "
_Shelf Registration Statement_ ").

  



  

(b) The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
Shelf Registration Statement to be declared effective under the
Securities Act as promptly as possible, if the Shelf Registration Statement
is not then effective, but in any event on or prior to the
Effectiveness Date, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to keep the
Registration Statement continuously effective under the Securities Act until
the earlier of the date that all Registrable Securities covered by such
Registration Statement have been sold or can be sold publicly without any
volume limitations under Rule 144 (the " _Effectiveness Period_ ").

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the
Company may, by written notice to each Investor, suspend sales under a
Registration Statement, including the Shelf Registration Statement, after the
Effective Date thereof and/or require that each Investor immediately cease
the sale of Registrable Securities pursuant thereto and/or defer the filing of
any subsequent Registration Statement if the Company is engaged in a material
merger, acquisition or sale and the Board of Directors of the Company
determines in good faith, by appropriate resolutions, that, as a result of
such activity, (i) it would be materially detrimental to the Company
(other than as relating solely to the price of the Common Stock) to maintain
a Registration Statement at such time or (ii) it is in the best interests of
the Company to suspend sales under such Registration Statement at such time.
Upon receipt of such notice, each Investor shall immediately discontinue any
sales of Registrable Securities pursuant to such registration until such
Investor is advised in writing by the Company that the current Prospectus or
amended Prospectus, as applicable, may be used. In no event, however, shall
this right be exercised to suspend sales beyond the period during which (in
the good faith determination of the Board of Directors of the Company) the
failure to require such suspension would be materially detrimental to the
Company. The Company's rights under this _Section 2.01(c)_ may be exercised
for a period of no more than 15 Trading Days at a time and not more than two
times in any twelve-month (12) period. Immediately after the end of any
suspension period under this _Section 2.01(c)_ , the Company shall take all
necessary actions (including filing any required supplemental Prospectus) to
restore the effectiveness of the applicable Registration Statement and the
ability of each Investor to publicly resell its Registrable Securities
pursuant to such effective Registration Statement.

  



  

Section 2.02 _Piggyback Registration_.

  



  

(a) Whenever the Company proposes to register any of its Common
Stock in connection with an underwritten public offering (whether an
offering of Common Stock by the Company, stockholders of the Company, or
both, but other than in connection with a Special Registration (as defined
below)), the Company will give prompt written notice to the Investors of its
intention to effect such a registration (but in no event less than ten (10)
days prior to the anticipated filing date) and (subject to _Section 2.02(b)_
below) will include in such registration all

  



  

   

5 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

Registrable Securities with respect to which the Company has received written
requests for inclusion therein within ten (10) business days after the date
of the Company's notice (a " _Piggyback Registration_ "). Any Investor that
has made such a written request may withdraw its Registrable Securities from
such Piggyback Registration by giving written notice to the Company and the
managing underwriter, if any, on or before the fifth (5th) business day
prior to the planned effective date of such Piggyback Registration. The
Company may terminate or withdraw any registration under this  _Section 2.02_
prior to the effectiveness of such registration, whether or not any Investor
has elected to include Registrable Securities in such registration. "
_Special Registration_ " means the registration of equity securities
and/or options or other rights in respect thereof (i) on Form S-4 or Form S-8
(or successor form), (ii) in connection with an at-the-market offering, (iii)
on any other registration form which may not be used for the registration or
qualification for distribution of Registrable Securities, or (iv) in
connection with any employee benefit or dividend reinvestment plan.

  



  

(b) The right of the Investors to participate in a registration
referred to in _Section 2.02(a)_ will be conditioned upon such
persons' participation in such underwriting and the inclusion of such
persons' Registrable Securities in the underwriting, and each such person
will (together with the Company and the other persons distributing their
securities through such underwriting) enter into an underwriting agreement in
customary form with the underwriter or underwriters selected for such
underwriting by the Company. If any participating person disapproves of the
terms of the underwriting, such person may elect to withdraw therefrom by
written notice to the Company. If the managing underwriters advise the
Company in writing that, in their reasonable opinion, the number of shares of
Common Stock requested to be included in such offering exceeds the number
which can be sold without adversely affecting the marketability of such
offering (including an adverse effect on the per share offering price), the
Company shall include in such Registration Statement or Prospectus only such
number of securities that in the reasonable opinion of such underwriters
can be sold without adversely affecting the marketability of the offering
(including an adverse effect on the per share offering price), which shares
shall be so included in the following order of priority: (i) first, the shares
the Company and/or selling stockholders, as applicable, propose to sell and
(ii) second, shares of the participating Investors pro rata on the basis of
the aggregate number of such shares owned by each participating Investor.

  



  

Section 2.03 _Requests and Demands_.

  



  

(a) ARCP OP may make three (3) requests to sell all or any portion
of its Registrable Securities in an underwritten offering that is
registered pursuant to a Registration Statement (each, an " _Underwritten
Shelf Takedown_ "). A request (a " _Demand_ ") for an Underwritten Shelf
Takedowns shall be made by ARCP OP by giving written notice to the Company
(the " _Demand Notice_ "). Each Demand Notice shall specify the approximate
number of Registrable Securities to be sold by ARCP OP in the Underwritten
Shelf Takedown and the expected price range (net of underwriting discounts
and commissions) of such Underwritten Shelf Takedown. Within two (2) business
days after receipt of any Demand Notice, the Company shall send written notice
of such requested Underwritten Shelf Takedown to each non-requesting
Investor, if any, and shall include in such Underwritten Shelf Takedown all
Registrable Securities with respect to which

  



  

   

6 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

the Company has received written requests for inclusion therein within five
(5) business days after sending such notice (except that each non-requesting
Investor shall have two (2) business days after receipt of such notice to
request inclusion of Registrable Securities in the Underwritten Shelf Takedown
in the case of a "bought deal", "registered direct offering" or "overnight
transaction").

  



  

(b) The underwriters in any Underwritten Shelf Takedown shall be
selected by ARCP OP.

  



  

(c) If an Investor desires to initiate an offering or sale of all or
part of such Investor's Registrable Securities that does not constitute an
Underwritten Shelf Takedown (a " _Non-Underwritten Shelf Takedown_ "), such
Investor shall so indicate in a written request delivered to the Company no
later than two (2) business days (or in the event any amendment or supplement
to the Registration Statement or Prospectus is necessary, no later than five
(5) business days) prior to the expected date of such Non-Underwritten Shelf
Takedown, which request shall include (i) the total number of Registrable
Securities expected to be offered and sold in such Non-Underwritten Shelf
Takedown, (ii) the expected plan of distribution of such Non-
Underwritten Shelf Takedown and (iii) the action or actions required
(including the timing thereof) in connection with such Non-Underwritten Shelf
Takedown, and, to the extent necessary, the Company shall file and effect an
amendment or supplement to its Registration Statement or Prospectus for such
purpose as soon as practicable. For the avoidance of doubt, unless otherwise
agreed to by the requesting Investor, a non-requesting Investor shall not
have the right to participate in a Non-Underwritten Shelf Takedown.

  



  

Section 2.04  _Registration Procedures_. In connection with the Company's
registration obligations hereunder, the Company shall:

  



  

(a) Not less than three (3) Trading Days prior to the filing of a
Registration Statement or any related Prospectus or any amendment
or supplement thereto, furnish to each Investor copies of all such documents
proposed to be filed, which documents (other than any document that is
incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by reference therein) will be
subject to the review of each Investor. The Company shall reflect in each
such document when so filed with the SEC all reasonable comments regarding the
description of the transactions under the Purchase Agreement, the Investors
or the plan of distribution as each Investor may reasonably and
promptly propose no later than two (2) Trading Days after each Investor has
been so furnished with copies of such documents as aforesaid

  



  

(b) (i) Subject to _Section 2.01(c)_ , prepare and file with the SEC
such amendments, including post-effective amendments, to each
Registration Statement and the Prospectus used in connection therewith as may

and file with the SEC such additional Registration Statements in order to
register for resale under the Securities Act all of the Registrable
Securities; (ii) cause the related Prospectus to be amended or supplemented

filed pursuant to Rule 424 (or any successor provision); and (iii) comply in

with the provisions of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act with respect
to the disposition of all Registrable Securities covered by the Registration
Statement during the applicable period in accordance with the intended
methods of disposition by the Investors thereof set forth in the
Registration Statement as so amended or in such Prospectus as so
supplemented.

  



  

(c)  Notify each Investor as promptly as reasonably possible and, if
requested by any Investors, confirm such notice in writing no later than two
(2) Trading Days thereafter, of any of the following events: (i) the SEC
issues any stop order suspending the effectiveness of any Registration
Statement or initiates any proceedings for that purpose; (ii) the Company
receives notice of any suspension of the qualification or exemption from
qualification of any Registrable Securities for sale in any jurisdiction, or
the initiation or threat of any proceeding for such purpose; or (iii) the
financial statements included in any Registration Statement become ineligible
for inclusion therein or any Registration Statement or Prospectus or other
document contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state
any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading.

  



  

(d) Use its reasonable best efforts to avoid the issuance of or, if
issued, obtain the withdrawal of (i) any order suspending the effectiveness
of any Registration Statement, or (ii) any suspension of the qualification (or
exemption from qualification) of any of the Registrable Securities for sale
in any jurisdiction, as soon as possible.

  



  

(e) Promptly deliver to each Investor, without charge, as many
copies of the Prospectus or Prospectuses (including each form of

reasonably request. The Company hereby consents to the use of such Prospectus
and each amendment or supplement thereto by the Investors in connection with
the offering and sale of the Registrable Securities covered by such
Prospectus and any amendment or supplement thereto to the extent permitted by
federal and state securities laws and regulations.

  



  

(f)  Prior to any public offering of Registrable Securities, use
reasonable best efforts to register or qualify or cooperate with the selling
Investors in connection with the registration or qualification (or exemption
from such registration or qualification) of such Registrable Securities for
offer and sale under the securities or Blue Sky laws of such jurisdictions
within the United States as any Investor requests in writing, to keep each
such registration or qualification (or exemption therefrom) effective for
so long as required, but not to exceed the duration of the Effectiveness
Period, and to do any and all other acts or things reasonably necessary or
advisable to enable the disposition in such jurisdictions of the Registrable
Securities covered by a Registration Statement; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the Company shall not be obligated to file any general consent to service of
process or to qualify as a foreign corporation or as a dealer in securities
in any jurisdiction in which it is not so qualified or to subject itself to
taxation in respect of doing business in any jurisdiction in which it is not

amendment, including a post-effective amendment, to the Registration Statement

substance and scope as are customarily made by issuers in underwritten public
offerings.

indemnification agreements) and take such other actions as the

the closing under the underwriting agreement, in form and substance as is
customarily given to underwriters in an underwritten secondary public
offering.

  



  

(l)  In the case of an Underwritten Shelf Takedown, use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain for delivery to the Company and the
lead underwriter, if any, a "comfort" letter from the Company's independent

offering.

ARTICLE 3

  

Indemnification and Contribution

    



  

Section 3.01.  _Indemnification by the Company_. The Company agrees to
indemnify and hold harmless each Investor beneficially owning any Registrable
Securities covered by a Registration Statement, its officers, directors,
employees, partners and agents, and each Person, if any, who controls such
Investor within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20
of the Exchange Act from and against any and all losses, claims, damages,
liabilities and expenses (including reasonable expenses of investigation and
reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) (collectively, "Damages") caused by
or relating to any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material
fact contained in any Registration Statement or Prospectus relating to
the Registrable Securities (as amended or supplemented if the Company shall
have furnished any amendments or supplements thereto) or any preliminary
prospectus or free-writing prospectus (as defined in Rule 405 under the
Securities Act), or caused by or relating to any omission or alleged omission
to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as such Damages
are caused by or related to any such untrue statement or omission or
alleged untrue statement or omission so made based upon information furnished
in writing to the Company by such Investor or on such Investor's behalf
expressly for use therein.

  



  

Section 3.02  _Indemnification by Participating Investors_. Each Investor
holding Registrable Securities included in any Registration Statement agrees,
severally but not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its
officers, directors and agents and each Person, if any, who controls the
Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20
of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the indemnity from the Company to
such Investor provided in _0_ , but only with respect to information
furnished in writing by such Investor or on such Investor's behalf expressly
for use in any Registration Statement or Prospectus relating to the
Registrable Securities, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any
preliminary prospectus or free-writing prospectus. No Investor shall be
liable under this _Section_

  



  

   

11 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

 _3.02_ for any Damages in excess of the net proceeds (after giving effect
to any underwriters discounts and commissions) realized by such Investor in
the sale of Registrable Securities of such Investor to which such Damages
relate.

  



  

Section 3.03.  _Conduct of Indemnification Proceedings_. If any proceeding
(including any governmental investigation) shall be instituted involving any
Person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to this 0, such
Person (an "Indemnified Party") shall promptly notify the Person against whom
such indemnity may be sought (the "Indemnifying Party") in writing and the
Indemnifying Party shall assume the defense thereof, including the employment
of counsel reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Party, and shall
assume the payment of all fees and expenses, _provided_ that the failure of
any Indemnified Party so to notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve
the Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder except to the extent that
the Indemnifying Party is actually materially prejudiced by such failure to
notify. In any such proceeding, any Indemnified Party shall have the right to
retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at
the expense of such Indemnified Party unless (a) the Indemnifying Party and
the Indemnified Party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of
such counsel, (b) in the reasonable judgment of such Indemnified Party
representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due
to actual or potential differing interests between them, including one or more
defenses or counterclaims that are different from or in addition to those
available to the Indemnifying Party, or (c) the Indemnifying Party shall have
failed to assume the defense within 30 days of notice pursuant to this _0_.
It is understood that, in connection with any proceeding or
related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, the Indemnifying Party shall
not be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate
firm of attorneys (in addition to any local counsel) at any time for all such
Indemnified Parties, and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed
as they are incurred. In the case of any such separate firm for the
Indemnified Parties, such firm shall be designated in writing by the
Indemnified Parties. The Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any
settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if
settled with such consent, or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff,
the Indemnifying Party shall indemnify and hold harmless such Indemnified
Parties from and against any loss or liability (to the extent stated above)
by reason of such settlement or judgment. Without the prior written consent of
the Indemnified Party, no Indemnifying Party shall effect any settlement of
any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any Indemnified
Party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought
hereunder by such Indemnified Party, unless such settlement (A) includes an
unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all liability arising out
of such proceeding, and (B) does not include any injunctive or other
equitable or non-monetary relief applicable to or affecting such Indemnified
Person.

  



  

Section 3.04.  _Contribution_. If the indemnification provided for in this
Article 3 is unavailable to the Indemnified Parties in respect of any
Damages, then each Indemnifying Party, in lieu of indemnifying the Indemnified
Parties, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified
Party, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of
the Indemnifying Party and Indemnified Party in connection with the actions,
statements or omissions that resulted in such Damages as well as any
other relevant equitable considerations.

  



  

   

12 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

The relative fault of such Indemnifying Party and Indemnified Party shall be
determined by reference to, among other things, whether any action in
question, including any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact
or omission or alleged omission of a material fact, has been taken or made
by, or relates to information supplied by, such Indemnifying Party or
Indemnified Party, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to
information and opportunity to correct or prevent such action, statement or
omission. The amount paid or payable by a party as a result of any Damages
shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth in this
Agreement, any reasonable attorneys' or other reasonable fees or expenses
incurred by such party in connection with any proceeding to the extent such
party would have been indemnified for such fees or expenses if the
indemnification provided for in this 0 was available to such party in
accordance with its terms.

  



  

The parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if
contribution pursuant to this _0_ were determined by _pro rata_  allocation
or by any other method of allocation that does not take into account the
equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph.
Notwithstanding the provisions of this _0_ , no Investor shall be required to
contribute, in the aggregate, any amount in excess of the amount by which the
net proceeds actually received by such Investor from the sale of the
Registrable Securities subject to the proceeding (after giving effect to any
underwriters discounts and commissions) exceeds the amount of any damages
that such Investor has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue
or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission, except in the
case of fraud by such Investor. Each Investor's obligation to contribute
pursuant to this _Section 3.04_ is several in the proportion that the
proceeds of the offering received by such Investor bears to the total
proceeds of the offering received by all such Investors and not joint.

  



  

No Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of
Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from
any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The
indemnity and contribution agreements contained in this Article 3 are in
addition to any liability that the Indemnifying Parties may have to the
Indemnified Parties.

joint venturers with each other, and nothing in this Agreement shall be
construed to make them such partners or joint venturers. Nothing herein
contained shall prevent the Advisor or Sub-advisor from engaging in or

or to render services of any kind to any other Person. Each of the Advisor and
the Sub-advisor shall promptly disclose to the Board the existence of any
condition or circumstance, existing or anticipated, of which it has knowledge,
that creates or which would reasonably result in a conflict of interest
between its obligations to the Company and its obligations to or its
interest in any other Persons. Nothing in this Section 8.1 shall derogate any
restrictions imposed indirectly on the Sub-advisor as set forth in the Non-
Competition Agreement. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 8.2| Time Commitment. The Sub-advisor shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates and their respective employees, officers and agents to, devote to
the Company such time as shall be reasonably necessary to conduct the business
and affairs of the Company in an appropriate manner consistent with the terms
of this Agreement. Each Party acknowledges that the other Party and its
Affiliates and their respective employees, officers and agents may also
engage in activities unrelated to the Company and may provide services to
Persons other than the Company or any of its Affiliates. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 8.3| Advisor and Sub-advisor Meetings. The Parties shall meet on a
regular basis (frequency to be determined) to discuss and consult with one
another regarding the Company and its assets and opportunities. The Parties
will provide each other information regarding the operations and acquisitions
of the Company as reasonably requested by the other. Each of Advisor and Sub-

this Agreement, Sub-advisor's obligations with respect to offering investment
opportunities to the Company shall be governed by the Investment Allocation
Agreement, which cannot be amended or modified without the written consent of
the Advisor.

   | 8.5| Prospectus Guidance. Each of the Advisor and Sub-advisor has read
and will abide by the Prospectus with respect to the Company's investment

Article 9

  



  

Other Agreements

  



   | 9.1| The Advisor shall not agree to an amendment to the Advisory
Agreement or waive any provision thereof, to the extent that such amendment

advisor's right to indemnification under Article 13 of this Agreement without
the prior written consent of the Sub-advisor. 
---|---|---
