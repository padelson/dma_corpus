 (c) Upon surrender of a Company Share Certificate (or affidavit of loss and bond as indemnity, in accordance with _Section 2.6(b)_, in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Share for cancellation to the Paying Agent, together with a letter of transmittal duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be reasonably required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such Company Share Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be entitled to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration in exchange therefor pursuant to  _Section 2.4(a)(iii)_, to be mailed (or made available for collection by hand if so elected by the surrendering holder) within five (5) Business Days following the later to occur of (i) the Paying Agents receipt of the Exchange Fund, and (ii) the Paying Agents receipt of such Company Share Certificate (or affidavit of loss and bond as indemnity, in accordance with  _Section 2.6(b)_, in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Share, and the Company Share Certificate or Book-Entry Share so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled within five (5) Business Days. 

   

 (d) No interest shall be paid or accrued for the benefit of the holders of the Company Share Certificate or Book-Entry Shares on the consideration payable to such holders pursuant to this Agreement. 

   

 (e) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to holders of Company Share Certificates or Book-Entry Shares as of the date twelve (12) months after the date on which the Merger becomes effective shall be delivered to Parent upon demand, and any holders of Company Share Certificates or Book-Entry Shares who have not theretofore

Corporation with a valid approval or ruling issued by the applicable
Governmental Authority regarding the withholding (or exemption from
withholding or interim ruling with respect to the obligation to withhold)
of Israeli Tax from the aggregate consideration payable to such holder in a
form reasonably satisfactory to Parent, then the deduction and withholding of
any amounts under the Israeli Tax Ordinance or any other provision of Israeli
law or requirement, if any, from the aggregate consideration payable to such
holder shall be made only in accordance with the provisions of such approval
or ruling or interim ruling. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the
Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent, or Merger Sub, as the
case may be, such withheld amounts shall be remitted to the applicable
Governmental Body not sooner than two (2) days prior to the due date under
applicable law and when so remitted shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Company Shares in respect of

 (i) furnish nonpublic information that could reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal to the third party making such Acquisition Proposal, _provided_ , 

   ##### 

  

 

that (y) prior to so furnishing, the Company receives from the third party an
executed confidentiality agreement containing confidentiality provisions no
more favorable to the third party than the confidentiality provisions under
the Confidentiality Agreement, and (z) subject to applicable antitrust laws
and regulations relating to the exchange of information, promptly following
furnishing any such nonpublic information to such third party, the Company
furnishes a copy of such nonpublic information to Parent hereunder (to the
extent such nonpublic information has not been previously so furnished),
and 

   

 (ii) engage in discussions and/or negotiations with the third party with respect to the Acquisition Proposal. 

  

 (d) In response to the receipt of a Superior Proposal that has not been withdrawn and continues to constitute a Superior Proposal after compliance by the Company with this _Section 5.4(d)_ , the board of directors (or any committee thereof charged with such authority) of the Company may (y) withhold or withdraw the Company Board Recommendation, or (z) approve, adopt, endorse or recommend to its shareholders a Superior Proposal (any of the foregoing actions, whether by the Companys board of directors or a committee thereof, a " _Change of Recommendation_ "), only if all of the following conditions are met: 

  

 (i) the Company General Meeting has not occurred, 

  

 (ii) the board of directors (or any committee thereof charged with such authority) of the Company has concluded in good faith, based on advice of its outside legal counsel, and after taking into account the legal, financial, fiduciary and other aspects of such unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal, that, in light of such Superior Proposal, the failure of the board of directors to effect a Change of Recommendation would constitute a breach of its fiduciary obligations to its shareholders under applicable Legal Requirements (which for this purpose shall be deemed to consist of Israeli Legal Requirements and, in addition, in order to determine the appropriate standards that would apply to such fiduciary obligations, the Companys board of directors may also consider and act on the basis of Delaware Legal Requirements), and 

  

 (iii) the Companys board of directors has (x) provided to Parent five (5) Business Days prior written notice of its intent to effect a Change of Recommendation (which notice shall include reasonable details of the applicable Superior Proposal and the manner in which it intends to effect the Change of Recommendation), provided that such five (5) Business Day period shall be extended for an additional five (5) Business Days following each modification of the financial or other materials terms of such Superior Proposal so long as the Companys board of directors determines that such modified proposal continues to constitute a Superior Proposal, (y) subject to applicable antitrust laws and regulations relating to the exchange of information, made available to Parent all materials and information made available to the Person making the Superior Proposal in connection with such Superior Proposal, and (z) for such five (5) Business Day period (plus each applicable extension) following the delivery to Parent of such notice and the provision of the materials and information referred to in (y) above, the Company shall, if requested by Parent, negotiate in good faith with Parent to revise this Agreement with the goal that the Acquisition Proposal that constituted a Superior Proposal would no longer constitute a Superior Proposal. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (e) Unless this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with _Section 9.1_ and no Legal Proceeding to dispute such termination shall have been commenced by Parent in good faith and is then pending, the Company agrees that it shall not submit to the vote of its shareholders any Acquisition Proposal (whether or not a Superior Proposal) or propose to do so.

 6.5 _Company Compensatory Awards_. 

  

 (a) Except as otherwise provided in _Section 6.5(b)_ or on _Schedule 6.5(a)_, at the Effective Time by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders thereof, each Company Option, Company RSU and other equity-based award denominated in Company Shares (each such award, a " _Company Compensatory Award_ ") that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not then vested or exercisable, shall be assumed by Parent and converted automatically at the Effective Time into an option, restricted stock unit award or other equity-based award, as the case may be, denominated in Parent Ordinary Shares and which has other terms and conditions substantially identical to those of the related Company Compensatory Award, except that (i) the number of Parent Ordinary Shares subject to each such award shall be determined by multiplying the number of Company Shares subject to such Company Compensatory Award immediately prior to the Effective Time by a fraction (the " _Award Exchange Ratio_ "), the numerator of which is the Per Share Merger Consideration and the denominator of which is the average closing price of a Parent Ordinary Share on NASDAQ over the five (5) trading days immediately preceding (but not including) the date on which the Effective Time occurs (rounded down to the nearest whole share), and (ii) if applicable, the exercise or purchase price per Parent Ordinary Share (rounded upwards to the nearest whole cent) shall equal (x) the per share exercise or purchase price per Company Share otherwise purchasable pursuant to such Company Compensatory Award immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by (y) the Award Exchange Ratio;  _provided_ , _however_ , that in no case shall the exchange of a Company Option be performed in a manner that is not in compliance with the adjustment requirements of Section 409A of the Code and, with respect to Company Options intended to qualify as incentive stock options under Section 422 of the Code, Section 424 of the Code or Section 1.424-1 of the Treasury Regulations. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this _Section 6.5_ shall restrict any holder of Company Compensatory Award from exercising any vested portion of the Company Compensatory Award into Company Shares (including by way of cashless exercise if allowed by the Company), at any time prior to the Effective Time. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing clause (a), each Company Compensatory Award that is held by a person who is not an employee of, or a consultant to, the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company as of the Effective Time (the " _Cashed Out Compensatory Awards_ ") shall not be assumed by Parent pursuant to this _Section 6.5(b)_ and shall, immediately prior to the Effective Time, be cancelled and extinguished and the vested portion (and, in the case of non-employee members of the Company Board, the unvested portion to the extent such unvested portion will automatically vest on the Closing Date pursuant to the underlying grant agreement or any other Acquired Company Benefit Plan) thereof shall automatically be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the aggregate number of Company Shares that were issuable upon exercise or settlement of the vested portion (and, in the case of non-employee members of the Company Board, the unvested portion to the extent such unvested portion will automatically vest on the Closing Date pursuant to the underlying grant agreement or any other Acquired Company Benefit Plan) of such Cashed Out Compensatory Award immediately prior to the Effective Time (after giving effect to any acceleration provided under the terms of the applicable Company Share Plan under which the Company Compensatory Award was granted, the applicable award agreement and any other Acquired Company Benefit Plan disclosed in _Part 3.16(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule_ ) and (ii) the Per Share Merger Consideration, less any per share exercise price or purchase price of such Cashed Out Compensatory Award. In the event any Cashed Out Compensatory Award is subject to Section 409A of the Code, the payment of the amount of cash with respect thereto shall be delayed to the extent necessary to comply with Section 409A of the Code. 

  

 (c) The Company shall take such action as may be reasonably necessary to provide that following the Effective Time, no holder of a Company Compensatory Award or any participant in any Company Share Plan, or other Acquired Company Benefit Plan or employee benefit arrangement of the Company or under any employment agreement shall have any right hereunder to acquire any Company Shares, any interest in Company Shares (including any "phantom" stock or stock appreciation rights) or any other interest in the equity of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or the Surviving Corporation, including in the event the assumption of the Company Compensatory Awards is delayed in accordance with _Section 6.5(e)_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, on the first day of any fiscal year commencing after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall cause the number of shares reserved for issuance pursuant to the Company 2007 Incentive Compensation Plan to increase by the maximum amount permissible under Section 4.1(y)(i) and (ii) of the Company 2007 Incentive Compensation Plan without giving effect to Section 4.1(y)(iii) of the Company 2007 Incentive Compensation Plan. 

  

 (d) As soon as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement and in any event prior to the Effective Time, the board of directors of the Company (or, if appropriate, any committee administering the Company Share Plans) shall adopt such resolutions that are necessary for the assumption and conversion of the Company Compensatory Awards and Company Restricted Share Awards pursuant to this _Section 6.5_. 

  

 (e) As soon as reasonably practicable after the execution of this Agreement, the Company shall instruct its Israeli counsel, advisors and accountants, in coordination with Parent, to prepare and file with the Israeli Tax Authority an application for a ruling in relation to the assumption by Parent of Company Compensatory Awards granted to Israeli employees, service providers and officers of the Company which will provide, among other things that (i) the 

   ##### 

  

 

assumption of the Company Compensatory Awards will not result in a taxable
event with respect to such Company Compensatory Awards pursuant to Section
3(i) or Section 102 of the Israeli Tax Ordinance (" _Section 102_"), and
with respect to such Company Compensatory Awards subject to Section 102 that
tax continuity shall apply including with regard to the requisite holding
period which will be deemed to have begun at the time of the grant of Company
Compensatory Awards and with regard to the classification of the gain, (ii)
the payments made in respect to Shares issued upon exercise or vesting of
Company Compensatory Awards granted under the capital gains route of
Section 102 and held by the trustee who is holding or controlling such Shares
pursuant to the provisions of Section 102 (the " _102 Trustee_ "), shall not
constitute a violation of Section 102 if deposited with the 102 Trustee and
released only after the lapse of the minimum trust period required by Section
102 (the " _102 Trust Period_ "), (iii) Parent and anyone acting on
its behalf shall be exempt from withholding tax in relation to any payments
made to the 102 Trustee (which ruling may be subject to customary conditions
regularly associated with such a ruling) (the " _Israeli Option Tax Ruling_
"). Each of Company and Parent shall cause their respective Israeli counsel,
advisors and accountants to coordinate all activities, and to cooperate with
each other, with respect to the preparation and filing of such application
and in the preparation of any written or oral submissions that may be
necessary, proper or advisable to obtain the Israeli Option Tax Ruling.
Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, Company shall use reasonable best
efforts to promptly take, or cause to be taken, all action and to do, or
cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable
Legal Requirements to obtain the Israeli Option Tax Ruling as promptly as
practicable. The final text of the Israeli Option Tax Ruling or the
Interim Option Ruling shall in all circumstances be subject to the prior
written confirmation of Parent or its counsel, which consent shall not
unreasonably be withheld, conditioned or delayed. If the Israeli Option Tax
Ruling is not granted prior to Closing, the Company shall seek to receive
prior to the Closing an interim tax ruling confirming that Parent and anyone
acting on its behalf shall be exempt from Israeli withholding tax in relation
to any payments made to the 102 Trustee (the " _Interim Option Ruling_ "). In
the event that the Israeli Option Tax Ruling has not been received by the
Closing, the Parent shall delay the assumption of the Company Compensatory
Awards held by Israeli residents until receipt of either the Israeli Option
Tax Ruling or a separate confirmation from the Israeli Tax Authority that
such assumption will not constitute a tax event in Israel. In the event that
the Israeli Option Tax Ruling has not been received within 180 days of the
Closing, and unless otherwise instructed by the Israeli Tax Authority, the
Parent will assume the Company Compensatory Awards as provided above and
shall withhold any amount that may be required under law. 

   

 (f) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, and in no event later than ten (10) Business Days thereafter, Parent shall file with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-8 with respect to the Parent Ordinary Shares issuable upon exercise or vesting of the Company Compensatory Awards assumed by Parent hereunder and Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement for so long as the Company Compensatory Awards remain outstanding. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Parent shall not issue any Parent Ordinary Shares in respect of any Company Compensatory Awards until the Form S-8 to be filed as herein provided has become effective. 

  

 6.6 _Directors and Officers Indemnification and Liability Insurance_. 

  

 (a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to fulfill and honor the obligations of the Company pursuant to any indemnification 

   ##### 

  

 

agreements of the Company, on the one hand, and any of its officers and
directors (collectively, the " _Indemnified Persons_ "), on the other hand
(the " _Indemnification Agreements_ "), which agreements shall survive the
Merger and continue in full force and effect in accordance with their
respective terms as in effect on the date of this Agreement, and
any indemnification, exculpation or advancement of expenses provisions under
the Articles of Association of the Company as in effect immediately prior to
the date hereof. 

   

 (b) Parent shall cause the Articles of Association of the Surviving Corporation to contain provisions with respect to indemnification and exemption that are at least as favorable to the Indemnified Persons as those contained in the Companys Articles of Association as in effect on the date hereof, which provisions will not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of seven years from the Effective Date in any manner that would adversely affect the rights of the Indemnified Persons thereunder, unless such modification is required by Legal Requirements. 

  

 (c) From the Effective Time until the seventh (7th) anniversary of the Effective Time, Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain in effect, for the benefit of the persons who were directors and executive officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time with respect to their acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time, any existing policy of directors and officers liability insurance maintained by the Company for the benefit of such directors and executive officers as of the date of this Agreement in the form or forms disclosed by the Company to Parent prior to the date of this Agreement (collectively the " _Existing Policy_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) the Surviving Corporation may substitute for the Existing Policy a policy or policies on comparably the same terms in the aggregate with respect to coverage and amount to those of the Existing Policy in effect on the date hereof, and (ii) the Surviving Corporation shall not be required to pay annual premiums for the Existing Policy (or for any substitute policies) in excess of two hundred percent (200%) of the aggregate premium paid by the Company and its Subsidiaries in the year ended December 31, 2009 for such coverage, _provided_ , _however_ , that in the event any future annual premiums for the Existing Policy (or any substitute policies) exceed such cap, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to reduce the amount of coverage of the Existing Policy (or any substitute policies) to the amount of coverage that can be obtained for a premium equal to such cap. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall have the right to, following notice to Parent, and shall at the request of Parent, purchase a "tail" directors and officers liability insurance policy, for a total premium in aggregate of no more than two hundred seventy-five percent (275%) of the aggregate premium paid by the Company and its Subsidiaries in the year ended December 31, 2009, covering the same persons and providing the same terms with respect to coverage and amount as aforesaid, and that by its terms shall provide coverage until the seventh (7th) anniversary of the Effective Time, and upon the purchase of such insurance Parents and the Surviving Corporations obligations pursuant to the first sentence of this  _Section 6.6(c)_ shall be deemed satisfied. 

  

 (d) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their successors or assigns shall (i) consolidate with or merge into any other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation shall assume all of the obligations of Parent and/or the Surviving Corporation set forth in this _Section 6.6_. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (e) The rights of each Indemnified Person under this _Section 6.6_ shall survive consummation of the Merger and are intended to benefit, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Person. Parent shall pay all reasonable expenses, including attorney fees, that may be incurred by any Indemnified Person in enforcing the indemnity and other obligations under this  _Section 6.6_.

 9.3 _Expenses; Termination Fees_. 

  

 (a) Except as set forth in this _Section 9.3_, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such expenses, whether or not the Merger is consummated; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that if this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant to  _Section 9.1(d)_, by Parent pursuant to _9.1(e)_ or _9.1(f)_ or by the Company pursuant to _Section_ _9.1(h)_ , then the Company shall make a nonrefundable cash payment to Parent, at the time specified in the next sentence, in the sum of $2.5 million (" _Expenses_ ") to compensate Parent for fees and expenses incurred by or on behalf of Parent in connection with the preparation and negotiation of this Agreement and otherwise in connection with the Merger. In the case of termination of this Agreement by the Company pursuant to  _Section 9.1(d)_ or _9.1(h)_ , the nonrefundable payment of Expenses pursuant to the proviso to the first sentence of this _Section 9.3_ shall be made by the Company concurrently with such termination; and in the case of termination of this Agreement by Parent pursuant to  _Section 9.1(d)_, _9.1(e)_ or _9.1(f)_ , the nonrefundable payment of Expenses pursuant to the proviso to the first sentence of this Section shall be made by the Company within two (2) Business Days after such termination. 

  

 (b) Without limiting the provisions of _Section 10.6_, if 

  

 (i) this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant to _Section 9.1(d)_ and (x) at or prior to the time of the Company General Meeting an Acquisition Proposal shall have been publicly announced and not publicly withdrawn, and (y) the Company enters into a binding agreement to consummate, or consummates, an Acquisition Transaction in respect of such Acquisition Proposal within twelve (12) months after the date of such termination (which for this purpose only, each reference to "85%" and "15%" appearing in the definition of an "Acquisition Transaction" shall be "50%"); or 

  

 (ii) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section 9.1(e)_, or 

  

 (iii) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to _Section 9.1(h)_; 

 

then (without limiting any liability of the Company for any breach by the
Company of any provision of this Agreement), in any such case, the Company
shall pay to Parent, in cash at the time specified in the next sentence, a
nonrefundable fee in the amount of $8,700,000 (the " _Fee_ ") less the amount

 (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, each of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges and agrees, on behalf of itself and its affiliates, that the Fee is not a penalty, but rather is liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent and Merger Sub in the circumstances in which the Fee is payable for the efforts and resources expended and opportunity forgone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the Merger, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision. 

  

 (d) In no event shall more than one (1) Fee be payable.
