Targets Subsidiaries that are parties thereto, as applicable, and, to
Targets Knowledge, is legal, valid, binding, enforceable and in full force
and effect with respect to each other party thereto, in either case subject
to the effect of bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium or other similar laws
affecting the enforcement of creditors rights generally and except as the
availability of equitable remedies 

 



37  may be limited by general principles of equity; (ii) the Material Contract
will continue to be legal, valid, binding and enforceable and in full force
and effect with respect to Target and any of Targets Subsidiaries that are
parties thereto, as applicable, and, to Targets Knowledge, will continue to

rights generally and except as the availability of equitable remedies may be
limited by general principles of equity; and (iii) neither Target nor any
Subsidiary of Target nor, to Targets Knowledge, any other party is in breach
or default of any Material Contract, and no event has occurred that with
notice or lapse of time would constitute a breach or default by Target, by any

permit termination, modification or acceleration, under such Material
Contract. Neither Target nor any Subsidiary of Target is a party to any
Material Contract that is not in writing. "Material Contract" means any
Contract to which Target is a party and that is not an Excluded Asset (A)
under which Target or its Subsidiaries have accounted for receipts or
expenditures in the twelve (12) months prior to the date of this Agreement, in

terminable at will, which will trigger no termination fees, or severance,
salary continuation or separation pay or benefits, other than as required by
Applicable Law and (ii) Target Employee Plans); (B) that is required to
be listed in Section 3.9 of the Target Disclosure Schedule; (C) requiring
Target or any Subsidiary of Target to indemnify any Person; (D) granting any

$25,000 or more; (F) involving any partnership, joint venture or limited
liability company agreement or concerning any equity or partnership interest
in another Person; (G) relating to the acquisition or disposition of any
material line of business (whether by merger, sale of stock, sale of assets or

with employees and Targets form of consulting or independent contractor
agreements); or (I) that would reasonably be expected to have a Target
Material Adverse Effect or its Subsidiaries if breached by Target or any of
its Subsidiaries in such a manner as would (1) permit any other party to
cancel or terminate the same (with or without notice of passage of time); (2)
provide a basis for any other party to claim money damages (either
individually or in the aggregate with all other such claims under that
contract) from Target or any Subsidiary of Target; or (3) give rise to a right
of acceleration of any material obligation or loss of any material benefit
under such Material Contract.

Disclosure Schedule, no prior consent of any party to a Material Contract is
required for the consummation by Target and its Subsidiaries of the
transactions contemplated hereby to be in compliance with the provisions of
such Material Contract or to avoid the termination of, the loss of any right
under or the incurrence of any obligation under, such Material Contract.

collectively, "Leases") to which Target or any Subsidiary of Target is a party
are in full force and effect and are valid, binding and enforceable in
accordance with their respective terms, except as such enforceability may be
limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium or other similar laws affecting
or relating to creditors rights generally; and general principles of equity,
regardless of whether asserted in a proceeding in equity or at law. True and
correct copies of all such Leases

 



38  have been provided to Acquiror. Target and its applicable Subsidiaries have
paid all rents and material service charges to the extent such rents and
material charges are due and payable under the Leases. Neither Target nor any

genuine, have arisen solely out of bona fide sales and deliveries of goods,
performance of services, and other business transactions in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practices in each case with persons
other than Affiliates, are not subject to any prior assignment, lien or
security interest, and are not subject to valid defenses, set-offs or counter
claims. To the Knowledge of Target, the accounts receivable are collectible
in accordance with their terms at their recorded amounts, subject only to the
reserve for doubtful accounts on the Target Financial Statements.

 

3.18 _Customers and Suppliers; Adequacy of Supply_. None of Targets top ten
(10) customers by revenue (each a "Top Customer") and none of Targets top
ten (10) suppliers by expenditures (each a "Top Supplier"), in each case for

amounts received by or paid to such party, has canceled or otherwise
terminated, or made any written threat or notice to Target or any Subsidiary
of Target to cancel or otherwise terminate its relationship with Target or any
Subsidiary of Target, or has at any time on or after the Target Balance Sheet

materially its services or supplies to Target or any Subsidiary of Target in
the case of any such Top Supplier, or its usage of the services or products
of Target or any Subsidiary of Target in the case of such Top Customer.
Neither Target nor any Subsidiary of Target has Knowingly breached any
Contract between Target or a Subsidiary of Target and any Top Customer or Top
Supplier of Target or any Subsidiary of Target, so as to provide a benefit to
Target or any Subsidiary of Target that was not intended by the parties to
such Contract, or engaged in any fraudulent conduct with respect to, such Top
Customer or Top Supplier. Target has not received written notice from any Top
Supplier of any failure in Targets ability to obtain from such Top Supplier,

manufacture, assembly or production of any Target Product.

absence status and current positions. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence,
Section 3.19 of the Target Disclosure Schedule shall not include monetary
compensation paid to current natural persons who are independent contractors
or who are providing services directly or indirectly as consultants;

individual or has contracted the services of such individual, as applicable.

with respect to leased properties and assets, valid leasehold interests
therein, free and clear of all Encumbrances of any kind or character, except
(a) liens for current taxes not yet due and payable; (b) such imperfections

properties; (c) liens securing debt that is reflected on the Target Balance
Sheet; and (d) such other mortgages, liens, pledges, charges or encumbrances

in any payment (including severance, change of control, golden parachute,
bonus, tax gross up, or otherwise), becoming due 

 



46  to any current or former employee, director or consultant, (ii) result in
any forgiveness of Indebtedness of any current or former employee, director or
consultant, (iii) materially increase any benefits otherwise payable by
Target or any of its Subsidiaries to any current or former employee, director
or consultant or (iv) result in the acceleration of the time of payment or
vesting of any such benefits to any current or former employee, director or
consultant except as required under Section 411(d)(3) of the Code (any of the
foregoing a "Change of Control Liability").

 

(j) _Parachute Payments_. There is no agreement, plan, arrangement or other
contract covering any employee, including arrangements contemplated by this
Agreement, that, considered individually or considered collectively with any
other such agreements, plans, arrangements or other contracts, will, or could
be expected to, give rise directly or indirectly to the payment of any amount
that would be characterized as a "parachute payment" within the meaning of
Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code. There is no agreement, plan, arrangement or
other contract by which Target or any Subsidiary of Target is bound
to compensate any Person for excise taxes paid pursuant to Section 4999 of
the Code. Section 3.23(j) of the Target Disclosure Schedule lists all Persons
who are "disqualified individuals" (within the meaning of Section 280G of the

hereof.

(k) _Deferred Compensation_. No compensation shall be includable in the gross
income of any current or former employee, director or consultant of Target or
any of its Subsidiaries, or their respective Affiliates, as a result of the
operation of Sections 409A or 457A of the Code with respect to any applicable
arrangements or agreements in effect prior to the Effective Time. No stock
options, stock appreciation rights or other equity-based awards issued or
granted by Target or any Subsidiary of Target are treated as deferred
compensation arrangements subject to the requirements of Sections 409A or 457A
of the Code. Each "nonqualified deferred compensation plan" (as such term is
defined under Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code and the guidance thereunder and
under Section 457A of the Code and the guidance thereunder) under which Target
or any of its Subsidiaries makes, is obligated to make or promises to make,
payments (each, a "409A Plan") complies, in both form and operation, with the
requirements of Sections 409A and 457A of the Code and the guidance
thereunder. Section 3.23(k) of the Target Disclosure Schedule lists each 409A
Plan under which Target, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
Affiliates makes, is obligated to make or promises to make, payments. No
payment to be made under any 409A Plan is or will be subject to tax or
penalties under Section 409A(a)(1) of the Code or 457A of the Code, and there
is no agreement, plan, arrangement or other contract by which Target or any
Subsidiary of Target is bound to compensate any Person for taxes or penalties
paid pursuant to Sections 409A or 457A of the Code. No Target Option has been
granted to U.S. employees that (i) has had an exercise price that was or may
reasonably have been less than the fair market value of the underlying equity
as of the date such Target Option was granted, as determined for purposes of
Section 409A of the Code, (ii) has any feature for the deferral of
compensation other than the deferral of recognition of income until the later
of exercise or disposition of such Target Option, or (iii) has been granted or
modified after December 31, 2004, with respect to any class of stock that is
not "service recipient stock" (within the meaning of the regulations under
Section 409A of the Code).

 

(l) _Employment Matters_. Target and its Subsidiaries are in compliance in all
material respects with all applicable foreign, federal, state and local laws,

case, with respect to employees: (i) are not liable for any arrears of wages,
severance pay or any Taxes or any penalty for failure to comply with any of
the foregoing, and (ii) are not liable for any payment to any trust or other
fund governed by or maintained by or on behalf of any Governmental Entity,

benefits or obligations for employees (other than routine payments to be made
in the normal course of business and consistent with past practice). There are
no pending or, to Targets Knowledge, threatened, or reasonably anticipated,
claims or actions against Target, any Subsidiary of Target, or any trustee of
Target or of a Subsidiary of Target under any workers compensation policy.
The services provided by the U.S. employees of Target and its Subsidiaries
are terminable at the will of Target and its Subsidiaries and any such
termination would result in no liability to Target or any Subsidiary of
Target. Neither Target, nor any Subsidiary of Target, nor any ERISA Affiliate
has direct or indirect liability with respect to any misclassification of any
Person as an independent contractor rather than as an employee, or with
respect to any employee leased from another employer.

 

(m) _Labor_. No work stoppage or labor strike against Target or any Subsidiary
of Target is pending, or, to the Knowledge of Target, threatened, or
reasonably anticipated. Target has no Knowledge of any activities or
proceedings of any labor union to organize any employees. There are no
actions, suits, claims, labor disputes or grievances pending or, to Targets
Knowledge, threatened, or reasonably anticipated relating to any labor
matters involving any employee, including charges of unfair labor practices.
Neither Target nor any Subsidiary of Target has engaged in any unfair labor
practices within the meaning of the National Labor Relations Act. Neither
Target nor any Subsidiary of Target presently is, nor has it been in the past,
a party to, or bound by, any collective bargaining agreement, works council

terms of such agreement, procedure or contract are dictated by Applicable Law
and not subject to negotiation by the employer, in any other jurisdiction with
respect to employees and no collective bargaining agreement is
being negotiated by Target or any Subsidiary of Target. Within the past year,
neither Target nor any Subsidiary of Target has incurred any liability or
obligation under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act
("WARN") or any similar state or local law that remains unsatisfied, nor
shall any terminations prior to the Closing Date result in unsatisfied
liability or obligation under WARN or any similar state or local law.

 

(n) _No Conflict_. To the Knowledge of Target, no director, officer, employee
or natural person providing services directly or indirectly as a consultant
(for this paragraph "consultant") of Target or any Subsidiary of Target is
obligated under any Contract, or subject to any judgment, decree, or order of
any court or administrative agency, that would conflict with such Persons
efforts to promote the interests of Target and its Subsidiaries or that would
interfere with the Target Business. Neither the execution nor delivery of this
Agreement, nor the carrying on of the Target Business as presently conducted
or proposed to be conducted nor any activity of such officers, directors,
employees or consultants in connection with the carrying on of the Target
Business as presently conducted or currently proposed to be conducted will, to
the Knowledge of Target, conflict with or result in a breach of the terms,
conditions, or provisions of, or constitute a default under, any contract or
agreement under which any of such officers, directors, employees, or
consultants is now bound.

circumstance whereby any employee of Target or any of Subsidiary of Target
might validly demand any claim for compensation upon termination of employment
beyond the statutory severance pay or benefits to which such employee is

(t) _Other_. Take or agree in writing or otherwise to take, or permit any of
its Subsidiaries to take, any of the actions described in Sections 5.1(a)

Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 5.1, solely with
respect to the Excluded Business, Target shall be permitted to take, and to

termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1 and the Effective Time,

stock or equity of Targets Subsidiaries or any material assets (any of the
foregoing an "Acquisition Proposal"); or (ii) agree to, enter into, accept,
approve or recommend any Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that

without payment of any fee or other penalty.

 

(b) Target shall notify Acquiror promptly (and no later than twenty-four (24)
hours) after receipt by Target (or its Representatives) of any Acquisition
Proposal or any request for nonpublic information in connection with an
Acquisition Proposal or for access to the properties, books or records of
Target by any Person or entity that informs Target that it is considering
making, or has made, an Acquisition Proposal; _provided, however_ , that this
sentence shall not apply to an Acquisition Proposal that solely relates to the

and conditions of such proposal, inquiry or contact, including the proposed
price.

of this Agreement take all action necessary in accordance with Delaware Law,
other Applicable Law and the Restated Certificate and Bylaws of Target to
obtain Executed Written Consents executed by (i) the executive officers of

(a) Subject to compliance with Applicable Law, Target shall afford Acquiror
and its accountants, counsel and other Representatives, reasonable access
during normal business hours during the period until the earlier of the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1 and the Effective Time
to (i) all of Targets properties, personnel, books, contracts,
commitments and records, and (ii) all other information concerning the
business, properties and personnel of Target as Acquiror may reasonably
request.

 

(b) Subject to compliance with Applicable Law, from the date hereof until the

frequent basis with one or more representatives of the other party to report
operational matters of materiality and the general status of
ongoing operations.

(c) No information or Knowledge obtained in any investigation pursuant to this
Section 6.3 or otherwise shall affect or be deemed to modify any
representation or warranty contained herein or the conditions to the
obligations of the parties to consummate the Merger.

 



58 6.4 _Confidentiality_. The parties acknowledge that Acquiror (or one of its
Affiliates) and Target have previously executed a Non-Disclosure Agreement
dated December 1, 2013 (the "Confidentiality Agreement"), which
Confidentiality Agreement is hereby incorporated herein by reference and shall
continue in full force and effect in accordance with its terms, as if such
Confidentiality Agreement were entered into directly by each of the parties
hereto.

 

6.5 _Public Disclosure_. Acquiror and Target shall consult with each other
before issuing any press release or otherwise making any public statement or
making any other public (or non-confidential) disclosure (whether or not in
response to an inquiry) regarding the terms of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, and neither shall issue any such press
release or make any such statement or disclosure without the prior approval
of the other, except as may be required by Applicable Law or by obligations
pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities exchange.

 

6.6 _Regulatory Approval; Further Assurances_.

 

(a) Each party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to file, as promptly
as practicable after the date of this Agreement, all notices, reports and
other documents required to be filed by such party with any Governmental
Entity with respect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and to submit promptly any additional information requested by
any such Governmental Entity, including any Premerger Notification and Report
Forms required to be filed with the Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust
Division of the United States Department of Justice in order to comply with
the HSR Act. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Acquiror and
Target shall take commercially reasonable actions and shall file and use
commercially reasonable efforts (i) to have declared complete all documents
and notifications with any such Governmental Entity, as may be required under
the HSR Act and (ii) to obtain an early termination of the applicable waiting
period. Subject to Sections 6.6(c) and 6.6(d), Target and Acquiror shall
respond as promptly as practicable to (1) any inquiries or requests received
from the Federal Trade Commission or the Department of Justice for additional
information or documentation and (2) any inquiries or requests received from
any state attorney general or other Governmental Entity in connection with
antitrust or related matters. Each of Target and Acquiror shall (i) give the
other party prompt notice of the commencement of any legal proceeding by or
before any Governmental Entity with respect to the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) keep the other party
informed as to the status of any such legal proceeding, and (iii) promptly
inform the other party of any communication to or from the Federal Trade
Commission, the Department of Justice or any other Governmental Entity
regarding the Merger.

(b) Subject to Sections 6.6(c) and 6.6(d), Acquiror and Target shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions
necessary to effectuate the Merger and make effective the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, but subject to Sections 6.6(c) and 6.6(d), each party to this
Agreement shall: (i) make any filings and give any notices required to be made
and

 



59  given by such party in connection with the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; (ii) use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain any consent required to be obtained (pursuant to any applicable legal
requirement or contract, or otherwise) by such party in connection with the
Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
_provided_ , _however_ , neither party shall be required to pay any fees to
obtain any such consents; and (iii) use commercially reasonable efforts to
lift any restraint, injunction or other legal bar to the Merger. Each party,
at the reasonable request of the other party, shall execute and deliver such
other instruments and do and perform such other acts and things as may be
necessary or desirable for effecting completely the consummation of this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

(c) Each of Acquiror and Target shall use its commercially reasonable efforts
to resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted by any Governmental
Entity with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under
the HSR Act, the Sherman Act, as amended, the Clayton Act, as amended, the
Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, and any other federal, state or
foreign statutes, rules, regulations, orders or decrees that are designed to
prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or effect of
monopolization or restraint of trade (collectively, "Antitrust Laws"). In
connection therewith, if any administrative or judicial action or proceeding
is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging any transaction
contemplated by this Agreement as violative of any Antitrust Law, each of
Acquiror and Target shall cooperate and use its commercially reasonable
efforts to vigorously contest and resist any such action or proceeding and to
have vacated, lifted, reversed, or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction
or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in
effect and that prohibits, prevents, or restricts consummation of any such
transaction.

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, Acquiror shall not have any obligation under this Agreement
to: (i) dispose or transfer or cause any of its Subsidiaries to dispose of or
transfer any assets, or to commit to cause Target to dispose of any assets;
(ii) discontinue or cause any of its Subsidiaries to discontinue offering any
product or service, or commit to cause Target to discontinue offering any
product or service; (iii) license or otherwise make available, or cause any
of its Subsidiaries to license or otherwise make available, to any Person, any
technology, software or other Proprietary Rights, or commit to cause Target to
license or otherwise make available to any Person any technology, software or
other Proprietary Rights; (iv) hold separate or cause any of its Subsidiaries
to hold separate any assets or operations (either before or after the Closing
Date), or commit to cause Target to hold separate any assets or operations;
or (v) make or cause any of its Subsidiaries to make any commitment (to any
Governmental Entity or otherwise) regarding its future operations or the
future operations of Target.

 

6.7 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Each of Target and Acquiror shall give
immediate notice to the other if any of the following occurs after the date
of this Agreement and prior to the termination of this Agreement or the
Effective Time: (a) receipt of any notice of, or other communication relating
to, a default, or event which with notice or lapse of time or both
would become a default, under any Material Contract; (b) receipt of any
notice or other communication in writing from any Person alleging that the
consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the

 



60  transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (c) receipt of any notice or
other written communication from any Governmental Entity in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (d) the occurrence or non-
occurrence of any fact or event which would reasonably be expected to cause
any condition hereunder not to be or satisfied; (e) the commencement or threat
of any action involving or affecting Target or any of its properties or
assets; (f) the occurrence or non-occurrence of any fact or event that causes
a material breach by Target or Acquiror of any provision of this Agreement
applicable to it; (g) the occurrence of any fact or event of which such party
becomes aware that results in the inaccuracy in any representation or warranty
of such party in this Agreement; and (h) the occurrence of any event that, had
it occurred prior to the date of this Agreement without any additional
disclosure hereunder, would have constituted a Material Adverse Effect of
Target or Acquiror; _provided_ , that the delivery of any notice by any party
pursuant to this provision shall not modify any representation or warranty of
such party, cure any breaches thereof or limit or otherwise affect the rights
or remedies available hereunder to the other parties and the failure of the
party receiving such information to take any action with respect to such
notice shall not be deemed a waiver of any breach or breaches to the
representations or warranties of the party disclosing such information.

6.8 _Cancellation of Target Options_. No Target Options, whether vested or
unvested, shall be assumed by Acquiror in the Merger.

6.9 _Employees_.

 

(a) From the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the termination of
this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1 or the Effective Time, Target will use
commercially reasonable efforts in consultation with Acquiror to retain the
Key Employees through the Effective Time and following the Merger.

 

(b) All employees of Target or its Subsidiaries who will (i) be terminated by
Target immediately prior to the Effective Time, conditioned on the Closing
(the "Terminating Employees"), (ii) have their employment transferred to or
continued with SpinCo or a SpinCo Subsidiary pursuant to the Asset Transfer
Agreement (the "Transferred Employees"), or (iii) remain or continue as
employees of Acquiror, Target or their respective Subsidiaries immediately
after the Effective Time (the "Continuing Employees"), including
identification of employees who will continue on a transitional basis (the
"Transition Employees"), will be provided to Acquiror as soon as practicable
following the date hereof. Target shall deliver to all Terminating Employees,
to the extent required by Applicable Law, all earned but unpaid wages and
bonuses, and accrued but unused vacation, sick leave and PTO or other
benefits, in each case, earned, accrued or mandated for payment under
Applicable Law through the Closing Date ("Accrued Employee Liabilities"),
which, together with all unpaid Accrued Employee Liabilities related to the
Transferred Employees which are payable by Target, shall be treated as a
Target Transaction Expense hereunder. Target shall identify the Accrued
Employee Liabilities in writing to Acquiror prior to the Closing Date. Prior
to and as a condition of any U.S. Terminating Employee receiving or becoming
eligible to receive any severance payment or other similar benefits or
compensation due to his or her termination of employment with Target and its
Subsidiaries, such U.S. Terminating Employee will be required to execute (and
not revoke, if applicable) and return a general release and waiver of claims
in favor of Target, Acquiror, the Surviving Corporation and each of their
Affiliates ("Waiver").

 



61 (c) Any and all unpaid severance pay or other Change of Control Liabilities
and other benefits payable pursuant to Section 6.9(b) hereof that are payable
by Target, other than as a result of action of or on behalf of Acquiror or its
Subsidiaries relating to the Continuing Employees after the Closing
(collectively, the "Severance Costs") shall be identified in writing to
Acquiror prior to the Closing Date and shall be treated as a Target
Transaction Expense hereunder.

 

(d) Except as set forth in Section 6.9(d) of the Target Disclosure Schedule,
effective no later than the day immediately preceding the Closing Date for
any 401(k) Plan and immediately prior to the Effective Time with respect to
any Target Employee Plan that is not a 401(k) Plan, and contingent upon the
Closing, and subject to local law, Target and any ERISA Affiliate shall
approve all necessary corporate action to terminate, and with respect to any
Target Employee Plan that is not a 401(k) Plan shall use reasonable best
efforts to take any other appropriate actions to effectuate the termination
of, all Target Employee Plans, whether or not an ERISA benefit plan, program
or arrangement, including any Target Employee Plans intended to include a Code
Section 401(k) arrangement (each a "401(k) Plan") such that Target and its
ERISA Affiliates shall have no continuing liability thereunder (including
liabilities relating to services performed prior to the Closing) (unless
Acquiror provides written notice to Target that any such Target Employee Plans
shall not be terminated, which written notice shall be provided at least five
(5) Business Days prior to the Closing or such other time period that the
parties may mutually and reasonably agree). Target shall provide Acquiror with
evidence that such Target Employee Plan(s) has been terminated (effective no
later than the day immediately preceding the Closing Date for any 401(k)Plan
and no later than immediately prior to the Effective Time with respect to any
Target Employee Plan that is not a 401(k) Plan) pursuant to resolutions of
the Board of Directors or any applicable committee thereof. The form and
substance of such resolutions shall be subject to reasonable review and
approval by Acquiror. Target also shall take such other actions in furtherance
of terminating such plans as Acquiror may reasonably require. In the event
that termination of a 401(k) Plan would reasonably be anticipated to trigger
liquidation charges, surrender charges or other fees then Target shall take
such actions as are necessary to reasonably estimate the amount of such
charges and/or fees and provide such estimate in writing to Acquiror no later
than fifteen (15) calendar days prior to the Closing Date.

 

(e) Acquiror agrees that, subject to Applicable Law, it shall, or cause an
Acquiror subsidiary (including without limitation the Surviving Corporation)
to, provide all employees listed on Section 6.9(b) of the Target Disclosure
Schedule who (i) have not terminated their employment with Target or its
Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time, (ii) are not Transferred Employees
and (iii) are Continuing Employees, the ability to participate in the
retirement, health, vacation and other non-equity based employee benefit plans
of Acquiror that are generally made available by Acquiror to similarly
situated employees of Acquiror, subject to the terms and conditions of each
such plan (other than with respect to equity-based benefits) (the "Acquiror
Benefit Plans") and/or continue, in the discretion of Acquiror, participation
in Target Employee Plans. No later than six (6) months following the
Effective Time, Acquiror shall offer cash retention bonuses totaling no less
than $4,000,000, to certain of the Continuing Employees and in individual
amounts determined by the Acquiror in its sole discretion. Such retention
bonuses shall be paid over a period of two years beginning at the Effective
Time based solely on continued employment. Acquiror will review with Target
the retention amounts that it has allocated to certain of the Continuing
Employees prior to Closing to the extent that such allocations have been made.
For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Section 6.9(e) shall require
Acquiror to adopt any retention policy, plan, arrangement or program. 

 



62 (f) To the extent that Acquiror provides the Continuing Employees compensation
and benefits through the Acquiror Benefit Plans, Acquiror shall provide
credit for service accrued by the Continuing Employees (and their eligible
dependents) for employment with Target and its subsidiaries (and their
predecessors) prior to the Effective Time for purposes of eligibility and
vesting (but not with respect to the accrual of any benefits or to the extent
necessary to prevent duplication of benefits). Effective as of, and following,
the Closing, to the extent permitted or required by Applicable Law, Acquiror
will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause any Acquiror Benefit Plan in
which any Continuing Employee participates that is a group health plan
(collectively, "Acquiror Welfare Plans") to (i) waive all limitations as to
preexisting conditions, requirements for insurability, exclusions and service
conditions with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable
to Continuing Employees (and eligible dependents) but only to the extent that
such limitations did not apply or were satisfied under the group health plan
maintained by Target prior to the Closing, and (ii) honor any payments,
charges and expenses of such Continuing Employees (and eligible dependents)
that were applied toward the deductible and out-of-pocket maximums for the
calendar year in which the Closing occurs under the corresponding Target
Benefit Plan in satisfying any applicable deductibles, out-of-pocket maximums
or co-payments under a corresponding Acquiror Welfare Plan during the
calendar year in which the Closing occurs.

(g) Any and all (i) unpaid Accrued Employee Liabilities related to the
Continuing Employees, other than vacation, sick leave and PTO, and (ii) unpaid
payments under the Key Employee Retention Plan related to the Continuing
Employees and severance payable to Transition Employees shall be identified
in writing to Acquiror prior to the Closing Date and shall be treated as a
Target Transaction Expense hereunder.

 

(h) Within ten (10) Business Days following the Closing Date, as an inducement
to their employment with Acquiror, Continuing Employees will be awarded
Acquiror RSUs in individual amounts determined by the Acquiror in its sole
discretion, subject to all of the terms and conditions set forth therein, by
the compensation committee of Acquirors board of directors. For
the avoidance of any doubt, the total number of Acquiror RSUs allocated shall
represent an aggregate of 1,000,000 shares of Acquiror Stock and shall be
proportionally adjusted for any change in the capitalization (including
without limitation any stock split or reverse stock split) of Acquiror that
occurs prior to the grant date of such Acquiror RSUs. Such Acquiror RSUs will
be subject to all of the terms and conditions set forth in the recipients
offer letter or employment agreement with Acquiror and a standard form
restricted stock unit agreement to be entered into between each recipient and
Acquiror, as may be modified to reflect the recipients offer letter or
employment agreement not inconsistent with the terms of the Agreement. The
vesting conditions shall be based solely on continued employment.

(i) Nothing in this Section 6.9 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall
constitute an amendment to, or be construed as amending, modifying or
terminating any benefit plan, program, arrangement or agreement, or be
construed to create a right in any employee of Target or Acquiror to
employment with Acquiror, the Surviving Corporation, Target or any other
Subsidiary or ERISA Affiliate of Acquiror or Target and, subject to any other
binding written

 



63  agreement between an employee and Acquiror, the employment of each U.S.
Continuing Employee shall be "at will" employment. Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, no Continuing Employee or other employee of
the Target or any of its Subsidiaries, or any beneficiary or dependent
thereof, will be deemed to be a third-party beneficiary of this Section 6.9 or
any other provision of this Agreement.

 

(j) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Acquiror agrees and acknowledges that
Acquiror shall be responsible for providing notices and making available the
group health care continuation coverage under COBRA (and any state law
equivalent) for (i) all of the Continuing Employees and former Continuing
Employees (and their respective covered dependents), whose qualifying events
(as defined in Code Section 4980B) occur on or after the Effective Time; and
(ii) any other employee of Target or an ERISA Affiliates or former employee of
Target or its ERISA Affiliates (and their respective eligible covered
dependents for whom Acquiror is required to offer or otherwise provide group
health continuation under COBRA or any state law equivalent and the parties
agree that for this purpose, the parties intend that SpinCo is not deemed to
be the "selling group" for purposes of Treasury regulation Section
54.4980B-9; provided that, the Target shall provide Acquiror with the records
necessary to identify and administer such responsibilities.

 

(k) Acquiror and SpinCo shall cooperate in all respects to insure that their
actions do not trigger obligations under WARN or any similar state or local
law. At the Closing, Target shall provide Acquiror with a complete list, by
employee name, date and location, of all U.S. employees of Target or its
Subsidiaries who have suffered an "Employment Loss," as such term is defined
in WARN in the ninety (90)-day period preceding the Closing (including the
Terminating Employees) which shall not number greater than forty (40) at any
"Single Site of Employment" (as such term is defined in WARN ), unless WARN
notices have been provided to such employees in compliance with WARN or any
similar state or local law). During the ninety (90)-day period following the
Closing, Acquiror and SpinCo shall provide each other with notice
(including employee ID, date and location) of the termination of any U.S.
employees of Acquiror, SpinCo, Target or its Subsidiaries, as the case may be,
under circumstances that might constitute an Employment Loss. Acquiror and
SpinCo agree to work together in good faith in the ninety (90)-day period
following the Closing to minimize the likelihood that WARN is triggered.
Nothing in this Section 6.9(k) shall be deemed to obligate any acquiror of
SpinCo or a buyer of SpinCos assets to comply with SpinCos obligations
under this section.

(l) Acquiror and Target agree that any liability incurred as a result of
triggering WARN in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall be borne by Acquiror and the Indemnifying Parties pro rata
based on the following: As to Acquiror, the sum of the number of Continuing
Employees in the Sunnyvale, CA location who are not Transition Employees, and
50% of the Transition Employees in the Sunnyvale, CA location, divided by the
total number of Continuing Employees, Terminated Employees and Transferred
Employees, in each case, in the Sunnyvale, CA location (the "Total WARN
Employee Base"), and as to the Indemnifying Parties, the sum of the number of
Transferred Employees in the Sunnyvale, CA location, Terminating Employees in
the Sunnyvale, CA location, and 50% of the Transition Employees in the
Sunnyvale, CA location, divided by the Total WARN Employee Base, in each case
as measured under WARN (the "WARN Pro Rata Liability").

 



64 (m) Target and Acquiror shall use reasonable best efforts to give any notices
required by law and take whatever other actions with respect to the plans,
programs, arrangements and policies described in this Section 6.9 as may be
reasonably appropriate or necessary to carry out the arrangements described in
this Section 6.9.

 

(n) Between the date hereof and the Closing Date, Target and Acquiror shall
provide each other with such plan documents and descriptions, employee data
or other information shall otherwise cooperate with each other as may be
reasonably required to carry out the intent of the arrangements described in
this Section 6.9, subject to Applicable Law, including data privacy rules.
In addition, between the date hereof and the Closing Date, (i) Target shall
not, and shall not cause its subsidiaries and controlled Affiliates to
(without obtaining the prior written consent of Acquiror), directly or
indirectly, solicit for employment or hire any of the Continuing Employees,
or in any way intentionally interfere with Acquirors offer and hiring process
with respect to the Continuing Employees, and (ii) Target shall use reasonable
good faith efforts to assist Acquiror (as and to the extent reasonably
requested by Acquiror) in effectuating the acceptance by the Continuing
Employees of Acquirors offer of employment to them.

 

(o) _Section 280G Matters_

 

(i) Target will obtain and deliver to Acquiror, prior to the initiation of the
procedure described in subsection (ii) of this Section 6.9(a), an excess
parachute payment waiver, in the form previously approved by Acquiror, from
each Person who Target reasonably believes is, with respect to Target or any
of its Subsidiaries, a "disqualified individual" (within the meaning of
Section 280G of the Code) with respect to the Merger and who would otherwise
receive or have the right or entitlement to receive a "parachute payment" (as
defined in Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code) from Target or any of its
Subsidiaries, or from Acquiror or any trade or business (whether or not
incorporated) that is a member of a controlled group or which is under common
control with Acquiror within the meaning of Section 414 of the Code, under
Section 280G of the Code as a result of the Closing or the consummation of the
Merger or the Spin-Off Transaction (including in connection with certain
changes in any such Persons employment circumstances following the
consummation of the Merger or the Spin-Off Transaction). By the execution of
such waiver agreement, the Person executing the waiver will agree to waive all
of his or her right and entitlement to receive (or if already paid, his or her
right and entitlement to keep) any portion of such "parachute payments" which
would cause the Person executing the waiver to receive an "excess parachute
payment" (as defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code), unless Targets
stockholders approve such waived payments in accordance with Section
280G(b)(5)(A)(ii) of the Code.

(ii) Target will submit the payments which are waived pursuant to the waiver
agreements described in subsection (i) of this Section 6.9(a) to its
stockholders and the holders of the voting power of any entity stockholder for
their approval in accordance with all applicable requirements of such Section
280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder, including
Q-7 of Section 1.280G-1 of such Treasury Regulations.

 

6.10 _Spin-Off Transaction_. For purposes of establishing a separate entity to
operate what is now Targets Access and Digital Home businesses, as such
businesses are more particularly described in _Schedule 6.10_ (collectively,
the "Excluded Business"), and ensuring that such Excluded Business will not be
part of the business of the Surviving Corporation after the Effective Time,
prior to the Closing:

(a) Target shall form a company ("SpinCo") as its wholly-owned subsidiary
pursuant to organizational documents substantially in the form attached hereto
as _Exhibit F_;

 



65 (b) Target, the applicable Subsidiaries of Target, and SpinCo shall enter into
an Asset Transfer Agreement substantially in the form attached hereto as
_Exhibit G_; and

(c) SpinCo, the Surviving Corporation and, as applicable, Acquiror shall
enter into a License Agreement and a Transition Services Agreement
substantially in the form attached hereto as _Exhibits H-1 and H-2_,
respectively, each of which will take effect at the Effective Time (the "Spin
Effective Time) and be subject to consummation of the Merger.

The agreements and other documents referred to in the foregoing Subsections
(a), (b) and (c) of this Section 6.10 shall be referred to collectively as the
"Spin-Off Documentation". The parties hereto shall cooperate reasonably with
each other and with the respective Representatives of the other parties in
connection with any documents to be executed or other actions to be taken as
may be necessary or advisable for purposes of consummating the Spin-Off
Transaction.

 

6.11 _Expenses_. Whether or not the Merger or the Spin-Off Transaction is
consummated, all Transaction Expenses and any other costs and expenses
incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such expense. For purposes of
clarity, and notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) any unpaid Target
Transaction Expenses, which shall include those Transaction Expenses set
forth on _Schedule 6.11_ attached hereto and any other items explicitly
designated as Target Transaction Expenses hereunder, shall be deducted from
the Cash Amount paid hereunder, as provided in the applicable provisions of
this Agreement, and (ii) neither the Surviving Corporation nor Acquiror shall
be responsible for payment or reimbursement of the Target Transaction
Expenses.

 

6.12 _Contract Consents_. Target shall use its commercially reasonable efforts
to obtain all of the consents set forth in Section 3.15(b) of the Target
Disclosure Schedule.

6.13 _Contract Termination_. Each of the Contracts listed or described on 
_Schedule 6.13_ shall have been terminated, and Target shall have delivered
to Acquiror documentation satisfactory to Acquiror of such termination.

 

6.14 _Tax Matters_.

(a)  _No Changes_. Without the prior written consent of Acquiror (which shall
not be unreasonably withheld), from the date hereof through the Closing Date,
Target shall not make or change any election, change an annual accounting
period, adopt or change any accounting method, file any amended Return, enter
into any closing agreement, settle any Tax claim or assessment, surrender any
right to claim a refund of Taxes, or consent to any extension or waiver of the
limitation period applicable to any Tax claim or assessment relating to
Target.

 



66 (b) _Allocation of Taxes_. In the case of any Taxes that are imposed on a
periodic basis and are payable for a Tax period that includes (but does not
end on) the Closing Date (the "Straddle Period"), the portion of such Tax
which relates to the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall (i) in the case of any Taxes
other than Taxes based upon or related to income, gains or receipts, be
deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire Straddle Period multiplied
by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days in the Pre-Closing
Tax Period and the denominator of which is the number of days in the entire
Straddle Period, and (ii) in the case of any Tax based upon or related to
income, gains or receipts be deemed equal to the amount which would be payable
if the relevant Straddle Period ended on the Closing Date.

(c) _Preparation of Returns_. Acquiror shall prepare or cause to be prepared
and file or cause to be filed all Returns for Target for the Pre-Closing Tax
Period and Straddle Period that are required to be filed after the Closing
Date. All Returns filed by Acquiror after the Closing Date will be prepared in
a manner consistent with the past practice and custom of Target to the extent
consistent with Applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that any income Tax
Return reflecting the Spin-Off Transaction shall be prepared in a manner
consistent with the tax reporting methodology set forth in the Spin-Off
Documentation. Acquiror shall permit the Stockholders Agent to review and
comment on each income Tax Return relating to or including a Pre-Closing Tax
Period prior to filing and shall make such revisions to such Tax Returns
as reasonably requested.

(d) _Tax Contests_. After the Closing Date, Acquiror, Target and the
Stockholders Agent, respectively, shall inform the other party in writing of
the commencement of any audit, examination, proceeding or self-assessment
relating in whole or in part to Taxes for a Pre-Closing Tax Period ("Tax
Contest") for which Acquiror may be entitled to indemnity from the
Indemnifying Parties under this Agreement. After the Closing Date, Acquiror
shall have the exclusive right to represent the interests of Target in any and
all Tax Contests; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Stockholders Agent shall
have the right to participate in any such Tax Contest and to employ counsel at
its own expense of its choice (which counsel shall be reasonably acceptable to
Acquiror) for purposes of such participation to the extent that any such Tax
Contest would reasonably be expected to result in a Tax indemnification
liability of the Indemnifying Parties pursuant to this Agreement. In the event
that Acquiror proposes to compromise or settle any Tax Contest, or consent
or agree to any Tax liability, relating to Target that would result in an
indemnity payment by the Indemnifying Parties, the Stockholders Agent shall
have the right to review such proposed compromise, settlement, consent or
agreement. Acquiror shall not agree or consent to compromise or settle any
Tax Contest on a basis that would result in a liability of the Indemnifying
Parties for indemnification unless the Stockholders Agent consents to such
settlement, compromise or concession, which consent will not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed. The provisions of this Section 6.14(d) shall
govern rather than the provisions of Section 9.9 in the event of any conflict.

 

(e) _Cooperation_. Acquiror, Target and the Stockholders Agent shall
cooperate fully as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other party
in connection with the preparation and filing of any Return required of
Target, and the defense of any Tax Contest, claim, audit, litigation or other
proceeding, with respect to Taxes which may be payable by Target for a Pre-
Closing Tax Period. Acquiror, Target and the Stockholders Agent agree to
abide by all record retention requirements of, or record retention agreements
entered into with, any Tax authority.

 



67 (f) _Certain Taxes and Fees_. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration, value added and other such Taxes, and all conveyance fees,
recording charges and other fees and charges (including any penalties and
interest) incurred in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall be borne and paid by the Indemnifying
Parties when due. The party responsible under Applicable Law for submitting
payment of such Taxes to the applicable Tax authority shall file all necessary
Returns and other documentation with respect to all such transfer,
documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other Taxes and fees. If
required by Applicable Law, Acquiror or Target shall join in the execution of
any such Returns and other documentation.

 

(g) _Pre-Closing Tax Estimated Amount_. No less than five (5) Business Days
prior to the Closing, Target shall deliver to Acquiror a statement setting
forth the Targets good faith estimate of the Pre-Closing Tax Estimated
Amount, which shall be itemized by category of Taxes set forth in the Pre-
Closing Tax Schedule and set forth such estimated amount for each
such Category. In addition, to the extent any such category includes, in
whole or in part, any Taxes of Target arising from or relating to the Spin-Off
Transaction, Target shall set forth in such statement its good faith estimate
of the total amount of any such Taxes (the "Pre-Closing Spin-Off Tax
Estimated Amount"). For the sake of clarity, it is acknowledged and agreed
that the Pre-Closing Spin-Off Tax Estimated Amount shall be deemed part of and
included under the Pre-Closing Tax Estimated Amount.

6.15 _Target Cash at Closing_. Immediately prior to the Closing, all cash and
cash equivalents of Target and any of its Subsidiaries, _less_ (i) the amount
of the unpaid Target Transaction Expenses and (ii) Taxes of Target
attributable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period, shall either (a) constitute Target
Cash for the purposes of the definition of Cash Amount, (b) be distributed to
the Stockholders as an integral part of the Merger if permitted by and in
accordance with the Restated Certificate and Applicable Law, or (c)
transferred to SpinCo pursuant to the Spin-Off Documentation (the "Cash
Disposition").

6.16 _Indemnification of Officers and Directors of the Company_.

 

(a) For a period of six (6) years following the Effective Time, Acquiror
shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, fulfill and honor in all
respects the obligations of the Target pursuant to any indemnification
agreements in effect as of the date hereof between the Target and the Target
Indemnified Persons, subject to applicable law. For a period of six (6)
years following the Effective Time, the Certificate of Incorporation and
Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation will contain provisions with respect to
exculpation and indemnification that are at least as favorable to the Target
Indemnified Persons as those contained in the Certificate of Incorporation
and Bylaws of the Target as in effect on the date hereof, which provisions
will not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would
adversely affect the rights thereunder of Target Indemnified Persons;
__provided__ that in no event shall Acquiror or the Surviving Corporation be
obligated to indemnify such director or officer for any amounts payable by
such person pursuant to Article 9 hereof.

 



68 (b) This Section 6.16 is intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by the Target Indemnified Persons and their heirs and personal
representatives and shall be binding on Acquiror and the Surviving Corporation
and its successors and assigns.

 

(c) If Acquiror, the Surviving Corporation or any of their successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not
be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of their assets
to any person, then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Acquiror or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set
forth in this Section 6.16.

 

6.17 _D andO Insurance_. Prior to the Closing, Target shall obtain and fully pay
the premium for the non-cancellable extension (the "DandO Tail Policy") of
Targets existing directors and officers liability insurance policies (the
"Existing DandO Policy"), in each case for a claims reporting or discovery
period of at least six (6) years from and after the Effective Time with
respect to any claim related to any period of time at or prior to the
Effective Time with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that
are no less favorable than the coverage provided under Targets existing
policies with respect to any actual or alleged error, misstatement, misleading
statement, act, omission, neglect, breach of duty or any matter claimed
against a director or officer of Target by reason of him or her serving in
such capacity that existed or occurred at or prior to the Effective Time;
provided that Target shall give Acquiror a reasonable opportunity to
participate in the selection of such DandO Tail Policy and the ability to
designate the broker and carrier of such DandO Tail Policy, subject to Target
consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld) and Target and Target shall
select such policy as designated by Acquiror, if such policy provides coverage
at least as favorable to such directors and officers as the Existing DandO
Policy. The cost of such DandO Tail Policy shall be treated as a Target
Transaction Expense hereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the event
Acquiror requests that Target purchase coverage in excess of the coverage
provided by the Existing DandO Policy, Target shall purchase such excess
coverage and the incremental additional cost of the premium related to such
excess coverage shall not be treated as a Target Transaction Expense
hereunder.

6.18 _Securities Filings_. Effective as of the Closing Date, the Stockholders
Agent, on behalf of the Series D Holders, and Acquiror shall enter into a
registration rights agreement with respect to the Acquiror Stock Merger
Consideration substantially in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit K_ (the
"Registration Rights Agreement"). Subject to Acquirors receipt of necessary
information from Target, within two (2) Business Days after the Closing Date,
or as soon thereafter as reasonably practicable, Acquiror shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to file a registration statement on Form S-3
(the "Registration Statement") registering the resale of the Acquiror Stock
Merger Consideration. Target shall use its reasonable best efforts: (a) upon
Acquirors request, assist Acquiror and its Representatives in the
preparation of any audited historical and pro forma financial statements of
Target that may be required in connection with Acquirors SEC reporting
obligations related to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated
hereby ("Required Target Financials") or the filing of the Registration
Statement, (b) promptly furnish such information as Acquiror may reasonably
request in connection with such financial statements, the Registration
Statement, or related to the performance of Acquirors SEC reporting
obligations relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated
hereby; and (c) complete, execute, acknowledge and deliver, or use

 



69  their reasonable best efforts to cause to be completed, executed,
acknowledged and delivered by the appropriate Representatives of Target or the
Stockholders, in each case, such questionnaires and other documents,
certificates and instruments as may be reasonably requested by Acquiror in
connection with the filing of the Registration Statement or the financial
statements or the performance of Acquirors SEC reporting
obligations relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby.

6.19 _Investor Questionnaires_. As promptly as practicable (but in any event
no later than the date on which Target submits the Solicitation Statement to
the Stockholders), Target shall distribute an investor questionnaire inquiring
as to the "accredited investor" status of each Stockholder as such term is
defined under Rule 501 under Regulation D of the Securities Act of 1933.
Target shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain completed
questionnaires from each Stockholder. Following such solicitation, in the
event that the parties determine in good faith that an exemption from the
registration requirements under the Securities Act is not available, the
parties shall in good faith negotiate an alternative structure to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement in order to maintain the relative
economic interests of the transaction and the allocation of such interests
between Acquiror and the Stockholders.

 

6.20 _Sunnyvale Lease_. At all times after the Closing during which SpinCo
occupies space at the building located at 1376 Bordeaux Drive in Sunnyvale
California (the "Sunnyvale Facility"), SpinCo shall pay rent to the Surviving
Corporation with respect to its occupancy of the Sunnyvale Facility in respect
of post-Closing periods as set forth in the Transition Services Agreement.
From and after the date on which the Surviving Corporation vacates the
Sunnyvale Facility, SpinCo pay 100% of the rent at the Sunnyvale Facility set
forth in the Transition Services Agreement. Acquiror shall have the right
to market the Sunnyvale Facility through a broker selected at the sole
discretion of Acquiror, after consultation with SpinCo, immediately after
Closing. When the Sunnyvale Facility is vacated by both the Surviving
Corporation and SpinCo, Acquiror shall be entitled to an amount equal to the
monthly rent of the Sunnyvale Facility for a period of seven and a half (7.5)
months following the vacancy of the Sunnyvale Facility by both the Surviving
Corporation and SpinCo, offset by any rental income received during such
period (the "Rental Amount"). The Rental Amount, if any, shall be disbursed
from the Indemnity Escrow Fund to Acquiror in advance on a monthly basis
during such 7.5 month period.

Amount, less with respect to each such Target Retention Bonus Plan Participant
a portion of the Indemnity Escrow Amount with a value (as determined pursuant
to Section 9.3) equal to the sum of (1) such Target Retention Bonus Plan
Participants Pro Rata Portion of ten percent (10%) the Escrow Amount

9.2 _Indemnification by the Indemnifying Parties_.

 

(a) Subject to the limitations set forth in this Section 9, the Indemnifying
Parties shall jointly but not severally indemnify and hold harmless Acquiror
and the Surviving Corporation and their respective officers, directors,
agents, Affiliates, attorneys, representatives and employees (individually an
"Acquiror Indemnified Person" and collectively the "Acquiror Indemnified
Persons") from and against any and all losses, costs, damages, liabilities,
investigation costs, Taxes and expenses, including, without limitation, costs
and expenses arising from claims, demands, actions, causes of action and
settlements, including fees and expenses of lawyers, experts and other
professionals, but excluding punitive, special, incidental or consequential
damages (except in each case to the extent such damages are awarded to a
third party in a third party claim) (collectively, "Damages"), resulting from
or arising out of:

(i) any misrepresentation or breach any of the representations and warranties
given or made by Target in this Agreement, the Target Disclosure Schedule or
any exhibit or schedule to this Agreement or in any certificate or document
furnished pursuant hereto by Target to Acquiror;

 



76 (ii) any breach of any covenant or agreement made by Target in this Agreement
or in any certificate, instrument or agreement delivered in connection
herewith;

(iii) any appraisal amount issued to any Dissenting Stockholder under the
Delaware Law or other Applicable Law in excess of the portion of the Merger
Consideration such Dissenting Stockholder would otherwise been entitled
pursuant to Section 2.6 if such Dissenting Stockholder had not exercised
dissenter or appraisal rights, as well as attorneys fees and expenses
incurred in connection with any claim for any such appraisal amount;

(iv) any claim by a Stockholder or former Stockholder of Target that such
Stockholder was entitled, under the Restated Certificate, Applicable Law or a
Contract, to a greater allocation of the Merger Consideration, or a greater
amount of other consideration, than such Stockholder received pursuant to
this Agreement;

(v) any inaccuracies in the Payment Schedule;

 

(vi) any Target Transaction Expenses not reflected in the Representative
Confirmation Letters;

 

(vii) any Indebtedness for borrowed money of Target not paid by Target by the
Closing;

 

(viii) any claim by a Stockholder or former Stockholder of Target or by a
third party that in any way relates to or arises from the Spin-
Off Transaction;

(ix) any third party claim relating to the Excluded Business; or

 

(x) any WARN Pro Rata Liability of the Indemnifying Parties pursuant to
Section 6.9(l).

 

(xi) any Rental Amount pursuant to Section 6.20;

 

(xii) any IP matter set forth on Schedule 9.2(a)(xii);or

 

(xiii) any commercial matter set forth on Schedule 9.2(a)(xiii).

 

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, for the sake of
clarity, the Acquiror Indemnified Persons right to indemnification
under clauses (ii) to (xiii) above shall not be affected by any disclosure
made in the Target Disclosure Schedule or other disclosure made by Target.

 



77 (b) _Survival of Representations and Warranties and Covenants_. All
representations and warranties made by Target herein, or in any certificate,
schedule or exhibit delivered pursuant hereto, shall survive the execution and
delivery of this Agreement and the Closing and shall survive until the Escrow
Termination Date; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that any claims for
indemnification involving (i) fraud or intentional misrepresentation or (ii)
any breach of any of the representations and warranties contained in Section
3.2 (Authority), 3.5 (Capital Structure), and 3.22 (Taxes) (collectively, the
"Fundamental Representations") shall survive (A) until the expiration of the
statute of limitations applicable to such claims (and thereafter until
resolved if a claim in respect thereof has been made prior to such date) with
respect to such matters, or (B) indefinitely if no statute of limitations
apply. There shall be no termination of any representation or warranty as to
which a claim has been asserted by Acquiror prior to the termination of such
survival period. All covenants and agreements which are to be performed prior
to or at the Closing shall survive until the Escrow Termination Date, provided
that the covenants and agreements in Section 6.10 shall survive until
satisfied; all covenants and agreements which are to be performed following
the Closing shall survive until satisfied or as otherwise specified in their
terms. Other than with respect to those claims that survive indefinitely
pursuant to this Section 9.2(b), the Acquiror Indemnified Persons may not
assert a claim unless it is asserted on or before the last day of the
applicable foregoing survival period. The parties acknowledge that the time
periods set forth in this Article 9 and elsewhere in this Agreement for the
assertion of claims and notices under this Agreement are the result of
arms-length negotiation among the parties and that they intend for the time
periods to be enforced as agreed hereunder by the parties. The parties
further acknowledge that the time periods set forth in this Article 9 and
elsewhere in the Agreement may be shorter than otherwise provided by law.

 

(c) _Threshold for Claims_. No claim for Damages shall be made under Section
9.2(a)(i) unless the aggregate of Damages for which claims are made hereunder
by the Acquiror Indemnified Persons exceeds $300,000 (the "Basket"), in which
case the Acquiror Indemnified Person shall be entitled under Section 9.2(a)(i)
to be indemnified against and compensated and reimbursed for the entire
amount of all Damages including the amount of the Basket; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Basket shall not apply with respect to any Damages
arising from, or directly or indirectly related to any claims
for indemnification involving (i) fraud or intentional misrepresentation, or
(ii) any breach of a Fundamental Representation.

(d)  _Cap on Indemnification by Indemnifying Parties_. The aggregate amount
to be paid by the Indemnifying Parties for claims for Damages made under
Section 9 shall not exceed the amount then remaining in the relevant Escrow
Funds (the "Cap"); _provided_ , _however_ , that the Cap shall not apply to
any Damages based upon claims for indemnification involving (i) fraud or
intentional misrepresentation, and (ii) any breach of a
Fundamental Representation.

(e) _Recourse from the Escrow Fund_. Notwithstanding any contrary provision
hereof, except with respect to any Damages arising from, or directly or
indirectly related to (i) fraud or intentional misrepresentation and (ii) any
breach of a Fundamental Representation, the relevant Escrow Funds shall be the
exclusive means for the Acquiror Indemnified Persons to collect any Damages
for which they are entitled to indemnification under Section 9 of this
Agreement.

 



78 (f) _Recourse from the IP Escrow Fund_. The IP Escrow Fund shall be available
for indemnification pursuant to Section 9.2(a)(xii), and shall not be
available for any other matters. Such matters shall be treated as a Third
Party Claim pursuant to Section 9.7, except that the Stockholders Agent shall
be permitted to participate in such settlement discussions, and Acquiror
shall consult and cooperate with the Stockholders Agent in handling such
claim. Any remaining funds in the IP Escrow Fund shall be released to the
Indemnifying Parties promptly after the settlement of such matters (the "IP
Escrow Termination Date") (less any amounts necessary to indemnify Acquiror).
If, with Acquirors prior written consent, such matter is resolved by Target
prior to Closing, then, unless such resolution would result in payment
obligations of Target after the Closing, the IP Escrow Fund shall never come
into effect, and such amounts will be paid to the Indemnifying Parties at
Closing as part of the Cash Amount and/or the Target Retention Bonus Plan.

(g) _Recourse from the Commercial Escrow Fund_. The Commercial Escrow Fund
shall be available for indemnification pursuant to Section 9.2(a)(xiii), and
shall not be available for any other matters. Such matters shall be treated as
a Third Party Claim pursuant to Section 9.7, except that the Stockholders
Agent and SpinCo shall be permitted to participate in such discussions, and
Acquiror shall consult and cooperate with the Stockholders Agent and SpinCo
in handling such claim. Damages with respect to the matters set forth in
Section 9.2(a)(xiii) shall be net of any proceeds of any sale of equipment
which are part of the subject matter of the Contracts set forth on Schedule
9.2(a)(xiii), or discounts in the remaining obligations of the Contracts set
forth on Schedule 9.2(a)(xiii). Any remaining funds in the Commercial Escrow
Fund shall be released to the Indemnifying Parties promptly after the
settlement of such matters (the "Commercial Escrow Termination Date") (less
any amounts necessary to indemnify Acquiror). If, with Acquirors
prior written consent, such matter is resolved by the Company prior to
Closing, then, unless such resolution would result in payment obligations of
Target after the Closing, the Commercial Escrow Fund shall never come into
effect, and such amounts will be paid to the Indemnifying Parties at Closing
as part of the Cash Amount and/or the Target Retention Bonus Plan.

(h) _Other Limitations_.

(i) Notwithstanding Section 9.2(a) or any other provision hereof, (a) the
liability of each Indemnifying Party shall not exceed such Indemnifying
Partys Pro Rata Portion of the aggregate Damages, provided that this
subclause (a) is subject to the further limitation of each Indemnifying
Partys liability under subclause (c) below, (b) with respect to breaches of
Fundamental Representations, the liability of the Indemnifying Party for
indemnification under this Section 9 shall be joint but not several, (c) with
respect to all claims for indemnification under this Section 9 which are not
subject to the Cap, the liability of each Indemnifying Party shall not exceed
100% of such Indemnifying Partys Pro Rata Portion of the Merger Consideration
and/or Target Retention Bonus Plan, subject to clause (e) below, (d) claims
for indemnification under this Section 9 shall be the sole and exclusive
remedy available to Acquiror Indemnified Persons, other than, in each case,
with respect to the liability of a particular Indemnifying Party, instances
of fraud or intentional misrepresentation in which

 



79  such Stockholder participated and (e) with respect to any claim for
indemnification under this Section 9 which is not subject to the Cap and which
is in an amount that exceeds the Cap, no Target Retention Bonus Plan
Participant who is not an Executive Officer shall be liable for the portion of
such amount that exceeds the Cap ("Excess Indemnification Liability").

 

(ii) Notwithstanding Section 9.2(a) or any other provision hereof, no Acquiror
Indemnified Person shall be entitled to seek recovery with respect to Claims
pursuant to Section 9.2(a)(ix) unless and until the Surviving Corporation or
any successor or assign has exhausted all remedies available to it against
SpinCo or any successor pursuant to the Asset Transfer Agreement.
Any recovery under the Asset Transfer Agreement shall reduce the Damages the
Acquiror Indemnified Persons are entitled to seek pursuant to this Agreement
in respect of such Claim.

 

(i) _Investigations, Knowledge and Waivers_. The Acquiror Indemnified Persons
right to indemnification under this Section 9 shall not be affected by any
investigation conducted with respect to, or any knowledge acquired (or capable
of being acquired) by, Acquiror or any of its Affiliates or Representatives at
any time, whether before or after the execution and delivery of this
Agreement or the Closing Date, with respect to Target or with respect to the
accuracy or inaccuracy of or compliance with any representation, warranty,
covenant or obligation. The waiver of any condition related to the accuracy of
any representation or warranty, or on the performance of or compliance with
any covenant or obligation, will not affect the right to indemnification,
reimbursement or other remedy based upon any such representation, warranty,
covenant or obligation. 

(j) _Calculation_. Any Losses as to which indemnification provided for in
Section 9 may apply shall be determined net of any actual cash recovery
actually received by an Acquiror Indemnified Person with respect to insurance
specifically with respect to the specific matter for which indemnification is
sought, but such Losses shall include any current or prospective
costs associated with obtaining such recovery. This Section 9.2(i) shall not
imply and shall not be construed to imply any obligation on the part of any
person to seek or pursue any such recovery and the failure to seek or pursue
any such recovery shall not be a defense to any indemnification obligation
hereunder.

9.3 _Indemnification Claims_.

 

(a) Upon receipt by the Stockholders Agent on or before the Release Date of a
certificate signed by any officer of Acquiror (an "Officers Certificate")
stating that Damages exist with respect to the indemnification obligations of
the Indemnifying Parties set forth in Section 9.2, and specifying in
reasonable detail the individual items of such Damages included in the amount
so stated, the date each such item was paid, or properly accrued or arose, and
the nature of the misrepresentation, breach of warranty, covenant or claim to
which such item is related, Acquiror shall, subject to the provisions of this
Section 9, be entitled to receive from the Escrow Fund a portion of the Escrow
Amount having a value equal to such Damages and such amount shall no longer be
payable to any of the Indemnifying Parties.

 



80 (b) The Stockholders Agent shall have a period of thirty (30) days from and
after delivery of any Officers Certificate to deliver to Acquiror a
response, in which the Stockholders Agent shall: (i) agree that Acquiror is
entitled to receive all of the requested Damages (in which case the response
shall be accompanied by written notice executed by the Stockholders Agent
instructing, if applicable, the Escrow Agent to disburse the requested Damages
to Acquiror) or (ii) dispute that Acquiror is entitled to receive the
requested Damages. Acquiror shall provide the Stockholders Agent with
reasonable access to information in order for it to evaluate, dispute or agree
to any claim for indemnification. With respect to claims for indemnification
purportedly made under Section 9.2(a)(xii) or 9.2(a)(xiii), the Stockholders
Agents agreement pursuant to clause (i) above shall not be unreasonably
denied, conditioned or delayed.

 

(c) If the Stockholders Agent disputes any claim or claims made in any
Officers Certificate, Acquiror shall have thirty (30) days to respond in a
written statement to the objection of the Stockholders Agent. If after such
thirty (30) day period there remains a dispute as to any claims, the
Stockholders Agent and Acquiror shall attempt in good faith for thirty (30)
days to agree upon the rights of the respective parties with respect to each
of such claims. If the Stockholders Agent and Acquiror should so agree, a
memorandum setting forth such agreement shall be prepared and signed by
Acquiror and the Stockholders Agent and shall be delivered to the Escrow
Agent, if applicable. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely on any such
memorandum for the release of any Escrow Amount to Acquiror in accordance with
the terms of such memorandum and the Escrow Agreement.

9.4 _Resolution of Conflicts_. If no agreement can be reached after good
faith negotiations between the parties pursuant to _Section 9.3(c)_, either
Acquiror or the Stockholders Agent may initiate formal legal action with the
applicable court in accordance with _Section 10.6_ to resolve such
dispute. The decision of the court as to the validity and amount of any claim
in such Officers Certificate shall be binding and conclusive upon the parties
to this Agreement, and notwithstanding anything in _Section 9_ hereof, the
parties and the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to act in accordance with such
decision.

9.5 _Stockholders  Agent_.

 

(a) The Stockholders Agent shall be constituted and is hereby appointed as
agent and attorney-in-fact for and on behalf of the Indemnifying Parties and
shall have full power and authority to perform all responsibilities of the
Stockholders Agent set forth in this Agreement, including without limitation,
to represent the Indemnifying Parties, to give and receive notices and
communications, to authorize the Escrow Agent to release any portion of the
Escrow Fund to Acquiror in satisfaction of claims under this Agreement by
Acquiror, to object to such releases, to agree to, negotiate, enter into
settlements and compromises of, and demand arbitration and comply with orders
of courts and awards of arbitrators with respect to such claims, to act on the
Indemnifying Parties behalf with respect to the matters set forth herein, in
accordance with the terms and provisions set forth herein, including giving
and receiving all notices and communications to be given or received with
respect to the matters set forth in _Section 6.14_ and _Section 9_ and to
take all actions necessary or appropriate in the judgment of the
Stockholders Agent for the interpretation of this Agreement and
accomplishment of the foregoing. Such agency may be changed by the vote of the
Indemnifying Parties representing a majority in interest of the Escrow Funds
from time to time upon not less than ten (10) days prior written notice to
Acquiror. No bond shall be required of the Stockholders Agent. Notices or

 



81  communications to or from the Stockholders Agent shall constitute notice to
or from each of the Stockholders. The Stockholders Agent may not resign
unless the Stockholders Agent gives Acquiror twenty (20) days prior written
notice of such resignation.

(b) The Stockholders Agent shall not be liable for any act done or omitted
hereunder as Stockholders Agent while acting in good faith and in the
exercise of reasonable judgment and any act done or omitted pursuant to the
advice of counsel shall be conclusive evidence of such good faith. The
Indemnifying Parties shall severally indemnify, defend and hold the
Stockholders Agent harmless against any loss, liability damages, claims
penalties, fines, forfeitures, actions, fees, costs and expenses
(collectively, "Agent Losses") arising out of Stockholders Agents execution
and performance of this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement, the and each other
agreement ancillary hereto, in each case as such Agent Loss is suffered
or incurred; provided that such Agent Losses were incurred without gross
negligence or bad faith on the part of the Stockholders Agent and arising out
of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of his duties
hereunder. The Indemnifying Parties acknowledge and agree that the foregoing
indemnities will survive the resignation or removal of the Stockholders Agent
or the termination of this Agreement.

 

(c) The Stockholders Agent shall have reasonable access to information about
Target and the Target Subsidiaries and the reasonable assistance of Targets
and the Targets Subsidiaries officers and employees for purposes of
performing its duties and exercising its rights hereunder, provided that the
Stockholders Agent shall treat confidentially and not disclose any nonpublic
information from or about Target or any Target Subsidiary to anyone (except on
a need to know basis to individuals who agree to treat such information
confidentially).

 

(d) If the Stockholders Agent shall resign, become incapacitated, disband,
die, be liquidated, resign or otherwise be unable to fulfill his or its
responsibilities hereunder, the Stockholders shall, by written consent of the
Stockholders that held a majority in interest of the Indemnity Escrow Fund,
within 10 calendar days after such death or disability, appoint a successor to
the Stockholders Agent and immediately thereafter notify Acquiror and, if
applicable, the Escrow Agent of the identity of such successor. If for any
reason there is no Stockholders Agent at any time, all references herein to
the Stockholders Agent shall be deemed to refer to the Stockholders.

(e) The Expense Fund Amount will be held by the Stockholders Agent and will
be used for the purposes of paying directly, or reimbursing the Stockholders
Agent for, any third party expenses pursuant to this Agreement, the Escrow
Agreement, and any other agreements ancillary hereto (such amounts as may at
any time not yet have been paid or reimbursed to the Stockholders Agent or
released to the Series D Holders and the Target Retention Bonus Plan
Participants, the "Stockholders Agents Expense Fund"). The Series D Holders
and the Target Retention Bonus Plan Participants will not receive any interest
or earnings on the Expense Fund and irrevocably transfer and assign to the
Stockholders Agent any ownership right that they may otherwise have had in
any such interest or earnings. The Stockholders Agent will not be liable for
any loss of principal of the Stockholders Agents Expense Fund other than as
a result of its gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Stockholders
Agent will hold these funds separate from his or its personal or corporate
funds,

 



82  will not use these funds for his or its personal or operating expenses or
any other personal or corporate purposes and will not voluntarily make these
funds available to his or its creditors in the event of bankruptcy.
Contemporaneous with or as soon as practicable following the completion of the
Stockholders Agents responsibilities, the Stockholders Agent will deliver
the balance of the Stockholders Agents Expense Fund to the Payment Agent
for further distribution to the Series D Holders and the Target Retention
Bonus Plan Participants. For tax purposes, the Expense Fund will be treated as
having been received and voluntarily set aside by the Series D Holders and
the Target Retention Bonus Plan Participants at the time of Closing.

9.6 _Actions of the Stockholders  Agent_. A decision, act, consent or
instruction of the Stockholders Agent shall constitute a decision of all
Indemnifying Parties for whom the Merger Consideration otherwise payable to
them is released to Acquiror from the Escrow Fund with respect to the matters
set forth herein and shall be final, binding and conclusive upon each
Indemnifying Party, and Acquiror may rely upon any decision, act, consent or
instruction of the Stockholders Agent as being the decision, act, consent
or instruction of each and every Indemnifying Party. Acquiror is hereby
relieved from any liability to any Person for any acts done by Acquiror in
accordance with such decision, act, consent or instruction of the
Stockholders Agent.

 

9.7 _Third-Party Claims_. In the event Acquiror becomes aware of a third-party
claim which Acquiror believes may result in Damages, Acquiror shall notify
and consult with the Stockholders Agent with respect to the defense of such
claim. Acquiror shall have the right in its sole discretion to defend any such
claim, and, subject to receiving the prior written consent of
the Stockholders Agent, to settle such claim. In the event that the
Stockholders Agent has consented to any such settlement, the Stockholders
Agent shall have no power or authority to object under Section 9.3 or any
other provision of this Section 9 to the amount of any claim by Acquiror
against the Holdback Amount for indemnity with respect to such settlement.
Acquiror shall keep Stockholders Agent provide periodic updates as to the
developments in the defense of such third party claims, and reasonably
sufficient information for the Stockholders Agent to make a decision with
respect to any request for consent.

 

9.8 _Tax Effect of Indemnification Payments_. All amounts received by Acquiror
Indemnified Persons pursuant to this _Section 9_ shall be treated for all
Tax purposes as adjustments to the aggregate Merger Consideration.

9.9 _Tax Indemnification_. In addition to the indemnification obligations set
forth in Section 9.2 above, the Indemnifying Parties shall severally indemnify
the Acquiror Indemnified Persons and hold them harmless from and against any
Damages resulting from or arising out of (a) all Taxes (or the non-payment
thereof) of Target for all taxable periods ending on or before the Closing
Date and the portion through the end of the Closing Date for any Straddle
Period ("Pre-Closing Tax Period"), (b) all Taxes of any member of an
affiliated, consolidated, combined or unitary group of which Target (or any
predecessor of Target) is or was a member on or prior to the Closing Date,
including pursuant to Treasury Regulation §1.1502-6 or any analogous or
similar state, local, or non-U.S. law or regulation, and (c) any and all Taxes
of any Person imposed on Target as a transferee or successor, by contract or
pursuant to any Applicable Law, which Taxes relate to an event or transaction
occurring before the Closing; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) the Taxes as
to which the Acquiror Indemnified Persons

 



83  shall be entitled to indemnification under clauses (a), (b), and (c), as
well as under Section 9.2, shall not include any category of Taxes reflected
on the Pre-Closing Tax Schedule, other than any and all Taxes of Target
arising from or relating to the Spin-Off Transaction which (A) are included,
in whole or in part, under any such category of Taxes reflected on the Pre-
Closing Tax Schedule and (B) which exceed the Pre-Closing Spin-Off Tax
Estimated Amount, (ii) for the avoidance of doubt, the employers share of all
employment, payroll and similar Taxes incurred by Target in relation to any
compensation payments made by Target in connection with the Merger, whether
such Taxes are incurred prior to, at, or following the Effective Time, shall
be treated as arising in the Pre-Closing Tax Period, and (iii) for the
avoidance of doubt, any and all Taxes of Target arising from or relating to
the Spin-Off Transaction shall be treated as arising in the Pre-Closing Tax
Period. Any indemnification hereunder for Damages with respect to Taxes,
including with respect to a breach of any representation or warranty set forth
in Section 3.22, shall be limited to Taxes attributable to any taxable period
(or portion thereof) ending on or before the Closing Date.

9.10 _Effect of Investigation_. The right to indemnification, payment of
Damages or for other remedies based on any representation, warranty, covenant
or obligation of Target and/or the Indemnifying Parties contained in or made
pursuant to this Agreement shall not be affected by any investigation
conducted with respect to, or any knowledge acquired (or capable of being
acquired) at any time, whether before or after the execution and delivery of
this Agreement or the date the Closing occurs, with respect to the accuracy
or inaccuracy of or compliance with, any such representation, warranty,
covenant or obligation. The waiver of any condition to the obligation of
Acquiror to consummate the Merger, where such condition is based on the
accuracy of any representation or warranty, or on the performance of or
compliance with any covenant or obligation, shall not affect the right to
indemnification, payment of Damages, or other remedy based on such
representation, warranty, covenant or obligation.

this Agreement and, therefore, waive the application of any law, regulation,
holding or rule of construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement or
other document will be construed against the party drafting such agreement
or document.

10.8 _Specific Enforcement_. Each party acknowledges and agrees that the other
would be irreparably harmed and would not have any adequate remedy at law in
the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed by
such other party in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached. Accordingly each party agrees that the other party shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement
and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, this
being in addition to any other remedy to which such party is entitled at law
or in equity.

10.9 _Amendment; Waiver_. Any amendment or waiver of any of the terms or
conditions of this Agreement must be in writing and must be duly executed by
or on behalf of the party to be charged with such waiver. The failure of a
party to exercise any of its rights hereunder or to insist upon strict
adherence to any term or condition hereof on any one occasion shall not
be construed as a waiver or deprive that party of the right thereafter to
insist upon strict adherence to the terms and conditions of this Agreement at
a later date. Further, no waiver of any of the terms and conditions of this
Agreement shall be deemed to or shall constitute a waiver of any other term
of condition hereof (whether or not similar).

 



86 10.10 _Interpretation_.

 

(a) When a reference is made in this Agreement to Sections, Schedules or
Exhibits, such reference shall be to a Section of, or a Schedule or Exhibit
to this Agreement unless otherwise indicated.

(b) The headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only
and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this
Agreement.

(c) The words "include," "includes" and "including" when used herein shall be
deemed in each case to be followed by the words "without limitation."

(d) Unless the context of this Agreement otherwise requires: (i) words of any
gender include each other gender; (ii) words using the singular or plural
number also include the plural or singular number, respectively; and (iii) the
terms "hereof," "herein," "hereunder" and derivative or similar words refer
to this entire Agreement.

10.11  _Waiver of Conflicts Regarding Representation_.

(a) Wilson Sonsini Goodrich and Rosati ("WSGR") has acted as counsel for the
Stockholders, the Target (prior to and including the Effective Time) and the
Stockholders Agent (collectively, the "Target Parties") in connection with
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (the "Engagement")
and, in that connection, not as counsel for any other person, including,
without limitation, Acquiror or any of its Affiliates (including the Surviving
Corporation). Only the Target Parties shall be considered clients of WSGR in
the Engagement. If the Stockholders Agent so desires, WSGR shall be
permitted, without the need for any future waiver or consent, to represent any
of the Stockholders or the Stockholders Agent after the Closing
in connection with any matter related to the matters contemplated by this
Agreement, any agreement ancillary thereto or therein or any disagreement or
dispute relating thereto and may in connection therewith represent the agents
or Affiliates of the Stockholders or the Stockholders Agent, in any of the
foregoing cases including, without limitation, in any dispute, litigation or
other adversary proceeding against, with or involving Acquiror, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their agents or Affiliates.

(b) To the extent that communications between a Target Party, on the one hand,
and WSGR, on the other hand, relate to the Engagement, such communication
shall be deemed to be attorney-client confidences that belong solely to the
Stockholders Agent, for and on behalf of the Stockholders. Neither Acquiror
nor any of its Affiliates, including the Surviving Corporation, shall have
access to (and Acquiror hereby waives, on behalf of each, any right of access
it may otherwise have with respect to) any such communications or the files or
work product of WSGR, to the extent that they relate to the Engagement,
whether or not the Closing occurs. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, Acquiror acknowledges and agrees, for itself and on behalf of its
Affiliates, including the Surviving Corporation, upon and after the
Closing: (i) the Stockholders Agent, for and on behalf of the Stockholders,
and WSGR shall be the sole holders of the attorney-client privilege of the
Target Parties with respect to the

 



87  Engagement, and neither Acquiror nor any of its Affiliates, including the
Surviving Corporation, shall be a holder thereof; (ii) to the extent that
files or work product of WSGR in respect of the Engagement constitute
property of a client of WSGR, only the Stockholders Agent, for and on behalf
of the Stockholders, shall hold such property rights of any Target Parties and
have the right to waive or modify such property rights; and (iii) WSGR shall
have no duty whatsoever to reveal or disclose any such attorney-client
communications, files or work product to Acquiror or any of its Affiliates,
including the Surviving Corporation, by reason of any attorney-
client relationship between WSGR and the Target Parties or otherwise;
_provided_ that, to the extent any communication is both related and unrelated
to the Engagement, WSGR shall provide (and the Stockholders Agent, for and on
behalf of the other Target Parties, shall instruct WSGR to provide)
appropriately redacted versions of such communications, files or work product
to Acquiror or its Affiliates, including the Surviving Corporation.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a dispute arises between any
of Acquiror or the Surviving Corporation or their Affiliates, on one hand, and
any of the Stockholders or the Stockholders Agent, on the other hand,
concerning the matters contemplated in this Agreement, Acquiror, for itself
and on behalf of its Affiliates and the Surviving Corporation and its
Affiliates, agrees that Acquiror, the Surviving Corporation and their
Affiliates shall not offer into evidence or otherwise attempt to use or assert
the foregoing attorney-client communications, files or work product against
the Stockholders Agent or the Stockholders.

(c) Without limitation of the foregoing, any other communication between a
Target Party, on the one hand, and any Representative of a Target Party (other
than WSGR) or any other third person (other than Acquiror and its Affiliates),
prior to the Closing and relating to the Engagement shall be deemed
confidential information of the Stockholders, and from and after the Closing,
such communications shall be deemed to be confidential information that belong
solely to the Stockholders Agent, for and on behalf of the Stockholders.
Prior to the Closing, the Target shall be entitled to transfer possession of
such communications (including any tangible and intangible copies of such
communications) to the Stockholders Agent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in
the event that a dispute arises between any of Acquiror or the Surviving
Corporation or their Affiliates, on one hand, and any of the Stockholders or
the Stockholders Agent, on the other hand, concerning the matters
contemplated in this Agreement, Acquiror, for itself and on behalf of its
Affiliates and the Surviving Corporation and its Affiliates, agrees that
Acquiror, the Surviving Corporation and their Affiliates shall not offer into
evidence or otherwise attempt to use or assert the foregoing communications
against the Stockholders Agent or the Stockholders.
