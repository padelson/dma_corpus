3  

  

 

 

 

   
 

each case, other than Excluded Shares) will cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without
interest, in accordance with Section 2.1(c), plus any unpaid dividends with a
record date prior to the Effective Time. Company Shares, other than those to
be canceled pursuant to Section 2.1(a) hereof and other than Excluded Shares,
sometimes are referred to herein as the "Merger Shares."

  

  

(e) Each Excluded Share shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action
on the part of the holder thereof, cease to be outstanding, shall be cancelled
without payment of any consideration therefor and shall cease to exist,
subject to any rights that Dissenting Stockholders who are holders thereof may
have under Section 2.6.

  

  

2.2 Exchange of Certificates; Exchange Fund.

  

  

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint a commercial bank or
trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company, pursuant to an agreement
to act as paying agent with respect to the Merger (the "Paying Agent")
hereunder. The Paying Agent agreement pursuant to which Parent shall appoint
the Paying Agent shall be in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the
Company.

  

  

(b) At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit or shall cause to
be deposited an amount in cash equal to the aggregate Merger Consideration
payable pursuant to Section 2.1(c) (such cash being hereinafter referred to as
the "Exchange Fund") with the Paying Agent (but not, for the avoidance of
doubt, for payments in respect of Company Options, which Parent shall pay to
the Surviving Corporation at or prior to the Effective Time and then cause the
Surviving Corporation to pay such sufficient payments through its payroll
system to the holders of Company Options in accordance with Section 2.5(a)),
for the benefit of the holders of each Merger Share. The Paying Agent shall,
pursuant to irrevocable instructions delivered by Parent at or prior to the
Effective Time, deliver the Merger Consideration contemplated to be paid for
the Merger Shares pursuant to this Agreement, through the Merger, out of the
Exchange Fund. Except as contemplated by this Section 2.2, the Exchange Fund
shall not be used for any other purpose. The Exchange Fund shall be invested
by the Paying Agent as directed by Parent; provided, however, that such
investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of
America or any agency or instrumentality thereof and backed by the full faith
and credit of the United States of America, in commercial paper obligations
rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and
Poor's Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank
repurchase agreements or banker's acceptances of commercial banks with capital
exceeding $1 billion (based on the most recent financial statements of such
bank which are then publicly available). Any net profit resulting from, or
interest or income produced by, such investments shall be the property of and
payable to Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as directed by Parent.

  

  

(c) Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any event no later than the
second Business Day after the Effective Time), Parent shall instruct the
Paying Agent to mail to each record holder of Merger Shares (i) a letter of
transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates and Book-Entry Shares shall pass, only upon
proper delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as
provided in Section 2.2(g)) and Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent, and
shall be in customary form and

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

4  

  

 

 

 

   
 

agreed to by Parent and the Company prior to the Effective Time) and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 2.2(g)) in exchange
for the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the Merger Shares
represented by such Certificates and Book-Entry Shares. Promptly after the
Effective Time, upon surrender of Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof as provided in Section 2.2(g)) or Book-Entry Shares for cancellation
to the Paying Agent together with such letters of transmittal, properly
completed and duly executed, the holders of such Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a cash amount in
immediately available funds (after giving effect to any required Tax
withholdings as provided in Section 2.2(h)) equal to (x) the number of Company
Shares represented by such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof
as provided in Section 2.2(g)), multiplied by (y) the Merger Consideration,
and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest
shall be paid or accrued on any Merger Consideration or on any unpaid
dividends and distributions payable to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares. In the event of a transfer of ownership of a Merger Share that is not
registered in the transfer records of the Company, the Merger Consideration
payable in respect of such Merger Share may be paid to a transferee if the
Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section
2.2(g)) or Book-Entry Share representing such Merger Share is presented to the
Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect
such transfer and the Person requesting such exchange shall pay to the Paying
Agent in advance any transfer Taxes required by reason of the delivery of the
Merger Consideration in any name other than that of the registered holder of
the Certificate or Book-Entry Share surrendered, or shall establish to the
satisfaction of the Paying Agent that such Taxes have been paid or are not
payable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.2, each
Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the
Merger Consideration without interest payable in respect of the Merger Shares
represented by such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as
provided in Section 2.2(g)) or Book-Entry Share and any distributions to which
such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.3 hereof.

  

  

(d) The Merger Consideration delivered or issued, as the case may be, in
accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been issued in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to each Company Share.

  

  

(e) Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including the proceeds of any
investments thereof) that remains unclaimed by the holders of Merger Shares in
the Merger after the date that is nine (9) months following the Effective Time
shall be delivered to Parent upon demand and, from and after such delivery,
any former holders of Merger Shares who have not theretofore complied with
this Article II shall thereafter look only to Parent for the Merger
Consideration payable in the Merger in respect of such Merger Shares, without
any interest thereon. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of Merger
Shares immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat
to or become the property of any Governmental Entity shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, become the property of Parent or the Company, as
the case may be, free and clear of any Liens, claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto.

  

  

(f) None of Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent
or any other Person shall be liable to any holder of Merger Shares for any
cash from the

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

5  

  

 

 

 

   
 

Exchange Fund properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

  

  

(g) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to
be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Company or Parent, the
delivery by such Person of a written indemnity agreement in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to Parent, and the posting by such Person of a customary
bond, in such reasonable amount as the Company or Parent may direct, as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Paying Agent shall pay in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the
Merger Shares represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate and
any distributions to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to
Section 2.3 hereof.

  

  

(h) Each of the Company, Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying
Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as the Company,
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent is required to deduct
and withhold under the Code or any provision of state, local, or foreign Tax
Law, with respect to the making of such payment. To the extent that amounts
are so withheld, such withheld amounts (i) shall be remitted by Parent, the
Surviving Corporation, the Company or the Paying Agent, as applicable, to the
applicable Governmental Entity and (ii) shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of whom such
deduction and withholding was made by the Company, Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent, as the case may be.

  

  

2.3 Rights as Stockholders; Stock Transfers. From and after the Effective
Time, holders of Merger Shares shall cease to be, and shall have no rights as,
stockholders of the Company, and shall have no rights in respect of the
Company Shares, other than the right to receive (a) any dividend or other
distribution with respect to such Company Shares with a record date occurring
prior to the Effective Time that shall have properly been declared by the
Company on such Company Shares in accordance with the terms of this Agreement
or prior to the date hereof and which remain unpaid at the Effective Time and
(b) the consideration provided under this Article II. After the Effective
Time, there will be no transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of
Company Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
other than to settle transfers of Company Shares that occurred prior to the
Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares are presented to the Paying Agent, they will be canceled and exchanged
for the Merger Consideration as provided in this Article II.

  

  

2.4 Anti-Dilution Provisions. If, between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time, the outstanding Company Shares shall have been changed into,
or exchanged for, a different number of shares or a different class, by reason
of any stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split,
combination or exchange of shares, then the Merger Consideration shall be
correspondingly adjusted as and if appropriate to provide the holders of
Merger Shares the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement as if
such event had not occurred.

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

6  

  

 

 

 

   
 


 

  

  

2.5 Treatment of Stock Options and Restricted Shares.

  

  

(a) Each option to purchase Company Shares (each, a "Company Option") that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether vested or
unvested, shall, as of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without
any further action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and shall
only entitle the holder of such Company Option to receive, as soon as
reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (and in any event within five
(5) Business Days), an amount in cash without interest (payable by the
Surviving Corporation through its payroll system) equal to the product of (i)
the total number of Company Shares subject to the Company Option (without
regard to any vesting provisions thereof) multiplied by (ii) the excess, if
any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per Company Share
under such Company Option less applicable Taxes required to be withheld under
the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law with respect to
such payment. At or immediately prior to the Effective Time, each Company
Option that has an exercise price that is equal to or greater than the Merger
Consideration, whether or not exercisable or vested, shall be cancelled
without any consideration therefor.

  

  

(b) Each Company Share subject to vesting or other lapse restrictions (each, a
"Company Restricted Share") that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall vest in full and become free of such restrictions as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time. Upon the Effective Time, the holder
of a Company Restricted Share shall be entitled to receive the Merger
Consideration with respect to each such Company Restricted Share in accordance
with Section 2.1(c) hereof.

  

  

(c) At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the Company Board and the
compensation committee of the Company Board, as applicable, shall adopt any
resolutions and take any actions that are necessary to effectuate the
provisions of Sections 2.5(a) and (b), including any action to approve the
disposition of the Company Options and the Company Restricted Shares in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to the extent
necessary to exempt such disposition under Rule 16b-3 of the Exchange Act. The
Company shall take all actions necessary to terminate the Stock Plans as of
the Effective Time and to ensure that after the Effective Time neither Parent
nor the Surviving Corporation will be required to deliver Company Shares or
other capital stock of the Company, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any
of their respective Affiliates to any Person pursuant to or in settlement of
Company Options or Company Restricted Shares.

  

  

2.6 Excluded Shares. No Person who has perfected a demand for appraisal rights
pursuant to Section 351.455 of the MGBCL shall be entitled to receive the
Merger Consideration with respect to the Company Shares owned by such Person
unless and until such Person shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such
Person's right to appraisal under the MGBCL. Each Dissenting Stockholder shall
be entitled to receive only the payment provided by Section 351.455 of the
MGBCL with respect to Company Shares owned by such Dissenting Stockholder. The
Company shall give Parent (a) prompt notice of any written demands for
appraisal, attempted withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments
served pursuant to applicable Law that are received by the Company relating to
stockholders' rights of appraisal and (b) the opportunity to participate in
all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demand for appraisal under
the MGBCL. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

7  

  

 

 

 

   
 

Parent (which will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed),
voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal, offer
to settle or settle any such demands or approve any withdrawal of any such
demands.

4.12 Financing.

  

  

(a) Parent has provided the Company with true, correct and complete copies of
(i) the fully executed commitment letters, dated as of the date hereof (the
"Debt Commitment Letters"), among Madison Capital Funding LLC, Golub Capital
LLC, Ares Capital Corporation, Maranon Capital, L.P., Audax Mezzanine Fund
III, L.P. and CFIG Polished Co-Invest SPV, LLC (each, a "Commitment Party"
and, together with such Commitment Party's Affiliates, successors and assigns,
the "Financing Parties"), and Parent regarding the amounts set forth therein
for the purposes of financing the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and related fees and expenses (the "Debt
Financing") and (ii) the fully executed equity commitment letters, dated as of
the date hereof (the "Equity Commitment Letters" and, together with the Debt
Commitment Letters, the "Commitment Letters"), among the investors, the
Guarantor, Parent and Merger Sub, regarding the proposed cash investments set
forth therein (the "Equity Financing" and together with the Debt Financing,
the "Financing").

  

  

(b) The Commitment Letters are in full force and effect and are the legal,
valid and binding obligations of the Guarantor, Parent and Merger Sub and, to
the Knowledge of Parent, of the other parties thereto, in accordance with the
terms and conditions thereof, except that such enforceability may be limited
by the Bankruptcy Exceptions. None of the Commitment Letters has been amended
or modified prior to the date of this Agreement, and, as of the date hereof,
the respective commitments contained in the Commitment Letters have not been
withdrawn, terminated or rescinded in any respect. There are no conditions
precedent or other conditions, side agreements or other arrangements or
understandings relating to the funding of the Financing or the terms thereof,
other than the terms thereof set forth in the Commitment Letters. No event has
occurred or circumstance exists which would result in any breach or violation
of or constitute a default (or an event or circumstance which with notice or
lapse of time or both would become a default) by Parent or Merger Sub under
the Commitment Letters. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub has any reason to
believe that any of the conditions to the Commitment Letters will not be
satisfied or that the Commitment Letters will not be available to Parent and
Merger Sub on the Closing Date. Parent has fully paid any and all commitment
and other fees that have been incurred and are due and payable on or prior to
the date hereof in connection with the Commitment Letters, if any, and has
otherwise satisfied all of the other terms and conditions required to be
satisfied pursuant to the terms of the Commitment Letters on or prior to the
date hereof, and Parent will pay, or cause to be paid, when due all other
commitment fees arising under the Commitment Letters as and when they become
payable. Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge that Parent's or Merger Sub's
ability to obtain any financing prior to consummating the Merger is not a
condition to Parent's and Merger Sub's obligation to consummate the Merger.

  

  

(c) Neither Parent, Merger Sub nor any of their Affiliates has (i) retained
any financial advisor on a basis exclusive to Parent and/or Merger Sub and/or
any such Affiliate or (ii) entered into an exclusivity, lock-up or other
similar agreement, arrangement or understanding with any bank or investment
bank or other potential provider of debt financing or, other than the Persons
who are party to the Equity Commitment Letter, equity financing that would
prevent or hinder such provider from providing or seeking to provide such debt
financing to any third party in connection with a transaction relating to the
Company or its Subsidiaries, in the case of clauses (i) and (ii), in
connection with the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

32  

  

 

 

 

   
 

Agreement. Neither Parent, Merger Sub nor any of their Affiliates has caused
or induced any Person to take any action that, if taken by Parent and/or
Merger Sub, would be a breach of, or would cause to be untrue, any of the
representations in this Section 4.12(c).

  

  

4.13 Guarantee. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, the
Guarantor has delivered to the Company the duly executed Guarantee. The
Guarantee is in full force and effect, has been duly executed and delivered by
the Guarantor, and constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the
Guarantor, enforceable in accordance with its terms, except to the extent that
the enforcement thereof may be limited by or subject to the Bankruptcy
Exceptions. The execution, delivery and performance by the Guarantor party to
the Guarantee do not and will not violate, conflict with, or result in a
breach of any provision of, or constitute a default (or an event which, with
notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a default) under, or result
in the termination of, or result in the loss of any benefit or creation of any
right on the part of any third party under, or accelerate the performance
required by, or result in a right of termination or acceleration of, or result
in the creation of any Lien (other than Permitted Liens) upon any of the
properties or assets of the Guarantor under any of the terms, conditions or
provisions of (a) the Organizational Documents of the Guarantor, (b) any
applicable Law or Order binding on the Guarantor or its assets or (c) any
Contract to which the Guarantor is a party. The Guarantor has the financial
capacity to pay and perform its obligations under the Guarantee, and all funds
necessary for the Guarantor to fulfill its obligation under the Guarantee will
be available to the Guarantor for so long as the Guarantee remains in effect.
No event has occurred, which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both,
would constitute a default on the part of the Guarantor under the Guarantee.

  

  

4.14 Interest in Competitors. Neither Parent, Merger Sub, the Guarantor nor
any of their respective associates (as defined under the HSR Act) own any
interest in any Person that derives revenues from products, services or lines
of business within the products, services or lines of business of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries that would reasonably be expected to have an
adverse effect on the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the Merger
or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

  

4.15 No Other Representation or Warranties. Except for the representations and
warranties contained in this Article IV, neither Parent, Merger Sub, nor any
other Person on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub makes any other express or
implied representation or warranty in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Parent acknowledges that it and
its Representatives have received access to such books and records,
facilities, equipment, contracts and other assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries that Parent and its Representatives have desired or requested to
review, and that Parent and its Representatives have had full opportunity to
meet with the management of the Company and to discuss the business and assets
of the Company and its Subsidiaries. Parent acknowledges that neither the
Company, any of its Subsidiaries nor any other Person has made any
representation or warranty, express or implied, as to the accuracy or
completeness of any information regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries
furnished or made available to Parent and its Representatives except as
expressly set forth in Article III (which includes the Company Disclosure
Letter), and neither the Company, any of its Subsidiaries nor any other Person
shall be subject to any liability or any indemnification or other obligation
to Parent or any other Person resulting from the Company's making available to
Parent or Parent's use of such information, or any information,

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

33  

  

 

 

 

   
 

documents or material made available to Parent in the due diligence materials
provided to Parent, including in any virtual or actual "data room," management
presentations (formal or informal) or in any other form in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing,
neither the Company, any of its Subsidiaries nor any other Person makes any
representation or warranty to Parent with respect to any financial projection
or forecast relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, nothing in this Section 4.15 shall relieve any Person of liability
for fraud or in any way modify, limit or prevent Parent or Merger Sub from
relying on the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in
Article III.

opportunity to attend and participate.

  

  

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the rest of this Section 6.1,
Parent and Merger Sub shall take any and all steps necessary to avoid or
eliminate each and every impediment under any antitrust, competition, or trade
regulation or other Law that may be asserted by any Governmental Entity or
private party with respect to this Agreement so as to make effective as
promptly as practicable the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to
avoid any suit or proceeding, which would otherwise have the effect of
preventing or delaying the Closing beyond the End Date. The steps involved in
the preceding sentence shall include, without limitation, (i) defending
through Litigation on the merits, including appeals, any claim asserted in any
court or other proceeding by any party; (ii) proposing, negotiating,
committing to and effecting, by consent decree, hold separate order or
otherwise, the sale, divestiture or disposition of such assets or businesses
of Parent (including its Subsidiaries and Affiliates) or the Company,
including entering into customary ancillary agreements relating to any such
sale, divestiture or disposition of such assets or businesses; (iii) agreeing
to any limitation on the conduct of Parent (including its Subsidiaries and
Affiliates) or the Company; or (iv) agreeing to take any other action as may
be required by a Governmental Entity in order (A) to obtain all necessary
approvals, authorizations, consents, clearances, exemptions, or expirations or
terminations of waiting periods as soon as reasonably possible, and in any
event before the End Date, (B) to avoid the entry of, or to have vacated,
lifted, dissolved, reversed or overturned any Order, whether temporary,
preliminary or permanent, that is in effect in any Litigation and that
prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, or (C) to effect the expiration or termination of any
waiting period, which would otherwise have the effect of preventing or
delaying the Closing beyond the End Date. Parent shall not, and shall cause
each of its Subsidiaries and Affiliates not to, take any action which is
intended to or which would reasonably be expected to affect adversely the
ability of any of the parties hereto to obtain (or cause delay in obtaining)
any necessary approvals, authorizations, consents, clearances, exemptions, or
expirations or terminations of waiting periods by any Governmental Entity
required for consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
to perform its covenants and agreements under this Agreement, or to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Parent and the Company shall
not, and shall not permit any of their Subsidiaries or Affiliates to, acquire
or agree to acquire by merger or consolidation, or by purchasing a substantial
equity interest in or a substantial portion of the

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

40  

  

 

 

 

   
 

assets of, or by any other manner, any business or any corporation,
partnership, association or other business organization or division thereof or
otherwise acquire or agree to acquire any assets that would delay or make
materially more difficult the obtaining of any approvals, authorizations,
consents, clearances, exemptions, or expirations or terminations of waiting
periods required for consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

  

  

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 6.1, neither the
Company nor any of its Representatives shall be prohibited under this Section
6.1 from taking any action permitted by Section 6.5.

  

  

(e) For purposes of this Section 6.1, the term Parent shall include the
Guarantor. Parent shall cause the Guarantor to comply with this Section 6.1 as
if the Guarantor was a party to this Agreement.

  

  

6.2 Access to Information.

  

  

(a) Subject to applicable Law, from the date hereof until the Closing Date or
the termination of this Agreement, the Company hereby agrees that it shall
ensure that, upon reasonable notice, the Company and its Subsidiaries (i) will
afford to Parent and its Representatives such reasonable access during normal
business hours to its books, records, properties, personnel (but not including
directors who are not employees of the Company), accountants and other
professionals retained by the Company and to such other information as Parent
may reasonably request (including for purposes of determining withholding
obligations under Section 2.2(h)); and (ii) will furnish Parent such financial
and operating data and other information with respect to the business and
properties of the Company as the Company prepares and compiles for members of
the Company Board in the ordinary course and as Parent may from time to time
reasonably request. All requests for access and information shall be
coordinated through senior corporate officers of the Company. The foregoing
notwithstanding, the Company shall not be required to afford such access if it
would unreasonably disrupt the operations of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, would in the reasonable judgment of the Company cause a
violation of any agreement to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is
a party, would in the reasonable judgment of the Company cause a risk of a
loss of privilege or trade secret protection to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (provided that the Company and Parent shall cooperate in good
faith to design and implement alternative procedures to enable Parent to
evaluate any such documents or other information without causing a waiver or
loss of privilege) or would in the reasonable judgment of the Company
constitute a violation of any applicable Law or contravene any applicable
antitrust principles, nor shall Parent or any of its representatives be
permitted to perform any on-site procedure (including any on-site
environmental procedure) with respect to any property of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries without the prior written consent of the Company. The Company
shall furnish, to the extent prepared by the Company in the ordinary course of
business, for the period beginning after the date of this Agreement and ending
at the Effective Time, as soon as practicable after the end of each month, a
copy of the monthly internally prepared financial statements of the Company.

  

  

(b) Parent agrees that it will not, and will cause its Representatives not to,
use any information obtained from the Company or its Representatives in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement for any
competitive purpose or other purpose

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

41  

  

 

 

 

   
 

unrelated to the consummation of such transaction in accordance with the
Confidentiality Agreement, dated May 25, 2012, by and between the Company and
Linden Manager II L.P. (the "Confidentiality Agreement"). Parent will treat as
strictly confidential all information provided to it by or on behalf of the
Company in connection with the matters contemplated hereby in accordance with
the Confidentiality Agreement.

  

  

6.3 Company Stockholder Meeting; Approval.

  

  

(a) As promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement (but in no
event later than the later of (i) ten (10) Business Days following the date of
this Agreement and (ii) three (3) Business Days after Parent and Merger Sub
shall have provided to the Company all of the information regarding Parent and
Merger Sub reasonably requested by the Company for inclusion in the Proxy
Statement), the Company shall prepare and file with the SEC the Proxy
Statement in connection with the Merger, and the parties will file, if
necessary, any other statement or schedule relating to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby. Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly
furnish in writing to the Company all information concerning Parent and Merger
Sub that is required by applicable Law to be included in the Proxy Statement
so as to enable the Company to comply with its obligations under this Section
6.3. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall cooperate in good faith
to determine the information regarding Parent and Merger Sub that is necessary
to include in the Proxy Statement in order to satisfy applicable Law. Each of
the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly correct any information
provided by it or any of its directors, officers, employees, Affiliates,
agents or other representatives for use in the Proxy Statement if and to the
extent that such information shall have become false or misleading in any
material respect. The Company shall take all steps reasonably necessary to
cause, as promptly as practicable, the Proxy Statement, as so corrected, to be
filed with the SEC and mailed to the Company's stockholders as and to the
extent required by applicable Law. Except as otherwise provided in Section 6.5
or to the extent that the Company Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with outside legal counsel to the Company) that to do so would
reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the
Company Board under applicable Law, the Proxy Statement shall include the
Recommendation. Unless the Company Board shall have effected a Change of
Recommendation in accordance with Section 6.5, the Company shall provide
Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment on the Proxy Statement prior to the filing thereof with the SEC, and
the Company shall give reasonable and good faith consideration to any comments
made by Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel (it being understood that Parent,
Merger Sub and their counsel shall provide any comments thereon as promptly as
reasonably practicable). Unless the Company Board shall have effected a Change
of Recommendation in accordance with Section 6.5, the Company shall provide in
writing to Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel any and all comments or other
communications, whether written or oral, that the Company or its counsel may
receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Proxy Statement promptly
after such receipt, and unless the Company Board shall have effected a Change
of Recommendation in accordance with Section 6.5, the Company shall provide
Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel a reasonable opportunity to participate
in the formulation of any response to any such comments of the SEC or its
staff (including a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any such
response, to which the Company shall give reasonable and good faith
consideration to any comments made by Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel)
and to participate in any discussions with the SEC or its staff regarding any
such comments. Unless the

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

42  

  

 

 

 

   
 

Company Board shall have effected a Change of Recommendation in accordance
with Section 6.5, if at any time prior to receipt of the Requisite Stockholder
Vote there shall occur any event that should be set forth in an amendment or
supplement to the Proxy Statement, the Company shall promptly notify Parent,
Merger Sub and their counsel of such event and the Company shall provide
Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment on any amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement prior to the
filing thereof with the SEC or the mailing thereof to the Company's
stockholders, and the Company shall give reasonable and good faith
consideration to any comments made by Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel (it
being understood that Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel shall provide any
comments thereon as soon promptly as reasonably practicable). As promptly as
practicable after the later of the Proxy Statement Clearance Date or the
Solicitation Period End-Date, the Company shall mail to the Company's
stockholders the Proxy Statement and all other proxy materials required to be
mailed therewith. The "Proxy Statement Clearance Date" shall mean the date on
which the staff of the SEC has, orally or in writing, confirmed to the Company
or its counsel that it has no further comments on the Proxy Statement (or, if
the staff of the SEC has not informed the Company that it intends to review
the Proxy Statement, the first date following the tenth calendar day following
the filing of the preliminary Proxy Statement).

  

  

(b) As promptly as practicable following the later of the Proxy Statement
Clearance Date or the Solicitation Period End-Date (or at any earlier time
selected by the Company in its discretion), the Company shall establish a
record date (the "Record Date") for, duly call and give notice of a special
meeting of its stockholders (the "Company Stockholder Meeting") for the
purpose of seeking the Requisite Stockholder Vote, regardless of whether the
Company Board shall have effected a Change of Recommendation, unless this
Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to and in accordance with Article
VIII. The Company Stockholder Meeting shall be held promptly (and in no event
later than forty (40) days) following the later of the Proxy Statement
Clearance Date or the Solicitation Period End-Date. The Company shall, through
the Company Board, make the Recommendation; provided that the Company Board
may withdraw or modify the Recommendation to the extent permitted under
Section 6.5. Unless the Company Board shall have made a Change of
Recommendation in accordance with Section 6.5, (i) the Company shall use all
reasonable lawful efforts to solicit from the Company's stockholders proxies
in favor of the approval of this Agreement and shall take all other reasonable
lawful action necessary or advisable to secure the Requisite Stockholder Vote,
and (ii) without limiting the foregoing, the Company shall retain a proxy
solicitation firm reasonably acceptable to Parent for the purpose of
soliciting from the Company's stockholders proxies in favor of the approval of
this Agreement. Once the Company Stockholder Meeting shall have been called
and noticed, the Company shall not postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholder
Meeting without the consent of Parent, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed (except that the Company may postpone or
adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting without such consent (A) for the
absence of a quorum, (B) to allow reasonable additional time to solicit
additional votes to secure the Requisite Stockholder Vote, (C) to allow
reasonable additional time for the filing and mailing of any supplemental or
amended disclosure which the Company believes in good faith, after
consultation with outside legal counsel, is necessary under applicable Law and
for such supplemental or amended disclosure to be disseminated to and reviewed
by the Company's stockholders prior to the Company Stockholder Meeting or (D)
if the Company Board shall have determined in good faith, after consultation
with outside legal counsel, that a failure to so postpone, adjourn or
otherwise delay the Company Stockholder

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

43  

  

 

 

 

   
 

Meeting would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the fiduciary
duties of the Company Board under applicable Law). After the Company has
established the Record Date, the Company shall not change such Record Date or
establish a different record date for the Company Stockholder Meeting without
the prior written consent of Parent, unless required to do so by applicable
Law.

  

  

(c) Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Affiliates shall vote or cause to
be voted all Company Shares beneficially owned by them in favor of approval of
this Agreement and the Merger at the Company Stockholder Meeting.

  

  

6.4 Stock Exchange De-listing. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall
cooperate with Parent and use reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions, and do or cause to be done all things, reasonably
necessary, proper or advisable on its part under applicable Laws and rules and
policies of NASDAQ to enable the delisting by the Surviving Corporation of the
Company Shares from NASDAQ and the deregistration of the Company Shares under
the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, and in
any event no more than ten (10) days after the Closing Date.

  

  

6.5 Solicitation.

  

  

(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
during the period beginning on the date of this Agreement and continuing until
the Solicitation Period End-Date, the Company and its Representatives shall
have the right, directly or indirectly, to (i) solicit, initiate, facilitate
or encourage any inquiries regarding, or the making of any proposal or offer
that constitutes, an Acquisition Proposal, including by way of providing
access to the officers, employees, agents, properties, books and records of
the Company and its Subsidiaries and access to non-public information pursuant
to one (1) or more Acceptable Confidentiality Agreements (but only pursuant to
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreements); provided that the Company shall
promptly (and in any event within forty-eight (48) hours) provide or make
available to Parent any material non-public information concerning the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries that is provided or made available to any Person
and that was not previously provided or made available to Parent; and (ii)
continue, enter into and maintain discussions or negotiations with respect to
Acquisition Proposals or other proposals that could lead to Acquisition
Proposals, or otherwise cooperate with or assist or participate in, or
facilitate any such discussions or negotiations. For purposes of this
Agreement, "Solicitation Period End-Date" means 11:59 p.m. (CST) on the date
that is forty (40) days after the date of this Agreement. Parent shall not,
and shall cause each of Merger Sub and each of their respective Affiliates not
to, actively interfere with or prevent the participation of any Person,
including any officer or director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
and any bank, investment bank or other potential provider of debt or equity
financing, in negotiations and discussions permitted by this Section 6.5.

  

  

(b) Except as expressly permitted by Section 6.5(c), (i) the Company shall,
and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and shall use its reasonable best efforts
to cause its Representatives to, on the Solicitation Period End-Date,
immediately cease any existing solicitations, discussions or negotiations with
any Persons (other than any Excluded Party) that may be ongoing with respect
to any Acquisition Proposals or any proposal reasonably likely to

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

44  

  

 

 

 

   
 

result in an Acquisition Proposal (and the Company shall request that all
copies of all non-public information it or its Subsidiaries or their
respective Representatives have distributed or made available since the date
hereof to Persons (other than any Excluded Party) in connection with their
consideration of any Acquisition Proposal (other than with respect to Parent
and its Affiliates), be promptly destroyed or returned to the Company (subject
to the exceptions set forth in any applicable confidentiality agreement)) and
cause any physical or virtual data room to no longer be accessible to or by
any Person, other than Parent and its Affiliates and any Excluded Party, and
(ii) from the Solicitation Period End-Date until the earlier to occur of the
Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article VIII,
the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not, and the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause its Representatives not to, directly or
indirectly, (A) initiate, solicit or knowingly encourage, facilitate or assist
any inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer that constitutes, or may
reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal, (B) engage in,
continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding
any proposal or offer that constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead
to, an Acquisition Proposal, or provide any non-public information or data to
any Person relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or afford to
any Person access to the business, properties, assets or personnel of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (C) enter into any other acquisition
agreement, merger agreement or similar definitive agreement, letter of intent
or agreement in principle with respect thereto or any other agreement relating
to an Acquisition Proposal (an "Alternative Acquisition Agreement"), or (D)
otherwise knowingly facilitate any effort or attempt to make an Acquisition
Proposal, other than, in each case, to request information from the Person
making any such proposal or offer for the sole purpose of the Company Board
informing itself about the proposal or offer that has been made and the Person
that made it or to notify any Person of the Company's obligations under this
Section 6.5. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may continue to take
any of the actions described in clauses (A), (B), (C) and (D) above from and
after the Solicitation Period End-Date with respect to any Excluded Party. For
purposes of this Agreement, "Excluded Party" means any Person, group of
Persons or group that includes any Person (so long as such Person and the
other members of such group, if any, who were members of such group
immediately prior to the Solicitation Period End-Date constitute at least 50%
of the equity financing of such group at all times following the Solicitation
Period End-Date and prior to the termination of this Agreement) (including,
with respect thereto, their Representatives) from whom the Company or any of
its Representatives has received prior to the Solicitation Period End-Date a
written Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board determines in its good
faith judgment prior to the Solicitation Period End-Date, after consultation
with its independent financial advisor and outside counsel, is bona fide.
Within two (2) Business Days following the Solicitation Period End-Date, the
Company shall deliver to Parent a list of all Excluded Parties (excluding
their respective Representatives).

  

  

(c) From and after the date of this Agreement, the Company shall promptly
notify Parent after it or any of its Subsidiaries has received any request for
discussions or negotiations, any request for access to the properties or books
and records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of which the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives is or has
become aware, or any request for information relating to the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, in each case, in connection with an Acquisition Proposal or
any proposal, inquiry, offer or request relating to or constituting an
Acquisition Proposal or a potential Acquisition Proposal or any amendments to
the financial or material terms of the

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

45  

  

 

 

 

   
 

foregoing. Such notice to Parent shall indicate the identity of the Person
making such proposal or request and the material terms and conditions of such
proposal, if any (including but not limited to pricing terms, financial terms,
proposed timing, fees, net cash to be assumed, required diligence, and form of
proposed transaction). The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed on a
current basis (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours) of the status
of any material developments regarding any such Acquisition Proposal or any
change to the financial or other material terms of any such Acquisition
Proposal within twenty-four (24) hours after the receipt thereof.
Notwithstanding Section 6.5(b) but without limiting the actions permitted by
Sections 6.5(a) and 6.5(b) and subject to complying with Section 6.5(b)
(including the right to maintain discussions and negotiations with Excluded
Parties), if, prior to the time the Requisite Stockholder Vote is obtained,
the Company receives a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal from any Person
that did not result from a breach of any provision of this Section 6.5 and
that the Company Board concludes in good faith, after consultation with its
independent financial advisor and outside legal counsel, constitutes a
Superior Proposal or would reasonably be expected to result in a Superior
Proposal, (i) the Company and its Representatives may provide access and non-
public information with regard to the Company and its Subsidiaries in response
to a request therefore by such Person if the Company receives from such Person
(or has received from such Person) an executed Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement (a copy of which the Company shall promptly (but in any event within
twenty-four (24) hours) provide to Parent following execution thereof);
provided that the Company shall promptly (and in any event within twenty-four
(24) hours) make available to Parent and Merger Sub any material non-public
information concerning the Company or its Subsidiaries that is provided to any
Person given such access which was not previously made available to Parent or
Merger Sub, and (ii) the Company and its Representatives may engage or
participate in any discussions or negotiations with such Person, in each case,
provided that the Company Board concludes in good faith, after consultation
with its outside legal counsel, that failure to take such action described in
the foregoing clauses (i) or (ii) would reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Company Board under applicable
Law.

  

  

(d) Except as set forth in this Section 6.5(d), neither the Company Board nor
any committee thereof shall withhold, withdraw, qualify, change, amend or
modify (or publicly propose or resolve to withhold, withdraw, qualify, change,
amend or modify), in any manner adverse to Parent, the Recommendation with
respect to the Merger, make any public statement in connection with the
Recommendation or in reference to an Acquisition Proposal that is inconsistent
with the Recommendation and in any manner adverse to Parent, or fail to
include the Recommendation in the Proxy Statement (any of the foregoing, a
"Change of Recommendation"), or adopt, approve or recommend (publicly or
otherwise), or propose to adopt, approve or recommend (publicly or otherwise)
an Acquisition Proposal, or cause or permit the Company to enter into any
Alternative Acquisition Agreement, or fail to make or reaffirm the
Recommendation within four (4) Business Days following Parent's written
request to do so following receipt of an Acquisition Proposal. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, prior to the time the
Requisite Stockholder Vote is obtained, the Company Board may effect a Change
of Recommendation (and, in the case of the following clause (y), terminate
this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(d)(ii) and enter into an Alternative
Acquisition Agreement) if (x) a material event, fact, development or
occurrence affecting the business, assets or operations of the Company (but
not relating to an Acquisition Proposal) that was neither known nor reasonably
foreseeable to the Company Board as of the date of this

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

46  

  

 

 

 

   
 

Agreement becomes known to the Company Board that the Company Board determines
in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that a failure
to effect a Change of Recommendation would reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Company Board under applicable
Law (an "Intervening Event") or (y) if the Company receives an Acquisition
Proposal that is a binding, written offer capable of acceptance that the
Company Board concludes in good faith, after consultation with its independent
financial advisor and outside counsel, constitutes a Superior Proposal;
provided that, in order to effect a Change of Recommendation under either
clause (x) or (y) or terminate this Agreement to enter into a definitive
agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal:

  

  

(i) the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its
independent financial advisor and outside counsel, that failure to do so would
reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the
Company Board under applicable Law and the Company shall have complied with
its obligations under this Section 6.5;

  

  

(ii) the Company shall have provided prior written notice to Parent, at least
four (4) days in advance of making such Change of Recommendation or such
termination (such period, the "Negotiation Period"), advising Parent of the
intention to effect a Change of Recommendation or terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Section 8.1(d)(ii), which notice shall state the basis for the
Change of Recommendation or termination and, in the case of a Superior
Proposal, the identity of the party making such Superior Proposal and the
material terms thereof and include copies of the final forms of all relevant
documents relating to such Superior Proposal;

  

  

(iii) during the Negotiation Period, the Company shall have, and shall have
caused its Representatives to, negotiate with Parent in good faith with
respect to changes to the terms and conditions of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby (or as to other proposals made by Parent);
and

  

  

(iv) after so negotiating with Parent and Merger Sub during the Negotiation
Period, the Company Board shall have considered in good faith any and all
changes to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby offered by
Parent (or other proposals made by Parent), and shall have concluded, after
consultation with its independent financial advisor and outside legal counsel,
(A) in the event the Company Board's determination pursuant to clause (d)(i)
above is in response to a Superior Proposal, that such Superior Proposal would
continue to constitute a Superior Proposal even if such changes or other
proposals were to be given effect; provided that, if any material amendment or
material revision is made to the Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board
has determined to be a Superior Proposal, the Company shall be required to
deliver a new written notice to Parent with respect to each successive
material amendment or material revision and to comply with the requirements of
this Section 6.5 (including Section 6.5(e)) with respect to such new written
notice, and the Negotiation Period shall recommence (except that the
Negotiation Period shall be reduced from four (4) days to two (2) days), or
(B) in the event the Company Board's determination pursuant to clause (d)(i)
above is in response to an Intervening Event, that such changes

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

47  

  

 

 

 

   
 

would not obviate the need for a Change of Recommendation in response to such
Intervening Event.

  

  

(e) Nothing contained in this Section 6.5 shall be deemed to prohibit the
Company or the Company Board or any committee thereof from (i) complying with
its disclosure obligations under U.S. federal or state Law with regard to an
Acquisition Proposal, including taking and disclosing to its stockholders a
position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange Act, or
(ii) complying with its disclosure obligations if, in the good faith judgment
of the Company Board, after consultation with outside counsel, failure to
disclose would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its obligations
under applicable Law. For avoidance of doubt, nothing set forth in this
Section 6.5 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the
Company Board from issuing a "stop, look and listen" statement or other
communication pending disclosure of its position, as contemplated by Rule
14e-2 or Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act

  

  

(f) The Company acknowledges and agrees that any violation of the restrictions
set forth in this Section 6.5 by any Representatives of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or their respective Representatives shall be deemed to be a
breach of this Section 6.5 by the Company.

  

  

6.6 Employee Matters.

  

  

(a) Subject to Section 6.6(d) and to the extent allowed under applicable Law,
Parent shall, and shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to, honor all
Company Benefit Plans and Company Foreign Plans. During the period beginning
at the Effective Time and for a period of twelve months following the
Effective Time (the "Continuation Period"), Parent shall, and shall cause the
Company and its Subsidiaries to, provide to each current employee of the
Company and its Subsidiaries and who remains so employed during such period
and who is not covered by a written employment agreement (the "Company
Employees") compensation and benefits that are comparable, in the aggregate,
to the compensation and benefits provided to such Company Employee immediately
before the Effective Time, but excluding from such comparability requirements
all equity-based compensation and benefits, change-in-control, retention or
similar plans. Parent shall, and shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries
to, provide Company Employees whose employment terminates during the
Continuation Period with severance compensation and benefits at least at the
levels such Company Employee would have become entitled to under the terms of
the Company's severance plans and policies set forth on Section 6.6(a) of the
Company Disclosure Letter.

  

  

(b) For purposes of determining eligibility to participate and vesting (other
than any equity plan or long-term incentive plans) and, with respect to any
paid time off or severance benefits only, for purposes of determining levels
of benefits, under the employee benefit plans of Parent and its Subsidiaries
providing benefits to any Company Employees after the Effective Time (the "New
Plans"), Parent shall or shall cause each Company Employee to be credited with
his or her years of service with the Company and its Subsidiaries and their
respective predecessors before the Effective Time, to the same extent such
credit for such service under any similar Company Benefit Plan or Company
Foreign Plan was recognized as of the Effective Time; provided, however, that
the foregoing shall not apply to the extent that its

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

48  

  

 

 

 

   
 

application would result in a duplication of benefits with respect to the same
period of service. In addition, and without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause (i) each
Company Employee to be immediately eligible to participate, without any
waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the extent coverage under such New
Plan is comparable to a Company Benefit Plan or Company Foreign Plan in which
such Company Employee participated immediately before the Effective Time (such
plans, collectively, the "Old Plans"), (ii) in the plan year in which the
Effective Time occurs, for purposes of each New Plan providing medical,
dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits and/or short- or long-term
disability or life insurance benefits to any Company Employee (other than
health care flexible spending account benefits, which are addressed in clause
(iii) below), all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work
requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such employee and his or her
covered dependents, unless such conditions would not have been waived under
the comparable Old Plans of the Company or its Subsidiaries in which such
Company Employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time, and
Parent shall cause any eligible expenses incurred by such Company Employee and
his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old
Plan ending on the date such Company Employee's participation in the
corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into account under such New Plan for
purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket
requirements applicable to such Company Employee and his or her covered
dependents as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan
and (iii) in the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs, for purposes of
each New Plan providing health care flexible spending account benefits or
dependent care flexible spending account benefits to any Company Employee, the
Company or the Parent to take into account the contributions of such Company
Employee and reimbursements received by such Company Employee under the Old
Plan for the plan year in which the employee's participation in the New Plan
commences for purposes of determining the reimbursements that may be made to
such employee under the New Plan; provided, however, that if the Old Plan and
New Plan do not operate on the same plan year, the Company Employee's
participation in each Old Plan providing health care flexible spending account
benefits or dependent care flexible spending account benefits shall continue
for the remainder of the current plan year in which the Effective Time occurs.

  

  

(c) With respect to any Company Employees based outside of the United States,
Parent's obligations under this Section 6.6 shall be modified to the extent
required to comply with applicable Laws.

  

  

(d) This Section 6.6 shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of
each of the parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this Section 6.6,
expressed or implied, is intended to confer upon any other Person who is not a
party to this Agreement any rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever
(including any third party beneficiary rights) under or by reason of this
Section 6.6. Nothing contained in this Section 6.6 or any other provision of
this Agreement, whether express or implied, is intended to confer upon any
Person who is not a party to this Agreement, including any Company Employee or
any current or former director or consultant of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, any right to continued employment, resumed employment or recall,
any right to receipt or continued receipt of compensation or benefits, or any
other rights of any kind or nature whatsoever. Nothing contained in this
Section 6.6 or any other provision of this Agreement, express or implied,
shall constitute an establishment of or amendment to or any other modification
of, or shall limit the ability of Parent

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

49  

  

 

 

 

   
 

or any of its Affiliates (including, following the Closing, the Company or any
Company Subsidiary) from amending of terminating, any benefit or compensation
plan, program, agreement, contract or arrangement.

  

  

6.7 Indemnification and Directors' and Officers' Insurance.

  

  

(a) Parent, the Surviving Corporation and Merger Sub agree that all rights to
exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses now existing in favor
of the current or former directors or officers, as the case may be, of the
Company or its Subsidiaries as provided in their respective articles of
incorporation or bylaws or other Organizational Documents or in any Contract
in effect on the date hereof shall survive the Merger and shall continue in
full force and effect for a period of six (6) years. For a period of six (6)
years from the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall
maintain in effect the exculpation, indemnification and advancement of
expenses provisions of the Company's and any of its Subsidiaries' articles of
incorporation, bylaws or similar Organizational Documents as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time or in any indemnification Contracts of
the Company or its Subsidiaries with any of their respective directors or
officers as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, and shall not
amend, repeal or otherwise modify any such provisions in any manner that would
adversely affect the rights thereunder of any individuals who at the Effective
Time were current or former directors or officers of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries; provided, however, that all rights to indemnification in respect
of any Litigation pending or asserted or any claim made within such period
shall continue until the disposition of such Litigation or resolution of such
claim. From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Company and
its Subsidiaries to honor, in accordance with their respective terms, each of
the covenants contained in this Section 6.7 without limit as to time.

  

  

(b) From and after the Effective Time, each of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law,
indemnify and hold harmless (and advance funds in respect of each of the
foregoing) each current and former director or officer of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries (each, together with such person's heirs, executors or
administrators, an "Indemnified Party") against any costs, fees or expenses
(including advancing reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses in advance of the
final disposition of any claim, suit, proceeding or investigation to each
Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted by Law), judgments, fines,
losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement incurred
in connection with any actual or threatened Litigation, arising out of,
relating to or in connection with any action or omission occurring or alleged
to have occurred whether before or after the Effective Time (including
matters, acts or omissions in connection with (i) the approval of this
Agreement and the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or (ii) such persons serving as an officer,
director or other fiduciary in any entity or Company Benefit Plan if such
service was at the request or for the benefit of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries), whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective
Time, to the fullest extent that the Company would have been permitted under
Missouri Law and its Articles of Incorporation, Bylaws and any applicable
Contracts in effect on the date hereof to indemnify such Person (and Parent or
the Surviving Corporation shall also advance expenses as incurred to the
fullest extent permitted under applicable Law and required by any applicable
Contracts; provided that, to the extent required by applicable Law, the Person

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

50  

  

 

 

 

   
 

to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances
if it is ultimately determined that such Person is not entitled to
indemnification by a court of competent jurisdiction) and provided, further,
that any determination required to be made with respect to whether an
officer's or director's conduct complies with the standards set forth under
Missouri Law and the Company's Articles of Incorporation, Bylaws and any
applicable Contracts shall be made by independent counsel selected jointly by
the Surviving Corporation and the Indemnified Parties.

  

  

(c) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under Section
6.7(b), upon learning of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, shall promptly notify Parent thereof, but the failure to so
notify shall not relieve Parent or the Surviving Corporation of any liability
it may have to such Indemnified Party except to the extent such failure
materially prejudices the indemnifying party. In the event of any such claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before or after the
Effective Time), (i) Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall have the right
to assume the defense thereof and Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall
not be liable to such Indemnified Parties for any legal expenses of other
counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified
Parties in connection with the defense thereof, except that if Parent or the
Surviving Corporation elects not to assume such defense or counsel for the
Indemnified Parties advises that there are issues which raise conflicts of
interest between Parent or the Surviving Corporation and the Indemnified
Parties, the Indemnified Parties may retain counsel satisfactory to them, and
Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall pay all reasonable fees and expenses
of such counsel for the Indemnified Parties promptly as statements therefor
are received; provided, however, that Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall be obligated pursuant to this Section 6.7(c) to pay for only one counsel
for all Indemnified Parties in any jurisdiction unless the use of one counsel
for such Indemnified Parties would present such counsel with a conflict of
interest; provided, that the fewest number of counsels necessary to avoid
conflicts of interest shall be used, (ii) the Indemnified Parties will
reasonably cooperate in the defense of any such matter, and (iii) Parent and
the Surviving Corporation shall not be liable for any settlement effected
without their prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed). Neither Parent nor the Surviving
Corporation shall settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment
in any proceeding or threatened action, suit, proceeding, investigation or
claim (and in which indemnification could be sought by any Indemnified Party
under this Section 6.7), unless such settlement, compromise or consent
includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all liability
arising out of such action, suit, proceeding, investigation or claim or such
Indemnified Party otherwise consents in writing. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, if any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation (whether arising before, at or after the Effective Time) is made
against any Indemnified Party on or prior to the sixth anniversary of the
Effective Time, then the provisions of this Section 6.7 shall continue in
effect until the final disposition of such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation.

  

  

(d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall purchase a six-year,
prepaid "tail" policy on the Company's directors' and officers' liability
insurance policies in effect on the date of this Agreement in respect of
actions or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time; provided that in
no event shall the cost of such tail policy exceed 300% of the current annual
premiums paid by the Company for such insurance; and provided, further, that
if the cost of such insurance exceeds 300% of the current annual premiums paid
by the Company

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

51  

  

 

 

 

   
 

for such insurance, the Company shall obtain a policy with the greatest
coverage available for a cost not exceeding 300% of the current annual
premiums paid by the Company for such insurance. The Surviving Corporation
shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) maintain such
"tail" policy in full force and effect and continue to honor their respective
obligations thereunder for so long as such "tail" policy shall be maintained
in full force and effect.

  

  

(e) Parent shall pay all expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, that
may be incurred by any Indemnified Party in enforcing the indemnity and other
obligations provided in this Section 6.7.

  

  

(f) The rights of each Indemnified Party hereunder shall be in addition to,
and not in limitation of, any other rights such Indemnified Party may have
under the articles of incorporation or bylaws or other Organizational
Documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the Surviving
Corporation, any other indemnification Contract, the MGBCL or otherwise. The
provisions of this Section 6.7 shall survive the consummation of the Merger
and expressly are intended to benefit, and are enforceable by, each of the
Indemnified Parties. After the Closing, the obligations of the Company and
Parent under this Section 6.7 shall not be terminated, amended, repealed,
revoked or modified in any manner which will adversely affect any Indemnified
Party without the consent of the affected Indemnified Party.

  

  

(g) In the event Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in either such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set
forth in this Section 6.7.

  

  

6.8 Section 16 Matters. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent, Merger Sub and
the Company shall each take all commercially reasonable steps as may be
necessary or appropriate to cause any disposition of Company Shares or
conversion of any derivative securities in respect of such Company Shares in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement by each individual who is a director or officer of the Company to be
exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

  

  

6.9 Takeover Laws. The parties shall use their respective reasonable best
efforts (a) to take all action necessary so that no Takeover Law is or becomes
applicable to the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and (b) if any such Takeover Law is or becomes applicable to any of
the foregoing, to take all action necessary so that the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to
eliminate or minimize the effect of such Takeover Law on the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

  

6.10 Publicity. On the date hereof, the Company and Parent shall issue a press
release substantially in the form of Exhibit D hereto. Unless the Company
Board shall have effected a Change of Recommendation in accordance with
Section 6.5, Parent and the Company

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

52  

  

 

 

 

   
 

shall consult with each other before issuing any other press release or other
public release or written announcement concerning the execution of this
Agreement or concerning any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the Merger, and no other written public release or
written announcement concerning such matters shall be issued by any party
without the prior written consent of the other party (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), except as such release or
announcement may be required by Law or the rules or regulations of any
securities exchange, in which case the party required to make the release or
announcement shall, to the extent reasonably practicable, allow the other
party reasonable time to comment on such release or announcement in advance of
such issuance.

  

  

6.11 Financing; Cooperation.

  

  

(a) Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall use its reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange and consummate the Financing
as soon as reasonably practicable on the terms and conditions described in the
Commitment Letters, including using reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in
full force and effect the Commitment Letters, (ii) negotiate and enter into
definitive agreements with respect thereto on the terms and conditions
contained in the Commitment Letters, (iii) comply with and satisfy all terms,
covenants and conditions to funding set forth in the Commitment Letters and
any definitive documents related to the Financing such that the Financing will
be able to be consummated at or prior to the Effective Time, (iv) enforce its
rights under the Commitment Letters and (v) consummate the Financing at or
prior to the Effective Time. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall terminate any
Commitment Letter or reduce the amount of the Financing available thereunder.
Parent will furnish true, correct and complete copies of all such material
definitive agreements relating the Financing to the Company promptly upon
their execution if prior to the Effective Date.

  

  

(b) Parent shall keep the Company informed with respect to all material
activity concerning the status of the Financing and shall give the Company
prompt notice of any material adverse change with respect to such Financing.
Without limiting the foregoing, Parent agrees to notify the Company promptly,
and in any event within two (2) Business Days, if at any time (i) any of the
Commitment Letters shall expire or be terminated for any reason, (ii) any
financing source that is a party to any Commitment Letter notifies Parent that
such source no longer intends to provide financing to Parent on the terms set
forth therein, (iii) any actual or threatened breach, default, termination or
repudiation by any party to the Commitment Letters or definitive agreements
relating to the Commitment Letter or any material dispute or disagreement
between or among the parties to the Commitment Letters or definitive
agreements relating to the Commitment Letters with respect to the obligation
to fund the Financing or the amount of the Financing to be funded at Closing,
or (iv) for any reason Parent or Sub no longer believes in good faith that it
will be able to obtain all or any portion of the Financing contemplated by the
Commitment Letters on the terms or within the timing described therein. Parent
shall not, and shall cause Merger Sub not to, amend, supplement, waive or
otherwise modify or replace, or agree to amend, supplement, waive or otherwise
modify or replace, the Commitment Letters in any manner prohibited by Section
6.11(c). Upon any such amendment, supplement, waiver or modification or
replacement of the Commitment Letters in accordance with Section 6.11(c) and
this Section 6.11(b), the term "Commitment Letters," "Debt Commitment Letters"
or "Equity

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

53  

  

 

 

 

   
 

Commitment Letters" shall mean the applicable Commitment Letters as so
amended, supplemented or modified or replaced.

  

  

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, after the date
of this Agreement but prior to the Effective Time, any Debt Commitment Letter
may be amended, supplemented, modified, replaced or any provision thereof
waived or superseded by written amendments to or agreements (in each case,
whether by amendment, supplement, modification or superseding agreement, the
"Alternative Commitment Letters") replacing the existing Debt Commitment
Letter, if and only if any such amendment, supplement, modification, waiver or
replacement: (i) does not reduce (and could not have the effect of reducing)
the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing to an amount that would cause
Parent and Merger Sub to not have sufficient funds to pay the aggregate Merger
Consideration and to pay all fees and expenses relating to the consummation of
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby on the Effective
Date and (ii) does not impose and would not reasonably be expected to impose
any new or additional conditions or otherwise expand, amend, or modify any of
the conditions to the Debt Financing or that otherwise expands, amends or
modifies any provisions in the Debt Commitment Letter or definitive documents
relating thereto in a manner that does or would reasonably be expected to (A)
delay or prevent or make less likely the funding of the Financing (or
satisfaction of the conditions to the Financing) on the date of the Closing or
(B) adversely impact the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to enforce its rights
against the other parties to the Debt Commitment Letters or definitive
documents relating thereto. In such event, (x) the term "Debt Commitment
Letter" as used herein shall be deemed to include the Debt Commitment Letters
that are not so superseded at the time in question or that are amended,
supplemented, modified, superseded or replaced in accordance with this Section
6.11(c) and any Alternative Commitment Letters entered into in accordance with
this Section 6.11(c) to the extent then in effect, and (y) the term "Debt
Financing" as used herein shall mean the debt financing contemplated by the
Commitment Letters as amended, modified or superseded in accordance this
Section 6.11(c). Parent shall deliver to the Company a substantially complete,
advance copy of any such amendment, supplement, modification, waiver or
replacement at least 24 hours prior to execution (provided, that in no event
shall such notice be delivered less than one Business Day prior to execution),
and promptly deliver to the Company true, correct and complete copies of any
such amendment, supplement, modification, waiver or replacement following
execution.

  

  

(d) If any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and
conditions or within the timing contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter or
the Debt Commitment Letter shall be terminated or modified for any reason not
in accordance with this Agreement (but without waiving any responsibility or
liability for breach by Parent or Merger Sub of its obligations under this
Agreement), then Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to arrange to
obtain Alternative Commitment Letters from alternative lenders in an amount
sufficient to consummate the Merger. The obligations under Sections 6.11(a)
and (b) shall apply equally to any such Alternate Commitment Letters
(including any new financing commitment). Parent shall keep Company informed
on a current basis in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to
arrange such Alternate Commitment Letters and shall, upon request, provide
true and complete copies of all documents related to the Alternate Commitment
Letters to the Company.

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

54  

  

 

 

 

   
 


 

  

  

(e) Unless the Company Board shall have effected a Change of Recommendation in
accordance with Section 6.5, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to use their commercially
reasonable efforts to, and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
cause its Representatives to use their commercially reasonable efforts to,
provide all cooperation that is customary and reasonable in connection with
the arrangement of the Debt Financing as may be reasonably requested in
writing by Parent (provided that such requested cooperation does not
unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries or require any non-continuing director, officer or employee of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to execute any solvency certificate or
similar document), including (i) participation in a reasonable number of
meetings, due diligence sessions, lender presentations, "road shows" and
sessions with ratings agencies, (ii) assisting with the preparation of
materials for rating agency presentations, offering documents, private
placement memoranda, bank information memoranda, prospectuses and similar
documents required in connection with the Debt Financing, (iii) furnishing
Parent and its debt financing sources (including the Financing Parties) with
such pertinent and customary information regarding the Company and its
Subsidiaries, including information required under "know your customer" and
anti-money laundering rules and regulations, all presently available financial
statements and financial projections and other pertinent financial information
required by the Debt Commitment Letter, pro forma financial information,
financial data, audit reports and other information of the type required by
Regulation S-X or Regulation S-K under the Securities Act and of type and form
customarily included in a registration statement on Form S-3 (or any
applicable successor form) under the Securities Act, in each case reasonably
requested in writing by Parent (other than information for which the Company
is dependent on information to be provided by Parent to the Company to prepare
such financial statements or projections or other information unless such
information is provided to the Company by Parent in a timely and reasonable
fashion), (iv) obtaining such consents, approvals and authorizations which
shall be reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the Debt Financing
and collateral arrangements in connection therewith, and (v) obtaining any
intellectual property assignment agreements relating to the Company Owned
Intellectual Property, and making all necessary filings with governmental
registration agencies to update ownership title in and to effectuate the
release of any security interests granted in the Company Owned Intellectual
Property, in each case as reasonably requested in writing by Parent; provided,
that, in each case, (A) none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or its
representatives shall be required to pay (or agree to pay) any commitment or
other fee, provide any indemnities or incur any liability in connection with
the Debt Financing prior to the Effective Time and (B) no personal liability
shall be imposed on the officers, directors, employees or agents involved.
Parent shall promptly, upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company and
its Representatives for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses
(including reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred by them in connection with the
cooperation of the Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective
Representatives contemplated by this Section 6.11. Parent and Merger Sub shall
jointly and severally indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Representatives
of the Company and its Subsidiaries, subject to Section 6.7, from and against
any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, fees, expenses, judgments
and fines arising in whole or in part out of actions or omissions undertaken
pursuant to this Section 6.11.

of the conditions set forth in Section 7.1 or 7.3 not being satisfied and is
not curable or, if curable, has not been cured within the earlier of (A) the
End Date or (B) twenty (20) Business Days after written notice thereof has
been given to Parent or Merger Sub by the Company; provided, however, that the
Company is not then in material breach of this Agreement so as to cause any of
the conditions set forth in Section 7.1 or Section 7.2 not to be satisfied;

  

  

(ii) at any time prior to the Requisite Stockholder Vote is obtained, if the

58  

  

 

 

 

   
 

provided, however, that the Company may not terminate this Agreement pursuant
to this Section 8.1(d)(iii) if the failure to obtain the Requisite Stockholder
Vote shall have been primarily caused by the Company's material breach of its
obligations in Section 6.1, Section 6.3(a), Section 6.3(b), Section 6.5 or
Section 6.9 which breach is not curable or, if curable, has not been cured
within ten (10) Business Days after written notice thereof has been given to
the Company by Parent; or

  

  

(iv) if (A) all of the conditions set forth in Sections 7.1 and 7.2 have been
satisfied (other than conditions that, by their nature, are to be satisfied at
the Closing and which were, at the time of termination, capable of being
satisfied at such time, or the failure of which to be satisfied, is caused by
a breach by Parent or Merger Sub of its representations, warranties, covenants
or agreements contained in this Agreement), (B) the Company has notified
Parent in writing that the Company is ready, willing and able to consummate
the Closing, and (C) Parent and Merger Sub have failed to consummate the

(e) by Parent, by written notice, at any time prior to the time the Requisite

(i) the Company breaches or fails to perform any of its representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement, which breach
or failure to perform results in any of the conditions set forth in Section
7.2(a) or 7.2(b) not being satisfied and is not curable or, if curable, has
not been cured within the earlier of (A) the End Date or (B) twenty (20)
Business Days after written notice thereof has been given to the Company by
Parent or Merger Sub; provided, however, that neither Parent nor Merger Sub is
then in material breach of this Agreement so as to cause any of the conditions
set forth in Section 7.1 or Section 7.3 not to be satisfied;

  

  

(ii) (A) the Company Board or any committee thereof shall have effected a
Change of Recommendation, or publicly proposed to effect a Change of
Recommendation, or approved, endorsed or recommended, or publicly proposed to
approve, endorse or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal, (B) any member of the
Company Board shall have publicly stated that such member opposes the Merger,
(C) any member of the Company Board shall have required the inclusion in the
Proxy Statement or any other filing made by the Company with the SEC a
statement to the effect that such member opposes the Merger, or (D) the
Company shall have breached any of its obligations under Section 6.5 (other
than immaterial or inadvertent breaches thereof not intended to result in an
Acquisition Proposal); or

  

  

(iii) the Company Stockholder Meeting shall have been held and completed and
the Requisite Stockholder Vote shall not have been obtained at such Company
Stockholder Meeting or at any adjournment, postponement or recess thereof;
provided, however, that Parent may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to

provided, further, that Parent may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this Section 8.1(e)(iii) if the failure to obtain the Requisite Stockholder

breach of its obligations in Section 6.1, Section 6.3(a) or Section 6.9 which

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

59  

  

 

 

 

   
 

breach is not curable or, if curable, has not been cured within ten (10)
Business Days after written notice thereof has been given to Parent by the
Company.

  

  

8.2 Termination Fee.

  

  

(a) If this Agreement is terminated:

  

  

(i) (A) pursuant to Sections 8.1(d)(iii), 8.1(e)(i) (other than as provided in
Section 8.2(a)(iv)), 8.1(e)(ii)(D) or 8.1(e)(iii), (B) any Person shall have
delivered to the Company or publicly disclosed an Acquisition Proposal
(substituting "66.67%" with respect to shares and "50%" with respect to assets
in the definition of Acquisition Proposal, a "Qualifying Acquisition
Proposal"), and not withdrawn such Qualifying Acquisition Proposal, prior to
the date of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to clause (A) above,
and (C) within twelve (12) months of such termination, the Company enters into
a definitive agreement with respect to any Qualifying Acquisition Proposal or
consummates the transactions contemplated by a Qualifying Acquisition Proposal
prior to the termination of this Agreement pursuant to clause (A) above, then
the Company shall, on the date such Qualifying Acquisition Proposal is
consummated, pay or cause to be paid an amount equal to $10,989,000 (the
"Company Termination Fee") (less any Reimbursable Expenses previously
reimbursed under Section 8.4(a)) to Parent by wire transfer of same day funds
to one or more accounts designated by Parent;

  

  

(ii) (A) pursuant to Section 8.1(b), (B) any Person shall have delivered to
the Company or publicly disclosed a Qualifying Acquisition Proposal, and not
withdrawn such Qualifying Acquisition Proposal, prior to the date of the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to clause (A) above, and (C) within
twelve (12) months of such termination, the Company enters into a definitive
agreement with respect to any Qualifying Acquisition Proposal or consummates
the transactions contemplated by a Qualifying Acquisition Proposal prior to
the termination of this Agreement pursuant to clause (A) above, then the
Company shall, on the date such Qualifying Acquisition Proposal is
consummated, pay or cause to be paid the Company Termination Fee (less any
Reimbursable Expenses previously reimbursed under Section 8.4(a)) to Parent by
wire transfer of same day funds to one or more accounts designated by Parent;

  

  

(iii) by the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(d)(ii), the Company shall pay the
Company Termination Fee to Parent on or prior to the date of such termination
by wire transfer of same day funds to one (1) or more accounts designated by
Parent; provided, that if such termination occurs prior to the Solicitation
Period End-Date on account of a Superior Proposal by a Person that is an
Excluded Party, then the Company shall pay to Parent an amount equal to
$5,494,000 (the "Excluded Party Fee"), instead of the Company Termination Fee,
on or prior to the date of such termination by wire transfer of same day funds
to one (1) or more accounts designated by Parent;

  

  

(iv) by Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(e)(ii)(A), (B) or (C), the Company
shall pay the Company Termination Fee (less any Reimbursable Expenses
previously reimbursed under Section 8.4(a)) to Parent within two (2) Business
Days after the date of such termination by wire transfer of same day funds to
one (1) or more

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

60  

  

 

 

 

   
 

accounts designated by Parent; provided, that if such termination occurs prior
to the Solicitation Period End-Date on account of a Superior Proposal by a
Person that is an Excluded Party, then the Company shall pay to Parent an
amount equal to the Excluded Party Fee (less any Reimbursable Expenses
previously reimbursed under Section 8.4(a)), instead of the Company
Termination Fee, within two (2) Business Days after the date of such
termination by wire transfer of same day funds to one (1) or more accounts
designated by Parent; or

  

  

(v) by the Company pursuant to Sections 8.1(d)(i) or 8.1(d)(iv), then Parent
shall promptly, but in no event later than two (2) Business Days, after the
date of such termination, pay or cause to be paid to the Company or its
designees an amount equal to $18,838,000 (the "Parent Termination Fee") by
wire transfer of same day funds to one (1) or more accounts designated by the
Company.

  

  

For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall (x) the Company be required to
pay the Excluded Party Fee or Company Termination Fee (A) on more than one (1)
occasion or (B) if, at the time this Agreement is terminated, this Agreement
could have been terminated by the Company pursuant to Sections 8.1(c) or
(d)(i) or (y) Parent be required to pay the Parent Termination Fee (A) on more
than one (1) occasion or (B) if, at the time this Agreement is terminated,
this Agreement could have been terminated by Parent pursuant to Sections
8.1(c) or (e)(i).

  

  

(b) The Company and Parent acknowledge that the agreements contained in this
Section 8.2 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the other parties would not
enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company fails to promptly pay
the amount due pursuant to Section 8.2(a), and, in order to obtain such
payment, Parent or Merger Sub commences a suit that results in a judgment
against the Company for the fee set forth in Section 8.2(a) or any portion of
such fee, then the Company shall pay to Parent or Merger Sub its costs and
expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) in connection with such suit,
together with interest on the amount of the fee at the prime rate of Citibank,
N.A. in effect on the date such payment was required to be made through the
date of payment; provided, however, that if Parent or Merger Sub fails to
prevail in any such suit, then Parent shall promptly pay the Company's costs
and expenses (including reasonable attorney's fees) in connection therewith.
Further, if Parent fails to promptly pay the amount due pursuant to Section
8.2(a), and, in order to obtain such payment, the Company commences a suit
that results in a judgment against Parent for the fee set forth in Section
8.2(a) or any portion of such fee, then Parent shall pay to the Company its
costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) in connection with
such suit, together with interest on the amount of the fee at the prime rate
of Citibank, N.A. in effect on the date such payment was required to be made
through the date of payment; provided, however, that if the Company fails to
prevail in any such suit, then the Company shall promptly pay Parent's costs
and expenses (including reasonable attorney's fees) in connection therewith.

  

  

(c) Notwithstanding any of the other terms of this Agreement (except for an
order of specific performance as and only to the extent expressly permitted by
Section 9.11), Parent's right to receive payment of the amounts due pursuant
to Section 8.2(a) shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent, Merger Sub
and their respective Affiliates against the Company or any of its Affiliates
or stockholders for failure to consummate the transactions contemplated

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

61  

  

 

 

 

   
 

by this Agreement in connection with any proper termination of this Agreement
under Sections 8.1(b), 8.1(d)(ii), 8.1(d)(iii) or 8.1(e) and for any losses
suffered under this Agreement in connection therewith and shall constitute
liquidated damages and full satisfaction of the Company's and any of its
Affiliate's or stockholder's liabilities and obligations under this Agreement
as a result thereof.

  

  

(d) Notwithstanding any of the other terms of this Agreement (except for an
order of specific performance as and only to the extent expressly permitted by
Section 9.11), the Company's right to receive payment of the amounts due
pursuant to Section 8.2(a) shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the
Company and its Affiliates against Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
respective Affiliates or equityholders for failure to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement in connection with any proper
termination of this Agreement under Sections 8.1(b), 8.1(d)(i) or 8.1(d)(iv)
and for any losses suffered under this Agreement in connection therewith and
shall constitute liquidated damages and full satisfaction of Parent's, Merger
Sub's and any of their respective Affiliate's or equityholder's liabilities
and obligations under this Agreement as a result thereof.

  

  

8.3 Effect of Termination. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section
8.1 hereof, then this Agreement shall forthwith become null and void, and
there shall be no liability or obligation on the part of the Company, Parent,
Merger Sub or their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates, except that the
provisions of Sections 6.2(b), 8.2, 8.3, 8.4 and Articles IX and X hereof will
survive the termination hereof; provided, however, that nothing herein shall
relieve any party hereto from liability for fraud.

  

  

8.4 Fees and Expenses.

  

  

(a) In the event this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1(d)(iii),
Section 8.1(e)(i), Section 8.1(e)(ii) or Section 8.1(e)(iii) under
circumstances in which the Company Termination Fee or Excluded Party Fee is
not then payable pursuant to Section 8.2, if at all, then the Company shall
reimburse Parent for all of its Reimbursable Expenses within two (2) Business
Days after the date of such termination by wire transfer of same day funds to
one (1) or more accounts designated by Parent.

  

  

(b) Except as expressly set forth in Section 8.2 or Section 9.11, whether or
not the Merger is consummated, all fees and expenses incurred in connection
with the Merger, this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such fees or expenses.

62

(c) any estimates, projections, predictions, data, financial information,

shall not be deemed to limit or affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement.

and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not affect the
validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof. If any provision of
this Agreement, or the application thereof to any Person or any circumstance,

9.6 Integration. This Agreement, the Company Disclosure Letter, the Parent
Disclosure Letter, the Confidentiality Agreement and the schedules, annexes,
and exhibits attached to any such documents constitute the entire agreement
and understanding between the Company, Parent and Merger Sub with respect to
the matters referred to herein and supersede all

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

64  

  

 

 

 

   
 

other prior agreements, understandings, representations or warranties both
written and oral, in each case among the parties, with respect to such
matters.

  

  

9.7 Governing Law. With respect to matters related to the transactions
contemplated by the Merger, this Agreement shall be governed and construed in
accordance with the Laws of the State of Missouri applicable to contracts made

principles.

  

  

9.8 No Third-Party Beneficiaries. Except for (a) the right of the Company on
behalf of its stockholders to pursue damages in the event of Parent's or
Merger Sub's breach of any covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement
and (b) the provisions of Sections 6.7 and 9.13, Parent and Merger Sub, on the
one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, hereby agree that their
respective representations, warranties and covenants set forth herein are
solely for the benefit of the other party hereto, in accordance with and
subject to the terms of this Agreement, and this Agreement is not intended to,
and does not, confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto any rights
or remedies hereunder, including, without limitation, the right to rely upon
the representations and warranties set forth herein. The representations and
warranties in this Agreement (a) are the product of negotiations among the
parties hereto, (b) are for the sole benefit of the parties hereto, (c) may be
intended not as statements of fact, but rather as a way of allocating the risk
to one of the parties if those statements prove to be inaccurate, (d) have
been qualified by reference to the Company Disclosure Letter and the Parent
Disclosure Letter, each of which contains certain disclosures that are not
reflected in the text of this Agreement and (e) may apply standards of
materiality in a way that is different from what may be viewed as material by
stockholders of, or other investors in, the Company. Any inaccuracies in such
representations and warranties are subject to waiver by the parties hereto in
accordance with Section 9.9 without notice or liability to any other Person.
Consequently, Persons other than the parties hereto may not rely upon the
representations and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of
actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any
other date.

  

  

9.9 Amendments; Waiver. Subject to the provisions of the applicable Laws, this
Agreement may not be modified or amended except pursuant to an instrument in
writing signed by the Company, Parent and Merger Sub and, in the case of any
modification to or amendment of Section 9.13, the Financing Parties, and, in
the case of any modification to or amendment of Section 6.7, the affected
Indemnified Parties (provided, that, prior to Closing, no consent of the
Indemnified Parties shall be required to modify or amend Section 6.7). Subject
to the provisions of the applicable Laws, any party may waive in whole or in
part any benefit or right provided to it under this Agreement, such waiver
being effective only if contained in a writing executed by the waiving party.
No failure by any party to insist upon the strict performance of any covenant,
duty, agreement or condition of this Agreement or to exercise any right or
remedy consequent upon breach thereof shall constitute a waiver of any such
breach or of any other covenant, duty, agreement or condition, nor shall any
delay or omission of any party to exercise any right hereunder in any manner
impair the exercise of any such right accruing to it thereafter.

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

65  

  

 

 

 

   
 


 

  

  

9.10 Assignment. This Agreement shall not be assignable by operation of Law or
otherwise; provided, however, that Parent and Merger Sub may (a) assign, by
prior written notice to the Company, any of their rights or obligations
hereunder to a direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent, except
that all representations and warranties made herein with respect to Parent and
Merger Sub as of the date of this Agreement shall be deemed representations
and warranties made with respect to such Affiliate as of the date of such
designation, (b) collaterally assign this Agreement to any parties providing
debt financing pursuant to the terms thereof (including for purposes of
creating a security interest herein or otherwise assigning as collateral in
respect of such financing) and (c) assign any of their rights or obligations
hereunder, in whole or in part, to any Person on or after the Effective Time;
provided, further, that any such designation shall not materially impede or
delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
otherwise materially impede the rights of the stockholders of the Company
under this Agreement and that no such assignment shall relieve the assigning
party of its obligations hereunder if such assignee does not perform such
obligations. Any purported assignment in violation of this Agreement is void.

  

  

9.11 Remedies; Jurisdiction.

  

  

(a) Remedies of Parent and Merger Sub.

  

  

(i) Specific Performance. Prior to the valid termination of this Agreement
pursuant to Article VIII, Parent and Merger Sub shall be entitled to seek and
obtain an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to
prevent breaches of this Agreement by the Company in the courts described in
Section 9.11(e) and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof,
including the Company's obligation to consummate the Merger.

  

  

(ii) Company Termination Fee. Parent shall be entitled to payment of the
Company Termination Fee if and when payable pursuant to Section 8.2(a) hereof.

  

  

(iii) Excluded Party Fee. Parent shall be entitled to payment of the Excluded
Party Fee if and when payable pursuant to Section 8.2(a) hereof.

  

  

(iv) Reimbursable Expenses. Parent shall be entitled to reimbursement of
Reimbursable Expenses if and when payable pursuant to Section 8.4(a) hereof.

  

  

(v) Termination. Parent and Merger Sub shall be entitled to terminate this
Agreement in accordance with Article VIII hereof.

  

  

(vi) Monetary Damages. Other than in the case of fraud, in no event shall
Parent, Merger Sub, the Guarantor or any of their respective former, current
and future direct or indirect equityholders, controlling persons,
stockholders, directors, officers, employees, agents, Affiliates, members,
managers, general or limited partners or assignees have the right to seek or
obtain money damages from the Company or any Company Related Party under this
Agreement (whether at law or in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise)
following termination of this Agreement in accordance with Section 8.1, other
than the right of Parent and Merger Sub to payment of the Company

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

66  

  

 

 

 

   
 

Termination Fee, Excluded Party Fee or Reimbursable Expenses, as the case may
be, pursuant to Section 8.2(a) hereof.

  

  

(b) Remedies of the Company.

  

  

(i) Specific Performance. Prior to the valid termination of this Agreement
pursuant to Article VIII, the Company shall be entitled to seek and obtain an
injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent
breaches of this Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub in the courts described in
Section 9.11(e) and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof;
provided that, the Company shall be entitled to seek and obtain an injunction,
specific performance and other equitable remedies to enforce Parent's and
Merger Sub's obligations to cause the Equity Financing to be funded and to
consummate the Merger only in the event that each of the following conditions
has been satisfied: (i) the conditions set forth in Section 7.1 and Section
7.2 (other than conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the
Closing) have been satisfied on the date the Closing should have been
consummated pursuant to the terms of this Agreement but for the failure of the
Equity Financing to be funded, (ii) the Debt Financing (including any
alternative financing that has been obtained in accordance with, and satisfies
the conditions of, Section 6.11) has been funded in accordance with the terms
thereof or will be funded in accordance with the terms thereof at the Closing
if the Equity Financing is funded at the Closing, and (iii) the Company has
confirmed in writing to Parent that if the Equity Financing and Debt Financing
are funded, then it would take all such actions that are within its control to
cause the Closing to occur. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company agrees
to cause any action, including any action seeking an injunction, specific
performance or other equitable, to be dismissed with prejudice at such time as
Parent and Merger Sub consummate the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (but such dismissal shall not be a condition
thereto). For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the Company be
entitled to seek the remedy of specific performance of Parent's and Merger
Sub's obligations to cause the Equity Financing to be funded or to complete
the Merger other than solely under the specific circumstances and as
specifically set forth in this Section 9.11(b). The election to pursue an
injunction, specific performance or other equitable remedy shall not restrict,
impair or otherwise limit the Company from, in the alternative, seeking to
terminate this Agreement and collect the Parent Termination Fee under Section
8.2(a); provided that in no event shall the Company be permitted to an
injunction, specific performance or other equitable remedy under this
Agreement following the payment of the Parent Termination Fee. For the
avoidance of doubt, the Company shall be entitled to enforce its rights (by
litigation or otherwise) as a third party beneficiary of the Equity Commitment
Letter in the event that the conditions in this Section 9.11(b)(i) are
satisfied.

  

  

(ii) Parent Termination Fee. The Company shall be entitled to the Parent
Termination Fee if and when payable pursuant to Section 8.2(a) hereof.

  

  

(iii) Termination. The Company shall be entitled to terminate this Agreement
in accordance with Article VIII hereof.

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

67

equity holders, controlling persons, stockholders, directors, officers,

however, that this Section 9.11(b)(v) shall not limit or restrict the remedies

(c) Acknowledgement Regarding Available Remedies

  

  

. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages,
even if available, would not be an adequate remedy would occur in the event
that the parties hereto do not perform their obligations under the provisions
of this Agreement (including failing to take such actions as are required of
them hereunder to consummate the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement) in accordance with its specified terms or
otherwise breach such provisions. The parties acknowledge and agree that (i)
the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions, specific
performance or other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement
and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in the courts
described in Section 9.11(e) without proof of damages or otherwise, (ii) the
provisions set forth in Section 8.2 are not intended to and do not adequately
compensate for the harm that would result from a breach of this Agreement and
shall not be construed to diminish or otherwise impair in any way any party's
right to specific performance and (iii) such rights of specific performance
are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
without such rights, neither the Company nor Parent would have entered into
this Agreement. Each of the parties hereto agrees that it will not oppose the
granting of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief on
the basis that the other parties hereto have an adequate remedy at law or an
award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at
law or in equity to the extent that the right of specific performance is
explicitly applicable under the terms of this Section 9.11. The parties hereto
acknowledge and agree that any party seeking an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement (to the extent that the right of specific
performance is explicitly applicable under the terms of this Section 9.11)
shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in connection with
any such order or injunction.

  

  

(d) Sole Remedy. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the remedies
provided for in this Section 9.11 shall be the parties' sole and exclusive
remedies for any breaches of this Agreement or any claims relating to the
transactions contemplated hereby.

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

68  

  

 

 

 

   
 

In furtherance of the foregoing, each party hereby waives, to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable law, any and all other rights, claims and
causes of action, known or unknown, foreseen or unforeseen, which exist or may
arise in the future, that such party may have against the other party or any
of its directors, officers, employees, investment bankers, attorneys,
accountants and other advisors or representatives arising under or based upon
any federal, state or local law (including any securities law, common law or
otherwise) for any breach of the representations and warranties or covenants
contained in this Agreement.

  

  

(e) Jurisdiction. Each of the parties hereto irrevocably agrees that any legal
action or proceeding with respect to this Agreement and the rights and
obligations arising hereunder, or for recognition and enforcement of any
judgment in respect of this Agreement and the rights and obligations arising
hereunder brought by the other party hereto or its successors or assigns shall
be brought and determined exclusively in the United States District Court for
the Northern District of Illinois, or in the event (but only in the event)
that such court does not have subject matter jurisdiction over such action or
proceeding, in the courts of the State of Illinois located in Cook County or
another court sitting in the State of Illinois. Each of the parties hereto
hereby irrevocably submits with regard to any such action or proceeding for
itself and in respect of its property, generally and unconditionally, to the
personal jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts and agrees that it will not
bring any action relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement in any court other than the aforesaid courts.
Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees not to
assert, by way of motion, as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any
action or proceeding with respect to this Agreement, (i) any claim that it is
not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the above-named courts for any
reason other than the failure to serve in accordance with this Section 9.11,
(ii) any claim that it or its property is exempt or immune from the
jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process commenced in such
courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment,
attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment or
otherwise) and (iii) to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable Law,
any claim that (A) the suit, action or proceeding in such court is brought in
an inconvenient forum, (B) the venue of such suit, action or proceeding is
improper or (C) this Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not be
enforced in or by such courts. Each of the parties hereto irrevocably consents
to the service of any summons and complaint and any other process in any other
action relating to this Agreement, on behalf of itself or its property, by the
personal delivery of copies of such process to such party or by sending or
delivering a copy of the process to the party to be served at the address and
in the manner provided for the giving of notices in this Section 9.11. Nothing
in this Section 9.11 shall affect the right of any party hereto to serve legal
process in any other manner permitted by Law.

  

  

9.12 Interpretation; Construction.

  

  

(a) The definitions in Sections 10.1 and 10.2 shall apply equally to both the
singular and plural forms of the terms defined. Whenever the context may
require, any pronoun shall include the corresponding masculine, feminine and
neuter forms. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used
in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation." All references herein to sections, paragraphs, subparagraphs,
clauses, Exhibits or Schedules shall be deemed references to sections,
paragraphs, subparagraphs or clauses of, or Exhibits or Schedules to this
Agreement, unless the context requires otherwise. Unless otherwise expressly
defined, terms defined in this Agreement

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

69  

  

 

 

 

   
 

have the same meanings when used in any Exhibit or Schedule hereto, including
the Company Disclosure Letter and the Parent Disclosure Letter. Unless
otherwise expressly specified, the words "this Agreement," "herein," "hereof,"
"hereto" and "hereunder" and other words of similar import refer to this
Agreement as a whole (including the Schedules, Annexes, Exhibits, the Company
Disclosure Letter and the Parent Disclosure Letter) and not to any particular
provision of this Agreement. The term "or" shall be inclusive and not
exclusive. The word "extent" in the phrase "to the extent" shall mean the
degree to which a subject or other thing extends, and such phrase shall not
mean simply "if." Any Contract, instrument or Law defined or referred to
herein or in any Contract or instrument that is referred to herein means such
Contract, instrument or Law as from time to time amended, modified or
supplemented, including (in the case of Contracts or instruments) by waiver or
consent and (in the case of Laws) by succession of comparable successor Laws
and references to all attachments thereto and instruments incorporated
therein. References to a Person are also to its permitted successors and
assigns. The phrase "made available" in this Agreement shall mean that the
information referred to has been made available by the party to whom such
information is to be made available. All references to dollars or "$" shall be
references to United States dollars.

  

  

(b) The parties have participated jointly in negotiating and drafting this
Agreement. In the event that an ambiguity or a question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly
by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provision of this
Agreement.

  

  

(c) The fact that any item of information is disclosed in the Company
Disclosure Letter to this Agreement shall not be construed to mean that such
information is required to be disclosed by this Agreement.

  

  

(d) Whenever this Agreement requires a Subsidiary of Parent to take any
action, such requirement shall be deemed to include an undertaking on the part
of Parent to cause such Subsidiary to take such action. Whenever this
Agreement requires a Subsidiary of the Company to take any action, such
requirement shall be deemed to include an undertaking on the part of the
Company to cause such Subsidiary to take such action and, after the Effective
Time, on the part of the Surviving Corporation to cause such Subsidiary to
take such action.

  

  

9.13 Financing Parties. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, each of the parties hereto: (i) agrees that it will not bring
or support any person in any action, suit, proceeding, cause of action, claim,
cross-claim or third-party claim of any kind or description, whether in law or
in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against any of the
Financing Parties (which defined term for the purposes of this provision shall

(whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) against any of
the Financing Parties in any way relating to the Debt Commitment Letters or
the performance thereof or the financings contemplated thereby, shall be
exclusively governed by, and construed in accordance with, the internal laws
of the State of New York, without giving effect to principles or rules or
conflict of laws to the extent such principles or rules would require or
permit the application of laws of another jurisdiction; and (iii) hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally waives any right such party may have to a
trial by jury in respect of any litigation (whether in law or in equity,
whether in contract or in tort or otherwise) directly or indirectly arising
out of or relating in any way to the Debt Commitment Letters or the
performance thereof or the financings contemplated thereby. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, (a) the Company and its
subsidiaries, affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents, partners,
managers, members or stockholders shall not have any rights or claims against
any Financing Party in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or in respect of any, or in
respect of any oral representations made or alleged to have been made in
connection herewith or therewith, including any dispute arising out of or
relating in any way to the Debt Commitment Letter or the performance thereof
or the financings contemplated thereby, whether at law or equity, in contract,

managers, members or stockholders for any obligations or liabilities of any
party hereto under this Agreement or for any claim based on, in respect of, or
by reason of, the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby or in respect

herewith or therewith, including any dispute arising out of or relating in any
way to the Debt Commitment Letters or the performance thereof or the
financings contemplated thereby, whether at law or equity, in contract, in
