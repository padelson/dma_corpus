        with
        respect to this Agreement, including, but not limited to, any dispute in
        connection with a claim by a third party (a "Dispute"). Either party may
        give
        the other party written notice of any Dispute not resolved in the normal
        course
        of business. If the parties cannot agree by the tenth Business Day following
        the
        date on which one party gives such notice (the "Dispute Date"), then the
        Dispute
        shall be determined as follows: Within 20 days of the Dispute Date, AT Co.
        and
        Valor shall each appoint one arbitrator. The two arbitrators so appointed
        shall
        appoint a third arbitrator within 30 days of the Dispute Date. If either
        party
        shall fail to appoint an arbitrator within such 20-day period, the arbitration
        shall be conducted by the sole arbitrator appointed by the other party. Whether
        selected by AT Co., Valor or otherwise, each arbitrator selected to resolve
        such
        dispute shall be a tax lawyer who is generally recognized in the tax community
        as a qualified and competent tax practitioner with experience in the tax
        area
        involved. Such arbitrators shall be empowered to resolve the Dispute, including
        by engaging nationally recognized accounting and other experts. Each of AT
        Co.
        and Valor shall bear 50% of the aggregate expenses of the arbitrators (or
        the
        sole arbitrator). The decision of the arbitrators shall be rendered no later
        than 90 days from the Dispute Date and shall be final.</font></div>
