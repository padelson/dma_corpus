which  the Company intends to commence solicitation of proxies for use at the
Company  Stockholders Meeting, which date, unless the parties otherwise
agree, shall  be  no earlier than March 15, 2006, the IRS notifies AT Co.
that the IRS  will  not issue the IRS 357(c) Ruling, then, during the
ensuing 30 day period,  the parties will collaborate reasonably and in good
faith in order to determine  a possible alternative structure for the
transactions contemplated hereby  that  the parties determine, with the
assistance of their respective tax advisors,  will either make likely the
receipt from the IRS of the IRS 357(c) Ruling  or  eliminate the necessity
for an IRS 357(c) Ruling, in either case, without  (a) substantially
increasing the costs to any party associated with  the  transactions
contemplated hereby, (b) causing the performance of the  covenants and
agreements of any party hereunder to become substantially more  burdensome,
(c) substantially increasing the regulatory or other consents  or approvals
required to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby,  or  (d)
otherwise resulting in any substantial impediment to the consummation  of the
transactions contemplated hereby. In the event the parties reasonably,  and
in good faith, agree upon such an alternative structure, they shall be 
obligated, as soon as practicable thereafter, to modify the covenants and 
agreements set forth in this Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements 
accordingly to reflect the change in transaction structure referenced in 
the  immediately preceding sentence. In furtherance of the foregoing, each
of  the  parties shall take all action reasonably necessary to modify the
Ruling Request  to reflect the transactions as so modified and effectuate the
change in  transaction structure contemplated by this Section 2.8, and each
such  party  shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the transactions
contemplated  hereby, as so modified, to be consummated as soon as
practicable thereafter.  To  the extent that the filing or effectiveness of
the materials necessary for  the  solicitation of proxies

 

18

 

  

 

for use at the  Company  Stockholders Meeting is delayed in order to afford
the parties the time  necessary to obtain a response with respect to the IRS
357(c) Ruling such  delay  will be deemed to not constitute, nor constitute
any basis for a claim of,  a  breach of the Company's covenants under
Article VIII hereof or otherwise.

accordance with  Section 3.1(b)) shall be automatically converted into the
right to  receive  an aggregate number of duly authorized, validly issued,

each share  of  Spinco Common Stock owned by the Company or any wholly owned
Subsidiary of  the  Company or Spinco, in each case immediately prior to the
Effective Time,  shall  be canceled and shall cease to exist and no stock or
other consideration  shall  be issued or delivered in exchange therefor.

 

(c) Each  share of Spinco Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to  the  Effective Time, when converted in accordance with this

canceled and shall cease  to  exist. Each holder of a certificate that,

Distribution and for distribution  in

 

19

 

  

 

accordance with  this  Article III, through the Agent, certificates or book-

with respect thereto  to  which the holders thereof may be entitled pursuant
to Section 3.2(c), being  hereinafter referred to as the " _Distribution
Fund_ ") issuable pursuant to  Section 3.1 in exchange for outstanding shares
of Spinco Common Stock.  The  Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable
instructions, deliver the Company Common  Stock contemplated to be issued
pursuant to Section 3.1 from the shares  of  stock held in the Distribution
Fund. If the Company deposits the Shares into  the  Distribution Fund prior
to the Effective Time and the Merger is not consummated,  the Agent shall
promptly return the shares to the Company. The Distribution  Fund  shall not
be used for any other purpose.

 

(b) _Distribution  Procedures_. At the Effective Time, all shares of Spinco
Common Stock shall  be converted into shares of Company Common Stock pursuant
to, and in accordance  with the terms of this Agreement, immediately
following which the Agent shall  distribute on the same basis as the shares
of Spinco Common Stock would have  been distributed in the Distribution and
to the persons entitled to receive  such  Distribution, in respect of the
outstanding shares of AT Co. Common Stock  held  by holders of record of AT
Co. Common Stock on the Record Date, all of the  shares of Company Common
Stock into which the shares of Spinco Common Stock  that  otherwise would
have been distributed in the Distribution have been converted  pursuant to
the Merger. Each person entitled to receive Spinco Common Stock  in  the
Distribution shall be entitled to receive in respect of the shares of 
Spinco  Common Stock otherwise distributable to such person a certificate or
book-entry  authorization representing the number of whole shares of Company
Common Stock  that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to this
Article III  (and  cash in lieu of fractional shares of Company Common
Stock, as contemplated  by  Section 3.2(e)) (and any dividends or
distributions pursuant to  Section 3.2(c)). The Agent shall not be entitled
to vote or exercise  any  rights of ownership with respect to the Company
Common Stock held by it from  time to time hereunder, except that it shall
receive and hold all dividends  or  other distributions paid or distributed
with respect thereto for the account  of  persons entitled thereto.

 

(c) _Distributions  with Respect to Undistributed Shares_. No dividends or
other distributions  declared or made after the Effective Time with respect
to Company Common  Stock  with a record date after the Effective Time shall
be paid with respect to  any  shares of Company Common Stock that are not
able to be distributed by the  Distribution Agent promptly after the
Effective Time, whether due to a legal  impediment to such distribution or
otherwise. Subject to the effect of  applicable laws, following the
distribution of any such previously undistributed  shares of Common Stock of
the Company, there shall be paid to the record  holder  of the certificates
representing such shares of Company Common Stock, without  interest (i) at
the time of the distribution, the amount of cash payable  in  lieu of
fractional shares of Company Common Stock to which such holder is  entitled
pursuant to Section 3.2(e) and the amount of dividends or  other 
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid 
with  respect to such whole shares of Company Common Stock and (ii) at the 
appropriate payment date therefor, the amount of dividends or other 
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to the 
distribution of such shares and a payment date subsequent to the
distribution  of  such shares payable with respect to such whole shares of
Company Common Stock.  The Company shall deposit in the Distribution Fund all
such dividends and  distributions.

 

20

 

  

 

(d) _No  Further Ownership Rights in Spinco Common Stock_. All shares of
Company  Common Stock issued in respect of shares of Spinco Common Stock
(including  any  cash paid pursuant to Section 3.2(c)) shall be deemed to
have been  issued  in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such
shares of Spinco Common  Stock.

 

(e) _No  Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
no  certificate or scrip representing fractional shares of Company Common
Stock  shall be issued in respect of shares of Spinco Common Stock, and such
fractional  share interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to
any rights  as a  stockholder of the Company. All fractional shares of
Company Common Stock  that a  holder of Spinco Common Stock would otherwise
be entitled to receive as a  result  of the Merger shall be aggregated and
if a fractional share results from  such  aggregation, such holder shall be
entitled to receive, in lieu thereof, an  amount in cash determined by
multiplying (i) the closing sale price  per  share of Company Common Stock
on the NYSE on the business day preceding the  Effective Time, if the stock
is being traded on such date, or if the stock  is  not being traded on such
date, the closing sale price per share of Company  Common Stock on the NYSE
on the first business day that such stock is traded,  by  (ii) the fraction
of a share of Company Common Stock to which such  holder  would otherwise
have been entitled. The Company shall timely make available  to  the Agent
any cash necessary to make payments in lieu of fractional shares  as 
aforesaid. Alternatively, the Company shall have the option of instructing 
the  Agent to aggregate all fractional shares of Company Common Stock, sell
such  shares in the public market and distribute to holders of Spinco Common
Stock  who  otherwise would have been entitled to such fractional shares of
Company Common  Stock a pro rata portion of the proceeds of such sale.

 

(f) _Termination  of Distribution Fund_. Any portion of the Distribution Fund
made available to  the Agent that remains undistributed to the former
stockholders of Spinco  on the  one-year anniversary of the Effective Time
shall be delivered to the Company,  upon demand, and any stockholders of
Spinco who have not received shares  of  Company Common Stock in accordance
with this Article III shall thereafter  look only to the Company for payment
of their claim for Company Common Stock  and  any dividends or distributions
with respect to Company Common Stock.

 

(g) _No  Liability_. Neither Spinco nor the Surviving Corporation shall be
liable to  any holder of Spinco Common Stock or any holder of shares of AT
Co. Common  Stock  for shares of Company Common Stock (or dividends or
distributions with respect  thereto or with respect to Spinco Common Stock)
delivered to a public official  pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law.

 

(h) _Closing  of Transfer Books_. From and after the Effective Time, the
stock transfer  books of Spinco shall be closed and no transfer shall be made
of any shares  of  capital stock of Spinco that were outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective  Time.

 

(i)  _Withholding Rights_. Spinco, the Company and the Surviving
Corporation  shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise  payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of any Spinco
Common Stock  such  amounts as they determine in good faith are required to
be deducted and withheld  with respect to the making of such payment under
the Code, or under any  provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the

 

21

 

  

 

extent that amounts  are  so withheld and paid over to the appropriate
Taxing Authority, such withheld  amounts will be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been  paid  to the recipient.

**ARTICLE  V 
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF AT CO.**

 

Except  as disclosed in the  corresponding section of the Disclosure Letter
delivered by AT Co. to the  Company immediately prior to the execution of
this Agreement and signed by  an  authorized officer of AT Co. (the " _AT
Co. Disclosure Letter_ ") (it being  agreed that disclosure of any item in
any section of the AT Co. Disclosure  Letter shall be deemed disclosure with
respect to any other section of this  Agreement to which the relevance of
such item is reasonably apparent on its  face), AT Co. hereby represents and
warrants to the Company as follows:

 

5.1  _Organization; Qualification_. AT Co. is a corporation duly organized, 
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of
Delaware.  AT Co. and its Subsidiaries have all requisite corporate power and
authority  to  own, lease and operate their properties and assets that will
be contributed  to  Spinco pursuant to the Distribution Agreement, except
where the failure to  have  such power and authority would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually  or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
Effect on the Spinco Business. Each  of  AT Co. and its Subsidiaries is duly
qualified or licensed to do business  and is  in good standing in each
jurisdiction in which the property owned, leased  or  operated by the Spinco
Business that will be contributed to Spinco pursuant  to  the Distribution
Agreement or the nature of the Spinco Business operated  by it  makes such
qualification necessary, except in such jurisdictions where the  failure to
be so qualified or licensed or in good standing would not reasonably  be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse 
Effect  on the Spinco Business.

 

5.2  _Corporate Authority; No Violation_.

 

(a) AT  Co. has the corporate power and authority to enter into this
Agreement and  each  other Transaction Agreement to which it is a party and
to carry out its  obligations hereunder and thereunder. The execution,

Transaction Agreement to which it  is a  party and the

 

24

 

  

 

consummation of  the  transactions contemplated hereby and thereby have been
duly authorized by  all  requisite corporate action on the part of AT Co.,
except for such further  action  of the Board of Directors of AT Co.
required to establish the Record Date  and  the Distribution Date, and the
effectiveness of the declaration of the  Distribution by the Board of
Directors of AT Co. (which is subject to the  satisfaction or, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, waiver of the  conditions set forth in the
Distribution Agreement). This Agreement has been  duly executed and delivered
by AT Co. and, assuming the due authorization,  execution and delivery by the
Company, constitutes a legal, valid and binding  agreement of AT Co.,
enforceable against AT Co. in accordance with its terms  (except insofar as

generally, or by principles governing the availability of equitable 
remedies). As of the Distribution Date, each other Transaction Agreement 
to  which AT Co. is a party will have been duly executed and delivered by
AT  Co.  and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by the
other  parties  thereto, will constitute a legal, valid and binding
agreement of AT Co.,  enforceable against AT Co. in accordance with its terms
(except insofar as  such  enforceability may be limited by applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency,  reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting
creditors' rights  generally, or by principles governing the availability of
equitable remedies). 

 

(b) Neither  the execution and delivery by AT Co. of this Agreement and other
Transaction  Agreements to which it is a party nor the consummation by AT Co.
of the  transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or compliance by AT Co.
with  any of  the provisions hereof or thereof will (i) violate or conflict
with any  provisions of AT Co.'s Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws; (ii)
result in a  default (or an event that, with notice or lapse of time or both,
would become  a  default) or give rise to any right of termination by any
third party,  cancellation, amendment or acceleration of any obligation or
the loss of  any  benefit under, any Contract to which AT Co. or any of its
Subsidiaries is  a  party or by which AT Co. or any of its Subsidiaries is
bound or affected;  (iii) result in the creation of a Lien, pledge, security
interest,  claim or  other encumbrance on any of the issued and outstanding
shares of Spinco Common  Stock, capital stock of any Spinco Subsidiary or on
any of the Spinco Assets  pursuant to any Contract to which AT Co. or any of
its Subsidiaries (including  Spinco and its Subsidiaries) is a party or by
which AT Co. or its Subsidiaries  is bound or affected; or (iv) assuming the
consents and approvals  contemplated by Section 5.2(c) below are obtained,
violate or conflict  with  any order, writ, injunction, decree, Law,
ordinance, rule or regulation  applicable to AT Co. or any of its
Subsidiaries (including Spinco and its  Subsidiaries), or any of the
properties, business or assets of any of the  foregoing, other than, in the
case of each of clauses (i) through  (iv), any  such violation, conflict,
default, right, loss or Lien which would not  reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material  Adverse Effect on the Spinco
Business.

 

(c) Other  than in connection with or in compliance with (i) the provisions
of  the  DGCL, (ii) the Securities Act, (iii) the Exchange Act, (iv) the 
HSR  Act, (v) the Communications Act and applicable rules and regulations 
thereunder and FCC Rules, (vi) the approvals set forth on Section  5.2(c)
of  the AT Co. Disclosure Letter, and (vii) the rules and regulations  of

consent or  approval of, or filing with, any Governmental Authority is
necessary for  the  consummation by AT Co. of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement  and  the other Transaction Agreements, except for such
authorizations, consents,  approvals or filings that, if not obtained or

 

25

 

  

 

made, would not  reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material  Adverse Effect on the Spinco Business.

 

5.3  _Information Supplied_. All documents that AT Co. is responsible for
filing  with any Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions
contemplated  hereby and by each other Transaction Agreement will comply in
all material  respects with the provisions of applicable Law. All information
supplied  or to  be supplied by AT Co. in any document, other than the
Registration Statement  which is addressed in Section 6.8 hereof, filed with
any Governmental  Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby and by  the  other Transaction Agreements will be, at the time of
filing, at the Distribution  Date and at the Effective Time, true and correct
in all material respects. 

 

5.4  _AT  Co. Reports and Financial Statements_.

 

(a) AT  Co. has previously made available to the Company complete and correct
copies  of: 

 

(i)  AT Co.'s Annual Reports on Form 10-K filed with the SEC under the
Exchange Act  for each of the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002;

 

(ii)  AT Co.'s Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC under the
Exchange  Act for the quarters ended March 31, 2005, June 30, 2005 and 
September 30, 2005;

 

(iii)  each definitive proxy statement filed by AT Co. with the SEC under the

(iv)  all current reports on Form 8-K filed by AT Co. with the SEC under the

(v)  each other form, report, schedule, registration statement and
definitive  proxy  statement filed by AT Co. or any of its Subsidiaries with
the SEC since  January 1, 2003 and prior to the date hereof (collectively,
and together  with the items specified in clauses (i) through (iv) above, the
" _AT Co.  SEC Documents_ ").

 

(b) As  of their respective dates, the AT Co. SEC Documents complied in all
material  respects with the requirements of the Securities Act or the
Exchange Act,  as the  case may be, and none of such AT Co. SEC Documents
when filed contained an  untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to
state a material fact required  to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light  of  the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading. The audited  consolidated financial statements and
unaudited consolidated interim financial  statements included in the AT Co.
SEC Documents (including any related notes  and  schedules) fairly present
in all material respects the financial position  of AT  Co. and its
consolidated Subsidiaries as of the respective dates thereof  and the 
results of operations and changes in cash flows, changes in stockholder's
equity  or other information included therein for the periods or as of the
respective  dates then ended, subject, where appropriate, to normal year-end
audit  adjustments (none of which AT Co. management expects to be material),
in  each  case in accordance with past practice and GAAP, consistently
applied, during  the  periods involved

 

26

 

  

 

(except as otherwise  stated therein). Since January 1, 2002, AT Co. has
timely filed all  reports, registration statements and other filings required
to be filed with  the  SEC under the rules and regulations of the SEC.
Except as set forth in the  AT  Co. SEC Documents filed prior to the date
hereof or Section 5.4 of  the AT  Co. Disclosure Letter or liabilities
incurred in the ordinary course of  business, consistent with past practice,

incurred any liability or obligation  that  is of a nature that would be
required to be disclosed on a consolidated balance  sheet of AT Co. and its
Subsidiaries or in the notes thereto prepared in  conformity with GAAP, other
than liabilities or obligations that would not  reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material  Adverse Effect on the
Spinco Business.

 

(c) AT  Co. has designed and maintains a system of internal controls over
financial  reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the
Exchange  Act)  sufficient to provide reasonable assurances regarding the
reliability of  financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external  purposes in accordance with GAAP. AT Co. (A) has
designed and maintains  disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in
Rules 13a-15(e)  and  15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to ensure that material
information required  to  be disclosed by AT Co. in the reports that it
files or submits under the  Exchange Act with respect to the AT Co. Business
and the Spinco Business  is  recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the time periods specified  in the SEC's rules and forms and is
accumulated and communicated to AT Co.'s  management as appropriate to allow
timely decisions regarding required  disclosure and to make the
certifications of the principal executive officer  and  principal financial
officer of AT Co. required pursuant to Sections 302  and  906 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act and (B) has disclosed, based on its  most  recent
evaluation of such disclosure controls and procedures prior to the  date 
hereof to AT Co.'s auditors and the audit committee of AT Co.'s Board of 
Directors, (x) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses  in the 
design or operation of internal controls over financial reporting that are 
reasonably likely to adversely affect in any material respect AT Co.'s
ability  to record, process, summarize and report financial information with
respect  to  the AT Co. Business and the Spinco Business and (y) any fraud,
whether or  not  material, that involves management or other employees who
have a significant  role in the AT Co.'s internal controls over financial
reporting with respect to  the AT Co. Business and the Spinco Business. AT
Co. has made available to  the  Company any such disclosure made by
management to AT Co.'s auditors and the  audit committee of AT Co.'s Board of
Directors.

 

5.5  _Brokers or Finders_. Other than Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and Smith 
Incorporated, JP Morgan Securities Inc. and Stephens, Inc., no agent,
broker,  investment banker, financial advisor or other similar Person is or
will be  entitled, by reason of any agreement, act or statement by AT Co. or
any of  its  Subsidiaries, directors, officers or employees, to any
financial advisory,  broker's, finder's or similar fee or commission, to
reimbursement of expenses or  to indemnification or contribution in
connection with any of the transactions  contemplated by this Agreement or
other Transaction Agreement.

since the Interim  Balance Sheet Date, Spinco and the Spinco Subsidiaries

bonus, incentive,  deferred compensation, stock option (or other equity-

subject to ERISA and whether written  or  oral, sponsored, maintained or

Spinco Subsidiaries, to which Spinco or any of the  Spinco Subsidiaries will
be a party on the Distribution Date, as provided  in the  Employee Benefits
Agreement, or in which any Person who is currently, has  been  or, on or
prior to the Effective Time, is expected to become an employee  of  Spinco
or any of the Spinco Subsidiaries (a " _Spinco Employee_ ") will be a 
participant on the Distribution Date, or with respect to which Spinco or  any
of  the Spinco Subsidiaries has any material liability (the " _Spinco
Benefit  Plans_ ").

 

(b) No  material liability under Title IV (including Sections 4069 and

Time  will  have been incurred by Spinco, any of the Spinco Subsidiaries or
any ERISA  Affiliate of any of them, and no condition exists that would
reasonably be  expected to result in Spinco or any of the Spinco Subsidiaries
incurring  any  such liability, other than liability for premiums due the
PBGC as of the  Distribution Date. The present value of accrued benefits
under each Spinco  Benefit Plan that is subject to Title IV of ERISA,

them has made or  suffered or will as of the Effective Time have made or

Distribution  Date  will have been operated and administered in all material
respects in accordance  with its terms and applicable Law, including ERISA

with respect to any  Spinco Benefit Plan have now been, or on the
Distribution Date will have  been,  timely made, except as may otherwise be
specifically permitted under the  terms  of the Employee Benefits Agreement.
There are no pending or, to the knowledge  of  Spinco or AT Co., threatened
claims by, on behalf of or against any of the  Spinco Benefit Plans in effect
as of the date hereof or any assets thereof,  other than routine benefit
claim matters, that, if adversely determined,  would  not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material  Adverse
Effect on Spinco, and no matter is pending (other than routine  qualification
determination filings, copies of which have been furnished  to the  Company

 

36

 

  

 

or will be promptly  furnished to the Company when made) before the IRS, the
United States Department  of Labor or the PBGC with respect to any Spinco
Benefit Plan.

 

(e) Subject  to the initial qualification determination filings to be made to
the Internal  Revenue Service (copies of which will be promptly furnished to
the Company  when  made), each Spinco Benefit Plan intended to be
"qualified" within the meaning of  Section 401(a) of the Code is, or on the
Distribution Date will be, so qualified  and the trusts maintained thereunder
are, or on the Distribution Date will  be,  exempt from taxation under
Section 501(a) of the Code, each trust maintained  under any Spinco Benefit
Plan intended to satisfy the requirements of  Section 501(c)(9) of the Code
has, or on the Distribution Date will  have,  satisfied such requirements
and, in either such case, no event has occurred  or  condition is known to
exist that would reasonably be expected to have a material  adverse effect on
such tax-qualified status for any such Spinco Benefit Plan  or  any such
trust.

 

(f) No  Spinco Benefit Plan provides, or on the Distribution Date will
provide, medical,  surgical, hospitalization, death or similar benefits
(whether or not insured)  for employees or former employees of Spinco or any
Spinco Subsidiary or for  any  other Person for periods extending beyond
their retirement or other termination  of service, other than (i) coverage
mandated by applicable Law,  (ii) death benefits under any "pension plan," or
(iii) benefits the  full cost of which is borne by the current or former
employee (or his  beneficiary).

 

(g) Except  as contemplated by this Agreement and each other Transaction
Agreement, no  Spinco Benefit Plan or employment arrangement, no similar plan
or arrangement  sponsored or maintained by AT Co. in which any Spinco
Employee is, or on  the  Distribution Date will be, a participant and no
contractual arrangement between  Spinco and any third party exists, or on the
Distribution Date will exist,  that  could result in the payment to any
current, former or future director, officer,  stockholder or employee of
Spinco or any of the Spinco Subsidiaries, or of  any  entity the assets or
capital stock of which have been acquired by Spinco  or a  Spinco
Subsidiary, of any money or other property or rights or accelerate  or 
provide any other rights or benefits to any such individual as a result of 
the  consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Transaction
Agreements  (including the Distribution), whether or not (a) such payment,
acceleration  or provision would constitute a "parachute payment" (within the
meaning of  Section 280G of the Code) or (b) some other subsequent action 
or event  would be required to cause such payment, acceleration or provision
to be  triggered.

 

6.13  _Labor Matters_. Except to the extent listed in Section 6.13 of the 
Spinco Disclosure Letter, neither Spinco nor any of the Spinco Subsidiaries 
is a  party to, or bound by, any collective bargaining agreement or other
Contract  with employees, a labor union or labor organization. Except for
such matters  which have not had, and would not reasonably be expected to

(a) as of  the  date hereof, (i) there are no strikes or lockouts with
respect to  Spinco  Employees, and (ii) there are not now, and to the
knowledge of Spinco  or AT  Co., since January 1, 2003 there has not been,
any union organizing  effort  pending or threatened against Spinco or any of
the Spinco Subsidiaries;  (b) there is no unfair labor practice, charge,
complaint, labor dispute  (other than routine individual grievances) or labor
arbitration proceeding  pending or, to the knowledge of Spinco or AT Co.,
threatened against Spinco  or  any of the Spinco Subsidiaries; (c) there is
no slowdown, or work  stoppage  in effect or, to the knowledge of Spinco or
AT Co., threatened with  

37

 

  

 

 

respect to Spinco  Employees; and (d) Spinco and the Spinco Subsidiaries are
in compliance  with all applicable Laws respecting (i) employment and
employment  practices, (ii) terms and conditions of employment and wages and
hours,  (iii) collective bargaining and labor relations practices,  (iv)
layoffs, (v) immigration, and (vi) the payment  of taxes and  other
withholdings. As of the date hereof, neither Spinco nor any of the  Spinco 
Subsidiaries has any liabilities under the WARN Act as a result of any
action  taken by Spinco and that would reasonably be expected to have,
individually  or  in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Spinco. 

 

6.14  _Intellectual Property Matters_. Section 6.14 of the Spinco
Disclosure  Letter contains a complete and accurate list of (i) all patented
or  registered Intellectual Property Rights (and pending applications
therefore)  owned by Spinco or any of the Spinco Subsidiaries, and (ii) all
other  patented or registered Intellectual Property Rights (and pending
applications  therefor) used by Spinco or any of the Spinco Subsidiaries, in
each case,  to the  extent material to the Spinco Business taken as a whole.
Spinco and the Spinco  Subsidiaries own and possess, or will immediately
prior to the Effective  Time  own and possess, free and clear of any Liens,
except Permitted Encumbrances,  all  right, title and interest in and to, or
have, or will immediately prior to  the  Effective Time have, adequate
licenses or other valid and enforceable rights  to  use, all material
Intellectual Property Rights used or held for use in  connection with the
Spinco Business as currently conducted and as proposed  to be  conducted
immediately prior to the Effective Time (including in connection  with 
services provided by Spinco and the Spinco Subsidiaries to third parties) 
(the " _Spinco IP Rights_ "), except where the failure to own or possess
such  items would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the  aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Spinco. To the best of AT Co.'s
or  Spinco's knowledge, there is no assertion or claim challenging the
validity,  enforceability, ownership or use of any of the foregoing that
would reasonably  be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse  Effect  on Spinco. The conduct of the Spinco Business as
currently conducted and  proposed to be conducted immediately prior to the
Effective Time does not  infringe, misappropriate or otherwise conflict in
any way with any Intellectual  Property Rights of any third party that would
reasonably be expected to have,  individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on Spinco. To  the  best of AT Co.'s or Spinco's knowledge,
there are no infringements or  misappropriations of, or other conflicts with,
any Intellectual Property  Rights  owned by or licensed by or to Spinco or
any Spinco Subsidiary that would  reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material  Adverse Effect on Spinco. The
transactions contemplated by this Agreement  shall  not impair the right,
title or interest of Spinco or any Spinco Subsidiary  in  and to the Spinco
IP Rights, and all of the Spinco IP Rights shall be owned  or  available for
use by the Surviving Corporation immediately after the Effective  Time on
terms and conditions identical, in all material respects, to those  under 
which Spinco and the Spinco Subsidiaries owned or used the Spinco IP Rights 
immediately prior to the Effective Time, except where such impairment or 
failure  to be owned or available for use would not reasonably be expected to
have,  individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Spinco.

Credit  Agreement, the Indenture governing the Spinco Notes, the Voting
Agreement,  the  Spinco Benefit Plans and except as filed as an exhibit to

Adverse Effect on Spinco. To the knowledge  of  Spinco or AT Co. and their
respective Subsidiaries, no other party to any  Spinco  Material Contract is
in breach of or in default under the terms of any Spinco  Material Contract
where such breach or default has had, or would reasonably  be  expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect  on 
Spinco. Each Spinco Material Contract is a valid and binding obligation of 
Spinco or any Spinco Subsidiary or AT Co. or any AT Co. Subsidiary which  is
a  party thereto and, to the knowledge of Spinco or AT Co. and their
respective  Subsidiaries, of each other party thereto, and is in full force
and effect,  except that (i) such enforcement may be subject to applicable
bankruptcy,  insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar Laws,
now or hereafter  in effect, relating to creditors' rights generally and (ii)
equitable  remedies of specific performance and injunctive and other forms of

of the  court  before which any proceeding therefor may be brought.

regulating competition and  telecommunications businesses (the " _Spinco
Licenses_ ") that are required  for the conduct of the Spinco Business, as
presently conducted and as proposed  to be conducted, except such Spinco
Licenses the failure of which to so hold  would not reasonably be expected to

Spinco.

 

(b) Each  Spinco License is, or will be on the Distribution Date, valid and
in full  force  and effect and has not been, or will not have been,

cancellation or modification of  which  has not had or would not reasonably
be expected to have, individually or  in the  aggregate, a Material Adverse
Effect on Spinco. No Spinco License is subject  to  (i) any conditions or
requirements that have not been imposed generally  upon licenses in the same
service, unless such conditions or requirements  would  not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material  Adverse
Effect on Spinco, or (ii) any pending regulatory proceeding  (other  than
those affecting the wireline industry generally) or judicial review  before 
a Governmental Authority, unless such pending regulatory proceedings or
judicial  review would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the  aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Spinco. Neither AT Co. nor
Spinco  has  knowledge of any event, condition or circumstance that would
preclude any  Spinco  License from being renewed in the ordinary course (to
the extent that such  Spinco License is renewable by its terms), except where
the failure to be  renewed has not had or would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually  or  in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on
Spinco.

 

(c) The  licensee of each Spinco License is, or on the Distribution Date will
be in  compliance with each Spinco License and has fulfilled and performed,
or will  fulfill or perform, all of its material obligations with respect
thereto,  including all reports, notifications and applications required by
the  Communications Act or the rules, regulations, policies, instructions
and  orders  of the FCC (the " _FCC Rules_ ") or similar rules, regulations,
policies,  instructions and orders of State Regulators and the payment of all
regulatory  fees, except (i) for exemptions, waivers or similar concessions
or  allowances and (ii) where such failure to be in compliance, fulfill 
or  perform its obligations or pay such fees or contributions has not had,
or 

 

41

 

  

 

would not reasonably  be  expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect  on  Spinco.

on the Distribution  Date will control, one hundred percent (100%) of the
voting power and  decision-making authority of each licensee of the Spinco
Licenses, except  where  the failure to own such equity or control such
voting power and decision-making  authority of such licensees would not
reasonably be expected to have,  individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on Spinco.

 

6.21  _Spinco Operations_. Spinco is a direct, wholly owned Subsidiary of AT
Co.  that, subject to the terms of the Distribution Agreement, following
the  Contribution will own, directly or indirectly, the Spinco Assets, and

provided  in the  Distribution Agreement.

stockholder of Spinco, have received the written opinions of Merrill Lynch, 
Pierce, Fenner and Smith Incorporated, JP Morgan Securities Inc. and Stephens,

Common  Stock who become holders of Spinco Common Stock in the Distribution.
Spinco  has  previously delivered a copy of such opinion to the Company.

indirectly, beneficially or of record) nor is a party to any agreement, 
arrangement or understanding for the purpose of acquiring, holding, voting 
or  disposing of, in each case, any shares of capital stock of the Company
(other  than as contemplated by this Agreement).

 

6.24  _Affiliate Transactions_. Except as specifically provided in this
Agreement  or any of the other Transaction Agreements or as disclosed in the
AT Co.  SEC  Documents, there are no transactions or Contracts of the type
that would  be  required to be disclosed by Spinco under Item 404 of
Regulation S-K  if  Spinco were a company subject to such Item between or
among (a) AT  Co.,  Spinco or any Spinco Subsidiary, on the one hand, and

(a) The  Company has previously made available to Spinco complete and correct
copies  of: 

 

(i)  Company's Annual Reports on Form 10-K filed with the SEC under the
Exchange Act  for the years ended December 31, 2004, and the Company's
audited  consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2003 and 2002, and the 
related  audited consolidated statements of operations, cash flows and
stockholder's  equity for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002
(the  " _Company Pre-IPO Financial Statements_ ");

 

(ii)  Company's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC under the
Exchange  Act for the quarters ended March 31, 2005, June 30, 2005 and 
September 30, 2005;

 

(iii)  each definitive proxy statement filed by the Company with the SEC
under the  Exchange Act prior to the date hereof;

 

(iv)  all current reports on Form 8-K filed by the Company with the SEC under
the  Exchange Act prior to the date hereof; and

 

(v)  each other form, report, schedule, registration statement and
definitive  proxy  statement filed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
with the SEC prior  to  the date hereof (collectively, and together with the
items specified in clauses  (i) through (iv) above, the " _Company SEC
Documents_ ").

 

(b) As  of their respective dates, the Company SEC Documents complied in all
material  respects, and each other form, report, schedule, registration
statement and  definitive proxy statement filed by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries  after  the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time (the "
_Additional Company SEC  Documents_ ") will comply in all material respects,
with the requirements of  the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case
may be, and none of such  Company SEC Documents when filed contained, or will
contain, an untrue statement  of a material fact or omitted, or will omit, to
state a material fact required  to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in the  light  of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading. The audited  consolidated financial statements and
unaudited consolidated interim financial  statements included in the Company
SEC Documents and the Additional Company  SEC  Documents and the Company
Pre-IPO Financial Statements fairly present in  all  material respects, or
will fairly present in all material respects, the  financial position of the
Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of  the  respective dates
thereof and the results of operations and changes in cash  flows, changes in
stockholder's equity or other

 

45

 

  

 

information included  therein for the periods or as of the respective dates
then ended, subject,  where  appropriate, to normal year-end audit
adjustments (none of which Company  management expects to be material), in
each case in accordance with past  practice and GAAP, consistently applied,
during the periods involved (except  as  otherwise stated therein). Since
its initial public offering in  February 2005, the Company has timely filed
all reports, registration  statements and other filings required to be filed
with the SEC under the  rules  and regulations of the SEC. Except as set
forth in the Company SEC Documents  filed prior to the date hereof or as set
forth in Section 7.4 of the  Company Disclosure Letter or liabilities
incurred in the ordinary course  of  business, consistent with past
practice, since the Interim Balance Sheet  Date,  the Company and its
Subsidiaries have not incurred any liability or obligation  that is of a
nature that would be required to be disclosed on a consolidated  balance
sheet of the Company and its Subsidiaries or in the footnotes thereto 
prepared in conformity with GAAP, other than liabilities or obligations that 
would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, 
a  Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

 

(c) The  Company and the Company Subsidiaries have designed and maintain a
system  of  internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rules
13a-15(f)  and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) sufficient to provide
reasonable assurances  regarding the reliability of financial reporting and
the preparation of  financial statements for external purposes in accordance
with GAAP. The Company  (A) has designed and maintains disclosure controls
and procedures  (as  defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the
Exchange Act) to ensure  that material information required to be disclosed
by the Company in the  reports  that it files or submits under the Exchange
Act is recorded, processed,  summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the SEC's rules and  forms and is accumulated and communicated
to the Company's management as  appropriate to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure and to  make  the certifications of the
principal executive officer and principal financial  officer of the Company
required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of  the  Sarbanes-Oxley Act and
(B) has disclosed, based on its most recent  evaluation of such disclosure
controls and procedures prior to the date hereof  to the Company's auditors
and the audit committee of the Company's Board of  Directors, (x) any
significant deficiencies and material weaknesses  in the  design or
operation of internal controls over financial reporting that are  reasonably
likely to adversely affect in any material respect the Company's  ability to
record, process, summarize and report financial information with  respect to
the Company and (y) any fraud, whether or not material,  that  involves
management or other employees who have a significant role in the  Company's
internal controls over financial reporting. The Company has made  available
to AT Co. and Spinco any such disclosure made by management to  the 
Company's auditors and the audit committee of the Company's Board of
Directors. 

 

7.5  _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_. Except as specifically
contemplated  by this Agreement, since the Interim Balance Sheet Date, each
of the Company  and  the Company Subsidiaries has conducted its business in
the ordinary course,  consistent with past practice, and there has not been
any event, occurrence,  development or state of circumstances or facts that
has had, or would reasonably  be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse  Effect  on the Company. From the Interim
Balance Sheet Date to the date hereof, none  of  the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries has taken any action or failed  to  take any action,
which action or failure, as the case may be, would constitute  a  breach of
Section 8.1 if taken without the consent of AT Co. and Spinco  after the date
hereof.

 

46

 

  

 

7.6  _Investigations; Litigation_. Except as described in the Company SEC

Company Subsidiaries or any of their  respective properties at law or in
equity before and there are no orders,  judgments or decrees of or before any
Governmental Authority, in each case  which  would reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a  Material Adverse Effect on the
Company.

(a) The  Company and the Company Subsidiaries are, and since January 1,
2003  have  been, in compliance with all, and have received no notice of any
violation  (as  yet unremedied) of any, Laws, applicable to the Company,
such Company  Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or assets,
except where  such  non-compliance, default or violation has not had, and
would not reasonably  be  expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect  on  the Company. Notwithstanding
anything contained in this Section 7.7(a),  no  representation or warranty
shall be deemed to be made in this  Section 7.7(a) in respect of
environmental, tax, employee benefits,  labor  or communications Laws
matters, which are the subject of the representations  and  warranties made
in Sections 7.10, 7.11, 7.12, 7.13 and 7.15 of this  Agreement, respectively.

 

(b) The  Company and the Company Subsidiaries are in possession of all
franchises,  grants, authorizations, licenses, permits, easements, variances,
exceptions,  consents, certificates, approvals and orders of any Governmental
Authority  necessary for the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to own,
lease and  operate  their properties and assets or to carry on their
businesses as they are now  being conducted (the " _Company Permits_ "),
except where the failure to have  any of the Company Permits has not had, and
would not reasonably be expected  to  have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the  Company. All Company Permits are
in full force and effect, except where the  failure to be in full force and
effect has not had, and would not reasonably  be  expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect  on  the
Company.

information regarding the Company or the Company Subsidiaries or the 
transactions contemplated by this Agreement provided by the Company
specifically  for inclusion in, or incorporation by reference into, the
Proxy  Statement/Prospectus or the Registration Statement will, in the case
of the  definitive Proxy Statement/Prospectus or any amendment or supplement
thereto,  at  the time of the mailing of the definitive Proxy

47

 

  

 

material fact or  omit  to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in  order  to make the statements therein, in the light
of the circumstances under which  they are made, not misleading. The
Registration Statement will comply in  all  material respects with the
provisions of the Securities Act and the Exchange  Act, as the case may be,
and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder,  except that no
representation is made by the Company with respect to information  provided
by AT Co. or Spinco specifically for inclusion in, or incorporation  by 
reference into, the Registration Statement.

property), including related  to  property currently owned, leased or used
by the Company or any of the Company  Subsidiaries or created by the
Company's or any Company Subsidiary's operations  that, would give rise to
liability for the Company or any of the Company  Subsidiaries under
applicable Environmental Laws, and, to the Company's  knowledge, the

(c) No  audits or other administrative proceedings or proceedings before any
Taxing  Authority are presently pending with regard to any Taxes or Tax
Return of  the  Company or any Company Subsidiary, as to which any Taxing
Authority has asserted  in writing any claim which, if adversely determined,
would reasonably be  expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect  on  the Company, and no Taxing Authority is now

7.12  _Benefit Plans_.

 

(a) Section 7.12(a)  of the Company Disclosure Letter lists each "employee
benefit plan" (as defined  in Section 3(3) of ERISA), and all other benefit,
bonus, incentive,  deferred compensation, stock option (or other equity-
based), severance, change  in control, welfare (including post-retirement
medical and life insurance)  and  fringe benefit plans, whether or not
subject to ERISA and whether written  or  oral, sponsored, maintained or
contributed to or required to be contributed  to  by the Company or any of
the Company Subsidiaries, to which the Company or  any  of the Company
Subsidiaries is a party or in which

 

50

 

  

 

any Person who  is  currently, has been or, prior to the Effective Time, is
expected to become  an  employee of the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries (a " _Company  Employee_ ") is a participant (the " _Company
Benefit Plans_ "), or with  respect to which the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries has or could  have any material liability.

 

(b) No  material liability under Title IV (including Sections 4069 and
4212(c)  of  ERISA) or Section 302 of ERISA has been incurred by the
Company, any  of the  Company Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate of any of
them, and no condition  exists that would reasonably be expected to result in
the Company, any of  the  Company Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate of any
of them of incurring any  such  liability, other than liability for premiums
due the PBGC. The present value  of  accrued benefits under each Company
Benefit Plan that is subject to Title  IV of  ERISA, determined based upon
the actuarial assumptions used for funding purposes  in the most recent
actuarial report prepared by such plan's actuary with respect  to such plan,
did not exceed, as of its latest valuation date, the then current  value of
the assets of such plan allocable to such accrued benefits.

 

(c) (i) No  Company Benefit Plan is a "multiemployer pension plan," as
defined in  Section 3(37) of ERISA and (ii) none of the Company, any of 
the  Company Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate of any of them has made or
suffered  a "complete withdrawal" or a "partial withdrawal," as such terms
are  respectively defined in Sections 4203 and 4205 of ERISA, which has  not
been  satisfied in full.

 

(d) Each  Company Benefit Plan has been operated and administered in all
material respects  in accordance with its terms and applicable Law,
including, ERISA and the  Code.  All contributions required to be made with
respect to any Company Benefit  Plan  have been timely made, except for
outstanding contributions in the ordinary  course. There are no pending or,
to the knowledge of the Company, threatened  claims by, on behalf of or
against any of the Company Benefit Plans or any  assets thereof, other than
routine benefit claim matters, that, if adversely  determined would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the  aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company and no matter is pending  (other than routine
qualification determination filings, copies of which  have  been furnished
to the AT Co. and Spinco or will be promptly furnished to  the AT  Co. and
Spinco when made) with respect to any of the Company Benefit Plans  before
the IRS, the United States Department of Labor or the PBGC.

 

(e) Each  Company Benefit Plan intended to be "qualified" within the meaning
of Section  401(a) of the Code is so qualified and the trusts maintained
thereunder are  exempt from taxation under Section 501(a) of the Code, each
trust maintained  under any Company Benefit Plan intended to satisfy the
requirements of  Section 501(c)(9) of the Code has satisfied such
requirements and,  in  either such case, no event has occurred or condition
is known to exist that  would reasonably be expected to have a material
adverse effect on such  tax-qualified status for any such Company Benefit
Plan or any such trust. 

 

(f) No  Company Benefit Plan provides medical, surgical, hospitalization,
death or  similar benefits (whether or not insured) for employees or former
employees  of  Company or any Company Subsidiary for periods extending
beyond their retirement  or other termination of service, other than (i)
coverage mandated  by  applicable Law,

 

51

 

  

 

(ii) death  benefits under any "pension plan," or (iii) benefits the full
cost of which  is borne by the current or former employee (or his
beneficiary). The Company  has  the right, and will have the right after the
Effective Time to terminate  any  Company Benefit Plan or to amend any such
Company Benefit Plan to reduce  future  benefits, (including any Company
Benefit Plan that provides post-retirement  medical and life insurance
benefits) without incurring or otherwise being  responsible for any material
liability with respect thereto.

 

(g) No  Company Benefit Plan or employment arrangement, and no contractual
arrangements  between the Company and any third party, exists that could
result in the  payment  to any current, former or future director, officer,
stockholder or employee  of  the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries,
or of any entity the assets  or  capital stock of which have been acquired
by the Company or a Company  Subsidiary, of any money or other property or
rights or accelerate or provide  any other rights or benefits to any such
individual as a result of the  consummation of the transactions contemplated
by the Transaction Agreements  whether or not (a) such payment, acceleration
or provision would constitute  a "parachute payment" (within the meaning of
Section 280G of the Code) or  (b) some other subsequent action or event would
be required to cause  such  payment, acceleration or provision to be
triggered.

 

7.13  _Labor Matters_. Except to the extent listed in Section 7.13 of the 
Company Disclosure Letter, neither the Company nor any of the Company 
Subsidiaries is a party to, or bound by, any collective bargaining agreement 
or  other Contract with employees, a labor union or labor organization.
Except  for  such matters which have not had, and would not reasonably be
expected to  have,  individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
Effect on the Company,  (a) as of the date hereof, (i) there are no strikes
or lockouts  with  respect to Company Employees, and (ii) there are not now
and, to the  knowledge of the Company, since January 1, 2003 there has not
been,  any  union organizing effort pending or threatened against the
Company or any  of the  Company Subsidiaries; (b) there is no unfair labor
practice, charges  or  complaint, labor dispute (other than routine
individual grievances) or labor  arbitration proceeding pending or, to the
knowledge of the Company, threatened  against the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries; (c) there  is no  slowdown, or work stoppage in effect
or, to the knowledge of Company, threatened  with respect to Company
Employees; and (d) the Company and the Company  Subsidiaries are in
compliance with all applicable Laws respecting  (i) employment and employment
practices, (ii) terms and conditions  of  employment and wages and hours,
(iii) collective bargaining and labor  relations practices, (iv) layoffs, (v)
immigration, and (vi) the  payments of taxes and other withholdings. As of
the date hereof, neither  the  Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries
has any liabilities under the  WARN  Act as a result of any action taken by
the Company and that would reasonably  be  expected to have, individually or
in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect  on  the Company.

 

7.14  _Intellectual Property Matters_. Section 7.14 of the Company 
Disclosure Letter contains a complete and accurate list of (i) all 
patented  or registered Intellectual Property Rights (and pending
applications therefor)  owned by the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries, and (ii) all  other  patented or registered Intellectual
Property Rights (and pending applications  therefor) used by the Company or
any of the Company Subsidiaries and material  to  the business of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries in each case, to  the  extent material
to the business of the Company as a whole. The Company and  the  Company
Subsidiaries own and possess free and clear of any Liens except  Permitted
Encumbrances, all right, title and

 

52

 

  

 

interest in and  to, or  have adequate licenses or other valid and
enforceable rights to use all material  Intellectual Property Rights used or
held for use in connection with the  business of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries taken as a whole as  currently conducted and as proposed to be
conducted immediately prior to  Effective Time (including in connection with
services provided by the Company  and the Company Subsidiaries to third
parties) (the " _Company IP Rights_ "),  except where the failure to own or
possess such items would not reasonably  be  expected to have, individually
or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect  on  the Company. To the best
of the Company's knowledge, there is no assertion or  claim challenging the
validity, enforceability, ownership or use of any of  the  foregoing that
would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the  aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company. The conduct of the business  of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries taken as a whole as currently  conducted
and as proposed to be conducted immediately after the Effective  Time  does
not infringe, misappropriate or otherwise conflict in any way with any 
Intellectual Property Rights of any third party that would reasonably be 
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
Effect  on  the Company. To the best of the Company's knowledge, there are
no infringements  or misappropriations of or other conflicts with, any
Intellectual Property  Rights owned by or licensed by or to the Company or
any Company Subsidiary  that  would reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a  Material Adverse Effect on the Company.
The transactions contemplated by  this  Agreement shall not impair the
right, title or interest of the Company or  any  Company Subsidiary in and
to the Company IP Rights, and all of the Company  IP  Rights shall be owned
or available for use by the Surviving Corporation  immediately after the
Effective Time on terms and conditions identical in  all  material respects
to those under which the Company and the Company Subsidiaries  owned or used
the Company IP Rights immediately prior to the Effective Time,  except where
such impairment or failure to be owned or available for use  would  not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material 
Adverse Effect on the Company.

 

7.15  _Communications Regulatory Matters_.

 

(a) The  Company and the Company Subsidiaries hold all approvals,
authorizations,  certificates and licenses issued by the FCC and State
Regulators set forth  in  Section 7.15(e) of the Company Disclosure Letter,
and all other material  regulatory permits, approvals, licenses, and other
authorizations, including  but  not limited to franchises, ordinances and
other agreements granting access  to  public rights of way, issued or
granted to the Company or any Company Subsidiary  by a state or federal
agency or commission or other federal, state or local  or  foreign
regulatory bodies regulating competition and telecommunications  businesses
(the " _Company Licenses_ ") that are required for the Company and  the
Company Subsidiaries to conduct its business, as presently conducted  and
as  proposed to be conducted, except such Company Licenses the failure of
which  to  so hold would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or
in the  aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

 

(b) Each  Company License is valid and in full force and effect and has not
been  suspended, revoked, cancelled or adversely modified, except where the
failure  to  be in full force and effect, or the suspension, revocation,
cancellation  or  modification of which has not had or would not reasonably
be expected to  have,  individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
Effect on the Company.  No  Company License is subject to (i) any conditions
or requirements that  have  not been imposed generally upon licenses in the
same service, unless

 

53

 

  

 

such conditions  or  requirements would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in  the  aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company, or (ii) any pending  regulatory proceeding (other than those
affecting the wireless industry  generally) or judicial review before a
Governmental Authority, unless such  pending regulatory proceedings or
judicial review would not reasonably be  expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect  on  the Company. The Company and
the Company Subsidiaries have no knowledge of  any  event, condition or
circumstance that would preclude any Company License  from  being renewed in
the ordinary course (to the extent that such Company License  is  renewable
by its terms), except where the failure to be renewed has not had  or  would
not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate,  a 
Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

 

(c) The  licensee of each Company License is in compliance with each Company
License  and  has fulfilled and performed all of its material obligations
with respect  thereto, including all reports, notifications and applications
required by  the  Communications Act or the FCC Rules or similar rules,
regulations, policies,  instructions and orders of State Regulators, and the
payment of all regulatory  fees, except (i) for exemptions, waivers or
similar concessions or  allowances and (ii) where such failure to be in
compliance, fulfill  or  perform its obligations or pay such fees or
contributions has not had, or  would  not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material  Adverse Effect on the Company.

 

(d) The  Company or a Company Subsidiary owns one hundred percent (100%) of
the equity  and controls one hundred percent (100%) of the voting power and
decision-making  authority of each licensee of the Company Licenses, except
where the failure  to  own such equity or control such voting power and
decision-making authority  of  such licensees would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or  in the  aggregate, a Material Adverse
Effect on the Company.

 

7.16  _Material Contracts_.

 

(a) Except  for this Agreement, each other Transaction Agreement, the Company
Benefit  Plans  and except as filed as an exhibit to any Company SEC
Document or as disclosed  in  Section 7.16 of the Company Disclosure Letter,
as of the date hereof,  neither the Company nor any of the Company
Subsidiaries is a party to or  bound  by any "material contract" (as such
term is defined in item 601(b)(10) of  Regulation S-K of the SEC) (all
contracts of the type described in  this  Section 7.16 being referred to
herein as " _Company Material  Contracts_ ").

 

(b) Neither  the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is in breach of or
default under the  terms of any Company Material Contract where such breach
or default has had,  or  would reasonably be expected to have, individually
or in the aggregate, a  Material Adverse Effect on the Company. To the
knowledge of the Company,  no  other party to any Company Material Contract
is in breach of or in default  under  the terms of any Company Material
Contract where such breach or default has  had,  or would reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate,  a  Material Adverse
Effect on the Company. Each Company Material Contract is  a  valid and
binding obligation of the Company or any Company Subsidiary which  is a 
party thereto and, to the knowledge of the Company, of each other party
thereto,  and is in full force and effect, except that (i) such enforcement 
may be  subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium  or  other similar Laws, now or hereafter in

 

54

 

  

 

effect, relating  to  creditors' rights generally and (ii) equitable
remedies of specific  performance and injunctive and other forms of equitable
relief may be subject  to  equitable defenses and to the discretion of the
court before which any  proceeding therefor may be brought.

 

7.17  _Company Real Property_.

 

(a) Section 7.17(a)  of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth the address

reasonably be expected to have a Material  Adverse Effect on the Company, the

Person the right to use or occupy such  Company Owned Real Property or any
material portion thereof; and (B) other  than the right of the Company

adverse to the business  of the Company as a whole, and a true and complete

for each such Company Leased Real  Property. The Company has made available
to AT Co. a true and complete copy  of  each such Company Lease document,
and in the case of any such Lease that  is an  oral Lease, a written summary
of the material terms of such Lease. Except  as set  forth in Section

expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company,  with  respect to
each such Spinco Lease: (i) the Company's or Company  Subsidiaries'
possession and quiet enjoyment of the Company Leased Real Property  under
such Company Lease has not been disturbed, and to Company's knowledge,  there

Property are in good condition  and  repair and sufficient for the operation
of the Company Business.

or  regulation enacted under Delaware law, or, to the knowledge of the
Company,  under the law of any other jurisdiction, will apply to this
Agreement, the  Voting Agreement, the Merger or the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby.  Assuming the accuracy of the representation and warranty

Request, including meetings or conferences with  IRS  personnel, whether
telephonically, in person or otherwise, without first  notifying the Company
or the Company's representatives and giving the Company  (or the Company's

number of the Company's representatives shall have an opportunity  to
participate in all conferences or meetings with IRS personnel that take 
place  in person, regardless of the nature of the issues expected to be

obligation or limitation  imposed upon it under this Agreement.

covenants, including those contained  in  certificates of AT Co., Spinco,
the Company and others, reasonably satisfactory  in form and substance to AT

AT Co. Tax Counsel for purposes of the Distribution  Tax  Opinion customary
Distribution Tax Representations, reasonably satisfactory  in  form and
substance to AT Co. Tax Counsel.

 

(c) _Merger  Tax Opinions_. AT Co. and Spinco, on the one hand, and the
Company, on the  other hand, shall cooperate with each other in obtaining,
and shall use their  respective reasonable best efforts to obtain, a written
opinion of their  respective tax counsel, Kirkland and Ellis LLP, in the case
of the Company  (" _Company Tax Counsel_ "), and AT Co. Tax Counsel, in the
case of AT Co.  and Spinco, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
the Company  and AT  Co., respectively (each such opinion, a " _Merger Tax
Opinion_ "), dated as  of the Effective Time, to the effect that, on the
basis of facts,  representations and assumptions set forth in such opinion,
the Merger will  be  treated as a tax-free reorganization within the meaning
of Section 368(a)  of the  Code. Each of the Company, AT Co. and Spinco
shall deliver to Company Tax  Counsel and AT Co. Tax Counsel for purposes of

(a) As  of the Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation shall, or shall cause
one  of its  Subsidiaries to, continue to employ as a successor employer all
of the Spinco  Employees (as of immediately prior to the Effective Time,
including all such  employees who have the rights of employment in accordance
with the established  practices or policies of Spinco on return from any
vacation, leave or other  authorized absence) (collectively, the "
_Transferred Employees_ "), provided  that nothing in this Agreement shall
require the Surviving Corporation to  retain  or employ such employees for
any specific length of time.

 

(b) Subject  to the terms of the Employee Benefits Agreement and the other
provisions  of this  Section 8.10, the Surviving Corporation shall cause the
Transferred  Employees to receive substantially the same level of benefits,
in the aggregate,  as provided under the Spinco Benefit Plans as of the
Distribution Date for  a  period of one (1) year after the Effective Time.

 

(c) To  the extent that service is relevant for all purposes, including
eligibility  to  participate, vesting credit, eligibility to commence
benefits, benefit accrual,  early retirement subsidies, and severance
benefits, under a Company Benefit  Plan  maintained for the benefit of the
Transferred Employees, the Company or one  of  its Subsidiaries shall,
effective as of the Closing, cause each Transferred  Employee to be credited
with service under the applicable Company Benefit  Plans  for all service
earned by such Transferred Employee with Spinco or AT Co.  (including their
respective predecessors) prior to or on the Closing Date;  provided, however,
that such service shall not be required to be recognized  to  the extent
that such recognition would result in a duplication of benefits. 

 

(d) With  respect to any Company Benefit Plans in which any Transferred
Employees become  eligible to participate on or after the Effective Time, the
Company shall  (i) waive all pre-existing conditions, exclusions and waiting
periods  with  respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable
to the Transferred  Employees and their eligible dependents, and (ii) for
purposes of  satisfying any deductible or out-of-pocket requirements, provide
each  Transferred Employee and their eligible dependents with credit for
any  co-payments and deductibles paid prior to the Effective Time under the
analogous  Spinco Benefit Plan. With respect to any former employees of
Spinco (the  " _Former Employees_ ") who are receiving "continuation
coverage" under a  Spinco Benefit Plan, as of the Effective Time, in
accordance with the  requirements of COBRA, the Company shall (i) provide, or
cause to  be  provided, as of the Effective Time, continued coverage under a
group health  plan  sponsored by the Company or one of its Subsidiaries, and
(ii) waive all  pre-existing conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with
respect to  participation and coverage requirements applicable to the Former
Employees  and  their eligible dependents.

 

68

 

  

 

(e) At  the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall assume, honor and
discharge  when due all Spinco Liabilities associated with the Transferred
Employees.  In  furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, the
Surviving Corporation  shall issue to the Transferred Employees restricted
shares of common stock  of  the Surviving Corporation in such amounts, and
on such terms and conditions,  as  shall be set forth in the Employee
Benefits Agreement and Section 8.10(e)  of the Spinco Disclosure Letter with
respect to such Transferred Employees  and  shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause such grants to be made at  or as  soon as practicable after
the Effective Time.

 

8.11  _Access to Information_.

 

(a) Upon  reasonable notice, each of AT Co., Spinco and the Company shall
afford to  each  other and to its respective officers, employees,
accountants, counsel and  other  authorized representatives, reasonable
access during normal business hours,  throughout the period prior to the
earlier of the Effective Time or the  Termination Date, to its and its
Subsidiaries' officers, employees, accountants,  consultants,
representatives, plants, properties, Contracts, commitments,  books, 
records (including Tax Returns) and any report, schedule or other document 
filed  or received by it pursuant to the requirements of the federal or
state  securities laws, and shall use all reasonable best efforts to cause
its  respective representatives to furnish promptly to the others such
additional  financial and operating data and other information, including
environmental  information, as to its and its Subsidiaries' respective
businesses and  properties as the others or their respective duly authorized
representatives,  as  the case may be, may reasonably request. The parties
hereby agree that the  provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement shall
apply to all information  and  material furnished by any party or its
representatives thereunder and hereunder. 

 

(b) Between  the date hereof and the Closing Date, (i) Spinco shall furnish
to  the  Company and its authorized representatives monthly unaudited
summary financial  information prepared for AT Co. management with respect to
Spinco's ILEC, CLEC  and Internet Divisions for each monthly period ending
after the date hereof  and  before the Closing and such financial

(ii) the Company shall furnish  to  AT Co., Spinco and their respective
authorized representatives unaudited  interim  combined statements of
operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries prepared  on a consistent
basis with past periods, in each case, as soon as practicable  following the
end of each fiscal month, but in any event no later than thirty  (30) days
following the end of such fiscal month.

 

8.12  _No Solicitation by the Company_.

 

(a) The  Company agrees that, following the date of this Agreement and prior
to the  earlier of the Effective Time or the Termination Date, neither it nor
any  Company Subsidiary shall, and that it shall use reasonable best efforts
to  cause  its and the Company's and each Company Subsidiary's officers,
directors,  employees, advisors and agents not to, directly or indirectly, 
(i) knowingly solicit, initiate or encourage any inquiry or proposal  that 
constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Company Acquisition 
Proposal, (ii) provide any non-public information or data to any Person 
relating to or in connection with a Company Acquisition Proposal, engage  in
any  discussions or negotiations concerning a

 

69

 

  

 

Company Acquisition  Proposal, or otherwise knowingly facilitate any effort
or attempt to make  or  implement a Company Acquisition Proposal, (iii)
approve, recommend, agree  to or  accept, or propose publicly to approve,
recommend, agree to or accept, any  Company Acquisition Proposal, or (iv)
approve, recommend, agree to  or  accept, or propose to approve, recommend,
agree to or accept, or execute  or  enter into, any letter of intent,
agreement in principle, merger agreement,  acquisition agreement, option
agreement or other similar agreement related  to  any Company Acquisition
Proposal. Without limiting the foregoing, any violation  of the restrictions
set forth in the preceding sentence by any of the Company's  Subsidiaries or
any of the Company's or the Company Subsidiaries' officers,  directors,
employees, agents or representatives (including any investment  banker,
attorney or accountant retained by the Company or the Company  Subsidiaries)
shall be a breach of this Section 8.12(a) by the Company.  The  Company
agrees that it will immediately cease and cause to be terminated  any 
existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any Persons conducted 
heretofore with respect to any Company Acquisition Proposal (except with 
respect  to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement).

 

(b) Notwithstanding  the foregoing, nothing contained in this Agreement shall
prevent the Company  or  the Company's Board of Directors from, prior to the
adoption of this Agreement  by the holders of Company Common Stock, engaging
in any discussions or  negotiations with, or providing any non-public
information to, any Person,  if  and only to the extent that (i) the Company
receives from such Person  an  unsolicited bona fide Company Superior
Proposal or a Company Acquisition  Proposal that the Company's Board of
Directors determines in good faith could  lead to a Company Superior
Proposal, (ii) the Company's Board of Directors  determines in good faith
(after consultation with its legal advisors) that  its  failure to do so
would be inconsistent with the Company's Board of Directors'  fiduciary
duties under applicable Law, (iii) prior to providing any  information or
data to any Person in connection with a proposal by any such  Person, the
Company's Board of Directors receives from such Person an executed 
confidentiality agreement substantially similar to the Confidentiality
Agreement  and (iv) prior to providing any non-public information or data
to  any  Person or entering into discussions or negotiations with any
Person, the  Company's Board of Directors notifies AT Co. promptly of any
such inquiry,  proposal or offer received by, any such information requested
from, or any  such  discussions or negotiations sought to be initiated or
continued with, the  Company, any Company Subsidiary or any of their
officers, directors, employees,  advisors and agents indicating, in
connection with such notice, the material  terms and conditions of the
Company Acquisition Proposal and the identity  of the  Person making such
Company Acquisition Proposal. The Company agrees that  it  shall keep AT Co.
reasonably informed, on a reasonably prompt basis, of the  status and
material terms of any such proposals or offers and the status  of any  such
discussions or negotiations and will notify AT Co. promptly of any 
determination by the Company's Board of Directors that a Company Superior 
Proposal (as hereinafter defined) has been made. For purposes of this
Agreement,  a " _Company Superior Proposal_ " means any proposal or offer
made by a third  party to acquire, directly or indirectly, by merger,
consolidation or otherwise,  for consideration consisting of cash and/or
securities, at least a majority  of  the shares of the Company Common Stock
then outstanding or all or substantially  all of the assets of the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries and otherwise  on  terms which the Board of
Directors of the Company (after consultation with  its  legal and financial
advisors) determines in its good faith judgment to be  more  favorable to
the Company's stockholders than the Merger.

 

70

 

  

 

(c) Prior  to the adoption of this Agreement by the holders of Company Common
Stock,  the  Board of Directors of the Company may, if it concludes in good
faith (after  consultation with its legal advisors) that failure to do so
would be  inconsistent with its obligations to comply with its fiduciary
duties under  applicable Law, withdraw its recommendation of the Merger, but
only at a  time  that is after the third business day following AT Co.'s
receipt of written  notice from the Company advising AT Co. of its intention
to do so.

 

(d) Nothing  in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company from taking and
disclosing to  its  stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a)
promulgated  under the  Exchange Act or from making any disclosure to the
Company stockholders if,  in  the good faith judgment of the Board of
Directors of the Company (after  consultation with its legal advisors), it is
required to do so in order to  comply with its fiduciary duties to the
Company's stockholders under applicable  Law; provided, however, that neither
the Company nor its Board of Directors  nor  any committee thereof shall
approve or recommend, or propose publicly to  approve  or recommend, a
Company Acquisition Proposal unless the Company has first  terminated this
Agreement pursuant to Section 11.1(h) hereof and has  otherwise complied with
the provisions thereof.

 

8.13  _Director and Officer Indemnification; Insurance_.

 

(a) From  and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, for
a period  of  six years after the Effective Time, indemnify, defend and hold
harmless to  the  fullest extent permitted by applicable Law each person who
is, or has been  at  any time prior to the Effective Time, an officer or
director of the Company  or  Spinco and each person who served at the
request of the Company or Spinco  as a  director, officer, trustee or
fiduciary of another corporation, partnership,  joint venture, trust, pension
or other employee benefit plan or enterprise,  including any person serving
in such capacity at the request of AT Co. with  respect to Spinco or a Spinco
Subsidiary (individually, an " _Indemnified  Party_ " and, collectively, the
" _Indemnified Parties_ ") against all  losses, claims, damages, liabilities,
costs and expenses (including attorneys'  fees), judgments, fines, penalties
and amounts paid in settlement with approval  of the indemnifying party
(which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld,  conditioned or delayed)
in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding  or investigation
arising out of or pertaining to acts or omissions, or alleged  acts or
omissions, by them in their capacities as such, whether commenced,  asserted
or claimed before or after the Effective Time. In the event of any  such 
claim, action, suit, arbitration, proceeding or investigation (" _Action_
"):  (i) the Surviving Corporation shall pay, as incurred, the reasonable 
fees  and expenses of counsel selected by the Indemnified Party, which
counsel  shall  be reasonably acceptable to the Surviving Corporation, in
advance of the  final  disposition of any such Action to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable  Law upon receipt of an undertaking to repay such
amounts in the event it  is  determined that such person is not entitled to
be indemnified under applicable  Law, and (ii) the Surviving Corporation will
provide reasonable cooperation  in the defense of any such Action; provided,
however, the Surviving Corporation  shall not be liable for any settlement
effected without its written consent  (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed),  and  provided further, that
the Surviving Corporation shall not be obligated pursuant  to this Section
8.12(a) to pay the fees and disbursements of more  than one  counsel for all
Indemnified Parties in a single Action, unless, in the good  faith judgment
of any of the Indemnified Parties, there is or may be a conflict  of
interests between two or more of such

 

71

 

  

 

Indemnified Parties,  in  which case there may be separate counsel for each
similarly situated group  (which counsel shall be reasonably acceptable to
the Surviving Corporation).  In  the event of any Action, any Indemnified
Party wishing to claim indemnification  will promptly notify the Surviving
Corporation thereof (provided, that failure  to so notify the Surviving
Corporation will not affect the obligations of  the  Surviving Corporation
except to the extent that the Surviving Corporation  shall  have been
prejudiced as a result of such failure). Notwithstanding the  foregoing,
nothing contained in this Section 8.12 shall be deemed  to grant  any right
to any Indemnified Party which is not permitted to be granted to  an 
officer or director of the Surviving Corporation under Delaware law,
assuming  for such purposes that the Surviving Corporation's Amended and
Restated  Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated Bylaws
provide for  the  maximum indemnification permitted by Law.

 

(b) Without  limiting the rights that any Indemnified Party may have under
applicable  Law,  the parties agree that all rights of indemnification
existing as of the date  hereof as provided in the respective certificate of
incorporation and bylaws  of  the Company and Spinco shall survive the
Merger and shall continue in full  force  and effect in accordance with
their terms for a period of six years following  the Effective Time.

 

(c) For  a period of six years following the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation  shall cause to be maintained directors' and officers' liability
insurance  policies covering the Indemnified Parties; provided that with
respect to  any  Indemnified Party who is or at any time prior to the
Effective Time was covered  by AT Co.'s existing directors' and officers'
liability insurance policies, such  coverage shall be on terms substantially
no less advantageous to the Indemnified  Parties than such insurance with
respect to claims arising from facts or  events  that occurred up to and
including the Effective Time to the extent available;  provided, however,
that the Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor  policies of at least
the same coverage and amounts containing terms and  conditions that are no
less advantageous to the covered persons; provided  further, that the
Surviving Corporation shall not be required to pay an annual  premium for
such insurance in excess of $2,000,000.

 

(d) This  Section 8.12 is intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable  by, the persons for whom indemnification is provided pursuant to
this  Section 8.12, their heirs and personal representatives, and shall 
be  binding on Spinco and the Company and their respective successors and
assigns. 

 

8.14  _Rule 145 Affiliates_. Spinco shall, at least 10 days prior to  the
Effective Time, cause to be delivered to the Company a list, reviewed  by
its  counsel, identifying all persons who will be, in its reasonable
judgment,  at the  Effective Time, "affiliates" of Spinco for purposes of
Rule 145 promulgated  by the SEC under the Securities Act (each, a " _Rule
145 Affiliate_").  Spinco shall furnish such information and documents as the
Company may  reasonably request for the purpose of reviewing such list.
Spinco shall use  all  reasonable best efforts to cause each person who is
identified as a  Rule 145 Affiliate in the list furnished pursuant to this
Section 8.14  to execute a written agreement (each, a " _Rule 145 Affiliate 
Agreement_"), substantially in the form of _Exhibit F_ to this  Agreement, at
or prior to the Effective Time.

 

72

 

  

 

8.15  _Public Announcements_. AT Co., Spinco and the Company shall consult
with  each other and shall mutually agree upon any press release or public 
announcement relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement 
and  neither of them shall issue any such press release or make any such
public  announcement prior to such consultation and agreement, except as may
be required  by applicable Law or by obligations pursuant to any listing
agreement with  any  national securities exchange or automated inter-dealer
quotation system,  in  which case the party proposing to issue such press
release or make such public  announcement shall use all reasonable best
efforts to consult in good faith  with  the other party before issuing any
such press release or making any such  public  announcement.

 

8.16  _Defense of Litigation_. Each of AT Co., Spinco and the Company shall
use  all reasonable best efforts to defend against all actions, suits or
proceedings  in which such party is named as a defendant that challenge or
otherwise seek  to  enjoin, restrain or prohibit the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement  or  seek damages with respect to such
transactions. None of AT Co., Spinco or  the  Company shall settle any such
action, suit or proceeding or fail to perfect  on a  timely basis any right
to appeal any judgment rendered or order entered against  such party therein
without having previously consulted with the other parties.  Each of AT Co.,
Spinco and the Company shall use all reasonable best efforts  to  cause each
of its Affiliates, directors and officers to use all reasonable  best 
efforts to defend any such action, suit or proceeding in which such
Affiliate,  director or officer is named as a defendant and which seeks any
such relief  to  comply with this Section 8.16 to the same extent as if such
Person  was a  party.

 

8.17  _Notification_.

 

(a) From  time to time prior to the Effective Time, each of AT Co., Spinco
and the  Company  shall supplement or amend its respective Disclosure Letter
with respect to  any  matter hereafter arising that, if existing or

qualified and that has been rendered untrue  or  inaccurate, in any material
respect, thereby. Delivery of such supplements  shall  be for informational
purposes only and shall not expand or limit the rights  or  affect the
obligations of any party hereunder, including any party's obligation  to
consummate the Merger. Such supplements shall not constitute a part of  the
AT  Co. Disclosure Letter, the Spinco Disclosure Letter or the Company
Disclosure  Letter, as the case may be, for purposes of this Agreement.

 

(b) Each  of AT Co., Spinco and the Company shall give prompt notice to the
other of  the  occurrence or nonoccurrence of any event the occurrence or
nonoccurrence  of  which has caused or is reasonably likely to cause (i) any
covenant  or  agreement of such party contained in this Agreement not to be
performed or  complied with, in any material respect or (ii) any condition
contained  in  Article IX to become incapable of being fulfilled at or prior
to the  Effective Time; provided, however, that the delivery of any notice
pursuant  to  this Section 8.17(b) shall not cure such breach or
noncompliance or  limit  or otherwise affect the remedies available
hereunder to the party receiving  such  notice.

 

73

(including derivative  securities with respect to Company Common Stock)
resulting from the transactions  contemplated by this Agreement by each
individual who is subject to the  reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of
the Exchange Act with respect  to the  Company or Spinco to be exempt under
Rule 16b-3 promulgated under  the  Exchange Act, such steps to be taken in
accordance with applicable SEC rules  and  regulations and interpretations
of the SEC staff.

**ARTICLE  IX 
CONDITIONS TO THE MERGER**

10.2  _Restrictions Relating to the Distribution_.

 

(a) Neither  the Company, nor the Surviving Corporation shall, nor shall the
Company or  the  Surviving Corporation permit any of its Subsidiaries to,
take any action,  including entering into any agreement, understanding or
arrangement or any  substantial negotiations with respect to any transaction
or series of  transactions that would cause a Distribution Disqualification
to occur (any  such  action, a " _Disqualifying Action_ "); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that  the term "Disqualifying Action" shall not include (i) any
action that is  taken pursuant to the terms of the Transaction Agreements,
(ii) any  action  that would not have caused a Distribution Disqualification
to occur but for  an  AT Co. Action, (iii) for the avoidance of doubt, any
action taken  by Spinco  or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the
Distribution, (v) any action  taken  solely to mitigate the adverse effects
on the Tax-Free Status of the  Transactions of a breach by Spinco, occurring
prior to the Distribution,  of a  representation, warranty or covenant
contained in the Transaction Agreements,  regardless of whether such breach
or its effects continue after the  Distribution.

 

(b) Except  as otherwise provided in subsection (c) or (g) of this  Section
10.2, until the first day after the second anniversary of  the  Distribution
Date, the Surviving Corporation shall not, nor shall the Surviving 
Corporation permit any of its Subsidiaries to, take any action (including 
entering into any agreement, understanding or arrangement or any substantial 
negotiations with respect to any transaction or series of transactions) that 
might cause a Distribution Disqualification to occur (any such action or 
failure  to act, a " _Potential Disqualifying Action_ "), including any
action or  failure to act that might be inconsistent with any representation
made in  the  Tax Materials, unless, prior to the taking of the Potential
Disqualifying  Action, AT Co. has delivered to the Surviving Corporation a
written  determination, in its reasonable discretion, which discretion shall
be exercised  in good faith solely to preserve the Tax-Free Status of the
Transactions,  that  the Potential Disqualifying Action would not jeopardize
the Tax-Free Status  of  the Transactions.

 

(c) Until  the first day after the second anniversary of the Distribution
Date, the  Surviving Corporation shall not enter into any agreement,
understanding or  arrangement or any substantial negotiations with respect to
any transaction  (including a merger to which the Surviving Corporation is a
party) involving  the  acquisition (including by the Surviving Corporation
or any of its Subsidiaries)  of common stock of the Surviving Corporation and
shall not issue any additional  shares of capital stock or transfer or modify
any options, warrants, convertible  obligations or other instrument that
provides for the right or possibility  to  issue, redeem or transfer any
shares of capital stock of the Surviving  Corporation (or enter into any
agreement, understanding, arrangement or any  substantial negotiations with
respect to any such issuance, transfer or  modification), except to the
extent that all such agreements, understandings,  arrangements, substantial
negotiations and other issuances, taken together,  do  not involve a direct
or indirect acquisition by any Person or Persons of  more  than 71,130,989
shares of the stock of the Surviving Corporation (as adjusted  to  take into
account any stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization,  reclassification
or similar transaction with respect to the stock of the  Surviving
Corporation). Notwithstanding the foregoing,

 

(i)  the Surviving Corporation may issue additional shares of common stock
of  the  Surviving Corporation to a person in a transaction to which Section

 

80

 

  

 

83  or  Section 421(a) or (b) of the Code applies (or options to acquire
stock  in  such a transaction) in connection with the person's performance
of services as  an employee, director or independent contractor of AT Co.,
the Company, the  Surviving Corporation, any of their respective
Subsidiaries, or any other  person  that is related to AT Co., the Company
or the Surviving Corporation under  Section 355(d)(7)(A) of the Code or a
corporation the assets of which  the  Surviving Corporation or Subsidiary
acquires in a reorganization under  Section 368 of the Code (including Spinco
or any of its Subsidiaries),  provided that such stock is not excessive by
reference to the services performed  by such person and such person or a
coordinating group of which the person  is a  member will not be a
controlling shareholder or a ten-percent shareholder  of the  Surviving
Corporation (within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 
1.355-7(h)(3) and (8)) immediately after the issuance of such common stock; 
and 

 

(ii)  the Surviving Corporation may issue additional shares of common stock
of  the  Surviving Corporation to a retirement plan of the Surviving
Corporation or  any  other person that is treated as the same employer as
the Surviving Corporation  under Section 414(b), (c), (m), or (o) of the Code
that qualifies  under Section 401(a) or 403(a) of the Code, provided that the
stock acquired  by  all of the qualified plans of the Surviving Corporation
and such other persons  during the four-year period beginning two years
before the Distribution Date  does not, in the aggregate, represent more than
ten percent of the total  combined voting power of all classes of stock of
the Surviving Corporation  entitled to vote or more than ten percent of the
total value of shares of  all  classes of stock of the Surviving
Corporation.

 

(d) Until  the first day after the second anniversary of the Distribution
Date, the  Surviving Corporation shall not, and shall not permit any of its
Subsidiaries  to, repurchase any shares of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation except  to  the extent consistent with the requirements of
Revenue Procedure 96-30.

 

(e) Until  the first day after the second anniversary of the Distribution
Date, the  Surviving Corporation shall cause its wholly-owned Subsidiaries
that were  wholly-owned Subsidiaries of Spinco at the time of the
Distribution (other  than  those set forth on Spinco Schedule 10.2(e)) to
continue the active  conduct  of the Spinco Business to the extent so
conducted by those Subsidiaries  immediately prior to the Distribution. The
Surviving Corporation shall cause  those Subsidiaries to continue the active
conduct of the Spinco Business  primarily through officers and employees of
the Surviving Corporation or  any of  its Subsidiaries (and not primarily
through independent contractors).

 

(f) Until  the first day after the second anniversary of the Distribution
Date, the  Surviving Corporation shall not voluntarily dissolve, liquidate,
merge or  consolidate with any other person, unless (i) in the case of a
merger  or  consolidation, the Surviving Corporation is the survivor of the
merger or  consolidation or (ii) prior to undertaking such action, AT Co.
has  delivered to the Surviving Corporation a written determination, in its 
reasonable discretion, which discretion shall be exercised in good faith 
solely  to preserve the Tax-Free Status of the Transactions, that such action
would  not  jeopardize the Tax-Free Status of the Transactions.

 

81

 

  

 

(g) _Permitted  Actions and Transactions_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
provisions of  this Section 10.2 shall not prohibit the Surviving Corporation
from  implementing any Potential Disqualifying Action upon which the IRS has
granted  a  favorable ruling to AT Co. or the Surviving Corporation. Any
such ruling  will be  treated as favorable for purposes of this Section
10.2(f) only if  the  Potentially Disqualifying Action is described in
reasonable detail in such  ruling and it is clear on the face of such ruling
that such Potentially  Disqualifying Action may be implemented without
jeopardizing the Tax-Free  Status  of the Transactions.

 

10.3  _Cooperation and Other Covenants_.

 

(a) _Notice  of Subsequent Actions_. From and after the Effective Time, each
of Spinco and  the Company, on the one hand, and AT Co., on the other hand,
shall furnish  the  other with a copy of any ruling requests or other
documents delivered to  the IRS  that relate to the Distribution or that
otherwise reasonably could be expected  to have an impact on the Tax-Free
Status of the Transactions; provided, that  each party may redact from any
IRS Submission or other documents any Redactable  Information.

 

(b) _Certain  Post-Closing Actions Requested by AT Co._ After the
Distribution Date, if  reasonably requested by AT Co., the Surviving
Corporation will take an action  (or fail to take an action) to mitigate the
effects of a breach by Spinco  prior  to the Distribution Date of a
representation or covenant in this Article X;  provided that (i) the
Surviving Corporation 's obligations under this  Section 10.3(b) are subject
to AT Co.'s agreement to pay and indemnify the  Surviving Corporation against
all reasonable costs and expenses of taking  or  refraining from taking such
action and (ii) any such action (or failure  to  take such action), even if
reasonably requested, does not and will not adversely  impact in any material
respect the business, operations or financial condition  of the Surviving
Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries or divisions. No  action  taken
pursuant to this Section 10.3(b) shall be treated as a Disqualifying  Action
or a Potential Disqualifying Action. Except as provided in this  Section
10.3(b), the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall  have  no duty
to take any action to mitigate the effects of a breach by Spinco  or its 
Subsidiaries prior to the Distribution of a representation or covenant
contained  in this _Article X._

 

10.4  _Indemnification for Disqualifying Actions_.

 

(a) _General_.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or any
provision of  any of  the Tax Sharing Agreement to the contrary, if there is
a Final Determination  that a Distribution Disqualification has occurred,
then the Surviving  Corporation shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless AT
Co. and the AT Co.  Subsidiaries (or any successor to any of them) from and
against any and all  (A) Taxes imposed pursuant to a Final Determination
and  (B) accounting, legal and other professional fees and court costs 
incurred  in connection with such Taxes (other than such costs incurred in
the joint  defense of a Third-Party Claim, which costs are subject to Section
10.5(e)  below), (C) costs and expenses that result from adverse tax
consequences  to  AT Co. or AT Co.'s stockholders (including all costs,
expenses and damages  associated with stockholders litigation or
controversies) and (D) all  Taxes  resulting from indemnification payments
hereunder (collectively, " _Tax-Related  Losses_ "), incurred by AT

 

82

 

  

 

Co. to the extent  that  the Distribution Disqualification is caused by any
Disqualifying Action taken  by  the Surviving Corporation or any of its
Subsidiaries after the Distribution  Date.

 

(b) _Exceptions  to Indemnification_.

 

(i)  If AT Co. delivers to the Surviving Corporation a written
determination,  pursuant to any clause of _Section 10.2_, that a Potential 
Disqualifying Action or other action described in _Section 10.2_ would  not
jeopardize the Tax-Free Status of the Transactions, then the Surviving 
Corporation shall have no obligation to indemnify AT Co. in respect of such 
Potentially Disqualifying Action or other action pursuant to _Section 
10.4(a)_ , except to the extent that a Disqualifying Action results from the 
inaccuracy, incorrectness or incompleteness of any representation provided 
by  the Surviving Corporation to AT Co. in respect of that determination.

 

(ii)  The Surviving Corporation shall have no obligation to indemnify AT Co.
pursuant  to Section 10.4(a) in respect of any action or transaction that
is  permitted to be taken without the consent of AT Co. under Section 10.2, 
except to the extent that, in the case of an action permitted pursuant to 
a  ruling described in Section 10.2(g), a Disqualifying Action results 
from  the inaccuracy, incorrectness or incompleteness of any representation
provided  by the Surviving Corporation to the IRS in connection with such
ruling.

 

(iii)  The Surviving Corporation shall have no obligation to indemnify AT Co.
pursuant  to Section 10.4(a) in respect of any item of income, gain,
deduction  or  loss arising in respect of or as a result of the Preliminary
Restructuring,  including an intercompany transaction pursuant to Section
1.1502-13  of the  Treasury Regulations, an excess loss account pursuant to
Section 1.1502-19  of the Treasury Regulations or any similar item, in each
case, resulting  from  such Preliminary Restructuring, or any item that is
includable in income  without  regard to the Tax-Free Status of the
Transactions because such item is  attributable to a predecessor of AT Co. or
Spinco, within the meaning of  Section  355(e)(4)(D) of the Code.

 

(iv)  Nothing contained in this _Article X_ shall be interpreted as 
requiring the Surviving Corporation to indemnify AT Co. against any Tax-
Related  Loss to the extent that such Tax-Related Loss arises from the
recognition  of  taxable income or gain by AT Co. or any AT Co. Affiliate on
the Distribution  as  a result of (A) any deemed sale of Spinco stock
attributable to such  stock  being treated for federal income tax purposes
as not having been distributed  to  AT Co. stockholders or (B) any failure
by AT Co. to distribute an  amount of  Spinco stock constituting control of
Spinco within the meaning of Section  368(c)  of the Code as a result of any
deemed sale described in _clause (A)._

 

(c) _Timing  and Method of Tax Indemnification Payments_. The Surviving
Corporation shall  pay any amount that is due and payable to AT Co. pursuant
to this  Section 10.4 on or before the ninetieth (90th) day following the
earlier  of  the date of an agreement of the parties or the date of a Final
Determination  that such amount is due and payable to AT Co. All payments
pursuant to this  Section 10.4 shall be made by wire transfer to the bank

 

83

 

  

 

account designated  by  AT Co. for such purpose, and, on the date of such
wire transfer, the Surviving  Corporation shall give AT Co. notice of the
transfer.

 

(d) _Prior  Period Agreements_. Except for the Tax Sharing Agreement, any and
all  existing Tax Sharing agreements and practices regarding Taxes and their
payment,  allocation or sharing between (i) AT Co. or any Subsidiary of AT
Co.  other  than Spinco or a Subsidiary of Spinco, on the one hand, and (ii)
Spinco  or  any Subsidiary of Spinco, on the other hand, shall be terminated
with respect  to  Spinco and all Subsidiaries of Spinco as of the
Distribution Date, and no  remaining liabilities thereunder shall exist
thereafter.

 

10.5  _Procedure for Indemnification for Tax Liabilities_.

 

(a) If  AT Co. receives notice of the assertion of any Third-Party Claim with
respect  to  which the Surviving Corporation may be obligated under Section
10.4(a)  to  provide indemnification, AT Co. shall give the Surviving
Corporation notice  thereof (together with a copy of such Third-Party Claim,
process or other  legal  pleading) promptly after becoming aware of such
Third-Party Claim; provided,  however, that the failure of AT Co. to give
notice as provided in this Section  shall not relieve the Surviving
Corporation of its obligations under  Section 10.4, except to the extent that
the Surviving Corporation  is  actually prejudiced by such failure to give
notice. Such notice shall describe  such Third-Party Claim in reasonable
detail.

 

(b) AT  Co. and the Surviving Corporation shall jointly control the defense
of, and  cooperate with each other with respect to defending, any Third-Party
Claim  with  respect to which the Surviving Corporation may be obligated
under  Section 10.4 to provide indemnification; provided that the Surviving 
Corporation shall forfeit such joint control right with respect to a
particular  Third-Party Claim if the Surviving Corporation or any Affiliate
of the Surviving  Corporation makes any public statement or filing, or takes
any action (including  the filing of any submission or pleading, or the
giving of a deposition or  production of documents, in any administrative or
court proceeding) in  connection with such Third-Party Claim that is
inconsistent in a material  respect with any representation or warranty made
by Spinco in this Agreement  or  the Tax Materials and provided, further
that AT Co. shall forfeit such joint  control right with respect to a
particular Third-Party Claim if the AT Co.  or  any Affiliate of AT Co.
makes any public statement or filing, or takes any  action (including the
filing of any submission or pleading, or the giving  of a  deposition or
production of documents, in any administrative or court  proceeding) in
connection with such Third-Party Claim that is inconsistent  in a  material
respect with any representation or warranty made by AT Co. or Spinco  in 
this Agreement or the Tax Materials.

 

(c) The  Surviving Corporation and AT Co. shall exercise their rights to
jointly control  the defense of any such Third-Party Claim solely for the
purpose of defeating  such Third-Party Claim and, unless required by
Applicable Law, neither the  Surviving Corporation nor AT Co. shall make any
statements or take any actions  that would reasonably be expected to result
in the shifting of liability  for  Losses or Tax-Related Losses arising out
of such Third-Party Claim from the  party making such statement or taking
such action (or any of its Affiliates)  to  the other party (or any of its
Affiliates).

 

84

 

  

 

(d) Statements  made or actions taken by either the Surviving Corporation or
AT Co. in  connection with the defense of any such Third-Party Claim shall
not prejudice  the rights of such party in any subsequent action or
proceeding between the  parties.

 

(e) If  either AT Co. or the Surviving Corporation fails to jointly defend
any such  Third-Party Claim, then the other party shall solely defend such
Third-Party  Claim and the party failing to jointly defend shall use
reasonable best efforts  to cooperate with the other party in its defense of
such Third-Party Claim;  provided, however, that AT Co. may not compromise or
settle any such Third-Party  Claim without the prior written consent of the
Surviving Corporation, which  consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. All costs  and expenses of either party in connection
with, and during the course of,  the  joint control of the defense of any
such Third-Party Claim shall be paid  by the  party that incurs such costs
and expenses.

 

10.6  _Exclusivity of Article X_. This Article X constitutes the  complete
and exclusive agreement of the parties with respect to the  indemnification
of AT Co. for Tax-Related Losses contained in Section 10.4.  Any conflict
between the terms of this Section 10.6 and any other  provision  of this
Agreement, or any provision of any other agreement, shall be resolved  in 
favor of this Section 10.6, unless such other provision expressly  provides 
that it shall be given priority over this specific Section.

that the right  to  terminate this Agreement pursuant to this clause 11.1(b)
shall not be available  to any party whose failure to perform any of its
obligations under this  Agreement required to be performed by it at or prior
to such date has been  a  substantial cause of, or substantially contributed
to, the failure of the  Merger  to have become effective on or before such
date;

 

(c) by  any party hereto if, (i) a statute, rule, regulation or executive 
order  shall have been enacted, entered or promulgated prohibiting the
consummation  of  the Merger or (ii) an Order, decree, ruling or injunction

the Requisite  Approval shall not be obtained; except that the right to
terminate this  Agreement under this Section 11.1(f) shall not be available
to the  Company  where the failure to obtain the Requisite Approval shall
have been caused  by the  action or failure to act of the Company and such
action or failure to act  constitutes a material breach by the Company of
this Agreement or a material  breach of the Voting Agreement by any party
thereto other than Spinco.

 

(g) by  AT Co. and Spinco, if (i) the Board of Directors of the Company (or

any  of the  foregoing, or (ii) the Company fails to call and hold the
Company  Stockholders Meeting within sixty (60) days after the
effectiveness  of the  Registration Statement.

 

(h) by  the Company if the Board of Directors of the Company determines in
good faith  that a Company Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Company
Superior Proposal,  except that the Company may not terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this  Section 11.1(h) unless and until (i) three business days

any  liability  on the part of any party or its directors, officers or
stockholders except  as  set forth in Section 11.3; provided, that nothing
in this Agreement  shall  relieve any party of liability for breach of this

damages, including any damages  based  on the value that would otherwise
have been available to the stockholders  of the  non-breaching party by
virtue of this Agreement, from any other party for  any  breach of this

all of the conditions to the transactions contemplated hereby set forth in 
Sections 9.1 and 9.2 (other than those which by their terms are intended 
to  be satisfied contemporaneously with the Closing) have been satisfied
other  than  the conditions set forth in Sections 9.1(h), 9.1(i) and/or
9.1(j),  or  (ii) the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section
11.1(d)  and the breach or breaches by AT Co. or Spinco that gave rise to

Co.  shall  pay the Company a fee, in immediately available funds, equal to

Company at any time before or after adoption of this Agreement by the 
stockholders of the  

87

the exercise of any other right  hereunder. Any agreement on the part of AT
Co., Spinco or the Company to  any  such extension or waiver shall be valid

respect to which such  matter  is relevant so long as the applicability of
such matter to such Section or  Subsection is reasonably apparent on its
face.

 

12.5  _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement or the application
of  any such provision to any Person or circumstance, shall be declared
judicially  to be invalid, unenforceable or void, such decision shall not
have the effect  of  invalidating or voiding the remainder of this
Agreement, it being the intent  and  agreement of the parties hereto that
this Agreement shall be deemed amended  by  modifying such provision to the
extent necessary to render it valid, legal  and  enforceable while
preserving its intent or, if such modification is not  possible, by
substituting therefor another provision that is legal and  enforceable and
that achieves the same objective. 

 

12.6  _Assignment; Binding Effect_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the
rights,  benefits or obligations hereunder may be assigned by any of the
parties hereto  (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior
written consent  of  all of the other parties. Subject to the preceding
sentence, this Agreement  will  be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and
be enforceable by the parties  hereto and their respective successors and
permitted assigns.

 

12.7  _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except as provided in Section 8.12,

confer  upon any Person (other than AT Co., Spinco and the Company and their
respective  successors and permitted assigns) any legal or equitable right,
benefit or  remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this
Agreement, and  no  Person (other than as so specified) shall be deemed a
third party beneficiary  under or by reason of this Agreement.

 

12.8  _Limited Liability_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement,  no stockholder, director, officer, Affiliate, agent or
representative of  any of  the parties hereto, in its capacity as such,
shall have any liability in  respect  of or relating to the covenants,
obligations, representations or warranties  of  such party under this
Agreement or in respect of any certificate delivered  with  respect hereto
or thereto and, to the fullest extent legally permissible,  each  of the
parties hereto, for itself and its stockholders, directors, officers  and 
Affiliates, waives and agrees not to seek to assert or enforce any such 
liability that any such Person otherwise might have pursuant to applicable 
Law. 

 

12.9  _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (together with the other
Transaction  Agreements, the Voting Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement,
the exhibits  and the Disclosure Letters and the other documents delivered
pursuant hereto)  constitutes the entire agreement of all the parties hereto
and supersedes  all  prior and contemporaneous agreements and
understandings, both written and  oral,  between the parties, or any of
them, with respect to the subject matter hereof.  All exhibits attached to
this Agreement and the Disclosure Letters are expressly  made a part of, and
incorporated by reference into, this Agreement.

 

12.10  _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed
in  accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware without giving
effect  to the  conflicts of law principles thereof.

 

91

 

  

 

12.11  _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts,  each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all of
which together  shall  constitute one agreement binding on the parties
hereto, notwithstanding that  not  all parties are signatories to the
original or the same counterpart.

 

12.12  _Waiver of Jury Trial_. Each of the parties hereto irrevocably waives
all  right to trial by jury in any action, suit, proceeding or counterclaim
(whether  based on contract, tort or otherwise) arising out of or relating to
this  Agreement or the actions of the parties hereto in the negotiation, 
administration, performance and enforcement hereof. 

 

12.13  _Jurisdiction; Enforcement_. The parties agree that irreparable
damage  would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement
were  not  performed in accordance with their specific terms or were
otherwise breached.  It  is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be
entitled to an injunction  or  injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically  the terms and provisions of this
Agreement in any court of the United States  located in the State of Delaware
or the Delaware Court of Chancery, this  being  in addition to any other
remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.  In addition, each of
the parties hereto (a) consents to submit itself to  the  personal
jurisdiction of any federal court located in the State of Delaware  or  the
Delaware Court of Chancery in the event any dispute arises out of this 
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,  (b)
agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal  jurisdiction
by motion or other request for leave from any such court and  (c) agrees that
it will not bring any action relating to this Agreement  or  any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any court other  than a 
federal court sitting in the State of Delaware.

and  outstanding shares of Spinco Common Stock on a pro rata basis to
holders  of the  AT Co. Common Stock (the "Distribution").

and among  AT  Co., Spinco and Valor (the " Merger Agreement"), following

Whereas,  the parties to this Agreement intend that the Contribution, 
together with the Debt Exchange, qualify as a tax-free reorganization under

that  the Distribution  qualify as a distribution of Spinco stock to AT Co.
stockholders pursuant  to  Section 355  of  the Code,  that the  Merger
qualify as a tax-free reorganization pursuant  to  Section  368 of the
Code,  and  that no gain or loss be recognized as a result of such
transactions for federal  income tax purposes by any of AT Co., Spinco, and
their respective stockholders  (except to the extent of cash received in lieu
of fractional shares).

 



 

Whereas,  AT Co., Spinco and Valor desire to set forth their rights and
obligations  with  respect to Taxes (as defined herein) due for periods
before and after the  Distribution Date.

2.01  OBLIGATIONS TO FILE TAX RETURNS.

 



 

(a)  AT  Co. shall file or cause to be filed any Income Tax Return that is
required  to be  filed after the Distribution Date by or with respect to any
member of the  Spinco  Group that (i) is filed on a consolidated, combined
or unitary basis, (ii)  includes both one or more members of the AT Co. Group
and one or more members  of  the Spinco Group, and (iii) is for a taxable
period that includes a  Pre-Distribution Period (a "Combined Return"). Each
member of the Spinco  Group  hereby irrevocably authorizes and designates AT
Co. as its agent, coordinator  and administrator for the purpose of taking
any and all actions necessary  or  incidental to the filing of any such
Combined Tax Return and, except as  otherwise provided herein, for the
purpose of making payments to, or collecting  refunds from, any Taxing
Authority in respect of a Combined Return. Except  as  otherwise provided
herein, AT Co. shall have the exclusive right to file,  prosecute, compromise
or settle any claim for refund for Income Taxes in  respect  of a Combined
Return for which AT Co. bears responsibility hereunder and  to  determine
whether any refunds of such Income Taxes to which the AT Consolidated  Group
may be entitled shall be received by way of refund or credit against  the 
Tax liability of the AT Consolidated Group.

 



 

(b)  Valor  shall file or cause to be filed any other Income Tax Return
required to be  filed  after the Distribution Date by or with respect to one
or more members of  the  Spinco Group, including any such Tax Return (i)
with respect to any taxable  period that includes but does not end on the
Distribution Date (a "Straddle  Return"), (ii) with respect to a taxable
period ending on the Distribution  Date  (a "Short Period Return"), and
(iii) with respect to a taxable period beginning  after the Distribution Date
(a "Separate Return"). AT Co. shall remit to  Valor  in immediately
available funds the amount of any Income Taxes (including  estimated Income
Taxes) related to a Straddle Return or Short Period Return  for  which AT
Co. is responsible hereunder, at least two Business Days before  payment  of
the relevant amount is due to a Taxing Authority. Valor shall file or 
cause  to be filed any Other Tax Return required to be filed after the
Distribution  Date by one or more members of the Spinco Group.

 



 

2.02  APPROVAL OF STRADDLE RETURNS AND SHORT PERIOD RETURNS. No later than
thirty  (30)  days prior to the date on which any Straddle Return or Short
Period Return  is  required to be filed (taking  into account any valid
extensions)  (the  "Due Date"), Valor shall submit or cause to be submitted
to AT Co. the Straddle  Return or Short Period Return and  shall  make or
cause to be made any and all changes to such return reasonably requested  by
AT Co., to the extent that such changes relate to items for which AT Co. 
has  responsibility hereunder (and for which at least substantial authority
exists  within the meaning of Section 6662 of the Code and the Treasury
Regulations  thereunder). Valor shall not file or allow to be filed any such
Straddle  Return  or Short Period Return prior to receiving written approval
of the return  from AT  Co., which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or  conditioned.

 



 

2.03  OBLIGATION TO REMIT TAXES. Subject to Section 2.01 and subject always
to  the  ultimate division of responsibility for Taxes set out in Section
2.04, AT  Co.  and Valor shall each remit or cause to be remitted to the
applicable Taxing  Authority any Taxes due in respect of any Tax Return that
such party is required  to file (or, in the case of a Tax for which no Tax
Return is required to  be  filed, which is otherwise payable by such party
or a member of such party\'s  group (the AT Co. Group or the Spinco Group) to
any Taxing Authority) and  shall  be entitled to reimbursement for such
payments to the extent provided herein  or  in the Merger Agreement.

 



 

2.04  TAX  SHARING OBLIGATIONS AND PRIOR AGREEMENTS.

 



 

(a)  From  and after the Merger, Valor shall be liable for and shall
indemnify and hold  the  AT Co. Group harmless against (i) any net liability
for Income Taxes of a  member  of the Spinco Group (and Valor and the Spinco
Group shall be entitled to  receive  and retain any net refund of Income
Taxes or other net Tax Benefit) attributable  to the treatment of payments
received from a federal or state universal services  fund ("USF Payments") in
respect of the Spinco Business for the period from  January 1, 1997, to the
Distribution Date, taking into account (x) any refund  of  Income Taxes with
respect to USF Payments previously not treated as  contributions to capital
within the meaning of Section 118(a) of the Code,  (y)  cost recovery
deductions arising from property acquired with USF Payments  and  (z) Income
Taxes payable as a result of a failure of a USF Payment to be  treated  as a
contribution to capital within the meaning of Section 118(a) of the  Code, 
in each case with respect to such period (a "USF Tax Amount"), (ii) any
Other  Taxes arising in the Pre-Distribution Period and attributable to a
member  of the  Spinco Group or to the employees, assets or transactions of
the Spinco Business,  except for Other Taxes arising in respect of the
Contribution (including  the  Preliminary Restructuring) or the Distribution
and (iii) any liability for  Taxes  arising in the Post-Distribution Period
and attributable to a member of the  Spinco Group or to the assets,
employees, or transactions of the Spinco  Business. Except with respect to
indemnification pursuant to clause (i),  all  indemnification pursuant to
this Section 2.04(a) shall be on a net after-Tax  basis.

 



 

(b)  Except for Taxes specifically allocated to Valor under this Agreement
or  for  which Valor has indemnified AT Co. pursuant to the Merger
Agreement, AT Co.  shall be liable for and shall indemnify and hold Valor and
its Subsidiaries  and  the Spinco Group harmless against, on a net after-Tax
basis, any Tax liability  (i) of the AT Co. Group or any AT Consolidated
Group or any member thereof  or  attributable to the employees, assets or
transactions of the AT Co. Business  or  (ii) of the Spinco Group or any
member thereof, including Taxes arising from  any  Distribution
Disqualification other than Taxes for which Valor is responsible  pursuant to
Article X of the Merger Agreement.

 



 

(c)  Except as set forth in this Agreement and in consideration of the
mutual  indemnities and other obligations of this Agreement, any and all
prior Tax  sharing or allocation agreements or practices between any member
of the AT  Co.  Group and any member of the Spinco Group (including the
ALLTEL Corporation  and  Subsidiaries Tax Sharing Policy in effect for
taxable years ending on or  after  December 31, 1991) shall be terminated
with respect to the Spinco Group as  of  the Distribution Date, and no
member of the Spinco Group shall have any  continuing rights or obligations
thereunder.

 



 

(d)  Valor  shall be entitled to any refund of or credit for Taxes for which
Valor is  responsible under this Agreement, and AT Co. shall be entitled to
any refund  of  or credit for Taxes for which AT Co. is responsible under
this Agreement.  Refunds for any Straddle Period shall be equitably
apportioned between the  AT  Co. Group and the Spinco Group in accordance
with the provisions of this  Agreement governing such periods. A party
receiving a refund to which another  party is entitled pursuant to this
Agreement shall pay the amount to which  such  other party is entitled
within five days after the receipt of the  refund.

 



 

2.06  PERIOD THAT INCLUDES THE DISTRIBUTION DATE.

 



 

(a)  To  the extent permitted by law or administrative practice, the taxable
year  of each  member of the Spinco Group with respect to any Tax shall be
treated as closing  at the close of the Distribution Date.

 



 

(b)  If it  is necessary for purposes of this Agreement to determine the Tax
liability  of  any member of the Spinco Group for a taxable year or period
that begins on  or  before and ends after the Distribution Date and that is
not treated under  Section 2.05(a) as closing at the close of the
Distribution Date, the  determination shall be made, in the case of Taxes
that are based upon income  or  receipts, by assuming that the relevant
taxable period ended at the close  of the  Distribution Date, except that
any exemptions, allowances or deductions that  are  calculated on an annual
basis shall be apportioned on a time basis. In the  case  of Taxes that are
imposed on a periodic basis, are payable for a taxable  period  that
includes (but does not end on) the Distribution Date, and are not based  upon
or related to income or receipts, the portion of such Tax that relates  to 
the Pre-Distribution Period shall be deemed to be the amount of such Tax  for
the  entire taxable period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which
is  the  number of days in the taxable period ending on the Distribution
Date and  the  denominator of which is the number of days in the entire
taxable period. 

 



 

(c)  For  the avoidance of doubt, Taxes allocated to the Pre-Distribution
Period shall  include (i) any Tax resulting from the departure of any
corporation from  any AT  Consolidated Group (resulting from the triggering
into income of deferred  intercompany transactions under Section 1.1502-13 of
the Treasury Regulations  or  excess loss accounts under Section 1.1502-19
of the Treasury Regulations  or  otherwise) other than any such Tax that
would not have arisen in the absence  of  a Disqualifying Action, and (ii)
any Tax related to items of income or gain  arising with respect to any
interest in an entity treated as a partnership  for  United States federal
income tax purposes, held by a member of the Spinco  Group  in the Pre-
Distribution Period, in accordance with the principles of Section 
1.1502-76(b)(2)(vi) of the Treasury Regulations.

3.01  CARRYBACKS. Without the consent of AT Co., no member of the Spinco
Group  shall  carry back any Tax Attribute (unless required to carry back

the carryback is required by  law, AT  Co. (or any other member of the AT
Co. Group receiving such refund) shall  promptly remit to Valor any Tax
Benefit it realizes with respect to any such  carryback.

 



 

3.02  AMENDED RETURNS. Valor shall not, and shall not permit any member of
the  Spinco  Group to, file any amended Income Tax Return of a member of the

Co. Group, in each case  with  respect to a Pre-Distribution Period, without
first obtaining the consent  of AT  Co., which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or  conditioned.

 



 

3.03  TIMING  ADJUSTMENTS.

 



 

(a)  If an  audit or other examination by any Taxing Authority with respect
to any Income  Tax Return shall result (by settlement or otherwise) in any
adjustment that  (A)  decreases deductions, losses or Tax credits or
increases income, gains or  recapture of Tax credits of a member of the AT
Consolidated Group for a  Pre-Distribution Period in respect of an item for
which AT Co. is responsible  hereunder and (B) will permit the Spinco Group
to increase deductions, losses  or  tax credits or decrease income, gains or
recapture of tax credits that would  otherwise (but for such adjustment) have
been taken or reported with respect  to  the Spinco Group for one or more
Post-Distribution Periods, Valor shall,  and  shall cause the Spinco Group
to, pay to AT Co. the amounts of any Tax Benefits  that result therefrom
within ten (10) days of the date on which such Tax  Benefits are realized,
provided, however, that this Section 3.02(a) shall  not  apply to any such
adjustment relating to the subject matter of 2.04(a)(i)  and  the last
sentence of Section 4.01.

 



 

(b)  If an  audit or other examination by any Taxing Authority with respect

Group for a Post-Distribution  Period and (B) will permit any member of the
AT Co. Group or any AT Consolidated  Group to increase deductions, losses or

shall, and shall cause the AT Co. Group to,  pay to  Valor the amounts of
any Tax Benefits that result therefrom within ten (10)  days  of the date on
which such Tax Benefits are realized.

 



 

(c)  The  party in control of the audit or other examination to which any
such adjustment  described in 3.02(a) or (b) above relates shall notify the
other party and  provide it with adequate information so that it may reflect
such adjustment  on  its applicable Tax Returns.

 



 

3.04  TAX  BENEFIT REALIZED. For purposes of this Agreement, a Tax Benefit
shall be  deemed  to have been realized at the time any refund of Taxes is
received or applied  against other Taxes due, or at the time of filing of a
Tax Return (including  any  relating to estimated Taxes) on which a loss,
deduction or credit is applied  in  reduction of Taxes which would otherwise
be payable; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that,  where a party has other
losses, deductions, credits or similar items available  to it, deductions,
credits or items for which the other party would be entitled  to a payment
under this Agreement shall be treated as the last items utilized  to 
produce a Tax Benefit.

Federal Rate  from  the due date of such payment. Notwithstanding the

Valor as the result of a Final  Determination with respect to a USF Amount,
such USF Amount may be paid in  ten  (10) equal, annual installments,

concerning  any  Combined Return, Straddle Return or Short Period Return or
otherwise concerning  Taxes for which AT Co. may be liable under this
Agreement. AT Co. shall promptly  notify Valor in writing upon receipt by AT

ARTICLE  VI.

 

 

COOPERATION

 



 

6.01  GENERAL. AT Co. and Valor shall cooperate with each other in the filing
of  any  Tax Returns and the conduct of any audit or other proceeding and
each shall  execute and deliver such powers of attorney and make available
such other  documents as are reasonably necessary to carry out the intent of
this Agreement.  Each party agrees to notify the other party in writing of

reasonably expected to affect  Tax Returns of the other party, or any of its
Subsidiaries, for a  Post-Distribution Period.

 



 

6.02  CONSISTENT TREATMENT.

 



 

(a)  Unless and until there has been a Final Determination to the contrary,
each  party agrees to treat the Contribution, together with the Debt
Exchange,  as a  reorganization qualifying under Section 368(a)(1)(D) of the
Code, the  Distribution as a transaction qualifying under Sections 355 and
361 of the  Code  and the Merger as a reorganization qualifying under
Section 368(a) of the  Code,  pursuant to which no gain or loss is
recognized by any of AT Co., Spinco,  Valor  and their respective
shareholders (except to the extent of cash received  in lieu  of fractional
shares).

 



 

(b)  Unless and until there has been a Final Determination to the contrary
or  unless  there is not at  least  substantial authority for a particular
position within the meaning of Section  6662 of the Code and the Treasury
Regulations thereunder,  Valor  shall file or cause to be filed all Tax
Returns of a member of the Spinco  Group  or relating to the Spinco Business
and shall conduct any Tax Contests in  respect  of a member of the Spinco
Group or the Spinco Business in a manner consistent  with AT Co.\'s
determination of the adjusted Tax basis of any asset and the  amount of any
Tax Attribute or any similar item held by the Spinco Group  at the  time of
the Distribution, and, without the consent of AT Co., in the case  of a 
past practice of the AT Co. Consolidated Group that is subject to a Tax
Contest  at the time of the Distribution, Valor shall not permit any of the
Spinco  Subsidiaries to take any position on any Tax Return, in any Tax
Contest or  otherwise that is inconsistent with such past practice. For the
avoidance  of  doubt, this Section shall not apply to reporting under GAAP.

obligation or liability of a party under  this Agreement or for purposes of
the preparation or filing of any such Tax  Return, the conduct of any Tax

arising  with  respect to this Agreement, including, but not limited to, any
dispute in  connection with a claim by a third party (a "Dispute"). Either
party may  give  the other party written notice of any Dispute not resolved
in the normal  course  of business. If the parties cannot agree by the tenth
Business Day following  the  date on which one party gives such notice (the
"Dispute Date"), then the  Dispute  shall be determined as follows: Within
20 days of the Dispute Date, AT Co.  and  Valor shall each appoint one
arbitrator. The two arbitrators so appointed  shall  appoint a third
arbitrator within 30 days of the Dispute Date. If either  party  shall fail
to appoint an arbitrator within such 20-day period, the arbitration  shall be
conducted by the sole arbitrator appointed by the other party. Whether 
selected by AT Co., Valor or otherwise, each arbitrator selected to resolve 
such  dispute shall be a tax lawyer who is generally recognized in the tax
community  as a qualified and competent tax practitioner with experience in
the tax  area  involved. Such arbitrators shall be empowered to resolve the
Dispute, including  by engaging nationally recognized accounting and other
experts. Each of AT  Co.  and Valor shall bear 50% of the aggregate expenses
of the arbitrators (or  the  sole arbitrator). The decision of the
arbitrators shall be rendered no later  than 90 days from the Dispute Date
and shall be final.
