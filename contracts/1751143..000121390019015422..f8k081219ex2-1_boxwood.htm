Article II _ 
 PURCHASE AND SALE TRANSACTIONS_

  



  

  

Section 2.1 _Purchase and Sale_. Subject to the terms and conditions set
forth herein, at the Closing, (a) Holdings shall issue to Parent a number of
Holdings Common Units such that Parent will own a number of Holdings Units
that correspond to the number of Purchased Units, (b) Seller shall transfer,
convey, assign and deliver to Buyer the Rolled Units, free and clear of all
Liens other than Securities Liens and Liens arising under or in
connection with this Agreement, and in exchange therefor Holdings shall issue
to Seller a corresponding number of Holdings Common Units (such that Seller
will hold a percentage of the issued and outstanding Holdings Common Units
equal to the percentage of the issued and outstanding Units that the Rolled
Units constitute) (the " _Seller Holdings Units_ ") and (c) Seller shall
sell, transfer, convey, assign and deliver to Buyer, and Buyer shall purchase
from Seller, the Purchased Units, free and clear of all Liens other than
Securities Liens.

  



  

Section 2.2 _Purchase Price._ The aggregate consideration (to be delivered
in the manner described in _Section 2.6(c)(vii)(B)_ and  _Section
2.6(c)(vii)(C))_ for the Purchased Units shall be an aggregate amount equal
to the Initial Purchase Price plus the Rollover Class B Stock. The Initial
Purchase Price may be subject to adjustment after the Closing pursuant to
_Section 2.4_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, upon
delivering the aggregate consideration in the manner described in _Section
2.6(c)(vii)(B) _and _Section 2.6(c)(vii)(C) _and the consummation of the
Closing, ownership and title of the Purchased Units shall pass from Seller to
Buyer.

  

  

  



  

Section 2.3 _Estimated Closing Statement; Available Closing Date Equity;
Rolled Unit Value_.

  



  

  

(a)  _Estimated Closing Statement; Draft Payoff Letter_. At least five (5)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall prepare and deliver
to Buyer a statement (the " _Estimated Closing Statement_ ") setting forth
the Company's good faith estimate of: (i) Cash (the " _Estimated Cash_
"), (ii) Working Capital (the " _Estimated Working Capital_ "), (iii) the
aggregate amount of Indebtedness as of immediately prior to the Closing (the
" _Estimated Indebtedness_ ") and (iv) the aggregate amount of Transaction
Expenses (the " _Estimated Transaction Expenses_ ") and drafts of the Payoff
Letter. The Company shall consider, in good faith, any comments to the Payoff
Letters delivered by Buyer at least two (2) Business Days in advance of
closing. The Company shall revise the Estimated Closing Statement to
incorporate any reasonable and good faith comments of Buyer to the Estimated
Closing Statement provided to the Company at least two (2) Business Days prior
to the Closing Date.

  

  

  



  

(b) _Available Closing Date Equity; Rolled Unit Value; Debt to Equity Ratio_.
At least two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall
prepare and deliver to the Company and Seller a certificate, duly executed and
certified by an executive officer of Parent, setting forth in reasonable
detail Parent's good faith calculation (and attaching reasonable supporting
details to enable a review thereof by Seller) of Available Closing Date
Equity, Rolled Unit Value and the Debt to Equity Ratio.

  



  

   

16

 



    

  



  

 _Section 2.4 Post-Closing Adjustment_ _._

  



  

(a) Within ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, Parent shall deliver to
Seller a statement (the " _Closing Statement_ ") setting forth in reasonable
detail Parent's good faith calculation (and attaching reasonable supporting
schedules, working papers and other relevant details to enable a review
thereof by Seller) of the following items (each a " _Closing Item_ "): (i)
Cash (as finally determined pursuant to this _Section 2.4_, the " _Final
Cash_ "); (ii) Working Capital (as finally determined pursuant to this
_Section 2.4_, the " _Final Working Capital_ "); (iii) the aggregate amount
of Indebtedness as of immediately prior to the Closing (as finally determined
pursuant to this _Section 2.4_, the " _Final Indebtedness_ "); (iv) the
aggregate amount of Transaction Expenses (as finally determined pursuant to
this _Section 2.4_, the " _Final Transaction Expenses_ ") and (v) the
resulting calculation of the Final Purchase Price. For the avoidance of
doubt, there shall be no adjustment to the Rolled Unit Value. The Buyer Group
agrees that, following the Closing through the date that the Closing
Statement becomes conclusive and binding upon the Parties in accordance with
this _Section 2.4_, it will not (and will cause its Affiliates not to) take
any actions with respect to any books, records, policies or procedures on
which the Closing Statement is based or on which the Closing Statement is to
be based that are inconsistent with or that would impede or delay the
determination of the amount of the Final Cash, the Final Working Capital, the
Final Indebtedness, the Final Transaction Expenses or the preparation of the
Dispute Notice or the Closing Statement in the manner and utilizing the
methods required by this Agreement.

  



  

(b) Seller shall have forty-five (45) days after Seller's receipt of the
Closing Statement (the " _Review Period_ ") within which to review Parent's
calculation of the Closing Items. If Seller disputes any of the Closing Items,
Seller shall notify Parent in writing of its objection to such Closing
Item(s) within the Review Period, together with a description of the basis
for and dollar amount of such disputed items (to the extent possible) (and
attaching reasonable supporting details to enable a review thereof by Parent)
(a " _Dispute Notice_ "). The Closing Items, as set forth in the Closing
Statement, shall become final, conclusive and binding on the Parties unless
Seller delivers to Parent a Dispute Notice within the Review Period. If
Seller timely delivers a Dispute Notice, any amounts on the Closing Statement
not objected to by Seller in the Dispute Notice (or by Parent as a result of
the items disputed by Seller in any such Dispute Notice) shall be final,
conclusive and binding on the Parties, and Parent and Seller shall, within
thirty (30) days following Parent's receipt of such Dispute Notice (the "
_Resolution Period_ "), use reasonable best efforts to attempt to resolve in
writing their differences with respect to the matters set forth in the
Dispute Notice (and any matters with respect to the Closing Items which Parent
is disputing as a result of the matters set forth in the Dispute Notice, or
any disputed matters arising out of the foregoing), and any such resolution
shall be final, conclusive and binding on the Parties. If, at the conclusion
of the Resolution Period, any amounts remain in dispute, then each of Parent
and Seller shall promptly, and in any event, within ten (10) days, execute any
reasonable engagement letter requested by the Valuation Firm and submit all
items remaining in dispute to a nationally recognized accounting firm
mutually acceptable to Parent and Seller (the " _Valuation Firm_ ") for
resolution, acting as an accounting expert (and not as an arbitrator) and in
accordance with the standards set forth in this _Section 2.4_, by delivering,
within ten (10) days after engagement of the Valuation Firm, their written
position with respect to such items remaining in dispute. Parent and Seller
shall each cooperate fully with the Valuation Firm, including by using
reasonable best efforts to provide the information, data and work papers used
by each Party and its representatives (including accountants) to prepare
and/or calculate the Closing Items, making its personnel and accountants
available to explain any such information, data or work papers, so as to
enable the Valuation Firm to make such determination as quickly and as
accurately as practicable; _provided_ , that (i) each Party
shall substantially simultaneously provide the other party with a copy of all
materials provided to, and communications with, the Valuation Firm and (ii)
no Party (or any of its Affiliates, advisors or representatives) shall engage
in any _ex parte_ communications with the Valuation Firm as to any Closing
Items then in dispute. The Valuation Firm shall determine, based solely on the
submissions by or written communications with Seller and Parent, and not by
independent review, only those issues set forth in the Dispute Notice (and
those raised by Parent in response thereto) that remain in dispute and shall
determine a value for any such disputed item which is equal to or between the
final values proposed by Parent and Seller in their respective submissions.
The Parties shall request that the Valuation Firm make a decision with
respect to all disputed Closing Items within thirty (30) days after the
submissions of the Parties, as provided above, and in any event as promptly as
practicable. The final determination with respect to all disputed Closing
Items shall be set forth in a written statement by the Valuation Firm
delivered to Seller and Parent and shall be final, conclusive and binding on
the Parties except for manifest error. Judgment may be entered upon the
determination of the Valuation Firm in any court having jurisdiction over the
Party against which such determination is to be enforced. The fees and
expenses of the Valuation Firm incurred pursuant to this _Section 2.4(b)_
shall be borne by Seller, on the one hand, and Parent, on the other hand, in
inverse proportion to the Final Allocation made by such Valuation Firm of any
disputed Closing Items, such that the prevailing Party pays the lesser
proportion of such fees, costs and expenses. For example, if Seller claims
that the appropriate adjustments are one thousand dollars ($1,000) greater
than the amount determined by Parent and if the Valuation Firm ultimately
resolves the dispute by awarding to Seller seven hundred dollars ($700) of the
one thousand dollars ($1,000) disputed, then the fees, costs and expenses of
the Valuation Firm will be allocated seventy percent (70%) (i.e., 700 ÷
1,000) to Parent and thirty percent (30%) (i.e., 300 ÷ 1,000) to Seller.

  



  

   

17

 



    

  



  

(c) From and after Seller's receipt of the Closing Statement until the
Closing Items are finally determined pursuant to this _Section 2.4_, Seller,
its Affiliates and their auditors, accountants and other representatives shall
be, upon reasonable advance notice to Parent, permitted reasonable access
during normal business hours to the Atlas Companies and Parent and their
auditors, accountants, personnel, books and records and any other documents
or information reasonably requested by such Person relating to any item
properly raised in a Dispute Notice (including the information, data and work
papers used by Parent and/or the Atlas Companies' auditors or accountants to
prepare and calculate the Closing Items, but excluding information the
disclosure of which, Parent was advised by legal counsel in good faith, could
reasonably be expected to jeopardize any applicable privilege (including the
attorney client privilege) and, subject to such Person and their auditors,
accountants and other representatives entering into any such access letters
reasonably required).

  



  

(d) If the Final Purchase Price exceeds the Initial Purchase Price (such
excess amount, if any, the " _Excess Amount_ "), within three (3) Business
Days after the Final Purchase Price is finally determined pursuant to this
_Section 2.4_, Parent shall contribute the Excess Amount to Holdings and
cause Holdings to pay to Seller the Excess Amount, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, in accordance with the wire transfer instructions
designated in writing by Seller to Parent.

  



  

(e) If the Final Purchase Price is less than the Initial Purchase Price (such
shortfall amount, if any, the " _Shortfall Amount_ "), within three (3)
Business Days after the Final Purchase Price is finally determined pursuant to
this _Section 2.4_, at the election of the Seller in its sole discretion,
the Seller may either (i) surrender, for no additional consideration,
a number of both Holdings Common Units and Rollover Class B Stock (subject to
equitable adjustment for any split, dividend, distribution, combination,
reclassification, reorganization, recapitalization or similar) equal to the
quotient of (A) the remaining Shortfall Amount divided by (B) the Common
Stock Price or (ii) pay, or cause to be paid, to Holdings, and Holdings shall
distribute to Parent, the remaining Shortfall Amount, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, in accordance with the wire transfer
instructions provided in writing by Parent to Seller; _provided_ , that the
Seller may elect to pay such Shortfall Amount by means of more than one
(without duplication) of the foregoing _clauses (i)_ or _(ii)_ and may change
its election at any time prior to such payment or surrender.

  



  

(f) Any payments or surrender of Equity Interests, as applicable, made
pursuant to this _Section 2.4_ shall be deemed an adjustment to the Final
Purchase Price, to the extent permitted by applicable Law.

  



  

   

18

 



    

  



  

Section 2.5 _Closing Transactions_ _._ The closing of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place by
conference call and by exchange of signature pages by email or fax at 9:00
a.m. Central Time on (a) the third (3rd) Business Day after the conditions
set forth in _Section 2.6_ have been satisfied, or, if permissible, waived

which by their terms are required to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject
to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions) or (b) such other date as
the Parties mutually agree (the date upon which the Closing occurs, the "
_Closing Date_ "). The Closing shall be deemed effective for all purposes as

Section 5.15 _Financing_.  Parent has received and accepted: (a) an
executed commitment letter dated August 12, 2019 (as amended, modified,
supplemented, replaced or extended from time to time after the date of this
Agreement in compliance with _Section 6.17_, the " _Debt Commitment Letter_
") from the Debt Financing Sources party thereto (including any Debt Financing
Sources who become party thereto by joinder in accordance with the terms
thereof) pursuant to which the Debt Financing Sources have agreed,
subject solely to the terms and conditions thereof and expressly stated
therein, to provide (a) the debt amounts set forth therein which is the full
amount of the debt financing required to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (such debt financing, together with any
permitted Alternative Financing, the " _Committed Financing_ ") and which may
be reduced pursuant to _Section 6.1(d)(iii)_. Parent has delivered to
Seller true, complete and correct copies of the executed Commitment Letter
and any fee letters referred to in, or contemplated by, the Debt Commitment
Letter (with only fee amounts, pricing caps and other economic "market flex"
terms redacted, so long as such redaction does not cover terms that could
affect the conditionality, amount, timing, availability or termination of the
Committed Financing) (each as amended, modified, supplemented, replaced
or extended from time to time after the date of this Agreement in compliance
with _Section 6.17_, the " _Fee Letter_ "). Except as set forth in the
applicable Commitment Letter, there are no conditions precedent to the
obligations of the Debt Financing Sources to provide the Committed Financing
or any contingencies that would permit the Debt Financing Sources to reduce
the total amount of the Committed Financing. There are no other agreements,
side letters or arrangements relating to the Committed Financing to which
Parent or any of its Affiliates is a party that could impose conditions to the
funding of the Committed Financing, other than those set forth in Debt
Commitment Letters (or in the unredacted portions of the Fee Letter). As of
the date of this Agreement, Parent does not have any reason to believe that it
will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis all conditions to be satisfied by
it in the Debt Commitment Letter or the Fee Letter at the time it is required
to consummate the Closing hereunder. Except for any amendments (in compliance
with _Section 6.17_) delivered to Seller on or prior to the date of this
Agreement, neither of the Debt Commitment Letter nor the Fee Letter have been
modified, altered or amended on or prior to the date of this Agreement, nor,
to the Knowledge of Buyer, is any such amendment, modification, withdrawal,
termination or rescission currently contemplated or the subject of current
discussions. None of the commitments under the Debt Commitment Letter entered
into on or prior to the date hereof have been withdrawn, terminated or
rescinded prior to the date of this Agreement. Subject to its terms and
conditions, the Committed Financing, when funded in accordance with the Debt
Commitment Letter, will provide Buyer with acquisition financing proceeds on
the Closing Date sufficient, together with available cash of the Buyer
Group from sources other than the Committed Financing, to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including making all necessary
payments of fees and expenses in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby and both before and after giving effect to any "flex" provisions
contained in the Fee Letter). As of the date of this Agreement, the Debt
Commitment Letter is (as to the Buyer Group and to the Knowledge of Buyer,
the other parties thereto) valid, binding and in full force and effect and no
event has occurred that, with or without notice, lapse of time, or both, which
would reasonably be expected to constitute a default or breach or a failure
to satisfy a condition precedent on the part of Parent under the terms and
conditions of the Debt Commitment Letter, other than any such default, breach
or failure that has been irrevocably waived by the Debt Financing Sources, as
applicable, or otherwise cured in a timely manner by Parent to the
satisfaction of the Debt Financing Sources. As of the date of this Agreement,
the Buyer Group has paid in full any and all commitment fees or other fees
required to be paid pursuant to the terms of the Commitment Letters entered
into as of the date hereof or Fee Letter on or before the date of
this Agreement, and will pay in full any such amounts due on or before the
Closing Date.

organization or division thereof, or otherwise acquire or agree to acquire any
assets or Equity Interests, if the entering into of a definitive agreement
relating to, or the consummation of such acquisition, merger or consolidation

of any Governmental Entity necessary to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or the expiration or termination of any
applicable waiting period; (ii) materially increase the risk of any
Governmental Entity seeking or entering an Order prohibiting the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (iii) materially increase

would, or would reasonably be expected to, void, impair or otherwise
abrogate any of the coverages provided or made available pursuant to or under
the RandW Insurance Policy. The cost of obtaining the RandW Insurance Policy,
including all premiums and any related brokers fees, shall be paid by Parent

from or in connection with any breach or non-fulfillment of any covenant or
agreement of Seller under this Agreement to the extent requiring performance
after the Closing and the matters set forth in _Schedule 1.1(a)_.

  



  

(b) Parent, Holdings and Buyer shall jointly and severally indemnify the
Seller Indemnified Parties and save and hold each of them harmless from and
against and pay on behalf of or reimburse such Seller Indemnified Parties for
any Losses which any such Seller Indemnified Party may suffer as a result of,
arising from or in connection with any breach or non-fulfillment of any
covenant of any member of the Buyer Group or the Company under this Agreement
requiring performance after the Closing.

  



  

(c) Seller shall not be liable to any Buyer Indemnified Party for any Loss
pursuant to or arising under this Agreement to the extent that the aggregate
amount of all Losses indemnified by Seller exceeds the net proceeds received
by Seller hereunder.

  



  

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein:

  



  

(i) Losses in respect of which a Buyer Indemnified Party would otherwise be
entitled to indemnification shall be offset by any amounts or benefits
received (whether in the form of cash, credit or some other beneficial
arrangement) from any third party in respect of such Loss, including in
respect of any insurance proceeds, including pursuant to the RandW Insurance
Policy (net of any reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred
in obtaining such recovery, including any deductible under any
insurance policy or the retention under the terms of the RandW Insurance
Policy) (collectively, the " _Third-Party Recovery Proceeds_ "); and

  



  

   

61

 



    



  

(ii) the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall be deemed not to have suffered any
Loss arising from any Liability to the extent such Liability was explicitly
included in the determination of Working Capital, Indebtedness or Transaction
Expenses, as it is the intent of the Parties that the procedures set forth in
_Section 2.4_ shall provide the sole and exclusive remedy for such claims.

  



  

(e) To the extent required by applicable Law, each Buyer Indemnified Party
and each Seller Indemnified Party shall take reasonable best efforts to
mitigate any Loss upon becoming aware of any event, state of facts,
circumstances or developments which would reasonably be expected to, or does,
give rise thereto. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
with respect to any indemnification obligation of Seller, if coverage is
available, the Buyer Group must first seek full recovery under the RandW
Insurance Policy prior to seeking recovery from Seller.

  



  

(f) Any Person making a claim for indemnification under this _Section 6.5_
(an " _Indemnitee_ ") shall notify the indemnifying party (an " _Indemnitor_
") of the claim in writing after receiving written notice of any Proceeding
or other claim against it (if by a third party), describing the nature of the
claim, the amount thereof (if known and quantifiable) and the basis thereof;
_provided_ , that the failure to so notify an Indemnitor shall not relieve an
Indemnitor of its obligations hereunder, except to the extent that an
Indemnitor is materially prejudiced thereby. The Parties shall cooperate in
good faith to resolve any disputed claim for indemnification. Any Indemnitor
shall be entitled to participate in the defense of such Proceeding or other
claim giving rise to an Indemnitee's claim for indemnification at such
Indemnitor's expense, and at its option (subject to the limitations set forth
below) shall be entitled to assume the control of the defense thereof
by providing notice to the Indemnitee within thirty (30) days of receipt of
the notice described in the first sentence of this _Section 6.5(f)_ and in
connection therewith, by irrevocably acknowledging, admitting and agreeing to
fully indemnify the Indemnitee for all Losses relating to such claim for
indemnification, subject to the terms of this _Section 6.5_. If the
Indemnitor assumes the defense of such claim for indemnification, it shall
appoint counsel that is reasonably acceptable to the Indemnitee (which
the Parties hereby agree that KandE is reasonably acceptable counsel to Parent
and Winston and Strawn LLP is reasonably acceptable counsel to Seller) to be
the lead counsel in connection with such defense; _provided_ , that (i) the
Indemnitee shall be entitled to participate in the defense of such claim and
to employ counsel of its choice for such purpose if the fees and expenses of
such separate counsel are borne entirely by the Indemnitee; (ii) Seller shall
not be entitled to assume control of such defense if (A) the claim for
indemnification relates to or arises in connection with any criminal
Proceeding, (B) the claim primarily seeks an injunction or other equitable
relief against a Buyer Indemnified Party, (C) presents, under applicable
standards of professional conduct, a conflict on any significant issue
between the Indemnitee and the Indemnitor, (D) involves any customer or
supplier of the Indemnitee or any of their Affiliates and such claim could
reasonably be expected to materially impair such Indemnitee's or its
Affiliate's relationship with such customer or supplier, (E) in the
circumstances in which Seller is the Indemnitor, has a reasonable likelihood
of resulting in Losses that exceed the maximum amount of liability Seller
would have under this _Section 6.5_; and (iii) if an Indemnitor shall
control the defense of any such claim, such Indemnitor shall obtain the prior
written consent of the Indemnitee (which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed) before entering into any settlement of a claim; 
_provided_ , _however_ , subject to the limitations set forth in this _Section
6.5_, an Indemnitor may settle or consent to the entry of judgment in respect
of such claim without the consent of the Indemnitee, if such settlement or
judgment is for (x) money damages only, (y) includes a full and unconditional
release of the Indemnitee from any further Liability in respect of such claim
and (z) does not contain any admission of wrongdoing on the part of the
Indemnitee. The Indemnitee may take any actions reasonably necessary to
defend any third party claim prior to the time it receives notice from the
Indemnitor that it will assume the defense of such claim. If the Indemnitor
makes any payments on any claim pursuant to this _Section 6.5_, the
Indemnitor shall be subrogated, to the extent of such payment, to all rights
and remedies of the Indemnitee to any insurance benefits or other claims of
the Indemnitee with respect to such claim, including any claims against third
parties.

  



  

   

62

 



    



  

(g) For the avoidance of doubt, except in the case of Fraud, the Buyer
Indemnified Parties' sole and exclusive source of recovery for any Losses due
to a breach or misrepresentation of any representations of Seller or the
Company, in this Agreement or in any certificate or other agreement delivered
by Seller or the Company pursuant to this Agreement shall be recovery from
the insurance coverage provided by the RandW Insurance Policy, and in no event
will any Buyer Indemnified Party make a claim for indemnification pursuant to
this Agreement, including this _Section 6.5_, in respect of any Loss
resulting from any breach or misrepresentation of any representation or
warranty of Seller or the Company pursuant to this Agreement or any
certificate delivered by Seller or the Company pursuant to this Agreement.
Subject to the limitations set forth in this _Section 6.5_, to the extent
Seller is liable to any Buyer Indemnified Party for any indemnifiable Loss
pursuant to _Section 6.5(a)_, then the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall be
required to effect and discharge payment of such indemnifiable Loss within
three (3) Business Days after the final, binding determination thereof, at
the election of Seller in its sole discretion, Seller may either (i)
surrender, for no additional consideration, a number of Seller Holdings Units
and Rollover Class B Stock (subject to equitable adjustment for any split,
dividend, distribution, combination, reclassification, reorganization,
recapitalization or similar) equal to the quotient of (A) the amount of such
Loss _divided by_ (B) the Common Stock Price, or (ii) pay, or cause to be
paid, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the Buyer
Indemnified Party, the amount of such indemnifiable Loss (after taking
into account any recovery under the RandW Insurance Policy); _provided_ , that
Seller may elect to pay the amount of such indemnifiable Loss by means of
more than one (without duplication) of the foregoing _clauses (i)_ or _(ii)_
and may change its election at any time prior to such payment or surrender.

  



  

(h) To the extent that any Third-Party Recovery Proceeds are recovered by a
Buyer Indemnified Party after the related indemnification payment has been
made by Seller pursuant to this _Section 6.5_ for the same Loss, in order to
prevent any recovery of a Loss more than once in respect of the same Losses
suffered, such Buyer Indemnified Party shall pay over to Seller, in cash,
the amounts of such Third-Party Recovery Proceeds for which indemnification
payments have previously been made by Seller, promptly after such Third-Party
Recovery Proceeds are actually recovered, but not more than the amount of
indemnification payment made by Seller pursuant to this _Section 6.5_. If
permitted under the terms of the RandW Insurance Policy, in lieu of the
foregoing, such Buyer Indemnified Party may subrogate or assign its rights to
recover under the RandW Insurance Policy to Seller or its designee.

  



  

(i) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, for the
purposes of this _Section 6.5_, each representation and warranty in this
Agreement and the Schedules shall be read without regard and without giving
effect to the terms "material", "in all material respects", "Material Adverse
Effects" or similar phrases or qualifiers contained in such representation or
warranty (as if such words or phrases were deleted from such representation
and warranty).

  



  

(j) The representations and warranties of Seller and the Company, and any
Buyer Indemnified Party right to indemnification with respect thereto, shall
not be affected or deemed waived by reason of any investigation made by or on
behalf of any Buyer Indemnified Party or by reason of the fact that any Buyer
Indemnified Party knew, or should have known, that any such representation and
warranty was, or might be, inaccurate.

  



  

   

63

 



    



  

(k) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Seller hereby
agrees that no Seller Indemnified Party will be entitled to seek indemnity,
reimbursement or contribution from Parent, Holdings, Buyer or any Atlas
Company or any of their respective officers or directors for any indemnity or
other obligation for which Seller is liable to any Buyer Indemnified Party
under this Agreement.

  



  

(l) Except in the case of Fraud, the sole and exclusive remedy for any and
all claims against Seller arising under, out of, related to or in connection
with this Agreement, shall be the remedies provided in _Section 2.4_, the
rights of indemnification set forth in this _Section 6.5_ and, with respect
to any covenant or agreement, specific performance or other
equitable remedies, and no Person will have any other entitlement, remedy or
recourse, whether in Contract, tort or otherwise against Seller (other than
specific performance, injunction or other equitable relief pursuant to the
terms of _Section 8.10_), it being agreed that all of such other remedies,
entitlements and recourse are expressly waived and released by the Parties to
the fullest extent permitted by law (including claims arising under
Environmental Laws, including the Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation and Liability Act, 42 U.S.C. § 9601, _et seq_., as
amended). The provisions of this _Section 6.5(l)_ and the limited remedies
provided in _Section 2.4_ and _Section 6.5_ were specifically bargained for
by the Parties and were taken into account by them in arriving at the
Enterprise Value and the Rolled Unit Value and the terms and conditions of
this Agreement. No Party shall be entitled to a rescission of this Agreement
(or any related agreements) or any further indemnification rights or claims
of any nature whatsoever, all of which are hereby expressly waived by the
Parties to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law.

  



  

(m) All indemnification payments under this _Section 6.5_ shall be deemed
adjustments to the Final Purchase Price for all purposes, including for
income Tax purposes, to the extent permitted by applicable Law.

  



  

Section 6.6  _Certain Tax Matters_. 

  



  

(a) Seller shall prepare and file, or cause to be prepared and filed, at its
sole cost and expense, all Tax Returns for each Atlas Company which are due
on or prior to the Closing Date and all Pass-Through Tax Returns of any Atlas
Company for any taxable period ending on or prior to the Closing Date
(collectively, the " _Seller Prepared Returns_ "), and shall pay any Taxes
shown as due on any Seller Prepared Return to the applicable Taxing Authority.
Seller shall cause each Seller Prepared Return to be prepared in a manner
consistent with the Company's past practice. Each Seller Prepared Return due
after the Closing Date that needs to be filed by any Atlas Company shall be
submitted to Parent for review and approval no later than thirty (30) days
prior to the due date for filing such Tax Return (taking into account
applicable extensions). Seller shall incorporate all reasonable comments
received from Parent no later than ten (10) days prior to the due date for
filing any such Tax Return (taking into account applicable extensions).
Parent shall cause the Atlas Companies to file all such Seller Prepared
Returns prepared by Seller and timely delivered to Parent in accordance with
this _Section 6.6(a)_. No Seller Prepared Return may be amended after the
Closing without the prior written consent of Parent. Parent shall prepare and
file, or cause to be prepared and filed, all Tax Returns of the Atlas
Companies (other than Seller Prepared Returns) for any Straddle Period that
are required to be filed after the Closing Date (the " _Parent Prepared
Returns_ "). Parent shall cause each Parent Prepared Return that is a Pass-
Through Tax Return to be prepared applying the "interim closing method" under
Section 706 of the Code (and any similar provision of state or local Law) and
in a manner consistent with the Company's past practice (provided that
any Pass-Through Tax Return for the Atlas Partnership Entities shall include
an election under Section 754 of the Code (or similar provision of any state,
local or non-U.S. jurisdiction) for the year including the Closing Date) and
deliver a copy of each such Tax Return to Seller for review and approval no
later than thirty (30) days prior to the due date for filing such Tax Return
(taking into account applicable extensions). Parent shall incorporate all
reasonable comments received from Seller no later than ten (10) days prior to
the due date for filing any such Tax Return (taking into account applicable
extensions). Notwithstanding any other provision of this _Section 6.6(a)_,
Seller, at its sole cost and expense, shall be solely responsible for filing
all of the Tax Returns required to be filed by Seller and paying all of the
Taxes due and owing by Seller (including to the extent attributable to income
of any Atlas Company that flows up to Seller).

  



  

   

64

 



    



  

(b) For purposes of determining whether the following Taxes are attributable
to a Pre-Closing Tax Period:

  



  

(i) in the case of property Taxes and other similar Taxes imposed for a
Straddle Period, the amounts that are allocable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period
shall be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire taxable period
multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days in the
taxable period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the
number of days in such Straddle Period;

  



  

(ii) in the case of Taxes in the form of interest or penalties, all such
Taxes shall be treated as attributable to a Pre-Closing Tax Period to the
extent relating to a Tax for a Pre-Closing Tax Period whether such items are
incurred, accrued, assessed or similarly charged on, before or after the
Closing Date;

  



  

(iii) in the case of Taxes imposed on any Atlas Company (or any other Buyer
Indemnified Party as a result of its direct or indirect ownership of an Atlas
Company) as a result of income of any Flow-Thru Entity realized on or prior to
the Closing Date (such income being computed assuming the Flow-Thru Entity
had a year that ends on the Closing Date and closed its books), such Taxes
shall be treated as Taxes of an Atlas Company for a Pre-Closing Tax Period;

  



  

(iv) in the case of Taxes imposed on any Atlas Company with respect to the
payment of any Transaction Expenses, such Taxes shall be treated as Taxes of
an Atlas Company for a Pre-Closing Tax Period; and

  



  

(v) in the case of all other Taxes for a Straddle Period (including Taxes
based on or measured by income, receipts, payments, or payroll (to the extent
not covered by (iv) above)), the amount allocable to the Pre-Closing Tax
Period shall be determined based on an interim closing of the books as of the
close of business on the Closing Date using a "closing of the books"
methodology;  _provided_ , that for purposes of this _clause (v)_ , any item
determined on an annual or periodic basis (including amortization and
depreciation deductions and the effects of graduated rates) shall be allocated
to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date based on the
mechanics set forth in _clause (i)_ for periodic Taxes.

  



  

(c) Parent shall notify Seller of receipt by any Atlas Company of a written
notice of any pending or threatened Tax audit, assessment, litigation or
other Proceeding if such audit, assessment, litigation or other Proceeding is
with respect to Taxes with respect to any Pass-Through Tax Returns of any
Atlas Company for any Pre-Closing Tax Period (" _Tax Contest_ "). No
failure or delay of Parent in the performance of the foregoing shall reduce
or otherwise affect the obligations or liabilities of Seller pursuant to this
Agreement except to the extent Seller is materially prejudiced thereby. Seller
shall, at its own expense, control any Tax Contest relating to a Seller
Prepared Return that is a Pass-Through Tax Return (a " _Seller Tax Contest_
"),  _provided_ that (i) Seller shall keep Parent reasonably informed
regarding the status of such Tax Contest; (ii) Seller shall control the Tax
Contests diligently and in good faith; (iii) Parent shall have the right to
participate in such Tax Contest; (iv) Seller shall not settle, resolve or
abandon the Tax Contest (or any portion thereof) without the prior written
consent of Parent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed) and (v) Seller shall bear all costs and expenses of Seller and
all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses of the Atlas Companies in
controlling such Tax Contest. Parent shall control any Tax Contests that are
not Seller Tax Contests (" _Parent Tax Contest_ "). Seller shall have the
right to participate in any Parent Tax Contest. Parent shall not settle any
Parent Tax Contest without the prior written consent of Seller (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).
Notwithstanding anything in the Agreement to the contrary, in case of any
conflict between this _Section 6.6(c)_ and _Section 6.5(f)_ with respect to
any Tax Contest, this _Section 6.6(c)_ shall govern with respect to such Tax
Contest.

  



  

   

65

 



    



  

(d) Each Party shall cooperate (and cause its Affiliates to cooperate) fully,
as and to the extent reasonably requested by each other Party, in connection
with the preparation and filing of Tax Returns pursuant to _Section 6.6(d)_
and any audit or other Proceeding with respect to Taxes or Tax Returns of any
Atlas Company (whether or not a Tax Contest). Such cooperation shall include
the provision of records and information which are reasonably relevant to any
such audit or other Proceeding and making employees available on a mutually
convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any
material provided hereunder. Following the Closing, Parent agrees to retain
all books and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the
Atlas Companies relating to any taxable period beginning before the Closing
Date until the expiration of the statute of limitations (and, to the extent
notified by Seller, any extensions thereof) of the respective taxable periods,
and to abide by all record retention agreements entered into with any Taxing
Authority. Each Party shall furnish the other Parties with copies of all
relevant correspondence received from any Taxing Authority in connection with
any Tax audit or information request with respect to any Taxes for which the
other may have an indemnification obligation under this Agreement. Each Party
shall (and shall cause its Affiliates to) provide certificates or forms, and
timely execute any Tax Return, that are necessary or appropriate to establish
an exemption for (or reduction in) any Transfer Tax. Seller shall (and shall
cause its Affiliates to) provide any information reasonably requested, at
Parent's sole cost and expense, to allow Parent or any Atlas Company to
comply with any information reporting or withholding requirements contained
in the Code or other applicable Laws or to compute the amount of payroll or
other employment Taxes due with respect to any payment made in connection
with this Agreement.

  



  

(e) All transfer, documentary, sales, use, value added, goods and services,
stamp, registration, notarial fees and other similar Taxes and fees
(collectively, " _Transfer Taxes_ "), shall be paid fifty percent (50%) by the
Buyer Group, on the one hand, and fifty percent (50%) by Seller, on the other
hand. Each Atlas Company will file all necessary Tax Returns and
other documentation with respect to all such Transfer Taxes, and, if required
by applicable Law, Seller and Parent will, and will cause their respective
Affiliates to, cooperate and join in the execution of any such Tax Returns and
other documentation.

  



  

(f) The Parties agree, for U.S. federal income Tax purposes, unless otherwise
required by a determination within the meaning of Section 1313 of the Code,
(i) to treat the contribution of the Units to Buyer by Seller in exchange for
Holdings Common Units, Class B Common Stock, and the Final Purchase Price
pursuant to this Agreement as a transaction described in Section 721 of
the Code, except to the extent Section 707 of the Code applies (including
because any portion of the Final Purchase Price does not qualify as a
reimbursement of preformation capital expenditures within the meaning of U.S.
Treasury Regulations Section 1.707-4(d)) (such reimbursements, the " _CapEx
Reimbursement_ ") and (ii) that neither the Class B Common Stock nor the
right to redeem or exchange Holdings Common Units contemplated by the
operating agreement of Holdings shall be treated as having a fair market
value greater than zero dollars ($0) (the " _Intended Tax Treatment_ ").
Within thirty (30) days after the determination of the Final Purchase Price
pursuant to _Section 2.4_, (A) Parent will prepare, and deliver to
Seller, an allocation statement allocating the Final Purchase Price and any
other amounts treated as consideration for U.S. federal income Tax purposes
(the " _Aggregate Consideration_ ") among the assets of the Atlas Companies
that are classified as entities that are disregarded as separate from Seller
(prior to the Closing) or that are treated as partnerships for U.S.
federal income Tax purposes, in each case, in accordance with Section 1060 of
the Code (and any other applicable section of the Code), the Treasury
Regulations thereunder (and any similar provision of state or local Law) and
the methodologies set forth on _Schedule 6.6(f)_ (the " _Proposed Allocation_
") and (B) Seller will prepare, and deliver to Parent, a schedule
setting forth the portion of the Final Purchase Price that qualifies as a
CapEx Reimbursement along with reasonably detailed supporting schedules (the
" _Proposed CapEx Schedule_ "). Within fifteen (15) days after the receipt of
the Proposed CapEx Schedule and Proposed Allocation, the receiving Party will
propose any changes or will indicate its concurrence therewith; _provided_
 that Parent may not propose any increase to the amount of CapEx
Reimbursement proposed by Seller in the Proposed CapEx Schedule. If Parent
and Seller do not agree with the Proposed CapEx Schedule or Proposed
Allocation, then Parent and Seller shall attempt in good faith to reach
agreement on the amount of the CapEx Reimbursement or the allocation of the
Aggregate Consideration, as applicable, in a manner consistent with
applicable income Tax Law. If Parent and Seller cannot reach agreement on the
amount of the CapEx Reimbursement or such allocation within fifteen (15) days
after Parent's receipt of Seller's proposed changes, then the Valuation Firm
shall determine the allocation or the amount of CapEx Reimbursement, as
applicable, under the procedures for resolving disputes as set forth in
_Section 2.4(b)_ (including the provisions thereof regarding fees and
expenses);  _provided_ that the Valuation Firm may not determine that the
amount of CapEx Reimbursement exceeds the amount proposed by Seller in the
Proposed CapEx Schedule. The allocation of the Final Purchase Price among the
assets of the Atlas Companies and the amount of the CapEx Reimbursement, as
agreed to by Parent and Seller or as finally determined by the Valuation Firm,
as the case may be, shall be binding on all Parties (the " _Final Allocation_
" and the " _Final CapEx Schedule_ ", respectively). Parent and Seller shall,
and shall cause each applicable Affiliate to: (1) file all Tax Returns for
income Taxes consistent with the Final CapEx Schedule, Final Allocation and
Intended Tax Treatment; (2) promptly inform each other of any challenge by
any Governmental Entity to the Final CapEx Schedule, Final Allocation or
Intended Tax Treatment; and (3) consult with and keep one another informed
with respect to the status of, and any discussion, proposal or submission with
respect to, any challenge to the Final CapEx Schedule, Final Allocation or
Intended Tax Treatment; _provided_ , that, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, the Parties shall make appropriate adjustments to the Final
Allocation and Final CapEx Schedule to reflect any adjustments to the Final
Purchase Price as a result of any indemnification payments pursuant to
_Section 6.5_.

  



  

   

66

 



    



  

(g) Subject to the final sentence of this _Section 6.6(g)_, Seller will be
entitled to any Tax refunds that are received by Parent or any Atlas Company,
and any amounts credited against Tax to which Parent and any Atlas Company
become entitled, in any Post-Closing Tax Period that relate to any Pre-
Closing Tax Period (other than refunds of Transfer Taxes, which shall be
allocated in the same manner as Transfer Taxes are allocated under _Section
6.6(e)_). Parent will pay, or cause to be paid, over to Seller any such
refund or the amount of any such credit within ten (10) Business Days after
receipt of such refund (or, if the refund is in the form of a credit against
Taxes, ten (10) Business Days after filing the Tax Return claiming such
credit), net of (i) any Taxes of any Atlas Company, Parent or any other Buyer
Indemnified Party with respect to such payment; (ii) any Taxes any Atlas
Company, Parent or any other Buyer Indemnified Party incurs with respect to
the receipt of such refund and (iii) any reasonable out-of-pocket expenses
that Parent, any Atlas Company or any of their Affiliates incur with respect
to such refund. Parent will, and will cause each Atlas Company to, timely
file a claim for a refund of any Taxes paid with respect to any Pre-
Closing Tax Period if reasonably requested by Seller. Nothing in this
_Section 6.6(g)_ shall require that Parent or any Atlas Company make any
payment with respect to any refund for a Tax (and such refunds shall be for
the benefit of Parent and the Atlas Companies) that is with respect to (A)
any refund of Tax that is the result of the carrying back of any Tax attribute
or Tax credit incurred in a Post-Closing Tax Period; (B) any refund of Tax
paid after the Closing Date to the extent Parent or the applicable Atlas
Company has not been indemnified for such Taxes; (C) any refund for Tax that
is reflected as a current asset (or offset to a current liability) on the
Final Working Capital, as finally determined; or (D) any refund for Tax that
gives rise to a payment obligation by any Atlas Company to any Person under
applicable Law or pursuant to a provision of a contract or other
agreement entered (or assumed) by any Atlas Company on or prior to the
Closing Date.

  



  

Section 6.7  _Press Release; SEC Filings_. 

  

  



  

(a) Any press or other public release or announcement concerning the
transactions contemplated hereby shall not be issued without the consent of
each of Parent and Seller, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that each Party may make
any such announcement which it in good faith believes is necessary or
advisable in connection with any required Law and; _provided_ , _further_ ,
that each Party and its Affiliates may make non-public
announcements regarding this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby to their and their Affiliates' respective directors,
officers, employees, direct and indirect limited partners and investors
without the consent of Parent or Seller so long as such Persons are bound by
obligations of confidentiality in respect of any such information disclosed to
them.

  



  

(b) As promptly as practicable, Parent shall prepare and file a Current
Report on Form 8-K pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act to report the
execution of this Agreement (the " _Signing Form 8-K_ ") and the Parties shall
issue a mutually agreeable press release announcing the execution of this
Agreement (the " _Signing Press Release_ "). Parent shall provide the Company
with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Signing Form 8-K
prior to its filing and shall consider such comments in good faith.

  



  

(c) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the date hereof but in any
event following delivery of any information required to be delivered pursuant
to this Agreement by the Atlas Companies, Parent and the Company shall prepare
and Parent shall file with the SEC a preliminary Proxy Statement, which shall
comply as to form, in all material respects, with, as applicable, the
provisions of the Securities Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder, for the purpose of soliciting proxies from Parent
Stockholders to vote at the Parent Stockholder Meeting in favor of the Parent
Stockholder Voting Matters. Parent shall file the definitive Proxy Statement
with the SEC and cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to its stockholders of
record, as of the record date to be established by the Parent Board, within
three (3) Business Days of (i) in the event the preliminary Proxy
Statement is not reviewed by the SEC, the expiration of the waiting period in
Rule 14a-6(a) under the Securities Exchange Act or (ii) in the event the
preliminary Proxy Statement is reviewed by the SEC, receipt of oral or written
notification of the completion of the review by the SEC.

  



  

(d) Prior to filing with the SEC, Parent will make available to Seller drafts
of the Proxy Statement and any other documents to be filed with the SEC, both
preliminary and final, and drafts of any amendment or supplement to the Proxy
Statement or such other document and will provide Seller with a reasonable
opportunity to comment on such drafts and shall consider such comments in
good faith. Parent will advise Seller promptly after it receives notice
thereof, of (i) the time when the Proxy Statement has been filed, (ii) in the
event the preliminary Proxy Statement is not reviewed by the SEC, the
expiration of the waiting period in Rule 14a-6(a) under the Securities
Exchange Act, (iii) in the event the preliminary Proxy Statement is reviewed
by the SEC, receipt of oral or written notification of the completion of the
review by the SEC, (iv) the filing of any supplement or amendment to the
Proxy Statement, (v) any request by the SEC for amendment of the Proxy
Statement, (vi) any comments, written or oral, from the SEC relating to the
Proxy Statement and responses thereto and (vii) requests by the SEC for
additional information in connection with the Proxy Statement. Parent and
Seller shall cooperate to promptly respond to any comments of the SEC on the
Proxy Statement, and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to have the
Proxy Statement cleared by the SEC under the Securities Exchange Act as soon
after filing as practicable.

  



  

   

67

 



    



  

(e) If at any time prior to Parent Stockholders Meeting the Parties discover
or become aware of any information that should be set forth in an amendment
or supplement to the Proxy Statement so that the Proxy Statement would not
include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading, Parent shall promptly transmit to
its stockholders an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement containing
such information.

  



  

(f) The Parties acknowledge that a substantial portion of the Proxy Statement
and certain other forms, reports and other filings required to be made by
Parent under the Securities Exchange Act in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (collectively, " _Additional Parent Filings_

(c) Seller, each member of the Buyer Group and the Company specifically
acknowledge that they are aware of the California Civil Code Section 1542,

Section 6.11  _Directors and Officers_.

  



  

(a) Parent acknowledges that (i) each Person that prior to the Closing served
as a director, officer, manager, employee, agent, trustee or fiduciary of any
Atlas Company or who, at the request of any Atlas Company, served as a
director, officer, manager, member, employee, agent, trustee or fiduciary of
another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, pension or other

Provisions_"), (ii) such DandO Provisions are rights of Contract and (iii) for
a period of six (6) years following the Closing Date, no amendment or
modification to any such DandO Provisions shall affect in any manner the

70

and with substantially the same coverage and amounts as, and contain terms and
conditions no less advantageous than, in the aggregate, the coverage
currently provided by such current policy; and

  



  

(ii) At or prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall purchase and maintain
in effect for a period of six (6) years thereafter, "run-off" coverage as
provided by any Atlas Company's fiduciary and employee benefit policies, in
each case, covering those Persons who are covered on the date hereof by such
policies and with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that
are no less advantageous than the coverage provided under any Atlas Company's
existing policies (the policies contemplated by the foregoing _clauses (i)_
and _(ii)_ , collectively, the " _Tail Policy_ "). The cost of the Tail
Policy shall be borne 50% by Seller and 50% by the Buyer Group. No claims made

written consent of Seller.

  



  

Section 6.12  _Access to Books and Records_. From and after the Closing,
Buyer Group and their Affiliates shall make or cause to be made available to
Seller (at Seller's sole expense) all books, records, Tax Returns and
documents of any Atlas Company (and the assistance of employees responsible
for such books, records and documents) during regular business hours as may
be reasonably necessary for (a) investigating, settling, preparing for the
defense or prosecution of, defending or prosecuting any Proceeding (other than
an actual or potential Proceeding (i) brought or threatened to be brought by
Seller or its Affiliates relating to or arising under this Agreement or (ii)
brought or threatened to be brought by any member of the Buyer Group or their
Affiliates against Seller of its Affiliate relating to or arising under this
Agreement), (b) preparing reports to Governmental Entities or (c) such other
purposes (that do not involve an actual or potential Proceeding brought by

Tax Returns, pursuing Tax refunds or responding to or disputing any Tax audit.
Parent shall (at its sole expense) cause each Atlas Company to maintain and
preserve all such Tax Returns, books, records and other documents for the
greater of (i) six (6) years after the Closing Date and (ii) any applicable
statutory or regulatory retention period, as the same may be extended and, in
each case, shall offer to transfer such records to Seller, at the end of any
such period. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Parent shall
not be required to provide any access or information to Seller, their
Affiliates or any of their respective representatives which Parent reasonably
believes it or, after the Closing, any Atlas Company are prohibited from
providing to Seller, their Affiliates or their respective representatives by
reason of applicable Law, which, for the avoidance of doubt, (A) constitutes
or allows access to information protected by attorney-client privilege, or
which Parent or any Atlas Company are required to keep confidential or (B)
could prevent access by reason of a Contract with a third party or which would
otherwise expose Parent, any of its Affiliates (including, after the Closing,
any Atlas Company) to a material risk of Liability.

Section 6.13  _Insurance_. Buyer Group shall be solely responsible from and

business for events or occurrences occurring after the Closing. Buyer Group
acknowledges that all insurance arrangements maintained by Seller and

Companies and their Affiliates, if any, will be terminated as of the Closing
and no further business interruption, property or Liability shall be covered
under any such insurance arrangements.

  



  

Section 6.14  _Employee Matters_. During the period beginning on the Closing
Date and ending on December 31, 2019, Parent shall, or shall cause the Atlas
Companies to, provide each employee of the Atlas Companies (" _Continuing
Employees_ ") with salary or wage rate and cash bonus
opportunities (excluding equity compensation) that are substantially similar
in the aggregate to the salary or wage rate and cash bonus
opportunities (excluding equity compensation) in effect for such Continuing
Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date and employee benefits that are
at least substantially comparable in the aggregate to the benefits provided
under the Company Employee Benefit Plans, any applicable collective
bargaining agreement and any other benefit plans, programs or arrangements
available to such Continuing Employee as of the Closing Date; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that for those Continuing Employees whose terms and conditions of
employment are governed by a collective bargaining agreement, such employees'
terms and conditions of employment shall continue to be so governed.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, subject to any applicable employment
agreements, including those Contracts set forth on _Schedule 6.14_ and all
obligations of the "Company" thereunder which the Buyer Group hereby
expressly assumes, the Continuing Employees employment will continue on an
at-will basis. Parent further agrees that, from and after the Closing Date,
Parent shall, or shall cause the Atlas Companies to grant each Continuing
Employee with credit for any and all service with the Atlas Companies (and
any predecessor thereof) earned prior to the Closing Date (a) for eligibility
and vesting purposes and (b) for purposes of vacation and paid time off
accrual and severance benefit determinations under each benefit or
compensation plan, program, agreement or arrangement that may be established
or maintained by Parent, any Atlas Company or any of its or
their Subsidiaries on or after the Closing Date (the " _New Plans_ "). In
addition, Parent hereby agrees that Parent shall, or shall cause the Atlas
Companies to, (i) cause to be waived all pre-existing condition exclusion and
actively-at-work requirements and similar limitations, eligibility waiting
periods and evidence of insurability requirements under any New Plans to the
extent waived or satisfied by a Continuing Employee under any Company Employee
Benefit Plan as of the Closing Date and (ii) cause any deductible, co-
insurance and out-of-pocket covered expenses paid on or before the Closing
Date by any Continuing Employee (or covered dependent thereof) to be taken
into account for purposes of satisfying applicable deductible,
coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket provisions after the Closing Date under
any applicable New Plan in the year of initial participation. Nothing
contained herein, express or implied, is intended to confer any rights
(including any third-party beneficiary rights), remedies or claims upon any
employee of any Atlas Company, any Continuing Employee or any other Person,
other than the Parties to this Agreement, or shall constitute an amendment to
or any other modification of any New Plan or Company Employee Benefit
Plan. Parent agrees and acknowledges that all collective bargaining
agreements in effect at any of the Atlas Companies as of the Closing Date
will continue in effect after the Closing Date in accordance with their terms
and with applicable Law. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein,
Parent and the Atlas Companies shall be solely responsible for any obligations
arising under Section 4980B of the Code with respect to all "MandA qualified
beneficiaries" as defined in Treasury Regulation Section
54.4980B-9. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
subject to any applicable employment agreements, it is understood and agreed
that Parent retains the right to terminate any employee at any time for any
reason.

Section 6.15  _Investigation by Parent; No Other Representations; Non-
Reliance of Parent_. Parent has substantial familiarity with the businesses
of the Atlas Companies and fully understand the risks inherent
therewith. Furthermore, Parent (for itself and on behalf of the Buyer
Indemnified Parties and its Affiliates, representatives and
financing sources), has conducted an independent investigation, verification,
review and analysis of the business, operations, assets, Liabilities, results
of operations, financial condition, technology and prospects of the Atlas
Companies and Parent, its Affiliates and their advisors and representatives
have had access to the personnel, properties, premises and records of the
Atlas Companies for such purpose. In entering into this Agreement and any
other Contract or certificate executed and delivered pursuant to this
Agreement, Parent has relied solely upon the aforementioned investigation,
review and analysis and not on any factual representations or opinions of the
Atlas Companies or Seller or any Atlas Company's or Seller's employees,
directors, managers, officers, representatives or any other Person, and,
except for the specific representations and warranties expressly made by
Seller and the Company in _Article III_ or Seller in _Article IV_ (in each
case, as modified by the Disclosure Schedules) and any other Contract or
certificate executed and delivered pursuant to this Agreement, Parent (for
itself and on behalf of the Buyer Indemnified Parties and its Affiliates,
representatives and financing sources): (a) specifically acknowledges
that none of the Atlas Companies, Seller or any other Person is making and
has not made any representation or warranty, expressed or implied, at law or
in equity, in respect of Seller, any Atlas Company or any Atlas Company's
businesses, assets, risks and other incidents of the Atlas Companies,
Liabilities, operations, prospects or condition (financial or otherwise),
including with respect to merchantability or fitness for any particular
purpose of any assets and whether the Atlas Companies possess sufficient real
property or personal property to operate their businesses, the nature or
extent of any Liabilities, the prospects of the business, the effectiveness
or the success of any operations, or the accuracy or completeness of any
confidential information memoranda, documents, projections, material or other
information (financial or otherwise) regarding the Atlas Companies
furnished to Parent or its Affiliates or their advisors or representatives or
made available to Parent, its Affiliates or their advisors or representatives
in any data rooms, management presentations or in any other form in
expectation of, or in connection with, the transactions contemplated hereby,
and the Units are being transferred through the sale of the Units "as is,
where is, with all faults"; (b) specifically disclaims that it is relying
upon or has relied upon any such other representations or warranties that may
have been made by any Person, and acknowledges that the Atlas Companies,
Seller and their Affiliates hereby specifically disclaim any such other
representation or warranty made by any Person; (c) specifically disclaims any
obligation or duty by the Atlas Companies, Seller or any of their Affiliates
or any other Person to make any disclosures of fact not required to be
disclosed pursuant to the specific representations and warranties set forth in
_Article III_ and _Article IV_; (d) specifically acknowledges Parent is
entering into this Agreement and acquiring the Units subject only to the
specific representations and warranties set forth in _Article III_ and
_Article IV_ as further limited by the specifically bargained for exclusive
remedies as set forth in _Section 6.5_; and (e) specifically acknowledges
that the sole purpose of the representations and warranties set forth in this
Agreement is to allocate financial responsibility pursuant to (and subject to
the limitations set forth in) _Section 6.5_ should the representations and
warranties prove to have been inaccurate and result in provable Losses, and
no other rights, remedies or causes of action (whether in law or in equity or
whether in Contract or in tort) are permitted to any Person as a result of
the misrepresentation or breach of any such representation and
warranty. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (i) no Atlas
Company nor Seller makes any representation or warranty regarding any third
party beneficiary rights or other rights which Parent might claim under any
studies, reports, tests or analyses prepared by any third parties for any
Atlas Company or any of their Affiliates, even if the same were made available
for review by Parent or its Affiliates or representatives; and (ii) none of
the documents, information or other materials provided to Parent at any time
or in any format by any Atlas Company, Seller or any of their Affiliates or
representatives constitute legal advice, and Parent waives all rights to
assert that it received any legal advice from any Atlas Company, Seller or any
of their Affiliates, or any of their respective representatives or counsel,
or that it had any sort of attorney-client relationship with any of
such Persons.

Section 6.16  _No Recourse_. Notwithstanding anything that may be expressed
or implied in this Agreement (except in the case of the immediately succeeding
sentence) or any document, agreement, or instrument delivered
contemporaneously herewith, and notwithstanding the fact that any Party may be
a partnership or limited liability company, each Party hereto, by its
acceptance of the benefits of this Agreement, covenants, agrees and
acknowledges that no Persons other than the Parties shall have any obligation
hereunder and that it has no rights of recovery hereunder against, and no
recourse hereunder or under any documents, agreements, or instruments
delivered contemporaneously herewith or in respect of any oral
representations made or alleged to be made in connection herewith or therewith
shall be had against, any former, current or future director, officer, agent,
Affiliate, manager, assignee, incorporator, controlling Person,
fiduciary, representative or employee of any Party (or any of their
successors or permitted assignees), against any former, current, or
future general or limited partner, manager, stockholder or member of any
Party (or any of their successors or permitted assignees) or any Affiliate
thereof or against any former, current or future director, officer, agent,
employee, Affiliate, manager, assignee, incorporator, controlling Person,
fiduciary, representative, general or limited partner, stockholder, manager or
member of any of the foregoing, but in each case not including the Parties
(each, but excluding for the avoidance of doubt, the Parties, a " _Non-
Party Affiliate_ "), whether by or through attempted piercing of the
corporate veil, by or through a claim (whether in tort, Contract or
otherwise) by or on behalf of such party against the Non-Party Affiliates, by
the enforcement of any assessment or by any Proceeding, or by virtue of any
statute, regulation or other applicable Law, or otherwise; it being expressly
agreed and acknowledged that no personal Liability whatsoever shall attach
to, be imposed on, or otherwise be incurred by any Non-Party Affiliate, as
such, for any obligations of the applicable party under this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, under any documents or instruments
delivered contemporaneously herewith, in respect of any oral representations
made or alleged to be made in connection herewith or therewith, or for any
claim (whether in tort, Contract or otherwise) based on, in respect of, or by
reason of, such obligations or their creation. Notwithstanding the forgoing,
a Non-Party Affiliate may have obligations under any documents,
agreements, or instruments delivered contemporaneously herewith or otherwise
contemplated by this Agreement if such Non-Party Affiliate is party to such
document, agreement or instrument. Except to the extent otherwise expressly
set forth in, and subject in all cases to the terms and conditions of and
limitations herein, this Agreement may only be enforced against, and any claim
or cause of action of any kind based upon, arising out of, or related to this
Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement,
may only be brought against the entities that are expressly named as Parties
hereto and then only with respect to the specific obligations set forth
herein with respect to such Party. Each Non-Party Affiliate is expressly
intended as a third-party beneficiary of this _Section 6.16_.

  



  

Section 6.17  _Financing._

  



  

(a) During the Pre-Closing Period, Parent may execute Subscription Agreements
with Equity Investors.

  



  

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, during the Pre-
Closing Period, Parent shall use, and shall cause its Affiliates to use, its
reasonable best efforts to obtain the proceeds of the Financing on the terms
and conditions described in the Commitment Letters, including using
reasonable best efforts to (i) negotiate definitive agreements with respect to
the Committed Financing (the " _Definitive Debt Agreements_ ") consistent
with the terms and conditions contained in the Debt Commitment Letter, (ii)
satisfy (or, if deemed advisable by Parent, obtain the waiver of) on a timely
basis all conditions in the Subscription Agreements, Debt Commitment Letter,
Fee Letter and such Definitive Debt Agreements that are within its control
(including payment of all fees and expenses) and comply with its
obligations thereunder, (iii) maintain in effect the Subscription Agreements,
Debt Commitment Letter and Fee Letter in accordance with their terms and (iv)
diligently enforce all of its rights under the Subscription Agreements and
Debt Commitment Letter (and any definitive agreements related thereto),
_provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall not be required to bring any
enforcement action against any Equity Financing Sources or Debt Financing
Source to enforce its rights under the applicable Financing. Parent shall not
and shall cause its Affiliates not to take or refrain from taking, directly or
indirectly, any action that could reasonably be expected to result in a
default under or failure of any of the conditions contained in, or materially
impair, delay or prevent consummation of the Financing contemplated by the
Subscription Agreements and the Debt Commitment Letter or in any Definitive
Debt Agreement related to the Committed Financing.

  



  

   

74

 



    



  

(c) Subject to the terms hereof, Parent shall use, and shall cause its
Affiliates to use, reasonable best efforts to comply with its obligations,
and enforce its rights, under the Commitment Letters. Parent shall give Seller
prompt notice of any material breach by any party to the Commitment Letters
of which Parent has become aware or any termination (or alleged or purported
termination) of the Commitment Letters. Parent shall keep Seller informed on
a reasonably current basis in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts
to obtain the proceeds of the Financing and shall not permit any amendment or
modification to, or any waiver of any material provision or remedy under, the
Commitment Letters entered into at or prior to the date hereof if such
amendment, modification, waiver or remedy (i) would materially delay the
occurrence of the Closing, (ii) reduces the aggregate amount of the
Financing, (iii) adds or imposes new conditions or amends the existing
conditions to the drawdown of the Financing or (iv) is adverse to
the interests of Seller, in each case, in any material respect.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, failure to obtain the Cash Equity shall not
relieve Parent of its obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, whether or not the Cash Equity is available.

  



  

(d) In the event that any portion of the Committed Financing becomes
unavailable on the terms and conditions (including any "flex provisions")
contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter and the Fee Letter, regardless of
the reason therefor, and such portion of the Committed Financing is required
to fund the transactions contemplated by this Agreement on the Closing Date,
Parent will (i) as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such
event, use its reasonable best efforts to obtain alternative financing (the "
_Alternative Financing_ ") (in an amount sufficient, when taken together with
any then-available Financing pursuant to any then-existing Debt Commitment
Letter, the then-existing Fee Letter and available cash of Parent, to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to pay related
fees and expenses earned, due and payable as of the Closing Date) on terms not
less favorable in the aggregate to the Buyer Group than those contained in
either the Debt Commitment Letter and the Fee Letter that the
Alternative Financing would replace (taking into account any flex provisions)
from the same or other sources and which do not include any
incremental conditionality to the consummation of such Alternative Financing
that are more onerous to Parent, Seller and the Atlas Companies (in each
case, in the aggregate) than the conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment
Letter (as applicable) in effect as of the date of this Agreement and (ii)
immediately notify Seller of such unavailability and the reason therefor.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, under no
circumstances shall Parent or its Affiliates be obligated to provide
Financing.

  



  

(e) For purposes of the foregoing _Section 6.17(a)_ through _Section
6.17(d)_, (i) the term " _Debt Commitment Letter_ " shall be deemed to
include any commitment letter (or similar agreement) with respect to
any Alternative Financing (that is debt financing) arranged in compliance
herewith (and any Debt Commitment Letter remaining in effect at the time in
question), (ii) the term " _Fee Letter_ " shall be deemed to include any fee

Persons who are on the board of directors or the board of managers (or
similar governing body) of any Atlas Company prior to the Closing in their
capacity as such shall not be required to pass resolutions or consents to

Closing, to be an issuer or other obligor with respect to the
Financing. Seller shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and

(h) None of Seller, the Atlas Companies, their Affiliates or any of their
respective representatives shall be required to take any action that would
subject such Person to actual or potential Liability, to bear any cost or
expense or to pay any commitment or other similar fee or make any other
payment or incur any other Liability or provide or agree to provide any
indemnity in connection with the Financing or their performance of their
respective obligations under this _Section 6.17(h)_ or any
information utilized in connection therewith. Parent shall indemnify and hold
harmless Seller, the Atlas Companies, their Affiliates and their respective
representatives from and against any and all Loss suffered or incurred by them
in connection with the arrangement of the Financing and the performance of
their respective obligations under this _Section 6.17(h)_ and any information
utilized in connection therewith, except in the case of Fraud or of gross
negligence or willful misconduct committed by or on behalf of Seller, any
Atlas Company or their respective Affiliates and representatives. Parent
shall, promptly upon receipt of a reasonably detailed invoice from Seller or
any Atlas Company, reimburse Seller or the Atlas Company and their Affiliates
for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by Seller, any
Atlas Company or their Affiliates (including those of its
accountants, consultants, legal counsel, agents and other representatives) in
connection with the cooperation required by this _Section 6.17(h)_.

  



  

Section 6.18  _Termination of Affiliate Obligations_. On or before the
Closing Date, except as set forth on _Schedule 6.18_ hereto, and except for
this Agreement and any ancillary agreements contemplated herein and for
liabilities relating to employment relationships and the payment of

and obligations of the Atlas Companies under any Contract or arrangement
contemplated by _Section 3.25_ shall be terminated in full as of the
completion of Closing without further liability to or obligations of the
Atlas Companies.

  



  

Section 6.19  _Confidentiality_.

  



  

(a) From and after the Closing, except to the extent consented to by any
member of the Buyer Group, Seller shall, and shall direct each of its
Affiliates and each of its and their respective representatives, to hold in
confidence and not use or disclose to any other Person, any Confidential
Information. If Seller or any of its Affiliates or any of their respective
representatives are requested or required by Law or by a self-regulatory
authority or entity (including, in each case, by oral question or request for
information or documents in any Proceeding, interrogatory, subpoena, civil
investigative demand or similar process) to publicly disclose any
Confidential Information, Seller or its Affiliates shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, promptly notify Parent in writing and may
disclose, without Liability hereunder or breach of this Agreement, only that
portion of such Confidential Information which, based on the advice of
counsel, is legally required to be disclosed; _provided_ , that Seller and its
Affiliates, at the written request and expense of Parent, shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain an appropriate protective order or
other reasonable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded such
information. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller and its Affiliates and
each of its and their respective representatives shall be permitted to (a)
make non-public disclosures, communications or statements including
Confidential Information (i) to any of Seller's or its Affiliates'
Affiliates, directors, officers, partners, employees, agents, consultants,
financing sources, investors (including direct and indirect limited partners
or investors), vehicles, managed accounts, attorneys, accountants, financial
advisors or other representatives or (ii) if compelled or requested to
disclose the same as part of any legal, judicial or administrative process or
Proceeding, by any regulatory authority or self-regulatory authority or by
other requirements of Law, including as part of any regulatory audit or
examination and (b) use or non-publicly disclose such information in
connection with (i) its ownership of Equity Interests of the Buyer Group and
the Atlas Companies and (ii) the governance of the Buyer Group and the Atlas
Companies, including participation as a member or observer of any boards of
directors, managers or similar. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, for purposes of the confidentiality obligations of this _Section
6.19(a)_, Seller's Affiliates and its and their representatives shall not
include the Atlas Companies, Buyer Group or any of their respective employees,
consultants or contractors.

  



  

   

77

 



    



  

(b) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, none of the
provisions of this _Section 6.19_ shall in any way limit the activities of
any Affiliate (including portfolio companies) of Seller or its Affiliates (or
any investment funds, vehicles or companies managed by Seller or its
Affiliates) who are not in receipt or otherwise provided any
Confidential Information. For avoidance of doubt, no such Affiliate
(including portfolio companies) shall be deemed to be "in receipt or
otherwise provided any Confidential Information" solely as a result of a
representative of Seller or its Affiliates (or any investment funds, vehicles
or companies managed by Seller or its Affiliates) who is in possession of
Confidential Information also being an officer, director or other agent of
such portfolio company; _provided_ , that such representative does not
use the Confidential Information in violation of _Section 6.19(a)_ or
otherwise act at the specific instruction of any Person who received the
Confidential Information if such Person is otherwise prohibited from such acts
pursuant to _Section 6.19(a)_ and such Confidential Information is used in
making such instruction.

  



  

Section 6.20  _Name Change_. Seller shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cease, and shall cause each of its Affiliates to use its reasonable best
efforts to cease, using the " _Atlas_ ," or " _Atlas Technical Consultants_
," names, marks and logos (or any derivative or similar name, marks and logos
thereof) within ninety (90) days after the Closing, and in furtherance of the
foregoing shall amend its Governing Documents with effect from and after the
Closing Date in order to change its name to delete the words " _Atlas_ ".

  



  

Section 6.21  _280G_. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to (i) seek to obtain a waiver from each
Person who is a "disqualified individual" (as defined in Section 280G of the
Code) of that portion of any payments or economic benefits received or
payable to such Person that is reasonably expected to constitute "parachute
payments" (as defined in Section 280G(b) of the Code) (the " _Waived 280G
Benefits_ "), and (ii) solicit the approval of its shareholders of any Waived
280G Benefits, in a manner that complies with Sections 280G(b)(5)(A)(ii) and
280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder. The
Company shall forward to the Buyer Parties at least five (5) days prior to the
submission to shareholders entitled to vote on such matters copies of all
documents prepared by the Company in connection with this _Section 6.21_ for
the Buyer Parties' review. Prior to Closing, the Company shall deliver to the
Buyer Parties evidence of the results of such vote. Such shareholder
approval, if obtained, shall establish the disqualified individual's right to
receive or retain the Waived 280G Payments, such that if such shareholder
approval is not obtained, no portion of the Waived 280G Payments shall be
paid, payable, received or retained. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the
extent that any Contract, agreement, or plan is entered into by any member of
the Buyer Group or any of their Affiliates and a disqualified individual in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement before the
Closing Date (the " _Buyer Arrangements_ "), the Buyer Group shall provide a
copy of such Contract, agreement or plan to the Company and the Seller at
least fifteen (15) days before the Closing Date and shall cooperate with the
Company in good faith in order to calculate or determine the value (for the
purposes of Section 280G of the Code) of any payments or benefits granted or
contemplated therein, which may be paid or granted in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement that could constitute a
"parachute payment" under Section 280G of the Code; _provided_ , that, in any
event, the Company's failure to include the Buyer Arrangements in the
stockholder voting materials described herein, for any reason, will not
result in a breach of the covenants set forth in this _Section 6.21_.

  



  

   

78

 



    



  

Section 6.22  _Post-Closing Reorganization_. On the Closing Date, Holdings
shall cause Buyer to merge with and into the Company, causing the separate
existence of Buyer to cease and causing the Company to continue as the
surviving entity in the Merger in accordance with the Delaware Limited
Liability Company Act and as a wholly-owned direct Subsidiary of Holdings.
Such merger shall have the effects set forth herein and in the applicable
provisions of the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the effective time of
such merger, all of the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of
the Company and Buyer shall vest in the Company, as the surviving entity, and
all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Buyer shall become the
debts, liabilities and duties of the Company, as the surviving entity.

(d) by Seller, if Buyer Group breaches in any material respect any of its
representations or warranties contained in this Agreement or breaches or

this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (i) would render a
condition precedent to Seller's obligations to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby set forth in _Section 2.6(a)_ or _Section 2.6(c)_ not
capable of being satisfied, and (ii) after the giving of written notice of
such breach or failure to perform to Buyer Group by Seller, cannot be cured or

of its representations or warranties contained in this Agreement or the
Company or Seller breaches or fails to perform in any material respect any of
its covenants contained in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform
(i) would render a condition precedent to Parent's obligations to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby set forth in _Section
2.6(a)_ or _Section 2.6(b)_ not capable of being satisfied, and (ii) after
the giving of written notice of such breach or failure to perform to Seller by

Agreement; and

  



  

(f) by Seller, if (i) all of the conditions to Closing set forth in _Section
2.6(a)_ and _Section 2.6(b)_ were satisfied or waived as of the date the
Closing should have been consummated pursuant to the terms of this Agreement
(other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the
Closing and could have been satisfied or would have been waived assuming a
Closing would occur), (ii) Seller has notified Parent that Seller and the
Company are ready, willing and able to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and (iii) Buyer Group fails to complete the
Closing within two (2) Business Days after the delivery of such notification
by Seller.

  



  

Section 7.2  _Effect of Termination_. In the event of the termination of
this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1_, this Agreement shall immediately
become null and void, without any Liability on the part of any Party or any

_provided_ , that (a) the Confidentiality Agreement and the agreements
contained in _Section 6.7(a)_, _Section 6.8_, this _Section 7.2_ and
_Article VIII_ of this Agreement survive any termination of this Agreement
and remain in full force and effect and (b) no such termination shall (i)
relieve any Party from any Liability arising out of or incurred as a result
of its breach of the terms of this Agreement prior to such termination or (ii)
impair the right of any Party hereto to compel specific performance by any
other Party of such Party's obligations under this Agreement.

Section 8.1  _Amendment and Waiver_. No amendment of any provision of this
Agreement shall be valid unless the same shall be in writing and signed by
Parent, Holdings, Buyer, the Company and Seller. No waiver of any provision
or condition of this Agreement shall be valid unless the same shall be in
writing and signed by the Party against which such waiver is to be enforced.
No waiver by any Party of any default, breach of representation or warranty
or breach of covenant hereunder, whether intentional or not, shall be deemed
to extend to any other, prior or subsequent default or breach or affect in

such occurrence. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of _Section
8.3_, _Section 8.8_, _Section 8.10_,  _Section 8.11_, _Section 8.14_ and

Section 8.3  _Assignment_. This Agreement and all of the provisions hereof
shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties and their
respective successors and assigns; _provided_ , that neither this Agreement
nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder may be assigned or
delegated by any Party (including by operation of Law) without the prior
written consent of the other Parties; _provided further_ , that
notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent may assign its rights under this
Agreement to its lenders providing financing in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby (including the Debt Financing Sources) for
collateral security purposes, it being understood that no such assignment
shall relieve any member of the Buyer Group of any of its obligations
hereunder. In the event the Company or any of its successors or assigns, (a)
consolidates with or merges into any other Person or (b) transfers all or
substantially all of its properties or assets to any Person, then, and in each
case, the successors and assigns of the Company shall be deemed to have
assumed the obligations set forth in _Section 6.11_.

  



  

   

81

 



    



  

Section 8.4  _Severability_. Whenever possible, each provision of this
Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid
under applicable Law, but if any provision of this Agreement or the
application of any such provision to any Person or circumstance shall be held
to be prohibited by or invalid, illegal or unenforceable under applicable Law
in any respect by a court of competent jurisdiction, such provision shall be
ineffective only to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity, illegality
or unenforceability, without invalidating the remainder of such provision or
the remaining provisions of this Agreement. Furthermore, in lieu of such
illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision, there shall be added
automatically as a part of this Agreement a legal, valid and
enforceable provision as similar in terms to such illegal, invalid, or
unenforceable provision as may be possible.

  



  

Section 8.5  _Interpretation_. The headings and captions used in this
Agreement and the table of contents to this Agreement are for reference
purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation
of this Agreement. Any capitalized terms used in any Schedule or Exhibit
attached hereto and not otherwise defined therein shall have the meanings set
forth in this Agreement. The use of the word " _including_ " herein shall
mean "including without limitation." The use of the word " _Ordinary Course of
Business_ " shall mean, with respect to any Person, any action taken by such
Person in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice. The
words "hereof," "herein," and "hereunder" and words of similar import,
when used in this Agreement, shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not
to any particular provision of this Agreement. References herein to a
specific Section, Subsection, Recital, Schedule or Exhibit shall refer,
respectively, to Sections, Subsections, Recitals, Schedules or Exhibits of
this Agreement. Terms defined in the singular shall have a comparable meaning
when used in the plural, and vice versa. References herein to any gender
shall include each other gender. The word "or" shall not be exclusive unless
the context clearly requires the selection of one (but not more than one) of a
number of items. References to "written" or "in writing" include in
electronic form. References herein to any Person shall include such Person's
heirs, executors, personal representatives, administrators, successors and
assigns; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing contained in this _Section
8.5_ is intended to authorize any assignment or transfer not otherwise
permitted by this Agreement. References herein to a Person in a particular
capacity or capacities shall exclude such Person in any other capacity. Any
reference to "days" shall mean calendar days unless Business Days are
expressly specified; _provided_ , that if any action is required to be done
or taken on a day that is not a Business Day, then such action shall be
required to be done or taken not on such day but on the first succeeding
Business Day thereafter. References herein to any Contract or
agreement (including this Agreement) mean such Contract or agreement as
amended, restated, supplemented or modified from time to time in accordance
with the terms thereof; _provided_ , that with respect to any Contract listed
(or required to be listed) on the Disclosure Schedules, all amendments,
modifications, supplements, extensions and renewals thereto (but excluding any
purchase orders, work orders or statements of work) must also be listed on
the appropriate schedule and disclosed. With respect to the determination of
any period of time, the word "from" means "from and including" and the words
"to" and "until" each means "to but excluding." References herein to any Law
shall be deemed also to refer to all rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder. If any party has breached any representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement contained herein in any respect, the fact that there exists
another representation, warranty, covenant or agreement relating to the same
subject matter (regardless of the relative levels of specificity) which the
party has not breached shall not detract from or mitigate the fact that the
party is in breach of the first representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement. The word "extent" in the phrase "to the extent" (or similar
phrases) shall mean the degree to which a subject or other thing extends, and
such phrase shall not mean simply "if". An accounting term not otherwise
defined in this Agreement has the meaning assigned to it in accordance with
GAAP. Except where otherwise expressly provided, all amounts in this Agreement
are stated and shall be paid in United States currency. The Parties and their
respective counsel have reviewed, negotiated and adopted this Agreement as
the joint agreement and understanding of the Parties, and the language used in
this Agreement shall be deemed to be the language chosen by the Parties to
express their mutual intent, and no rule of strict construction shall be
applied against any Person. Any information or materials shall be deemed
provided, made available or delivered to each member of the Buyer Group if
such information or materials have been uploaded to the electronic data room
maintained by Seller and its financial advisors on the SmartRoom online-
platform provided by BMC Group for purposes of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement (the " _Data Room_ ") or otherwise provided to any member
of the Buyer Group's representatives (including counsel) via electronic mail,
in each case, prior to the date hereof. The content of the Data Room as at
the relevant date set out in the preceding sentence has been stored on six
identical encrypted USB devices prepared by Seller's representatives, of which
Seller and Parent each received three for evidentiary purposes on the date
hereof.

Section 8.6  _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement and the agreements and
documents referred to herein, including the Stockholder Support Agreement,
contain the entire agreement and understanding between the Parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements
and understandings, whether written or oral, relating to such subject matter
in any way. The Parties have voluntarily agreed to define their rights,
Liabilities and obligations with respect to the transactions contemplated
hereby exclusively in Contract pursuant to the express terms and provisions
of this Agreement, and the Parties expressly disclaim that they are owed any
duties or are entitled to any remedies not expressly set forth in this
Agreement. Furthermore, this Agreement embodies the justifiable
expectations of sophisticated parties derived from arm's-length negotiations
and no Person has any special relationship with another Person that would
justify any expectation beyond that of an ordinary buyer and an ordinary
seller in an arm's-length transaction.

  



  

Section 8.7  _Counterparts; Electronic Delivery_. This Agreement and
agreements, certificates, instruments and documents entered into in connection
herewith may be executed and delivered in one or more counterparts and by fax
or email, each of which shall be deemed an original and all of which shall
be considered one and the same agreement. No Party shall raise the use of a
fax machine or email to deliver a signature or the fact that any signature or
agreement or instrument was transmitted or communicated through the use of a
fax machine or email as a defense to the formation or enforceability of a
Contract and each Party forever waives any such defense.

  



  

Section 8.8  _Governing Law; Waiver of Jury Trial; Jurisdiction_. The Law of
the State of Delaware shall govern (a) all claims or matters related to or
arising from this Agreement (including any tort or non-contractual claims)
and (b) any questions concerning the construction, interpretation, validity
and enforceability of this Agreement, and the performance of the obligations
imposed by this Agreement, in each case without giving effect to any choice-
of-law or conflict-of-law rules or provisions (whether of the State of
Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the
Law of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in the foregoing, all disputes against any
Debt Financing Source under the Debt Commitment Letter related to this
Agreement or the facts and circumstances leading to its execution, whether in
contract, tort or otherwise (including any dispute arising out of or relating
in any way to the Debt Commitment Letter), will be governed by, and construed
in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York applicable to contracts
executed in and to be performed entirely within such State, without regard to
conflict of law principles that would result in the application of any law
other than the law of the State of New York. Each party to this Agreement
hereby IRREVOCABLY waives all rights to trial by jury in any action, suit or
Proceeding brought to resolve any dispute between or among any of the parties
(whether arising in contract, tort or otherwise) arising out of, connected
with, related or incidental to this Agreement, the transactions contemplated
hereby and/or the relationships established among the parties hereunder
(INCLUDING, FOR THE AVOIDANCE OF DOUBT, WITH RESPECT TO THE COMMITTED
FINANCING OR AGAINST ANY DEBT FINANCING SOURCE). THE PARTIES HERETO FURTHER
WARRANT AND REPRESENT THAT EACH HAS REVIEWED THIS WAIVER WITH ITS LEGAL
COUNSEL, AND THAT EACH KNOWINGLY AND VOLUNTARILY WAIVES ITS JURY TRIAL RIGHTS
FOLLOWING CONSULTATION WITH LEGAL COUNSEL. Each of the Parties submits to the
exclusive jurisdiction of first, the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware
or if such court declines jurisdiction, then to the Federal District Court
for the District of Delaware, in any action or Proceeding arising out of or
relating to this Agreement, agrees that all claims in respect of the action
or Proceeding shall be heard and determined in any such court and agrees not
to bring any Proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement in any
other courts. Nothing in this _Section 8.8_, however, shall affect the right
of any Party to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by Law or at
equity. Each Party agrees that a final judgment in any Proceeding so brought
shall be conclusive and may be enforced by suit on the judgment or in any
other manner provided by Law or at equity. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each
of the Parties agrees that it will not bring or support any action against
the Debt Financing Sources, including any dispute arising out of or relating
in any way to any Debt Commitment Letter or the performance thereof, whether
based on contract, tort or otherwise, in any forum other than exclusively in
federal court sitting in the State of New York, Borough of Manhattan in the
City of New York.

Section 8.9  _Trust Account Waiver_. Each of the Company and Seller
acknowledges that Parent has established the Trust Account for the benefit of
its public stockholders, which holds proceeds of its initial public offering.
For and in consideration of Parent entering into this Agreement and for
other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which
is hereby acknowledged, each of the Company and Seller, for itself and the
Affiliates it has the authority to bind, hereby agrees it does not now and
shall not at any time hereafter have any right, title, interest or claim of
any kind in or to any assets in the Trust Account (or distributions therefrom
to Parent's public stockholders), and hereby waives any claims it has or may
have at any time against or with respect to the Trust Account (or
distributions therefrom to Parent's public stockholders) as a result of, or
arising out of, any discussions, contracts or agreements (including this
Agreement) among Parent, Seller and the Company or the Company's shareholders
and will not seek recourse against the Trust Account (or distributions
therefrom to Parent's public stockholders) for any reason whatsoever.

  



  

Section 8.10  _Specific Performance_. Each Party acknowledges that the
rights of each Party to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby are
unique and recognize and affirm that in the event any of the provisions of
this Agreement are not performed in accordance with their specific terms or
otherwise are breached, money damages would be inadequate (and therefore the
non-breaching Party would have no adequate remedy at Law) and the non-
breaching Party would be irreparably damaged. Accordingly, each Party agrees
that each other Party shall be entitled to specific performance, an
injunction or other equitable relief (without posting of bond or other
security or needing to prove irreparable harm) to prevent breaches of the
provisions of this Agreement and to enforce specifically this Agreement
and the terms and provisions hereof in any Proceeding, in addition to any
other remedy to which such Person may be entitled.

  



  

Section 8.11  _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement is for the sole
benefit of the Parties and their permitted assigns and nothing herein
expressed or implied shall give or be construed to give any Person, other
than the Parties and such permitted assigns, any legal or equitable
rights hereunder (other than (a) in respect of the Buyer Indemnified Parties,
the Seller Indemnified Parties, the Indemnified Persons and Non-Party
Affiliates, each of whom is an express third-party beneficiary hereunder and
entitled to enforce certain obligations hereunder and (b) in respect of the
Debt Financing Sources, each of whom (i) is an express third-party beneficiary
of _Section 8.1_,  _Section 8.3_, _Section 8.8_, _Section 8.14_ and this
Section 8.11 to the extent such sections affect the rights and obligations of
the Debt Financing Sources and (ii) shall be entitled to enforce such
provisions and rely thereon).

  



  

Section 8.12  _Legal Representation_. Seller, each member of the Buyer Group
and the Company hereby agree, on their own behalf and on behalf of their
current and future directors, managers, members, partners, officers,
equityholders, employees and Affiliates and each of their successors and
assigns (all such parties, the " _Waiving Parties_ "), that Kirkland and Ellis
LLP ("KandE") (or any successor thereto) may represent Seller or any direct or
indirect director, manager, member, partner, officer, employee, equityholder
or Affiliate thereof, in connection with any dispute, litigation, claim,
Proceeding or obligation arising out of or relating to this Agreement, any
agreement entered into in connection herewith or the transactions contemplated
hereby (any such representation, the " _Post-Closing Representation_ ")
notwithstanding its representation (or any continued representation) of the
Company in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
and each member of the Buyer Group and the Company on behalf of itself and
the Waiving Parties hereby consents thereto and irrevocably waives (and will
not assert) any conflict of interest or any objection arising therefrom or
relating thereto. Each member of the Buyer Group and the Company each
acknowledge that the foregoing provision applies whether or not KandE provides
legal services to the Company after the Closing Date. Each member of the
Buyer Group and the Company, for itself and the Waiving Parties, hereby
irrevocably acknowledges and agrees that all communications among KandE, the
Company, Seller and/or any director, officer, manager, member, equityholder,
employee or representative of any of the foregoing made in connection with
the negotiation, preparation, execution, delivery and performance under, or
any dispute or Proceeding arising out of or relating to, this Agreement, any
agreement entered into in connection herewith, the transactions contemplated
hereby or any matter relating to any of the foregoing, are privileged
communications and the attorney-client privilege and the expectation of
client confidence belongs solely to Seller and may be exclusively controlled
by Seller and shall not pass to or be claimed by a member of the Buyer Group
or the Atlas Companies, and from and after the Closing none of any member of
the Buyer Group, any Atlas Company or any Person purporting to act on behalf
of or through any member of the Buyer Group, any Atlas Company or any of the
Waiving Parties, will seek to obtain the same by any process. From and after
the Closing, each member of the Buyer Group and the Company, on behalf of
itself and the Waiving Parties, irrevocably waives and will not assert any
attorney-client privilege with respect to any communication among KandE, any
Atlas Company, Seller and/or any director, officer, manager,
member, equityholder, employee or representative of any of the foregoing
occurring prior to the Closing in connection with any Post-
Closing Representation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a
dispute arises between any member of the Buyer Group or any Atlas Company, on
the one hand, and a third party other than Seller, on the other hand, any
member of the Buyer Group and any Atlas Company may assert the attorney-
client privilege to prevent disclosure of confidential communications to such
third party; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither any member of the Buyer
Group nor any Atlas Company may waive such privilege without the prior
written consent of Seller.

Section 8.13  _Schedules_. All Schedules and Exhibits attached hereto or
referred to herein and the recitals to this Agreement are (a) each hereby
incorporated in and made a part of this Agreement as if set forth in full
herein and (b) qualified in their entirety by reference to
specific provisions of this Agreement. Any fact or item disclosed in any
Section of the Schedules shall be deemed disclosed in each other Section of
the Schedule to which such fact or item may apply so long as (x) such other
Section is referenced by applicable cross-reference or (y) it is reasonably
apparent on the face of such disclosure that such disclosure is applicable
to such other Section or Schedule. The headings contained in the Schedules
are for convenience of reference only and shall not be deemed to modify or
influence the interpretation of the information contained in these Schedules
or the Agreement. The Schedules are not intended to constitute, and shall not
be construed as, an admission or indication that any such fact or item is
required to be disclosed. The Schedules shall not be deemed to expand in any
way the scope or effect of any representations, warranties or covenants
described in this Agreement. Any fact or item, including the specification of
any dollar amount, disclosed in the Schedules shall not by reason only of
such inclusion be deemed to be material, to establish any standard of
materiality or to define further the meaning of such terms for purposes of
the Agreement and matters reflected in the Schedules are not necessarily
limited to matters required by the Agreement to be reflected herein and may
be included solely for information purposes; and no Party shall use the fact
of the setting of the amounts or the fact of the inclusion of any item in the
Schedules in any dispute or controversy between the Parties as to whether any
obligation, item or matter not described or included in the Schedules is or is
not required to be disclosed (including whether the amount or items are
required to be disclosed as material or threatened) or is within or outside
of the Ordinary Course of Business. No disclosure in the Schedules relating to
any possible breach or violation of any Contract, Law or Order shall be
construed as an admission or indication that any such breach or violation
exists or has actually occurred. The information contained in the Schedules
shall be kept strictly confidential by the Parties and no third party
may rely on any information disclosed or set forth therein. Moreover, in
disclosing the information in the Schedules, Seller expressly does not waive
any attorney-client privilege associated with such information or any
protection afforded by the work-product doctrine with respect to any of the
matters disclosed or discussed therein.

seek to enforce this Agreement against, make any claims for breach of this
Agreement against, or seek to recover monetary damages from, any Debt
Financing Source or Equity Financing Source in connection with this Agreement
or (b) seek to enforce the commitments against, make any claims for breach of
any Commitment Letter against, or seek to recover monetary damages from, or
otherwise sue, any Debt Financing Source or Equity Financing Source for the
Financing in connection with (i) this Agreement or (ii) the obligations of
the Debt Financing Sources or Equity Financing Sources for the Financing
under the applicable Commitment Letter. Nothing in this _Section 8.14_ shall
in any way limit or qualify the rights and obligations of (x) the Debt
Financing Sources or Equity Financing Sources for the applicable Financing and
the other parties to the Financing (or the definitive documents related to
the Committed Financing) to each other thereunder or in connection therewith
and (y) Seller against any member of the Buyer Group.

(a) the number of shares of any series and the designation to distinguish the
shares of such series from the shares of all other series;

  



  

(b) the voting powers, if any, and whether such voting powers are full or

Section 3. _Common Stock_.

  



  

(a) __Voting Generally__.

  



  

(i) Except as otherwise required by law or this Second Amended and Restated
Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation), the holders of the
Common Stock shall exclusively possess all voting power with respect to the
Corporation and the holders of the Preferred Stock, as such, shall not be
entitled to vote.

  



  

(ii) Except as otherwise required by law or this Second Amended and Restated
Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation), the holders of shares
of Common Stock shall be entitled to one vote for each such share on each
matter properly submitted to the stockholders on which the holders of the
Common Stock are entitled to vote.

  



  

(iii) Except as otherwise required by law or this Second Amended and Restated
Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation), at any annual or
special meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation, holders of the Class
A Common Stock and holders of the Class B Common Stock voting together as a
single class (or, if any holders of Preferred Stock are entitled to vote
together with the holders of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock,
the holders of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock and the Preferred
Stock shall vote together as a single class), shall have the exclusive right
to vote for the election of directors and on all other matters properly
submitted to a vote of the stockholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
except as otherwise required by law or this Second Amended and
Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation), holders of
shares of any series of Common Stock shall not be entitled to vote on any
amendment to this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any
amendment to any Preferred Stock Designation) that relates solely to the
terms of one or more outstanding series of Preferred Stock if the holders of

Ex A-1-3

 



    



  

(b) __Class A Common Stock__.

  



  

(i) _Dividends._ Subject to applicable law and the rights, if any, of the
holders of any outstanding series of the Preferred Stock, the holders of
shares of Class A Common Stock shall be entitled to receive such dividends
and other distributions (payable in cash, property or capital stock of the
Corporation) when, as and if declared thereon by the Board from time to time
out of any assets or funds of the Corporation legally available therefor and
shall share equally on a per share basis in such dividends and distributions;
_provided that_ , in the event of any dividend or other distribution received
by the Corporation from the Partnership in respect of the Units or other
equity interests of the Partnership held by the Corporation, including upon
any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Partnership (any such
dividend or distribution, a " _Partnership Distribution_ "), the Board shall
to the extent the Corporation has lawful funds then available, declare and
pay in connection with such Partnership Distribution a dividend or other
distribution on the shares of Class A Common Stock in an amount equal to 100%
of such Partnership Distribution, net of reserves for taxes payable by the
Corporation as reasonably determined by the Board (a " _Pass-Through
Distribution_ "), and the holders of Class A Common Stock shall share equally
on a per share basis in such Pass-Through Distribution. The Board shall fix
the record date for any Pass-Through Distribution to be the same date as the
record date for the corresponding Partnership Distribution fixed by the
managing member of the Partnership or, if necessary to comply with applicable
law, such later date that is as soon as practicable after the record date for
the Partnership Distribution fixed by the managing member of the Partnership.
To the extent that a Partnership Distribution is paid in a form other than
cash, the Corporation shall sell a portion of such Partnership Distribution
sufficient to reserve for taxes payable by the Corporation as reasonably
determined by the Board, and the balance of such Partnership
Distribution shall be a Pass-Through Distribution.

  



  

(ii) _Liquidation, Dissolution or Winding Up of the Corporation_. Subject to
applicable law and the rights, if any, of the holders of any outstanding
series of the Preferred Stock, in the event of any voluntary or involuntary
liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, after payment
or provision for payment of the debts and other liabilities of the
Corporation, the holders of shares of Class A Common Stock shall be entitled
to receive all the remaining assets of the Corporation available for
distribution to its stockholders, ratably in proportion to the number of
shares of Class A Common Stock held by them. A dissolution, liquidation or
winding-up of the Corporation, as such terms are used in this paragraph (ii),
shall not be deemed to be occasioned by or to include any consolidation or
merger of the Corporation with or into any other corporation or corporations
or other entity or a sale, lease, exchange or conveyance of all or a part of
the assets of the Corporation.

  



  

(c) __Class B Common Stock__.

  



  

(i) _Dividends_. Except as provided in subsection (f) below, holders of
Class B Common Stock shall not be entitled to receive any dividends.

  



  

(ii) _Liquidation, Dissolution or Winding Up of the Corporation_. The
holders of Class B Common Stock shall not be entitled to receive any assets of
the Corporation in the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation,
dissolution or winding up of the Corporation. A dissolution, liquidation or
winding-up of the Corporation, as such terms are used in this paragraph (ii),
shall not be deemed to be occasioned by or to include any consolidation or
merger of the Corporation with or into any other corporation or corporations
or other entity or a sale, lease, exchange or conveyance of all or a part of
the assets of the Corporation.

  



  

(iii) _Transfer of Class B Common Stock._

  



  

(1) A holder of Class B Common Stock may surrender shares of Class B Common
Stock to the Corporation for no consideration at any time. Following the
surrender of any shares of Class B Common Stock to the Corporation, the
Corporation will take all actions necessary to retire such shares and
such shares shall not be re-issued by the Corporation.

  



    

Ex A-1-4

 



    



  

(2) A holder of Class B Common Stock may transfer shares of Class B Common
Stock to any transferee (other than the Corporation) only if, and only to the
extent permitted by the LLC Agreement, such holder also simultaneously
transfers an equal number of such holder's Units to such transferee. Upon a
transfer of Units in accordance with the LLC Agreement, an equal number of
shares of Class B Common Stock held by the holder of such Units will
automatically and simultaneously be transferred to the same transferee of such
Units. The transfer restrictions described in this Section 3(c)(iv)(2) are
referred to as the "Restrictions".

  



  

(3) Any purported transfer of shares of Class B Common Stock in violation of
the Restrictions shall be null and void. If, notwithstanding the Restrictions,
a person shall, voluntarily or involuntarily, purportedly become or attempt
to become, the purported owner ("Purported Owner") of shares of Class B
Common Stock in violation of the Restrictions, then the Purported Owner shall
not obtain any rights in and to such shares of Class B Common Stock (the
"Restricted Shares"), and the purported transfer of the Restricted Shares to
the Purported Owner shall not be recognized by the Corporation's transfer
agent (the "Transfer Agent").

  



  

(4) Upon a determination by the Board (including the vote of the majority of
the disinterested directors serving on the Board at such time), or by a
committee composed solely of disinterested directors, that a person has
attempted or may attempt to transfer or to acquire Restricted Shares in
violation of the Restrictions, the Corporation shall refuse to give effect to
such transfer or acquisition on the books and records of the Corporation. In
furtherance of the foregoing, the Corporation shall cause the Transfer Agent
to refuse to record the Purported Owner's transferor as the record owner of
the Restricted Shares and shall institute proceedings to enjoin or rescind
any such transfer or acquisition.

  



  

(5) The Board (including the vote of a majority of the disinterested
directors serving on the Board at such time), or by a committee composed
solely of disinterested directors may, to the extent permitted by law, from
time to time establish, modify, amend or rescind, by bylaw or otherwise,
regulations and procedures that are consistent with the provisions of this
Section 3(c)(iv) for determining whether any transfer or acquisition of
shares of Class B Common Stock would violate the Restrictions and for the
orderly application, administration and implementation of the provisions of
this Section 3(c). Any such procedures and regulations shall be kept on file
with the Secretary of the Corporation and with the Transfer Agent and shall
be made available for inspection by any prospective transferee and, upon
written request, shall be mailed to holders of shares of Class B Common Stock.

  



    

Ex A-1-5

 



    



  

(6) The Board (including a majority of the disinterested directors serving on
the Board at such time), or by a committee composed solely of disinterested
directors, shall have, all powers necessary to implement the Restrictions,
including without limitation, the power to prohibit the transfer of any
shares of Class B Common Stock in violation thereof.

  



  

(iv) _Issuance of Class A Common Stock Upon Redemption; Cancellation of
Class B Common Stock_.

  



  

(1) Shares of Class B Common Stock shall be redeemable for shares of Class A
Common Stock on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the
LLC Agreement. The Corporation will at all times reserve and keep available
out of its authorized but unissued shares of Class A Common Stock, solely for
the purpose of issuance upon redemption of the Class B Common Stock for Class
A Common Stock pursuant to the LLC Agreement, such number of shares of Class
A Common Stock that shall be issuable upon any such redemption pursuant to
the LLC Agreement; provided that nothing contained herein shall be construed
to preclude the Corporation from satisfying its obligations in respect of any
such redemption of shares of Class B Common Stock pursuant to the LLC
Agreement by delivering to the holder of such shares of Class B Common Stock
upon such redemption, cash in lieu of shares of Class A Common Stock in the
amount permitted by and provided in the LLC Agreement or shares of Class A
Common Stock which are held in the treasury of the Corporation. All shares of
Class A Common Stock that shall be issued upon any such redemption will, upon
issuance in accordance with the LLC Agreement, be validly issued, fully paid
and nonassessable. To the extent that any holder of Class B Common Stock
exercises its right pursuant to the LLC Agreement to have some or all of such
holder's Units redeemed by the Partnership in accordance with the LLC
Agreement, then simultaneous with the payment of the consideration due under
the LLC Agreement to such holder of Class B Common Stock for such holders
Units, the Corporation shall redeem for no consideration such number of
shares of Class B Common Stock registered in the name of the redeeming or
exchanging holder of Class B Common Stock equal to the number of Units held
by such holder of Class B Common Stock that are redeemed or exchanged in such
redemption or exchange transaction shall be automatically transferred to the
Corporation, retired and canceled and shall not be reissued.

  



  

(2) Notwithstanding the Restrictions, (A) in the event that an outstanding
share of Class B Common Stock shall cease to be held by a registered holder of

further action on the part of the Corporation or any holder of Class B Common
Stock be transferred to the Corporation, retired and cancelled for no
consideration, and shall not be re-issued by the Corporation and (B) in the
event that one or more of the Units held by a registered holder of Class B
Common Stock ceases to be held by such holder (other than as a result of a
transfer of one or more Units together with an equal number of shares
of Class B Common Stock as permitted by the LLC Agreement), a corresponding
number of shares of Class B Common Stock registered in the name of such
holder shall automatically and without further action on the part of the
Corporation or such holder be transferred to the Corporation, retired and
cancelled for no consideration, and such shares shall not be re-issued by the
Corporation.

exchangeable for, shares of any other class or classes or of any other series
of the same class of the Corporation's capital stock.

  



  

(e) _Preemptive Rights_. No stockholder shall, by reason of the holding of
shares of any class or series of capital stock of the Corporation, have any
preemptive or preferential right to acquire or subscribe for any shares or

may at any time be issued, sold or offered for sale by the Corporation, unless
specifically provided for in a Preferred Stock Designation.

  



  

(f) _Stock Split or Reverse Stock Split_. In no event shall the shares of

(g) _Authorization and Issuance of Additional Shares; Repurchases or
Redemptions._

  



  

(i) If at any time the Corporation issues a share of Class A Common Stock or
any other Equity Security of the Corporation (other than Class B Common
Stock), (1) the Corporation shall cause the Partnership to issue to the
Corporation one Unit (if the Corporation issues a share of Class A Common
Stock), or such other Equity Security of the Partnership (if the Corporation
issues Equity Securities other than Class A Common Stock) corresponding to
such Equity Securities issued by the Corporation, and with substantially the
same rights to dividends and distributions (including distributions upon
liquidation) and other economic rights as those of such Equity Securities of
the Corporation and (2) the net proceeds received by the Corporation with
respect to issuance of the corresponding share of Class A Common Stock or
other Equity Security, if any, shall be concurrently contributed by the
Corporation to the Partnership as a capital contribution. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, this _Section 3(h)(i)_ shall not apply to (x) the issuance and
distribution to holders of shares of Class A Common Stock of rights to
purchase Equity Securities of the Corporation under a "poison pill" or
similar stockholders rights plan (and upon any redemption of Units for Class A
Common Stock, such Class A Common Stock will be issued together with a
corresponding right under such plan) or (y) the issuance under the
Corporation's employee benefits plans of any warrants, options, other rights
to acquire Equity Securities of the Corporation or rights or property that
may be converted into or settled in Equity Securities of the Corporation, but
shall in each of the foregoing cases apply to the issuance of Equity
Securities of the Corporation in connection with the exercise or settlement of
such rights, warrants, options or other rights or property.

  



  

(ii) The Corporation shall not in any manner effect any subdivision (by stock
split, stock dividend, reclassification, recapitalization or otherwise) or
combination (by reverse stock split, reclassification, recapitalization or
otherwise) of the outstanding Common Stock unless accompanied by an
identical subdivision or combination, as applicable, of the outstanding
Units, with corresponding changes made with respect to any other exchangeable
or convertible securities. The Corporation shall not in any manner effect any
subdivision (by stock split, stock dividend, reclassification,
recapitalization or otherwise) or combination (by reverse stock split,
reclassification, recapitalization or otherwise) of any outstanding Equity
Securities of the Corporation (other than the Common Stock) unless accompanied
by an identical subdivision or combination, as applicable, of the
corresponding Equity Securities of the Partnership, with corresponding
changes made with respect to any other exchangeable or convertible
securities.

  



  

(iii) The Corporation may not redeem, repurchase or otherwise acquire (1) any
shares of Class A Common Stock unless substantially simultaneously the
Partnership redeems, repurchases or otherwise acquires from the Corporation
an equal number of Units for the same form and amount of consideration per
security or (2) any other Equity Securities of the Corporation (other than
Class B Common Stock) unless substantially simultaneously the Partnership
redeems, repurchases or otherwise acquires from the Corporation an equal
number of Equity Securities of the Partnership of a corresponding class or
series with substantially the same rights to dividends and distributions
(including distributions upon liquidation) and other economic rights as those
of such Equity Securities of the Corporation for the same form and amount of
consideration per security. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that
any consideration payable by the Corporation in connection with the
redemption or repurchase of any shares of Class A Common Stock or other Equity
Securities of the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries consists (in whole
or in part) of shares of Class A Common Stock or such other Equity Securities
(including in connection with the cashless exercise of an option or warrant),
then the redemption or repurchase of the corresponding Units or other
Equity Securities of the Partnership shall be effectuated in an equivalent
manner.

Partnership, dated as of [●], 2019, as such agreement may be further amended,
restated, amended and restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time
to time in accordance with its terms, (iii) " _Unit_ " shall mean a unit

Section 4. _Rights and Options_. The Corporation has the authority to create
and issue rights, warrants and options entitling the holders thereof to
purchase shares of any class or series of the Corporation's capital stock or
other securities of the Corporation, and such rights, warrants and options
shall be evidenced by instrument(s) approved by the Board. The Board is
empowered to set the exercise price, duration, times for exercise and other
terms and conditions of such rights, warrants or options; _provided,
however_, that the consideration to be received for any shares of capital
stock subject thereto may not be less than the par value thereof.

 _Article V_ _ 
 BYLAWS_

  



  

The Board may make, amend, and repeal the Amended and Restated Bylaws (the "
_Bylaws_ ") of the Corporation, provided, however, that so long as the
Shareholders' Agreement remains in effect, the Board shall not approve any
amendment, alteration or repeal of any provision of the Bylaws, or the
adoption of any new Bylaw, that would be contrary to or inconsistent with the
terms of the Shareholders' Agreement. Any Bylaw made by the Board under the
powers conferred hereby may be amended or repealed by the Board (except as
specified in any such Bylaw so made or amended) or by the stockholders in the
manner provided in the Bylaws of the Corporation. In addition to any other
vote required by law, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least
662⁄3% of the Voting Stock (as defined below), voting together as a single
class, is required to amend or repeal, or to adopt any provision inconsistent
with, this Article V; provided, however, that so long as the Shareholders'
Agreement, dated as of [●], 2019, by and among the Corporation, Boxwood
Merger Sponsor LLC, [Bernhard Capital Partners Management LP] and other
parties thereto (as it may be amended and/or restated, the "Shareholders'
Agreement"), remains in effect, the Board may not approve any amendment,
alteration or repeal of any provision of the bylaws of the Corporation, or the
adoption of any new bylaw of the Corporation, that would be contrary to or
inconsistent with the terms of the Shareholders' Agreement without the
written consent of the Parties to the Shareholders' Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in the bylaws of the Corporation shall
be deemed to limit the ability of the parties to the Shareholders' Agreement
to amend, alter or repeal any provision of the Shareholders' Agreement
pursuant to the terms thereof, provided that no amendment to the Shareholders'
Agreement (whether or not such amendment modifies any provision of the
Shareholders' Agreement to which the bylaws of the Corporation are subject)
shall amend the bylaws of the Corporation. For the purposes of this Second
Amended and Restated Certificate, " _Voting Stock_ " means stock of the
Corporation of any class or series entitled to vote generally in the election
of directors. The Bylaws also may be adopted, amended, altered or repealed by
the stockholders; _provided, however_ , that in addition to any vote of the
holders of any class or series of capital stock of the Corporation required by
applicable law or this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any
Preferred Stock Designation), the affirmative vote of the holders of at least
a majority of the voting power of all outstanding shares of capital stock of
the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors,
voting together as a single class shall be required for the stockholders to
adopt, amend, alter or repeal the Bylaws other than Article VIII of the
Bylaws; provided further, that in addition to any vote of the holders of any
class or series of capital stock of the Corporation required by applicable
law or this Second Amended and Restated Certificate (including any
Preferred Stock Designation), the affirmative vote of the holders of at least
662⁄3% of the voting power of all outstanding shares of capital stock of the
Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting
together as a single class, shall be required for the stockholders to adopt,
amend, alter or repeal Article VIII of the Bylaws.

  



  

 _Article VI_ _ 
 MEETINGS OF STOCKHOLDERS_

  



  

Section 1. _Annual Meetings_. Except as otherwise expressly provided by law,
the annual meeting of stockholders for the election of directors and for the
transaction of such other business as may properly come before the meeting
shall be held at such date, time and place, if any, as shall be determined
exclusively by resolution of the Board in its sole and absolute discretion.

  



  

Section 2. _Special Meetings_. Subject to the rights, if any, of the holders
of any outstanding series of the Preferred Stock, and to the requirements of
applicable law, special meetings of stockholders of the Corporation may be
called only by the Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer, or the
Board pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of the Board, and the
ability of the stockholders to call a special meeting is hereby specifically
denied. Except as provided in the foregoing sentence, special meetings of
stockholders may not be called by another person or persons.

  



    

Ex A-1-10

 



    



  

Section 3. _Advance Notice_. Advance notice of stockholder nominations for
the election of directors and of business to be brought by
stockholders before any meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation shall
be given in the manner provided in the Bylaws.

  



  

Section 4. _No Action by Written Consent_. Subject to the rights, if any, of
the holders of any outstanding series of Preferred Stock, any action required
or permitted to be taken by the stockholders of the Corporation must be
effected by a duly called annual or special meeting of such stockholders and
may not be effected by written consent of the stockholders of the Corporation.

  



  

 _Article VII_ _ 
 BOARD OF DIRECTORS_

  



  

Section 1. _Number, Election, and Terms of Directors_. Subject to the rights,
if any, of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock to elect
additional directors under circumstances specified in any Preferred Stock
Designation and to the terms of the Shareholders' Agreement, the number of
directors will be fixed from time to time in the manner provided in the Bylaws
of the Corporation. Subject to Section 6 of this Article VII, the directors,
other than those who may be elected by the holders of any series of Preferred
Stock, will be classified with respect to the time for which they severally
hold office into three classes, as nearly equal in number as
possible, designated Class I, Class II, and Class III. At any meeting of
stockholders at which directors are to be elected, the number of directors
elected may not exceed the greatest number of directors then in office in any
class of directors. The directors first appointed to Class I will hold office
for a term expiring at the first annual meeting of stockholders following the
consummation of the Initial Business Combination; the directors first
appointed to Class II will hold office for a term expiring at the
second annual meeting of stockholders following the consummation of the
Initial Business Combination; and the directors first appointed to Class III
will hold office for a term expiring at the third annual meeting of
stockholders following the consummation of the Initial Business Combination,
with the members of each class to hold office until their successors are
elected and qualified. At each succeeding annual meeting of the stockholders
of the Corporation, the successors to the class of directors whose term
expires at that meeting will be elected by plurality vote of all votes cast
at such meeting to hold office for a term expiring at the annual meeting of
stockholders held in the third year following the year of their election and
until their successors are elected and qualified. Subject to the rights, if
any, of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock to elect additional
directors under circumstances specified in any Preferred Stock Designation,
directors may be elected by the stockholders only at an annual meeting of
stockholders. Election of directors of the Corporation need not be by written
ballot unless requested by the presiding officer or by the holders of a
majority of the Voting Stock present in person or represented by proxy at a
meeting of the stockholders at which directors are to be elected. If
authorized by the Board, such requirement of a written ballot shall be
satisfied by a ballot submitted by electronic transmission, provided that any
such electronic transmission must either set forth or be submitted with
information from which it can be determined that the electronic transmission
was authorized by the stockholder or proxy holder.

  



    

Ex A-1-11

 



    



  

Section 2. _Newly Created Directorships and Vacancies_. Subject to the terms
of the Shareholders' Agreement, and the rights, if any, of the holders of any
series of Preferred Stock to elect additional directors under circumstances
specified in any Preferred Stock Designation and Section 6 of this Article
VII, newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the number of
directors and any vacancies on the Board resulting from death, resignation,
disqualification, removal, or other cause will be filled solely by the
affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining directors then in office, even
though less than a quorum of the Board, or by a sole remaining director. Any
director elected in accordance with the preceding sentence will hold office
for the remainder of the full term of the class of directors in which the new
directorship was created or the vacancy occurred and until such
director's successor has been elected and qualified, subject, however, to
such director's earlier death, resignation, retirement, disqualification or
removal. If the number of directors is changed, any increase or decrease shall
be apportioned by the Board among the classes so as to maintain the number of
directors in each class as nearly equal as possible; _provided, however_ ,
that no decrease in the number of directors constituting the Board may
shorten the term of any incumbent director.

  



  

Section 3. _Removal_. Subject to the terms of the Shareholders' Agreement,
and to the rights, if any, of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock to
elect additional directors under circumstances specified in any Preferred
Stock Designation and Section 6 of this Article VII, any director may be
removed from office by the stockholders only for cause and only in the manner
provided in this Article VII, Section 4\. At any annual meeting or special
meeting of the stockholders, the notice of which states that the removal of a
director or directors is among the purposes of the meeting and identifies the
director or directors proposed to be removed, the affirmative vote of the
holders of at least majority of the voting power of the outstanding Voting
Stock, voting together as a single class, may remove such director or
directors for cause. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a
stockholder party to the Shareholders' Agreement provides notice to the
Corporation to remove a director designated by such stockholder pursuant to
the terms of the Shareholders' Agreement, whether such removal is with or
without cause, the Corporation may take all necessary action to cause such
removal, to the extent permitted by applicable law, and such director or
director may be removed with or without cause.

  



  

Section 4. _Preferred Stock - Directors_. Notwithstanding any other provision
of this Article VII, and except as otherwise required by law, whenever the
holders of one or more series of the Preferred Stock shall have the right,
voting separately by class or series, to elect one or more directors, the
number of directors constituting the entire board shall automatically be
increased by such specified number of directors and the term of office, the
filling of vacancies, the removal from office and other features of such
directorships shall be governed by the terms of such series of the Preferred
Stock as set forth in this Second Amended and Restated Certificate, including
any Preferred Stock Designation, and such directors shall not be included in
any of the classes created pursuant to this Article VII unless expressly
provided by such terms. Except as otherwise provided in a Preferred Stock
Designation, whenever the holders of any series of Preferred Stock having
such right to elect additional directors are divested of such right pursuant
to the provisions of such stock, the terms of office of all such additional
directors elected by the holders of such stock, or elected to fill any
vacancies resulting from the death, resignation, disqualification or removal
of such additional directors, shall forthwith terminate (in which case each
such director thereupon shall cease to be qualified as, and shall cease to be,
a director) and the total authorized number of directors of the Corporation
shall automatically be reduced accordingly.

  



    

Ex A-1-12

 



    



  

 _Article VIII_ _ 
 LIMITED LIABILITY_

  



  

To the full extent permitted by the DGCL and any other applicable law
currently or hereafter in effect, no director of the Corporation will be
personally liable to the Corporation or its stockholders for or with respect
to any breach of fiduciary duty or other act or omission as a director of the
Corporation, except to the extent such exemption from liability or limitation
thereof is not permitted under the DGCL as it now exists. In addition to the
circumstances in which a director of the Corporation is not personally liable
as set forth in the preceding sentence, a director of the Corporation shall
not be liable to the fullest extent permitted by any amendment to the DGCL
hereafter enacted that further limits the liability of a director. No repeal
or modification of this Article VIII will adversely affect the protection of
any director of the Corporation provided hereby in relation to any breach of
fiduciary duty or other act or omission as a director of the Corporation
occurring prior to the effectiveness of such repeal or modification.

  



  

 _Article IX_ _ 
 INDEMNIFICATION_

  



  

Section 1. _Right to Indemnification_. Each person who was or is made a party
or is threatened to be made a party to or is otherwise subject to or involved
in any claim, demand, action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative (a " _Proceeding_ "), by reason of the fact
that he or she is or was a director or an officer of the Corporation or is or
was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer,
employee or agent of another company or of a partnership, joint venture, trust
or other enterprise, including service with respect to an employee benefit
plan (an " _Indemnitee_ "), whether the basis of such Proceeding is alleged
action in an official capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent or in
any other capacity while serving as a director, officer, employee or agent,
shall be indemnified by the Corporation to the fullest extent permitted or
required by the DGCL and any other applicable law, as the same exists or may
hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the
extent that such amendment permits the Corporation to provide broader
indemnification rights than such law permitted the Corporation to provide
prior to such amendment), against all expense, liability and loss (including
attorneys' fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes or penalties and
amounts paid in settlement) reasonably incurred or suffered by
such Indemnitee in connection therewith (" _Indemnifiable Losses_ ");
_provided, however_ , that, except as provided in Section 4 of this Article
IX with respect to Proceedings to enforce rights to indemnification, the
Corporation shall indemnify any such Indemnitee pursuant to this Section 1 in
connection with a Proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such Indemnitee
only if such Proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the Board.

  



  

Section 2. _Right to Advancement of Expenses._ The right to indemnification
conferred in Section 1 of this Article IX shall include the right to
advancement by the Corporation of any and all expenses (including, without
limitation, attorneys' fees and expenses) incurred in defending any such
Proceeding in advance of its final disposition (an " _Advancement of Expenses_
"); _provided, however_ , that, if the DGCL so requires, an Advancement of
Expenses incurred by an Indemnitee in his or her capacity as a director or
officer (and not in any other capacity in which service was or is rendered by
such Indemnitee, including without limitation service to an employee benefit
plan) shall be made pursuant to this Section 2 only upon delivery to the
Corporation of an undertaking (an " _Undertaking_ "), by or on behalf of such
Indemnitee, to repay, without interest, all amounts so advanced if it shall
ultimately be determined by final judicial decision from which there is no
further right to appeal (a " _Final Adjudication_ ") that such Indemnitee is
not entitled to be indemnified for such expenses under this Section 2. An
Indemnitee's right to an Advancement of Expenses pursuant to this Section 2
is not subject to the satisfaction of any standard of conduct and is not
conditioned upon any prior determination that Indemnitee is entitled to
indemnification under Section 1 of this Article IX with respect to the
related Proceeding or the absence of any prior determination to the contrary.

  



    

Ex A-1-13

 



    



  

Section 3. _Contract Rights_. The rights to indemnification and to the
Advancement of Expenses conferred in Sections 1 and 2 of this Article IX
shall be contract rights and such rights shall continue as to an Indemnitee
who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure
to the benefit of the Indemnitee's heirs, executors and administrators.

  



  

Section 4. _Right of Indemnitee to Bring Suit_. If a claim under Section 1 or
2 of this Article IX is not paid in full by the Corporation within 60
calendar days after a written claim has been received by the Corporation,
except in the case of a claim for an Advancement of Expenses, in which case
the applicable period shall be 20 calendar days, the Indemnitee may at any
time thereafter bring suit against the Corporation to recover the unpaid
amount of the claim. If successful in whole or in part in any such suit, or in
a suit brought by the Corporation to recover an Advancement of Expenses
pursuant to the terms of an Undertaking, the Indemnitee shall be entitled to
the fullest extent permitted or required by the DGCL, as the same exists or
may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the
extent that such amendment permits the Corporation to provide broader
reimbursements of prosecution or defense expenses than such law permitted the
Corporation to provide prior to such amendment), to be paid also the expense
of prosecuting or defending such suit. In (i) any suit brought by the
Indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification hereunder (but not in a suit
brought by the Indemnitee to enforce a right to an Advancement of Expenses) it
shall be a defense that, and (ii) any suit brought by the Corporation to
recover an Advancement of Expenses pursuant to the terms of an
Undertaking, the Corporation shall be entitled to recover such expenses,
without interest, upon a Final Adjudication that, the Indemnitee has not met
any applicable standard for indemnification set forth in the DGCL. Neither the
failure of the Corporation (including its Board of Directors or a committee
thereof, its stockholders or independent legal counsel) to have made a
determination prior to the commencement of such suit that indemnification of
the Indemnitee is proper in the circumstances because the Indemnitee has met
the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the DGCL, nor an actual
determination by the Corporation (including its Board of Directors or a
committee thereof, its stockholders or independent legal counsel) that the
Indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall create a
presumption that the Indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct
or, in the case of such a suit brought by the Indemnitee, be a defense to
such suit. In any suit brought by an Indemnitee to enforce a right
to indemnification or to an Advancement of Expenses hereunder, or brought by
the Corporation to recover an Advancement of Expenses hereunder pursuant to
the terms of an Undertaking, the burden of proving that the Indemnitee is not
entitled to be indemnified, or to such Advancement of Expenses, shall be on
the Corporation.

  



    

Ex A-1-14

 



    



  

Section 5. _Non-Exclusivity of Rights_. The rights to indemnification and to
the Advancement of Expenses conferred in this Article IX shall not be
exclusive of any other right which any person may have or hereafter acquire
under any statute, this Second Amended and Restated Certificate, the Bylaws,
any agreement, any vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or
otherwise. Nothing contained in this Article IX shall limit or otherwise
affect any such other right or the Corporation's power to confer any such
other right.

  



  

Section 6. _Insurance_. The Corporation may maintain insurance, at its
expense, to protect itself and any director, officer, employee or agent of the
Corporation or another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or
other enterprise against any expense, liability or loss, whether or not the
Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such
expense, liability or loss under the DGCL.

  



  

Section 7. _No Duplication of Payments_. The Corporation shall not be liable
under this Article IX to make any payment to an Indemnitee in respect of any
Indemnifiable Losses to the extent that the Indemnitee has otherwise actually
received payment (net of any expenses incurred in connection therewith and
any repayment by the Indemnitee made with respect thereto) under any insurance
policy or from any other source in respect of such Indemnifiable Losses.

  



  

 _Article X_ _ 
 CORPORATE OPPORTUNITIES_

  



  

The Corporation renounces, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any
interest or expectancy of the Corporation in, or in being offered an
opportunity to participate in, any Excluded Opportunity pursuant to Section
122(17) of the DGCL. An "Excluded Opportunity" is any matter, transaction or
interest that is presented to, or acquired, created or developed by, or which
otherwise comes into the possession of (i) any director of the Corporation
who is not an employee of the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries, or (ii)
any holder of Common Stock or Preferred Stock or any partner, member,
director, stockholder, employee or agent of any such holder, other than
someone who is an employee of the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries
(collectively, "Covered Persons"), unless such matter, transaction or
interest is presented to, or acquired, created or developed by, or
otherwise comes into the possession of, a Covered Person expressly and solely
in such Covered Person's capacity as a director of the Corporation, such
opportunity is one the Corporation is legally and contractually permitted to
undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for the Corporation to pursue,
and to the extent the director is permitted to refer that opportunity to the
Corporation without violating any legal or contractual obligation. Any
amendment, repeal or modification of the foregoing provisions of this Article
X shall not adversely affect any right or protection of any director, officer
or other agent of the Corporation existing at the time of such amendment,
repeal or modification.

  



    

Ex A-1-15

 



    



  

 _Article XI_ _ 
 AMENDMENTS_

  



  

The Corporation reserves the right to amend, alter, change or repeal any
provision contained in this Second Amended and Restated Certificate
(including any Preferred Stock Designation), in the manner now or hereafter
prescribed by this Second Amended and Restated Certificate and the DGCL, all
rights, preferences and privileges herein conferred upon stockholders,
directors or any other persons by and pursuant to this Second Amended and
Restated Certificate in its present form or as hereafter amended are granted
subject to the right reserved in this Article XI. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in this Second Amended and Restated Certificate or the
Bylaws, and notwithstanding that a lesser percentage or vote may be permitted
from time to time by applicable law, no provision of Article IV, Article VII,
Article IX, Article X, and this Article XI (except by virtue of a filing of a
Preferred Stock Designation, but subject to any vote required by law or by
other provisions of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate with respect
to such Preferred Stock Designation) may be altered, amended or repealed in
any respect, nor may any provision of this Second Amended and Restated
Certificate or of the Bylaws inconsistent therewith be adopted, unless in
addition to any other vote required by this Second Amended and Restated
Certificate or otherwise required by law, such alteration, amendment, repeal
or adoption is approved at a meeting of the stockholders called for that
purpose by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 662⁄3% of the
voting power of all outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation
entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a
single class; provided, however, that, so long as the Shareholders' Agreement
remains in effect, no provision of this Second Amended and Restated
Certificate may be amended, altered or repealed in any manner that would be
contrary to or inconsistent with the terms of the Shareholders' Agreement.

  



  

 _Article XII_ _ 
 EXCLUSIVE FORUM FOR CERTAIN LAWSUITS_

  



  

Section 1. _Forum_. Unless the Corporation consents in writing to the
selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware (the " _Court of Chancery_ ") shall be the sole and exclusive forum
for any stockholder to bring (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought
on behalf of the Corporation, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a
fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer or other employee of the
Corporation to the Corporation or the Corporation's stockholders, (iii) any
action asserting a claim against the Corporation, its directors, officers or
employees arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL or this Second
Amended and Restated Certificate or the Bylaws or as to which the DGCL confers
jurisdiction on the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, or (iv) any
action asserting a claim against the Corporation, its directors, officers
or employees governed by the internal affairs doctrine, except for, as to
each of (i) through (iv) above, any claim (A) as to which the Court of
Chancery determines that there is an indispensable party not subject to the
jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery (and the indispensable party does not
consent to the personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery within ten days
following such determination), (B) which is vested in the exclusive
jurisdiction of a court or forum other than the Court of Chancery, (C)
for which the Court of Chancery does not have subject matter jurisdiction, or
(D) arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, as to which the
Court of Chancery and the federal district court for the District of Delaware
shall have concurrent jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
provisions of this _Section 1_ will not apply to suits brought to enforce a
duty or liability created by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended,
or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive
jurisdiction. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any
interest in any security of the Corporation shall be deemed to have notice of
any consented to the provisions of this _Section 1_.

Article I 
 OFFICES

  



  

Section 1.1 Registered Office. The registered office of the Corporation
within the State of Delaware shall be located at the office of the
Corporation's registered agent as stated in the Corporation's Amended and
Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as the same may be amended or
restated from time to time (the " _Certificate of Incorporation_ ").

  



  

Section 1.2 Additional Offices. The Corporation may, in addition to its
registered office in the State of Delaware, have such other offices and places
of business, both within and outside the State of Delaware, as the Board of
Directors of the Corporation (the " _Board_ ") may from time to time
determine or as the business and affairs of the Corporation may require.

  



  

Article II 
 STOCKHOLDERS MEETINGS

  



  

Section 2.1 Annual Meetings. The annual meeting of stockholders shall be held
at such place, either within or without the State of Delaware, and time and on
such date as shall be determined by the Board and stated in the notice of the
meeting, provided that the Board may in its sole discretion determine that
the meeting shall not be held at any place, but may instead be held solely by
means of remote communication pursuant to _Section 9.5(a)_. At each annual
meeting, the stockholders shall elect those directors of the Corporation to
fill any term of a directorship that expires on the date of such annual
meeting and may transact any other business as may properly be brought before
the meeting.

  



  

Section 2.2 Special Meetings. Subject to the rights, if any, of the holders
of any outstanding series of the preferred stock of the Corporation ("
_Preferred Stock_ "), and to the requirements of applicable law, special
meetings of stockholders of the Corporation may be called only by the
Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer, or the Board pursuant to a
resolution adopted by a majority of the Board and the ability of the
stockholders to call a special meeting is hereby specifically denied. Except
as provided in the foregoing sentence, special meetings of the stockholders
may not be called by another person or persons.

  



  

Section 2.3 Notices. Notice of each stockholders meeting stating the place,
if any, date, and time of the meeting, and the means of remote communication,
if any, by which stockholders and proxy holders may be deemed to be present
in person and vote at such meeting, and the record date for determining the
stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, if such date is different from
the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of the
meeting, shall be given in the manner permitted by Section 9.3 to each
stockholder entitled to vote thereat as of the record date for determining
the stockholders entitled to notice of the meeting, by the Corporation
not less than 10 nor more than 60 days before the date of the meeting unless
otherwise required by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware
(the " _DGCL_ "). If said notice is for a stockholders meeting other than an
annual meeting, it shall in addition state the purpose or purposes for which
the meeting is called, and the business transacted at such meeting shall be
limited to the matters so stated in the Corporation's notice of meeting
(or any supplement thereto). Any meeting of stockholders as to which notice
has been given may be postponed, and any meeting of stockholders as to which
notice has been given may be cancelled, by the Board upon public announcement
(as defined in _Section 2.7(c)_ ) given before the date previously scheduled
for such meeting.

  



    

Ex A-2-1

 



    



  

Section 2.4 Quorum. Except as otherwise provided by applicable law, the
Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, the presence, in person or by
proxy, at a stockholders meeting of the holders of shares of outstanding
capital stock of the Corporation representing a majority of the voting power
of all outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote
at such meeting shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at
such meeting, except that when specified business is to be voted on by a class
or series of stock voting as a class, the holders of shares representing a
majority of the voting power of the outstanding shares of such class or
series shall constitute a quorum of such class or series for the transaction
of such business. If a quorum shall not be present or represented by proxy at
any meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation, the chairman of the
meeting may adjourn the meeting from time to time in the manner provided in
_Section 2.6_ until a quorum shall attend. The stockholders present at a duly
convened meeting may continue to transact business until adjournment,
notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough stockholders to leave less than a
quorum. Shares of its own stock belonging to the Corporation or to another
corporation, if a majority of the voting power of the shares entitled to vote
in the election of directors of such other corporation is held, directly or
indirectly, by the Corporation, shall neither be entitled to vote nor be
counted for quorum purposes; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not
limit the right of the Corporation or any such other corporation to vote
shares held by it in a fiduciary capacity.

  



  

Section 2.5 Voting of Shares.

  



  

(a) _Voting Lists_. The Corporation shall prepare, at least 10 days before
every meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders of record
entitled to vote at such meeting; provided, however, if the record date for
determining the stockholders entitled to vote is less than 10 days before the
meeting date, the list shall reflect the stockholders entitled to vote as of
the tenth day before the meeting date, arranged in alphabetical order and
showing the address and the number of shares registered in the name of each
stockholder. Nothing contained in this _Section 2.5(a)_ shall require the
Corporation to include electronic mail addresses or other electronic contact
information on such list. Such list shall be open to the examination of any
stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting, during ordinary business
hours for a period of at least 10 days prior to the meeting: (i) on a
reasonably accessible electronic network, provided that the information
required to gain access to such list is provided with the notice of the
meeting, or (ii) during ordinary business hours, at the principal place of
business of the Corporation. In the event that the Corporation determines to
make the list available on an electronic network, the Corporation may take
reasonable steps to ensure that such information is available only to
stockholders of the Corporation. If the meeting is to be held at a place, then
the list shall be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting
during the whole time thereof, and may be examined by any stockholder who is
present. If a meeting of stockholders is to be held solely by means of remote
communication as permitted by _Section 9.5(a)_ , the list shall be open to
the examination of any stockholder during the whole time of the meeting on a
reasonably accessible electronic network, and the information required to
access such list shall be provided with the notice of meeting. The stock
ledger shall be the only evidence as to who are the stockholders entitled to
examine the list required by this _Section 2.5(a)_ or to vote in person or by
proxy at any meeting of stockholders.

  



  

(b) _Manner of Voting_. At any stockholders meeting, every stockholder
entitled to vote may vote in person or by proxy. If authorized by the Board,
the voting by stockholders or proxy holders at any meeting conducted by
remote communication may be effected by a ballot submitted by electronic
transmission (as defined in _Section 9.3_ ), provided that any such
electronic transmission must either set forth or be submitted with
information from which the Corporation can determine that the electronic
transmission was authorized by the stockholder or proxy holder. The Board, in
its discretion, or the chairman of the meeting of stockholders, in such
person's discretion, may require that any votes cast at such meeting shall be
cast by written ballot.

  



  

(c) _Proxies_. Each stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders
or to express consent or dissent to corporate action in writing without a
meeting may authorize another person or persons to act for such stockholder
by proxy, but no such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three
years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period. Without
limiting the manner in which a stockholder may authorize another person or
persons to act for such stockholder as proxy, either of the following shall
constitute a valid means by which a stockholder may grant such authority.

  



  

(i) A stockholder may execute a document authorizing another person or
persons to act for such stockholder as proxy. Execution may be accomplished by
the stockholder or such stockholder's authorized officer, director, employee
or agent.

  



  

(ii) A stockholder may authorize another person or persons to act for such
stockholder as proxy by transmitting or authorizing the transmission of an
electronic transmission to the person who will be the holder of the proxy or
to a proxy solicitation firm, proxy support service organization or like
agent duly authorized by the person who will be the holder of the proxy to
receive such transmission, provided that any such transmission must either
set forth or be submitted with information from which it can be determined
that the transmission was authorized by the stockholder.

  



    

Ex A-2-2

 



    



  

Any copy, facsimile telecommunication or other reliable reproduction of the
document (including any electronic transmission) authorizing another
person or persons to act as proxy for a stockholder may be substituted or
used in lieu of the document for any and all purposes for which the original
document could be used; provided that such copy, facsimile telecommunication
or other reproduction shall be a complete reproduction of the entire
document.

  



  

(d) _Required Vote_. Subject to the rights of the holders of one or more
series of Preferred Stock, voting separately by class or series, to elect
directors pursuant to the terms of one or more series of Preferred Stock, at
all meetings of stockholders at which a quorum is present, the election of
directors shall be determined by a plurality of the votes cast by the
stockholders present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and
entitled to vote thereon. All other matters presented to the stockholders at a
meeting at which a quorum is present shall be determined by the vote of a
majority of the votes cast by the stockholders present in person or
represented by proxy at the meeting, unless the matter is one upon which, by
applicable law, the Certificate of Incorporation, these Bylaws or applicable
stock exchange rules, a different or minimum vote is required, in which case
the different or minimum vote shall be the required vote for such matter.

  



  

(e) _Inspectors of Election_. The Board may, and shall if required by law, in
advance of any meeting of stockholders, appoint one or more persons as
inspectors of election, who may be employees of the Corporation or otherwise
serve the Corporation in other capacities, to act at such meeting of
stockholders or any adjournment thereof and to make a written report thereof.
The Board may designate one or more persons as alternate inspectors to
replace any inspector who fails to act. If no inspectors of election or
alternates are appointed by the Board, the chairman of the meeting shall
appoint one or more inspectors to act at the meeting. Each inspector, before
discharging his or her duties, shall take and sign an oath faithfully to
execute the duties of inspector with strict impartiality and according to the
best of his or her ability. The inspectors shall ascertain and report the
number of outstanding shares and the voting power of each; determine the
number of shares present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and
the validity of proxies and ballots; count all votes and ballots and report
the results; determine and retain for a reasonable period a record of the
disposition of any challenges made to any determination by the inspectors;
and certify their determination of the number of shares represented at the
meeting and their count of all votes and ballots. No person who is a
candidate for an office at an election may serve as an inspector at such
election. Each report of an inspector shall be in writing and signed by the
inspector or by a majority of them if there is more than one inspector acting
at such meeting. If there is more than one inspector, the report of a majority
shall be the report of the inspectors.

  



  

Section 2.6 Adjournments. Any meeting of stockholders, annual or special, may
be adjourned, from time to time, whether or not there is a quorum, to
reconvene at the same or some other place. Notice need not be given of any
such adjourned meeting if the date, time, and place, if any, thereof, and the
means of remote communication, if any, by which stockholders and proxy holders
may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such adjourned meeting are
announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken. At the adjourned
meeting the stockholders, or the holders of any class or series of stock
entitled to vote separately as a class, as the case may be, may transact any
business that might have been transacted at the original meeting. If the
adjournment is for more than 30 days, notice of the adjourned meeting shall
be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting. If
after the adjournment a new record date for stockholders entitled to vote is
fixed for the adjourned meeting, the Board shall fix a new record date for
notice of such adjourned meeting in accordance with _Section 9.2_ , and shall
give notice of the adjourned meeting to each stockholder of record entitled
to vote at such adjourned meeting as of the record date fixed for notice of
such adjourned meeting.

  



  

Section 2.7 Advance Notice for Business.

  



  

(a) _Annual Meetings of Stockholders_. No business may be transacted at an
annual meeting of stockholders, other than business that is either (i)
specified in the Corporation's notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto),
(ii) otherwise properly brought before the annual meeting by or at the
direction of the Board or duly authorized committee thereof or (iii)
otherwise properly brought before the annual meeting by any stockholder of
the Corporation (x) who is a stockholder of record on the date of the giving
of the notice provided for in this _Section 2.7(a)_  and on the record date
for the determination of stockholders entitled to vote at such annual meeting
and (y) who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this _Section
2.7(a)_. Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 2.7(a)_ to the
contrary, only persons nominated for election as a director pursuant to
_Section 3.2_ will be considered for election at such meeting.

  



    

Ex A-2-3

 



    



  

(i) In addition to any other applicable requirements, for business (other
than nominations) to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a
stockholder, such stockholder must have given timely advance notice thereof
in proper written form to the Secretary of the Corporation and such business
must otherwise be a proper matter for stockholder action. Subject to _Section
2.7(a)(iii)_ , a stockholder's notice to the Secretary with respect to such
business, to be timely must be delivered to the Secretary or mailed and
received at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not later than
the close of business on the 90th day nor earlier than the close of business
on the 120th day before the anniversary date of the immediately preceding
annual meeting of stockholders; provided, however, that in the event that the
annual meeting is more than 30 days before or more than 70 days after such
anniversary date, notice by the stockholder to be timely must be so delivered
not earlier than the close of business on the 120th day before the meeting and
not later than the later of (x) the close of business on the 90th day before
the meeting or (y) the close of business on the 10th day following the day on
which public announcement of the date of the annual meeting is first made by
the Corporation. The public announcement of an adjournment or postponement of
an annual meeting shall not commence a new time period (or extend any time
period) for the giving of a stockholder's notice as described in this
_Section 2.7(a)_.

  



  

(ii) To be in proper written form, a stockholder's notice to the Secretary
with respect to any business (other than nominations) must set forth as to
each such matter such stockholder proposes to bring before the annual meeting
(A) a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the
annual meeting, the text of the proposal or business (including the text of
any resolutions proposed for consideration and in the event such
business includes a proposal to amend these Bylaws, the language of the
proposed amendment) and the reasons for conducting such business at the
annual meeting, (B) the name and record address of such stockholder and the
name and address of the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the
proposal is made, (C) the class or series and number of shares of capital
stock of the Corporation that are owned beneficially and of record by such
stockholder and by the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the proposal
is made, (D) a description of all arrangements or understandings between such
stockholder and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the proposal is
made and any other person or persons (including their names) in connection
with the proposal of such business by such stockholder, (E) any material
interest of such stockholder and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf
the proposal is made in such business and (F) a representation that such
stockholder (or a qualified representative of such stockholder) intends to
appear in person or by proxy at the annual meeting to bring such business
before the meeting.

  



  

(iii) The foregoing notice requirements of this _Section 2.7(a)_ shall be
deemed satisfied by a stockholder as to any proposal (other than nominations)
if the stockholder has notified the Corporation of such stockholder's
intention to present such proposal at an annual meeting in compliance with
Rule 14a-8 (or any successor thereof) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended (the " _Exchange Act_ "), and such stockholder has complied with
the requirements of such Rule for inclusion of such proposal in a proxy
statement prepared by the Corporation to solicit proxies for such annual
meeting. No business shall be conducted at the annual meeting of
stockholders except business brought before the annual meeting in accordance
with the procedures set forth in this _Section 2.7(a)_. If the Board or the
chairman of the annual meeting determines that any stockholder proposal was
not made in accordance with the provisions of this _Section 2.7(a)_ or that
the information provided in a stockholder's notice does not satisfy the
information requirements of this _Section 2.7(a)_ , such proposal shall not
be presented for action at the annual meeting. Notwithstanding the foregoing
provisions of this _Section 2.7(a)_ , if the stockholder (or a qualified
representative of the stockholder) does not appear at the annual meeting of
stockholders of the Corporation to present the proposed business, such
proposed business shall not be transacted, notwithstanding that proxies in
respect of such matter may have been received by the Corporation.

  



  

(iv) In addition to the provisions of this  _Section 2.7(a)_ , a stockholder
shall also comply with all applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the
rules and regulations thereunder with respect to the matters set forth
herein. Nothing in this _Section 2.7(a)_ shall be deemed to affect any
rights of stockholders to request inclusion of proposals in the Corporation's
proxy statement pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act.

  



    

Ex A-2-4

 



    



  

(b) _Special Meetings of Stockholders_. Only such business shall be conducted
at a special meeting of stockholders as shall have been brought before the
meeting pursuant to the Corporation's notice of meeting. Nominations of
persons for election to the Board may be made at a special meeting of
stockholders at which directors are to be elected pursuant to the
Corporation's notice of meeting only pursuant to _Section 3.2_.

  



  

(c) _Public Announcement_. For purposes of these Bylaws, " _public
announcement_ " shall mean disclosure in a press release reported by the Dow
Jones News Service, Associated Press or comparable national news service or
in a document publicly filed by the Corporation with the Securities and
Exchange Commission pursuant to Sections 13, 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act
(or any successor thereto).

Executive Officer (if he or she shall be a director) or, in the absence (or
inability or refusal to act) of the Chief Executive Officer or if the Chief
Executive Officer is not a director, the President (if he or she shall be a
director) or, in the absence (or inability or refusal to act) of the President
or if the President is not a director, such other person as shall be
appointed by the Board. The Board may adopt such rules and regulations for the
conduct of the meeting of stockholders as it shall deem appropriate. Except
to the extent inconsistent with these Bylaws or such rules and regulations as
adopted by the Board, the chairman of any meeting of stockholders shall have
the right and authority to convene and (for any or no reason) to recess
and/or adjourn the meeting, to prescribe such rules, regulations and
procedures and to do all such acts as, in the judgment of such chairman, are
appropriate for the proper conduct of the meeting. Such rules, regulations or
procedures, whether adopted by the Board or prescribed by the chairman of the
meeting, may include, without limitation, the following: (a) the
establishment of an agenda or order of business for the meeting; (b) rules and
procedures for maintaining order at the meeting and the safety of those
present; (c) limitations on attendance at or participation in the meeting to
stockholders of record of the Corporation, their duly authorized and
constituted proxies or such other persons as the chairman of the
meeting shall determine; (d) restrictions on entry to the meeting after the
time fixed for the commencement thereof; and (e) limitations on the time
allotted to questions or comments by participants. Unless and to the extent
determined by the Board or the chairman of the meeting, meetings of
stockholders shall not be required to be held in accordance with the rules of
parliamentary procedure. The secretary of each annual and special meeting of
stockholders shall be the Secretary or, in the absence (or inability or
refusal to act) of the Secretary, an Assistant Secretary so appointed to act
by the chairman of the meeting. In the absence (or inability or refusal to
act) of the Secretary and all Assistant Secretaries, the chairman of the
meeting may appoint any person to act as secretary of the meeting.

  



  

Section 2.9 Consents in Lieu of Meeting. Except as may be otherwise provided
for or fixed pursuant to the Certificate of Incorporation relating to the
rights of the holders of any outstanding series of Preferred Stock, any
action required or permitted to be taken by the stockholders of the
Corporation must be effected by a duly called annual or special meeting of
such stockholders and may not be effected by written consent of the
stockholders of the Corporation.

  



  

Article III 
 DIRECTORS

  



  

Section 3.1 Powers. The business and affairs of the Corporation shall be
managed by or under the direction of the Board, which may exercise all
such powers of the Corporation and do all such lawful acts and things as are
not by statute or by the Certificate of Incorporation or by these Bylaws
required to be exercised or done by the stockholders. Directors need not be
stockholders or residents of the State of Delaware.

  



  

Section 3.2 Advance Notice for Nomination of Directors.

  



  

(a) Only persons who are nominated in accordance with the following
procedures shall be eligible for election as directors of the
Corporation, except as may be otherwise provided by the terms of one or more
series of Preferred Stock with respect to the rights of holders of one or
more series of Preferred Stock to elect directors or as contemplated by and
pursuant to the terms of the Shareholders' Agreement, dated as of [●], 2019,
by and among the Corporation, Boxwood Merger Sponsor LLC, [Bernhard Capital
Partners Management LP] and other parties thereto (as it may be amended
and/or restated from time to time, the "Shareholders'
Agreement"). Nominations of persons for election to the Board at any annual
meeting of stockholders, or at any special meeting of stockholders called for
the purpose of electing directors as set forth in the Corporation's notice of
such special meeting, may be made (i) by or at the direction of the Board or
a duly authorized committee thereof or (ii) by any stockholder of the
Corporation (x) who is a stockholder of record on the date of the giving of
the notice provided for in this _Section 3.2_ and on the record date for the
determination of stockholders entitled to vote at such meeting and (y) who
complies with the notice procedures set forth in this _Section 3.2_.

  



    

Ex A-2-5

 



    



  

(b) In addition to any other applicable requirements, for a nomination to be
made by a stockholder, such stockholder must have given timely notice thereof
in proper written form to the Secretary of the Corporation. To be timely, a
stockholder's notice to the Secretary must be delivered to the Secretary at
the principal executive offices of the Corporation (i) in the case of an
annual meeting, not later than the close of business on the 90th day nor
earlier than the close of business on the 120th day before the anniversary
date of the immediately preceding annual meeting of stockholders; provided,
however, that in the event that the annual meeting is more than 30 days
before or more than 70 days after such anniversary date, notice by the
stockholder to be timely must be so delivered not earlier than the close of
business on the 120th day before the meeting and not later than the later of
(x) the close of business on the 90th day before the meeting or (y) the close
of business on the 10th day following the day on which public announcement of
the date of the annual meeting was first made by the Corporation; and (ii) in
the case of a special meeting of stockholders called for the purpose of
electing directors, not later than the close of business on the 10th day
following the day on which public announcement of the date of the special
meeting is first made by the Corporation. In no event shall the public
announcement of an adjournment or postponement of an annual meeting or
special meeting commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for the
giving of a stockholder's notice as described in this _Section 3.2_.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding anything in _Section 3.2(b)_ to the contrary, in the
event that the number of directors to be elected to the Board at an annual
meeting is greater than the number of directors whose terms expire on the
date of the annual meeting and there is no public announcement by the
Corporation naming all of the nominees for the additional directors to be
elected or specifying the size of the increased Board before the close of
business on the 100th day prior to the anniversary date of the immediately
preceding annual meeting of stockholders, a stockholder's notice required by
this _Section 3.2_ shall also be considered timely, but only with respect to
nominees for the additional directorships created by such increase that are
to be filled by election at such annual meeting, if it shall be delivered to
the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not later
than the close of business on the 10th day following the date on which such
public announcement was first made by the Corporation.

  



  

(d) To be in proper written form, a stockholder's notice to the Secretary
must set forth (i) as to each person whom the stockholder proposes to nominate

(a) If an owner of a certificate representing shares claims that such
certificate has been lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken, the Corporation

(iii) the Corporation has received a guarantee of signature of the person
signing such endorsement or instruction or such other reasonable assurance
that the endorsement or instruction is genuine and authorized as the

records of the Corporation, vote such shares, receive dividends or
notifications with respect to such shares and otherwise exercise all
the rights and powers of the owner of such shares, except that a person who
is the beneficial owner of such shares (if held in a voting trust or by a

may be owned by any person or group of persons, if permitted by the DGCL and
noted conspicuously on the certificate representing such shares or, in the
case of uncertificated shares, contained in a notice sent pursuant to _Section
7.2_ , may be enforced against the holder of such shares or any successor or
transferee of the holder including an executor, administrator, trustee,
guardian or other fiduciary entrusted with like responsibility for the person
or estate of the holder.

  



  

(b) A restriction imposed by the Corporation on the transfer or the
registration of shares of the Corporation or on the amount of shares of the
Corporation that may be owned by any person or group of persons, even if
otherwise lawful, is ineffective against a person without actual knowledge of
such restriction unless: (i) the shares are certificated and such restriction
is noted conspicuously on the certificate; or (ii) the shares
are uncertificated and such restriction was contained in a notice sent
pursuant to _Section 7.2_.

  



  

Section 7.9 Regulations. The Board shall have power and authority to make
such additional rules and regulations, subject to any applicable requirement
of law, as the Board may deem necessary and appropriate with respect to the

by the DGCL and any other applicable law, as the same exists or may hereafter

and amounts paid in settlement) reasonably incurred or suffered by such
Indemnitee in connection therewith (" _Indemnifiable Losses_ "); _provided,

such Indemnitee, including without limitation service to an employee benefit
plan) shall be made pursuant to this Section 8.2 only upon delivery to the
Corporation of an undertaking (an " _Undertaking_ "), by or on behalf of such
Indemnitee, to repay, without interest, all amounts so advanced if it shall
ultimately be determined by final judicial decision from which there is no
further right to appeal (a " _Final Adjudication_ ") that such Indemnitee is
not entitled to be indemnified for such expenses under this Section 8.2. An
Indemnitee's right to an Advancement of Expenses pursuant to this Section 8.2
is not subject to the satisfaction of any standard of conduct and is not
conditioned upon any prior determination that Indemnitee is entitled to
indemnification under Section 8.1 of this Article VIII with respect to the
related Proceeding or the absence of any prior determination to the contrary.

  



    

Ex A-2-13

 



    



  

Section 8.3 Contract Rights. The rights to indemnification and to the
Advancement of Expenses conferred in Sections 8.1 and 8.2 of this Article VIII
shall be contract rights and such rights shall continue as to an Indemnitee
who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure
to the benefit of the Indemnitee's heirs, executors and administrators

  



  

Section 8.4 Right of Indemnitee to Bring Suit. If a claim under Section 8.1
or 8.2 of this Article VIII is not paid in full by the Corporation within 60
calendar days after a written claim has been received by the Corporation,
except in the case of a claim for an Advancement of Expenses, in which case
the applicable period shall be 20 calendar days, the Indemnitee may at any
time thereafter bring suit against the Corporation to recover the unpaid
amount of the claim. If successful in whole or in part in any such suit, or
in a suit brought by the Corporation to recover an Advancement of Expenses
pursuant to the terms of an Undertaking, the Indemnitee shall be entitled to
the fullest extent permitted or required by the DGCL, as the same exists or
may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the
extent that such amendment permits the Corporation to provide
broader reimbursements of prosecution or defense expenses than such law
permitted the Corporation to provide prior to such amendment), to be paid
also the expense of prosecuting or defending such suit. In (i) any suit
brought by the Indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification hereunder
(but not in a suit brought by the Indemnitee to enforce a right to an
Advancement of Expenses) it shall be a defense that, and (ii) any suit
brought by the Corporation to recover an Advancement of Expenses pursuant to
the terms of an Undertaking, the Corporation shall be entitled to recover
such expenses, without interest, upon a Final Adjudication that, the
Indemnitee has not met any applicable standard for indemnification set forth
in the DGCL. Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its Board of
Directors or a committee thereof, its stockholders or independent legal
counsel) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such suit
that indemnification of the Indemnitee is proper in the circumstances because
the Indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the
DGCL, nor an actual determination by the Corporation (including its Board or
a committee thereof, its stockholders or independent legal counsel) that the
Indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall create a
presumption that the Indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct
or, in the case of such a suit brought by the Indemnitee, be a defense to
such suit. In any suit brought by an Indemnitee to enforce a right to
indemnification or to an Advancement of Expenses hereunder, or brought by the
Corporation to recover an Advancement of Expenses hereunder pursuant to the
terms of an Undertaking, the burden of proving that the Indemnitee is not
entitled to be indemnified, or to such Advancement of Expenses, shall be on
the Corporation.

  



  

Section 8.5 Non-Exclusivity of Rights. The rights to indemnification and to
the Advancement of Expenses conferred in this Article VIII shall not be
exclusive of any other right which any person may have or hereafter acquire
under any statute, the Certificate of Incorporation, these Bylaws, any
agreement, any vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise.
Nothing contained in this Article VIII shall limit or otherwise affect any
such other right or the Corporation's power to confer any such other right

  



  

Section 8.6 Insurance. The Corporation may maintain insurance, at its
expense, to protect itself and any director, officer, employee or agent of the
Corporation or another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or
other enterprise against any expense, liability or loss, whether or not the
Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such
expense, liability or loss under the DGCL.

  



  

Section 8.7 No Duplication of Payments. The Corporation shall not be liable
under this Article VIII to make any payment to an Indemnitee in respect of
any Indemnifiable Losses to the extent that the Indemnitee has otherwise
actually received payment (net of any expenses incurred in connection
therewith and any repayment by the Indemnitee made with respect thereto) under
any insurance policy or from any other source in respect of such
Indemnifiable Losses.

  



    

Ex A-2-14

 



    



  

Section 8.8 Amendments. Any repeal or amendment of this _Article VIII_ by the
Board or the stockholders of the Corporation or by changes in applicable law,
or the adoption of any other provision of these Bylaws inconsistent with this
_Article VIII_ , will, to the extent permitted by applicable law, be
prospective only (except to the extent such amendment or change in applicable
law permits the Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights to
Indemnitees on a retroactive basis than permitted prior thereto), and will not
in any way diminish or adversely affect any right or protection existing
hereunder in respect of any act or omission occurring prior to such repeal or
amendment or adoption of such inconsistent provision; provided however, that
amendments or repeals of this _Article VIII by the stockholders_ shall
require the affirmative vote of the stockholders holding at least 662⁄3%  of
the voting power of all outstanding shares of capital stock of the
Corporation.

  



  

Section 8.9 Severability. If any provision or provisions of this _Article
VIII_ shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason
whatsoever: (a) the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining
provisions of this _Article VIII_ shall not in any way be affected or
impaired thereby; and (b) to the fullest extent possible, the provisions of
this _Article VIII_ (including, without limitation, each such portion of this
_Article VIII_ containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable) shall be construed so as to give effect to the intent
manifested by the provision held invalid, illegal or unenforceable.

  



  

Article IX 
 MISCELLANEOUS

  



  

Section 9.1 Place of Meetings. If the place of any meeting of stockholders,
the Board or committee of the Board for which notice is required under these
Bylaws is not designated in the notice of such meeting, such meeting shall be
held at the principal business office of the Corporation; provided, however,
if the Board has, in its sole discretion, determined that a meeting shall not
be held at any place, but instead shall be held by means of remote
communication pursuant to _Section 9.5_ hereof, then such meeting shall not be
held at any place.

  



  

Section 9.2 Fixing Record Dates.

  



  

(a) In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to
notice of any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, the Board
may fix a record date, which shall not precede the date upon which the
resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board, and which record
date shall not be more than 60 nor less than 10 days before the date of such
meeting. If the Board so fixes a date, such date shall also be the record
date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote at such meeting unless
the Board determines, at the time it fixes such record date, that a later
date on or before the date of the meeting shall be the date for making such
determination. If no record date is fixed by the Board, the record date for
determining stockholders entitled to notice of and to vote at a meeting of
stockholders shall be at the close of business on the business day next
preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the
close of business on the business day next preceding the day on which the
meeting is held. A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice
of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of
the meeting; provided, however, that the Board may fix a new record date for
the adjourned meeting, and in such case shall also fix as the record date for
stockholders entitled to notice of such adjourned meeting the same or an
earlier date as that fixed for determination of stockholders entitled to vote
in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this _Section 9.2(a)_ at the
adjourned meeting.

  



  

(b) In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to
receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any
rights or the stockholders entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any
change, conversion or exchange of stock, or for the purpose of any other
lawful action, the Board may fix a record date, which record date shall not
precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted,
and which record date shall be not more than 60 days prior to such action. If
no record date is fixed, the record date for determining stockholders for any
such purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board
adopts the resolution relating thereto.

  



    

Ex A-2-15

 



    



  

(c) Unless otherwise restricted by the Certificate of Incorporation, in order
that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to express
consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, the Board may fix a
record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the
resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board, and which record
date shall not be more than ten (10) days after the date upon which the
resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board. If no record date
for determining stockholders entitled to express consent to corporate action
in writing without a meeting is fixed by the Board, (i) when no prior action
of the Board is required by law, the record date for such purpose shall be
the first date on which a signed written consent setting forth the
action taken or proposed to be taken is delivered to the Corporation in
accordance with applicable law, and (ii) if prior action by the Board is
required by law, the record date for such purpose shall be at the close of
business on the day on which the Board adopts the resolution taking such
prior action.

  



  

Section 9.3 Means of Giving Notice.

  



  

(a) _Notice to Directors_. Whenever under applicable law, the Certificate of
Incorporation or these Bylaws notice is required to be given to any director,
such notice shall be given either (i) in writing and sent by mail, or by a
nationally recognized delivery service, (ii) by means of
facsimile telecommunication or other form of electronic transmission, or
(iii) by oral notice given personally or by telephone. A notice to a director
will be deemed given as follows: (i) if given by hand delivery, orally, or by
telephone, when actually received by the director, (ii) if sent through the
United States mail, when deposited in the United States mail, with postage and
fees thereon prepaid, addressed to the director at the director's address
appearing on the records of the Corporation, (iii) if sent for next day
delivery by a nationally recognized overnight delivery service, when deposited
with such service, with fees thereon prepaid, addressed to the director at
the director's address appearing on the records of the Corporation, (iv) if
sent by facsimile telecommunication, when sent to the facsimile transmission
number for such director appearing on the records of the Corporation, (v) if
sent by electronic mail, when sent to the electronic mail address for such
director appearing on the records of the Corporation, or (vi) if sent by any
other form of electronic transmission, when sent to the address, location or
number (as applicable) for such director appearing on the records of the
Corporation.

  



  

(b) _Electronic Transmission_. " _Electronic transmission_ " means any form
of communication, not directly involving the physical transmission of paper,
that creates a record that may be retained, retrieved and reviewed by a
recipient thereof, and that may be directly reproduced in paper form by such
a recipient through an automated process.

  



  

(c) _Notice to Stockholders Sharing Same Address_. Without limiting the
manner by which notice otherwise may be given effectively by the Corporation
to stockholders, any notice to stockholders given by the Corporation under
any provision of the DGCL, the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws
shall be effective if given by a single written notice to stockholders who
share an address if consented to by the stockholders at that address to whom
such notice is given. A stockholder may revoke such stockholder's consent by
delivering written notice of such revocation to the Corporation. Any
stockholder who fails to object in writing to the Corporation within 60 days
of having been given written notice by the Corporation of its intention to
send such a single written notice shall be deemed to have consented to
receiving such single written notice.

  



  

(d) _Exceptions to Notice Requirements_. Whenever notice is required to be
given, under the DGCL, the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, to
any person with whom communication is unlawful, the giving of such notice to
such person shall not be required and there shall be no duty to apply to any
governmental authority or agency for a license or permit to give such notice
to such person. Any action or meeting that shall be taken or held without
notice to any such person with whom communication is unlawful shall have the
same force and effect as if such notice had been duly given. In the event
that the action taken by the Corporation is such as to require the filing of
a certificate with the Secretary of State of Delaware, the certificate shall
state, if such is the fact and if notice is required, that notice was given
to all persons entitled to receive notice except such persons with whom
communication is unlawful.

  



    

Ex A-2-16

 



    



  

Whenever notice is required to be given by the Corporation, under any
provision of the DGCL, the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws,
to any stockholder to whom (1) notice of two consecutive annual meetings of
stockholders and all notices of stockholder meetings or of the taking of
action by written consent of stockholders without a meeting to such
stockholder during the period between such two consecutive annual meetings,
or (2) all, and at least two payments (if sent by first-class mail) of
dividends or interest on securities during a 12-month period, have been
mailed addressed to such stockholder at such stockholder's address as
shown on the records of the Corporation and have been returned undeliverable,
the giving of such notice to such stockholder shall not be required. Any
action or meeting that shall be taken or held without notice to such
stockholder shall have the same force and effect as if such notice had been
duly given. If any such stockholder shall deliver to the Corporation a written
notice setting forth such stockholder's then current address, the requirement
that notice be given to such stockholder shall be reinstated. In the event
that the action taken by the Corporation is such as to require the filing of a
certificate with the Secretary of State of Delaware, the certificate need not
state that notice was not given to persons to whom notice was not required to
be given pursuant to Section 230 (b) of the DGCL. The exception in subsection
(1) of the first sentence of this paragraph to the requirement that notice be
given shall not be applicable to any notice returned as undeliverable if the
notice was given by electronic transmission.

  



  

Section 9.4 Waiver of Notice. Whenever any notice is required to be given
under applicable law, the Certificate of Incorporation, or these Bylaws, a
written waiver of such notice, signed by the person or persons entitled to
said notice, or a waiver by electronic transmission by the person entitled to
said notice, whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed
equivalent to such required notice. Attendance at a meeting shall constitute
a waiver of notice of such meeting, except where a person attends for the
express purpose of objecting at the beginning of the meeting to the
transaction of any business on the ground that the meeting was not lawfully
called or convened.

  



  

Section 9.5 Meeting Attendance via Remote Communication Equipment.

  



  

(a) _Stockholder Meetings_. If authorized by the Board in its sole
discretion, and subject to such guidelines and procedures as the Board may
adopt, stockholders and proxy holders not physically present at a meeting of
stockholders may, by means of remote communication:

  



  

(i) participate in a meeting of stockholders; and

  



  

(ii) be deemed present in person and vote at a meeting of stockholders,
whether such meeting is to be held at a designated place or solely by means of
remote communication, provided that (A) the Corporation shall implement
reasonable measures to verify that each person deemed present and permitted
to vote at the meeting by means of remote communication is a stockholder or
proxy holder, (B) the Corporation shall implement reasonable measures to
provide such stockholders and proxy holders a reasonable opportunity to
participate in the meeting and to vote on matters submitted to the
stockholders, including an opportunity to read or hear the proceedings of the
meeting substantially concurrently with such proceedings, and (C) if any
stockholder or proxy holder votes or takes other action at the meeting by
means of remote communication, a record of such votes or other action shall
be maintained by the Corporation.

  



  

(b) _Board Meetings_. Unless otherwise restricted by applicable law, the
Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, members of the Board or any
committee thereof may participate in a meeting of the Board or any committee
thereof by means of conference telephone or other communications equipment by
means of which all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other.
Such participation in a meeting shall constitute presence in person at the
meeting.

  



  

Section 9.6 Dividends. The Board may from time to time declare, and the
Corporation may pay, dividends (payable in cash, property or shares of the
Corporation's capital stock) on the Corporation's outstanding shares of
capital stock, subject to applicable law and the Certificate
of Incorporation.

  



  

Section 9.7 Reserves. The Board may set apart out of the funds of the
Corporation available for dividends a reserve or reserves for any proper
purpose and may abolish any such reserve.

  



  

Section 9.8 Contracts and Negotiable Instruments. Except as otherwise
provided by applicable law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws,
any contract, bond, deed, lease, mortgage or other instrument may be executed
and delivered in the name and on behalf of the Corporation by such officer or
officers or other employee or employees of the Corporation as the Board may
from time to time authorize. Such authority may be general or confined to
specific instances as the Board may determine. The Chairman of the Board, the
Chief Executive Officer, the President, the Chief Financial Officer, the
Treasurer or any Vice President may execute and deliver any contract, bond,
deed, lease, mortgage or other instrument in the name and on behalf of the
Corporation. Subject to any restrictions imposed by the Board, the Chairman
of the Board Chief Executive Officer, President, the Chief Financial
Officer, the Treasurer or any Vice President may delegate powers to execute
and deliver any contract, bond, deed, lease, mortgage or other instrument in
the name and on behalf of the Corporation to other officers or employees of
the Corporation under such person's supervision and authority, it being
understood, however, that any such delegation of power shall not relieve such
officer of responsibility with respect to the exercise of such delegated
power.

  



    

Ex A-2-17

 



    



  

Section 9.9 Fiscal Year. The fiscal year of the Corporation shall be fixed by
the Board.

  



  

Section 9.10 Seal. The Board may adopt a corporate seal, which shall be in
such form as the Board determines. The seal may be used by causing it or
a facsimile thereof to be impressed, affixed or otherwise reproduced.

  



  

Section 9.11 Books and Records. The books and records of the Corporation may
be kept within or outside the State of Delaware at such place or places as may
from time to time be designated by the Board.

  



  

Section 9.12 Resignation. Any director, committee member or officer may
resign by giving notice thereof in writing or by electronic transmission to
the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer, the President or the
Secretary. The resignation shall take effect at the time it is delivered
unless the resignation specifies a later effective date or an effective date
determined upon the happening of an event or events. Unless otherwise
specified therein, the acceptance of such resignation shall not be necessary
to make it effective.

  



  

Section 9.13 Surety Bonds. Such officers, employees and agents of the
Corporation (if any) as the Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer,
President or the Board may direct, from time to time, shall be bonded for the
faithful performance of their duties and for the restoration to the
Corporation, in case of their death, resignation, retirement, disqualification
or removal from office, of all books, papers, vouchers, money and other
property of whatever kind in their possession or under their control belonging
to the Corporation, in such amounts and by such surety companies as the
Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer, President or the Board may
determine. The premiums on such bonds shall be paid by the Corporation and
the bonds so furnished shall be in the custody of the Secretary.

  



  

Section 9.14 Securities of Other Corporations. Powers of attorney, proxies,
waivers of notice of meeting, consents in writing and other
instruments relating to securities owned by the Corporation may be executed
in the name of and on behalf of the Corporation by the Chairman of the Board,
Chief Executive Officer, President, or any officers authorized by the Board.
Any such officer, may, in the name of and on behalf of the Corporation, take
all such action as any such officer may deem advisable to vote in person or by
proxy at any meeting of security holders of any corporation in which the
Corporation may own securities, or to consent in writing, in the name of the
Corporation as such holder, to any action by such corporation, and at any such
meeting or with respect to any such consent shall possess and may exercise
any and all rights and power incident to the ownership of such securities and
which, as the owner thereof, the Corporation might have exercised and
possessed. The Board may from time to time confer like powers upon any other
person or persons.

  



  

Section 9.15 Conflicts. So long as the Shareholders' Agreement is in effect,
it is intended that these Bylaws be interpreted in a manner consistent with
the applicable provisions of the Shareholder's Agreement, and that such
provisions of the Shareholder's Agreement be incorporated into these Bylaws
and be a part hereof. In the event of any conflict between the terms of these
Bylaws and those contained in the Shareholders' Agreement, the terms and
provisions of the Shareholders' Agreement shall govern and control and these
Bylaws shall be construed so as to give effect to such provisions.

  



  

Section 9.16 Amendments. Subject to the Certificate of Incorporation, the
affirmative vote of a majority of the Board shall be required to adopt, amend,
alter or repeal the Bylaws. The Bylaws also may be adopted, amended, altered
or repealed by the stockholders; provided, however, that in addition to any
vote of the holders of any class or series of capital stock of the Corporation
required by applicable law or the Certificate of Incorporation, the
affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the voting (except
as otherwise provided in _Section 8.7_ ) power of all outstanding shares of
capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the
election of directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required
for the stockholders to adopt, amend, alter or repeal the Bylaws.

Ex D-13

(e) If, at any time after the Effective Time, PubCo issues a share of its
Class A Common Stock or any other Equity Security of PubCo (other than shares
of Class B Common Stock), (i) the Company shall concurrently issue to PubCo
one Common Unit (if PubCo issues a share of Class A Common Stock), or such
other Equity Security of the Company (if PubCo issues Equity Securities other
than Class A Common Stock) corresponding to the Equity Securities issued by
PubCo, and with substantially the same rights to dividends and distributions
(including distributions upon liquidation) and other economic rights as those
of such Equity Securities of PubCo to be issued and (ii) PubCo shall
concurrently contribute to the Company the net proceeds or other property
received by PubCo, if any, for such share of Class A Common Stock or other
Equity Security; _provided_ , _however_ , that if PubCo issues any shares of
Class A Common Stock in order to acquire or fund the acquisition from a
Member (other than PubCo) of a number of Common Units (and shares of Class B
Common Stock) equal to the number of shares of Class A Common Stock so
issued, then the Company shall not issue any new Common Units in
connection therewith and, where such shares of Class A Common Stock have been
issued for cash to fund an acquisition, PubCo shall not be required to
transfer such net proceeds to the Company, and such net proceeds shall instead
be transferred to such Member as consideration for such acquisition.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, this _Section 4.1(e)_ shall not apply to the
issuance and distribution to holders of shares of PubCo Common Stock of
rights to purchase Equity Securities of PubCo under a "poison pill"
or similar shareholders rights plan (and upon any redemption of Common Units
for Class A Common Stock, such Class A Common Stock will be issued together
with a corresponding right under such plan), or to the issuance under PubCo's
employee benefit plans of any warrants, options, stock appreciation right,
restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance based award or other
rights to acquire Equity Securities of PubCo or rights or property that may
be converted into or settled in Equity Securities of PubCo, but shall in each
of the foregoing cases apply to the issuance of Equity Securities of PubCo in
connection with the exercise or settlement of such rights, warrants, options,
stock appreciation right, restricted stock, restricted stock units,
performance based award or other rights or property. Except pursuant to
_Section 4.6_ , (x) the Company may not issue any additional Units to PubCo
or any of its Subsidiaries unless substantially simultaneously therewith PubCo
or such Subsidiary issues or sells an equal number of newly-issued shares of
Class A Common Stock to another Person and contributes the net proceeds
therefrom to the Company, and (y) the Company may not issue any other Equity
Securities of the Company to PubCo or any of its Subsidiaries unless
substantially simultaneously PubCo or such Subsidiary issues or sells, to
another Person, an equal number of newly-issued shares of a new class or
series of Equity Securities of PubCo or such Subsidiary with substantially the
same rights to dividends and distributions (including distributions upon
liquidation) and other economic rights as those of such Equity Securities of
the Company and contributes the net proceeds therefrom to the Company. If at
any time PubCo or any of its Subsidiaries (other than the Company and its
Subsidiaries) issues Debt Securities, PubCo or such Subsidiary shall transfer
to the Company (in a manner to be determined by the Managing Member in its
reasonable discretion) the proceeds received by PubCo or such Subsidiary, as
applicable, in exchange for such Debt Securities in a manner that directly or
indirectly burdens the Company with the repayment of the Debt Securities. In
the event any Equity Security outstanding at PubCo is exercised or otherwise
converted and, as a result, any shares of Class A Common Stock or
other Equity Securities of PubCo are issued, (i) the corresponding Equity
Security outstanding at the Company shall be similarly exercised or otherwise
converted, as applicable, and an equivalent number of Units or other Equity
Securities of the Company shall be issued to PubCo as contemplated by the
first sentence of this _Section 4.1(e),_ and (ii) PubCo shall concurrently
contribute to the Company the net proceeds received by PubCo from any such
exercise.

(f) PubCo or any of its Subsidiaries may not redeem, repurchase or otherwise
acquire (i) any shares of Class A Common Stock (including upon forfeiture of
any unvested shares of Class A Common Stock) unless substantially
simultaneously the Company redeems, repurchases or otherwise acquires from
PubCo or such Subsidiary an equal number of Common Units for the same price
per security or (ii) any other Equity Securities of PubCo, unless
substantially simultaneously the Company redeems, repurchases or otherwise
acquires from PubCo or such Subsidiary an equal number of Equity Securities
of the Company of a corresponding class or series with substantially the same
rights to dividends and distributions (including distributions upon
liquidation) and other economic rights as those of such Equity Securities of
PubCo for the same price per security. The Company may not redeem, repurchase
or otherwise acquire (x) except pursuant to _Section 4.6_ , any Common Units
from PubCo or any of its Subsidiaries unless substantially simultaneously
PubCo or such Subsidiary redeems, repurchases or otherwise acquires an equal
number of shares of Class A Common Stock for the same price per security
from holders thereof, or (y) any other Equity Securities of the Company from
PubCo or any of its Subsidiaries unless substantially simultaneously PubCo or
such Subsidiary redeems, repurchases or otherwise acquires for the same price
per security an equal number of Equity Securities of PubCo of a corresponding
class or series with substantially the same rights to dividends and
distributions (including distribution upon liquidation) and other economic
rights as those of such Equity Securities of PubCo. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, to the extent that any consideration payable by PubCo in
connection with the redemption or repurchase of any shares of Class A
Common Stock or other Equity Securities of PubCo or any of its Subsidiaries
consists (in whole or in part) of shares of Class A Common Stock or such
other Equity Securities (including, for the avoidance of doubt, in connection
with the cashless exercise of an option or warrant other than those issued
under PubCo's employee benefit plans), then the redemption or repurchase of
the corresponding Units or other Equity Securities of the Company shall be
effectuated in an equivalent manner.

  



  

(g) The Company shall not in any manner effect any subdivision (by any equity
split, equity distribution, reclassification, recapitalization or
otherwise) or combination (by reverse equity split, reclassification,
recapitalization or otherwise) of the outstanding Common Units
unless accompanied by an identical subdivision or combination, as applicable,
of the outstanding PubCo Common Stock, with corresponding changes made with
respect to any other exchangeable or convertible securities. PubCo shall not
in any manner effect any subdivision (by any equity split, equity
distribution, reclassification, recapitalization or otherwise) or combination
(by reverse equity split, reclassification, recapitalization or otherwise) of
the outstanding PubCo Common Stock unless accompanied by an identical
subdivision or combination, as applicable, of the outstanding Common Units,
with corresponding changes made with respect to any other exchangeable or
convertible securities.

Person unless such Person shall have executed a counterpart to this Agreement
and all other documents, agreements or instruments deemed necessary or
desirable in the discretion of the Managing Member. Upon such issuance and
execution, such Person shall be admitted as a Member of the Company. In that
event, the Managing Member shall amend _Exhibit A_ to reflect such additional
issuances. Subject to _Section 12.1_ , the Managing Member is hereby
authorized to amend this Agreement to set forth the designations, preferences,
rights, powers and duties of such additional Units or other Equity Securities
in the Company, or such other amendments that the Managing Member determines
to be otherwise necessary or appropriate in connection with the creation,
authorization or issuance of, any class or series of Units or other Equity
Securities in the Company pursuant to this _Section 4.3(b)_ ; _provided_ ,
that notwithstanding the foregoing, the Managing Member shall have the right
to amend this Agreement as set forth in this sentence without the approval of
any other Person (including any Member) and notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement (including _Section 12.1_ ) if such amendment is
necessary, and then only to the extent necessary, in order to consummate any

_provided_ , that the designations, preferences, rights, powers and duties of
any such additional Units or other Equity Securities of the Company as set
forth in such amendment are substantially similar to those applicable to such

exchangeable for or convertible into cash or other securities or property;
and  
---|---|--- 
  



   | (D)| if the Redeeming Member requires the Redemption to take place on
a specific Business Day, such Business Day; _provided_ , _that_ , any such
specified Business Day shall not be earlier than the date that would
otherwise apply pursuant to _clause (a)_ of the definition of Redemption
Date.  
---|---|--- 
  



  

(iii) If the Common Units to be redeemed (or the shares of Class B Common
Stock to be transferred and surrendered) by the Redeeming Member
are represented by a certificate or certificates, prior to the Redemption
Date, the Redeeming Member shall also present and surrender such certificate
or certificates representing such Common Units (or shares of Class B Common
Stock) during normal business hours at the principal executive offices of the
Company, or if any agent for the registration or transfer of Class A Common
Stock is then duly appointed and acting (the " _Transfer Agent_ "), at the
office of the Transfer Agent. If required by the Managing Member or the
Transfer Agent, the Redeeming Member shall also deliver, prior to the
Redemption Date, instruments of transfer, in forms reasonably satisfactory to
the Managing Member and the Transfer Agent, duly executed by the Redeeming
Member or the Redeeming Member's duly authorized representative.

  



  

(iv) Upon receipt of a Redemption Notice, the Company shall be entitled to
elect (a " _Cash Election_ ") to settle the Redemption by delivering to the
Redeeming Member, in lieu of the applicable number of shares of Class A Common
Stock that would be received in such Redemption, an amount of cash equal to
the Cash Election Amount for such Redemption. In order to make a Cash Election
with respect to a Redemption, the Company must provide written notice of such
election (a " _Cash Election Notice_ ") to the Redeeming Member (with a copy
to PubCo) prior to 5:00 p.m., Texas time, on the third Business Day after the
Redemption Notice Date. If the Company fails to provide such written notice
prior to such time, it shall not be entitled to make a Cash Election with
respect to such Redemption.

  



  

(v) For U.S. federal and applicable state and local income tax purposes, each
of the Redeeming Member, the Company and PubCo, as the case may be, agree to
treat each Redemption and, in the event PubCo exercises its Call Right, each
transaction between the Redeeming Member and PubCo as a result of such
exercise of its Call Right, as a sale of the Redeeming Member's Common Units
(together with the same number of shares of Class B Common Stock) to PubCo in
exchange for shares of Class A Common Stock or cash, as applicable.

(b) _Redemption Procedures._

  



  

(i) Subject to the satisfaction of any contingency described in _Section
4.6(a)(ii)(C)_ or _(D)_ that is specified in the relevant Redemption Notice,
the Redemption shall be completed on the Redemption Date; _provided_ , that if
a valid Cash Election has not been made, the Redeeming Member may, at any
time prior to the Redemption Date, revoke its Redemption Notice by giving
written notice (the " _Retraction Notice_ ") to the Company (with a copy to
PubCo); _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event may the Redeeming Member
deliver a Retraction Notice later than two Business Days prior to the
applicable Redemption Date. The timely delivery of a Retraction Notice shall
terminate all of the Redeeming Member's, the Company's and PubCo's rights and
obligations arising from the retracted Redemption Notice.

  



  

(ii) Unless the Redeeming Member has timely delivered a Retraction Notice as
provided in _Section 4.6(b)(i)_ or PubCo has elected its Call Right pursuant
to _Section 4.6(f)_ , on the Redemption Date (to be effective immediately
prior to the close of business on the Redemption Date) (A) the Redeeming
Member shall transfer and surrender the Common Units to be redeemed (and a
corresponding number of shares of Class B Common Stock) to the Company, in
each case free and clear of all liens and encumbrances, (B) PubCo shall
contribute to the Company the consideration the Redeeming Member is entitled
to receive under _Section 4.6(a)(i)_  or _Section 4.6(a)(iv)_ , as
applicable, and as described in _Section 4.1(e)_ , the Company shall issue
to PubCo a number of Common Units or other Equity Securities of the Company
as consideration for such contribution, (C) the Company shall (x) cancel the
redeemed Common Units, (y) transfer to the Redeeming Member the consideration
the Redeeming Member is entitled to receive under _Section 4.6(a)(i)_ or
_Section 4.6(a)(iv)_ , as applicable, and (z) if the Common Units are
certificated, issue to the Redeeming Member a certificate for a number of
Common Units equal to the difference (if any) between the number of Common
Units evidenced by the certificate surrendered by the Redeeming Member
pursuant to _Section 4.6(b)(ii)(A)_  and the number of redeemed Common Units
and (D) PubCo shall cancel the surrendered shares of Class B Common Stock.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement to the contrary, in
the event that the Company makes a valid Cash Election, PubCo shall only be
obligated to contribute to the Company an amount in cash equal to the net
proceeds (after deduction of any underwriters' discounts or commissions and
brokers' fees or commissions (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any
deferred discounts or commissions and brokers' fees or commissions payable in
connection with or as a result of such public offering) (such difference, the
" _Discount_ ")) from the sale by PubCo of a number of shares of Class A
Common Stock equal to the number of Common Units and Class B Common Stock to
be redeemed with such cash or from the sale of other PubCo Equity
Securities used to fund the Cash Election Amount; _provided_ , that PubCo's
Capital Account shall be increased by an amount equal to any such Discounts
relating to such sale of shares of Class A Common Stock or other PubCo Equity
Securities in accordance with  _Section 7.9_ ; _provided_ , _further_ , that
the contribution of such net proceeds shall in no event affect the Redeeming
Member's right to receive the Cash Election Amount.

  



    

Ex D-20

 



    



  

(c) _Splits, Distributions and Reclassifications._ If (i) there is any
reclassification, reorganization, recapitalization or other similar
transaction pursuant to which the shares of Class A Common Stock are
converted or changed into another security, securities or other
property (other than as a result of a subdivision or combination or any
transaction subject to _Section 4.1(g)_ ), or (ii) PubCo, by dividend or
otherwise, distributes to all holders of the shares of Class A Common Stock
evidences of its Indebtedness or assets, including securities (including
shares of Class A Common Stock and any rights, options or warrants to all
holders of the shares of Class A Common Stock to subscribe for, to purchase
or to otherwise acquire shares of Class A Common Stock, or other
securities or rights convertible into, or exchangeable or exercisable for,
shares of Class A Common Stock) but excluding any cash dividend or
distribution as well as any such distribution of Indebtedness or assets
received by PubCo from the Company in respect of the Common Units, then upon
any subsequent Redemption, in addition to the shares of Class A Common Stock
or the Cash Election Amount, as applicable, each Member shall be entitled to
receive the amount of such security, securities or other property that such
Member would have received if such Redemption had occurred immediately prior
to the effective date of such reclassification,
reorganization, recapitalization, other similar transaction, dividend or
other distribution, taking into account any adjustment as a result of any
subdivision (by any split, distribution or dividend, reclassification,
reorganization, recapitalization or otherwise) or combination (by reverse
split, reclassification, recapitalization or otherwise) of such security,
securities or other property that occurs after the effective time of such
reclassification, reorganization, recapitalization or other similar
transaction. For the avoidance of doubt, if there is any reclassification,
reorganization, recapitalization or other similar transaction in which the
shares of Class A Common Stock are converted or changed into another
security, securities or other property, or any dividend or
distribution (other than an excluded dividend or distribution, as described
above), this _Section 4.6_ shall continue to be applicable,  _mutatis
mutandis_ , with respect to such security or other property. This Agreement
shall apply to the Common Units held by the Members and their Transferees as
of the date hereof, as well as any Common Units hereafter acquired by a Member
and his or her or its Transferees.

  



  

(d) _PubCo Covenants. _ PubCo shall at all times keep available, solely for
the purpose of issuance upon a Redemption, out of its authorized but
unissued shares of Class A Common Stock, such number of shares of Class A
Common Stock that shall be issuable upon the Redemption of all outstanding
Common Units (other than those Common Units held by PubCo or any Subsidiary of
PubCo); _provided_ , that nothing contained herein shall be construed to
preclude PubCo from satisfying its obligations with respect to a Redemption by
delivery of cash pursuant to a Cash Election or shares of Class A Common
Stock that are held in the treasury of PubCo. PubCo covenants that all shares
of Class A Common Stock that shall be issued upon a Redemption shall, upon
issuance thereof, be validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable. In
addition, for so long as the shares of Class A Common Stock are listed on a
National Securities Exchange, PubCo shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause all shares of Class A Common Stock issued upon a Redemption to be listed
on such National Securities Exchange at the time of such issuance. For
purposes of this Section 4.6(d), references to the "Class A Common Stock"
shall be deemed to include any Equity Securities issued or issuable as a
result of any reclassification, combination, subdivision or similar of the
Class A Common Stock.

  



  

(e) _Redemption Taxes. _ The issuance of shares of Class A Common Stock upon
a Redemption shall be made without charge to the Redeeming Member for
any stamp or other similar tax in respect of such issuance; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if any such shares of Class A Common Stock are to be issued
in a name other than that of the Redeeming Member, then the Person or Persons
in whose name the shares are to be issued shall pay to PubCo the amount of
any tax that may be payable in respect of any Transfer involved in such
issuance or shall establish to the satisfaction of PubCo that such tax has
been paid or is not payable.

  



    

Ex D-21

 



    



  

(f) _PubCo Call Rights_.

  



  

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 4.6_ , a
Redeeming Member shall be deemed to have offered to sell its Common Units as
described in the Redemption Notice to PubCo, and PubCo may, in its sole
discretion, by delivery of a notice in accordance with, and subject to the
terms of, this _Section 4.6(f)_ (a " _Call Election Notice_ "), elect to
purchase directly and acquire such Common Units (together with the surrender
and delivery of the same number of shares of Class B Common Stock) on the
Redemption Date by paying to the Redeeming Member (or, on the Redeeming
Member's written order and  _Section 4.6(e)_ , its designee) that number of
shares of Class A Common Stock the Redeeming Member (or its designee) would
otherwise receive pursuant to _Section 4.6(a)(i)_ or, at PubCo's election, an
amount of cash equal to the Cash Election Amount of such shares of Class A
Common Stock (the " _Call Right_ "), whereupon PubCo shall acquire the Common
Units offered for redemption by the Redeeming Member (together with the
surrender and delivery of the same number of shares of Class B Common Stock
to PubCo for cancellation). PubCo shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as the owner of such Common Units; _provided_ , that if PubCo funds
the Cash Election Amount other than through the issuance of shares of Class A
Common Stock, such Common Units will be reclassified into another Equity
Security of the Company if the Managing Member determines such
reclassification is necessary.

  



  

(ii) PubCo may, at any time prior to the Redemption Date, in its sole
discretion deliver a Call Election Notice to the Company and the
Redeeming Member setting forth its election to exercise its Call Right. A
Call Election Notice may be revoked by PubCo at any time; _provided_ , that
any such revocation does not prejudice the ability of the parties to
consummate a Redemption on the Redemption Date. Except as otherwise provided
by this _Section 4.6(f)_ , an exercise of the Call Right shall be consummated
pursuant to the same timeframe and in the same manner as the relevant
Redemption would have been consummated if PubCo had not delivered a
Call Election Notice.

  



  

(g) _Distribution Rights_. No Redemption shall impair the right of the
Redeeming Member to receive any distributions payable on the Common Units
redeemed pursuant to such Redemption in respect of a record date that occurs
prior to the Redemption Date for such Redemption. For the avoidance of doubt,
no Redeeming Member, or a Person designated by a Redeeming Member to receive
shares of Class A Common Stock, shall be entitled to receive, with respect to
such record date, distributions or dividends both on Common Units redeemed by
the Company from such Redeeming Member and on shares of Class A Common Stock
received by such Redeeming Member, or other Person so designated, if
applicable, in such Redemption.

  



  

(h) _PubCo Membership._  Any Common Units acquired by the Company under this
_Section 4.6_ and Transferred by the Company to PubCo shall
remain outstanding and shall not be cancelled as a result of their
acquisition by the Company. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, PubCo shall continue as a Member of the Company with respect to any
Common Units or other Equity Securities in the Company it receives under this
Agreement (including under this _Section 4.6_ in connection with any
Redemption).

  



    

Ex D-22

 



    



  

(i) _Redemption Restrictions_. The Managing Member may impose additional
limitations and restrictions on Redemptions (including limiting Redemptions or
creating priority procedures for Redemptions), to the extent it determines,
in Good Faith, such limitations and restrictions to be necessary or
appropriate to avoid undue risk that the Company may be classified as a
"publicly traded partnership" within the meaning of Section 7704 of the Code.

  



  

(j) _Tax Certificates_. In connection with any Redemption, the Redeeming
Member shall deliver to PubCo or the Company, as applicable, a certificate,
dated as of the date of the Redemption and sworn under penalties of perjury,
in a form reasonably acceptable to PubCo or the Company, as applicable,
certifying as to such Redeeming Member's taxpayer identification number and
that such Redeeming Member is a not a foreign person for purposes of Section
1445 and Section 1446(f) of the Code.

  



  

(k) _Representations and Warranties_. In connection with any Redemption or
exercise of a Call Right, upon the acceptance of the Class A Common Stock or
an amount of cash equal to the Cash Election Amount, the Redeeming Member
shall represent and warrant that the Redeeming Member is the owner of the
number of Common Units the Redeeming Member is electing to have the Company
redeem and that such Common Units are not subject to any liens or
restrictions to transfer the shares (other than restrictions imposed by this
Agreement and Pubco's Second Amended and Restated Certificate of
Incorporation).

  



  

Section 4.7 _Representations and Warranties of the Members_. Unless otherwise
set forth in an agreement between the Company and a Member, each Member
severally (and not jointly) represents and warrants to the Company and each
other Member as of the date of such Member's admittance to the Company that
(i) to the extent it is not a natural person, it is duly formed, validly
existing and in good standing under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its
formation, and if required by Law is duly qualified to conduct business and is

beneficiaries or other Persons necessary for the due authorization, execution,
delivery and performance of this Agreement by that Member have been duly
taken; (iii) it has duly executed and delivered this Agreement, and this
Agreement is enforceable against such Member in accordance with its terms,
subject to bankruptcy, moratorium, insolvency and other Laws
generally affecting creditors' rights and general principles of equity
(whether applied in a proceeding in a court of law or equity); (iv) its
authorization, execution, delivery, and performance of this Agreement does not
breach or conflict with or constitute a default under (A) such Member's
charter or other governing documents to the extent it is not a natural person
or (B) any material obligation under any other material agreement or
arrangement to which that Member is a party or by which it is bound; and (v)
it: (A) has been furnished with such information about the Company and the
Interest as that Member has requested, (B) has made its own independent
inquiry and investigation into, and based thereon has formed an independent
judgment concerning, the Company and such Member's Interest herein, (C) has
adequate means of providing for its current needs and possible
contingencies, is able to bear the economic risks of this investment and has
a sufficient net worth to sustain a loss of its entire investment in the
Company in the event such loss should occur, (D) has such knowledge and
experience in financial and business matters as to be capable of evaluating
the merits and risks of an investment in the Company, (E) is, or is controlled
by, an "accredited investor," as that term is defined in Rule 501(a) of
Regulation D, promulgated under the Securities Act, and (F) understands and
agrees that its Interest shall not be sold, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise
Transferred except in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and
pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act or an
applicable exemption from registration and/or qualification under the
Securities Act and applicable state securities Laws.

Article V 
 ALLOCATIONS OF PROFITS AND LOSSES

  



  

Section 5.1 _Profits and Losses_. After giving effect to the allocations
under _Section 5.2_ and subject to _Section 5.4_ , Profits and Losses (and,
to the extent determined by the Managing Member to be necessary and
appropriate to achieve the resulting Capital Account balances described
below, any allocable items of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit
includable in the computation of Profits and Losses) for each Fiscal Year or
other taxable period shall be allocated among the Members during such Fiscal
Year or other taxable period in a manner such that, after giving effect to
all distributions through the end of such Fiscal Year or other taxable
period, the Capital Account balance of each Member, immediately after making
such allocation, is, as nearly as possible, equal to (i) the amount such
Member would receive pursuant to _Section 11.3(b)_ if all assets of the
Company on hand at the end of such Fiscal Year or other taxable period were
sold for cash equal to their Gross Asset Values, all liabilities of the
Company were satisfied in cash in accordance with their terms (limited with
respect to each nonrecourse liability to the Gross Asset Value of the assets
securing such liability), and all remaining or resulting cash was distributed,
in accordance with _Section 11.3(b)_ , to the Members immediately after
making such allocation, _minus_ (ii) such Member's share of Company Minimum
Gain and Member Minimum Gain, computed immediately prior to the hypothetical
sale of assets, and the amount any such Member is treated as obligated to
contribute to the Company, computed immediately after the hypothetical sale of
assets.

  



  

Section 5.2 _Special Allocations_.

  



  

(a) Nonrecourse Deductions for any Fiscal Year or other taxable period shall
be specially allocated to the Members on a _pro rata_ basis in
accordance with the number of Units owned by each Member. The amount of
Nonrecourse Deductions for a Fiscal Year or other taxable period shall equal
the excess, if any, of the net increase, if any, in the amount of Company
Minimum Gain during that Fiscal Year or other taxable period over the
aggregate amount of any distributions during that Fiscal Year or other taxable
period of proceeds of a Nonrecourse Liability that are allocable to an
increase in Company Minimum Gain, determined in accordance with the provisions
of Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-2(d).

  



  

(b) Any Member Nonrecourse Deductions for any Fiscal Year or other taxable
period shall be specially allocated to the Member who bears economic risk of
loss with respect to the Member Nonrecourse Debt to which such Member
Nonrecourse Deductions are attributable in accordance with
Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-2(i). If more than one Member bears the
economic risk of loss for such Member Nonrecourse Debt, the
Member Nonrecourse Deductions attributable to such Member Nonrecourse Debt
shall be allocated among the Members according to the ratio in which they
bear the economic risk of loss. This _Section 5.2(b)_ is intended to comply
with the provisions of Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-2(i) and shall be
interpreted consistently therewith.

  



    

Ex D-24

 



    



  

(c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if
there is a net decrease in Company Minimum Gain during any Fiscal Year
or other taxable period (or if there was a net decrease in Company Minimum
Gain for a prior Fiscal Year or other taxable period and the Company did not
have sufficient amounts of income and gain during prior periods to allocate
among the Members under this _Section 5.2(c))_ , each Member shall be
specially allocated items of Company income and gain for such Fiscal Year or
other taxable period in an amount equal to such Member's share of the net
decrease in Company Minimum Gain during such year (as determined pursuant to
Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-2(g)(2)). This section is intended to
constitute a minimum gain chargeback under Treasury Regulations Section
1.704-2(f) and shall be interpreted consistently therewith.

  



  

(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement except _Section
5.2(c)_ , if there is a net decrease in Member Minimum Gain during any Fiscal
Year or other taxable period (or if there was a net decrease in Member Minimum
Gain for a prior Fiscal Year or other taxable period and the Company did not
have sufficient amounts of income and gain during prior periods to allocate
among the Members under this _Section 5.2(d))_ , each Member shall be
specially allocated items of Company income and gain for such year in an
amount equal to such Member's share of the net decrease in Member Minimum Gain
(as determined pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-2(i)(4)). This
section is intended to constitute a partner nonrecourse debt minimum gain
chargeback under Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-2(i)(4) and shall be
interpreted consistently therewith.

  



  

(e) Notwithstanding any provision hereof to the contrary except _Section
5.2(a)_ and _Section 5.2(b)_ , no Losses or other items of loss or expense
shall be allocated to any Member to the extent that such allocation would
cause such Member to have an Adjusted Capital Account Deficit (or increase
any existing Adjusted Capital Account Deficit) at the end of such Fiscal Year
or other taxable period. All Losses and other items of loss and expense in
excess of the limitation set forth in this _Section 5.2(e)_  shall be
allocated to the Members who do not have an Adjusted Capital Account Deficit
in proportion to their relative positive Capital Accounts but only to the
extent that such Losses and other items of loss and expense do not cause any
such Member to have an Adjusted Capital Account Deficit.

  



  

(f) Notwithstanding any provision hereof to the contrary except _Section
5.2(c)_ and _Section 5.2(d)_ , in the event any Member unexpectedly receives
any adjustment, allocation or distribution described in paragraph (4), (5) or
(6) of Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)( _d_ ), items of income
and gain (consisting of a _pro rata_ portion of each item of
income, including gross income, and gain for the Fiscal Year or other taxable
period) shall be specially allocated to such Member in an amount and manner
sufficient to eliminate any Adjusted Capital Account Deficit of that Member as
quickly as possible; _provided_ , that an allocation pursuant to this
_Section 5.2(f)_ shall be made only if and to the extent that such Member
would have an Adjusted Capital Account Deficit after all other allocations
provided for in _Section 5.1_ and _Section 5.2_  have been tentatively made
as if this _Section 5.2(f)_ were not in this Agreement. This _Section 5.2(f)_
 is intended to constitute a qualified income offset under Treasury
Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii) and shall be interpreted consistently
therewith.

  



    

Ex D-25

 



    



  

(g) If any Member has a deficit balance in its Capital Account at the end of
any Fiscal Year or other taxable period that is in excess of the sum of (i)
the amount that such Member is obligated to restore and (ii) the amount that
the Member is deemed to be obligated to restore pursuant to the penultimate
sentence of Treasury Regulations Sections 1.704-2(g)(1) and (i)(5), that
Member shall be specially allocated items of Company income and gain in the
amount of such excess as quickly as possible; _provided_ , that an
allocation pursuant to this _Section 5.2(g)_ shall be made only if and to the
extent that such Member would have a deficit balance in its Capital Account
in excess of such sum after all other allocations provided for in _Section
5.1_ and _Section 5.2_ have been made as if _Section 5.2(f)_ and this
_Section 5.2(g)_ were not in this Agreement.

  



  

(h) To the extent an adjustment to the adjusted tax basis of any Company
asset pursuant to Code Sections 734(b) or 743(b) is required, pursuant to
Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)( _m_ )(2) or
1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)( _m_ )(4), to be taken into account in determining
Capital Accounts as a result of a distribution to any Member in complete
liquidation of such Member's Interest in the Company, the amount of such
adjustment to the Capital Accounts shall be treated as an item of gain (if the
adjustment increases the basis of the asset) or loss (if the adjustment
decreases such basis) and such item of gain or loss shall be allocated to the
Members in accordance with Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)
_(m)_ (2) if such section applies or to the Member to whom such distribution
was made if Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)( _m_ )(4) applies.

  



  

(i) The allocations set forth in _Sections 5.2(a)_ through _5.2(h)_ (the "
_Regulatory Allocations_ ") are intended to comply with certain requirements
of Treasury Regulations Sections 1.704-1(b) and 1.704-2. Notwithstanding any
other provision of this _Article V_ (other than the Regulatory Allocations),
the Regulatory Allocations (and anticipated future Regulatory Allocations)
shall be taken into account in allocating other items of income, gain, loss
and deduction among the Members so that, to the extent possible, the net
amount of such allocation of other items and the Regulatory Allocations to
each Member should be equal to the net amount that would have been allocated
to each such Member if the Regulatory Allocations had not occurred. This
_Section 5.2(i)_ is intended to minimize to the extent possible and to the
extent necessary any economic distortions which may result from application
of the Regulatory Allocations and shall be interpreted in a manner consistent
therewith.

  



  

Section 5.3 _Allocations for Tax Purposes in General_.

  



  

(a) Except as otherwise provided in this _Section 5.3_ , each item of income,
gain, loss and deduction of the Company for U.S. federal income tax purposes
shall be allocated among the Members in the same manner as such item is
allocated under _Sections 5.1_  and _5.2_ _._

  



  

(b) In accordance with Code Section 704(c) and the Treasury Regulations
thereunder (including the Treasury Regulations applying the principles of
Code Section 704(c) to changes in Gross Asset Values), items of income, gain,
loss and deduction with respect to any Company property having a Gross Asset
Value that differs from such property's adjusted U.S. federal income tax basis
shall, solely for U.S. federal income tax purposes, be allocated among the
Members to account for any such difference using (i) the
"traditional method," under Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-3(b) with
respect to any property deemed to be contributed by Atlas to the Company and
(ii) any method or methods determined by the Managing Member to be appropriate
and in accordance with the applicable Treasury Regulations with respect to
any other Company property.

  



    

Ex D-26

 



    



  

(c) Any (i) recapture of depreciation or any other item of deduction shall be
allocated, in accordance with Treasury Regulations Sections 1.1245-1(e) and
1.1254-5, to the Members who received the benefit of such deductions and (ii)
recapture of credits shall be allocated to the Members in accordance with
applicable Law.

  



  

(d) Allocations pursuant to this _Section 5.3_ are solely for purposes of
U.S. federal, state and local income taxes and shall not affect or in any way
be taken into account in computing any Member's Capital Account or share of
Profits, Losses, other items or distributions pursuant to any provision of
this Agreement.

  



  

(e) If, as a result of an exercise of a noncompensatory option to acquire an
interest in the Company, a Capital Account reallocation is required
under Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)( _s_ )(3), the Company
shall make corrective allocations pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section
1.704-1(b)(4)(x).

  



  

(f) Any adjustment to the adjusted tax basis of Company property pursuant to
Code Section 743(b) resulting from a transfer of a Company Interest shall be
handled in accordance with Treasury Regulations section 1.743-1(j).

  



  

Section 5.4 _Other Allocation Rules_.

  



  

(a) The Members are aware of the income tax consequences of the allocations
made by this _Article V_ and the economic impact of the allocations on
the amounts receivable by them under this Agreement. The Members hereby agree
to be bound by the provisions of this _Article V_  in reporting their share
of Company income and loss for U.S. federal and applicable state and local
income tax purposes.

  



  

(b) The provisions regarding the establishment and maintenance for each
Member of a Capital Account as provided by _Section 4.4_ and the
allocations set forth in _Sections 5.1_ , _5.2_ and _5.3_ are intended to
comply with the Treasury Regulations and to reflect the intended economic
entitlement of the Members. If the Managing Member determines that the
application of the provisions in _Sections 4.4_ , _5.1_ , _5.2_ or _5.3_
would result in non-compliance with the Treasury Regulations or would be
inconsistent with the intended economic entitlement of the Members, the
Managing Member is authorized to make any appropriate adjustments to such
provisions to the extent permitted by applicable Law.

  



  

(c) All items of income, gain, loss, deduction and credit allocable to an
interest in the Company that may have been Transferred shall be allocated
between the Transferor and the Transferee based on the portion of the Fiscal
Year or other taxable period during which each was recognized as the owner of
such interest, without regard to the results of Company operations during any
particular portion of that year and without regard to whether cash
distributions were made to the Transferor or the Transferee during that year;
_provided_ , _however_ , that this allocation must be made in accordance with
a method determined by the Managing Member and permissible under Code
Section 706 and the Treasury Regulations thereunder.

  



    

Ex D-27

 



    



  

(d) The Members' proportionate shares of the "excess nonrecourse liabilities"
of the Company, within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section
1.752-3(a)(3), shall be allocated to the Members on a _pro rata_ basis in
accordance with the number of Units owned by each Member.

  



  

Article VI 
 DISTRIBUTIONS

  



  

Section 6.1 _Distributions_.

  



  

(a) _Distributions_. To the extent permitted by applicable Law and hereunder,
and except as otherwise provided in _Section 11.3_ , distributions to Members
may be declared by the Managing Member out of funds legally available therefor
in such amounts and on such terms (including the payment dates of such
distributions) as the Managing Member shall determine (in its sole discretion
in accordance with the fiduciary duties set forth in _Section 7.1(b)_ ) using
such record date as the Managing Member may designate. Any such distribution
shall be made to the Members as of the close of business on such record date
on a _pro rata_ basis (except that, for the avoidance of doubt, repurchases
or redemptions made in accordance with _Section 4.1(f)_ or payments made
in accordance with _Sections 7.4_ or _7.9_ need not be on a _pro rata_
basis), in accordance with the number of Units owned by each Member as of the
close of business on such record date; _provided_ _,_ _however_ , that the
Managing Member shall have the obligation to make distributions as set forth
in _Sections 6.2_ and _11.3(b)(iii)_ ; and _provided_ _,_ _further_ _,_
_that_ , notwithstanding any other provision herein to the contrary,
no distributions shall be made to any Member to the extent such distribution
would render the Company insolvent or violate the Act. For purposes of the
foregoing sentence, insolvency means the inability of the Company to meet its
payment obligations when due. Promptly following the designation of a record
date and the declaration of a distribution pursuant to this _Section 6.1_
, the Managing Member shall give notice to each Member of the record date,
the amount and the terms of the distribution and the payment date thereof.

  



  

(b) _Successors_. For purposes of determining the amount of distributions,
each Member shall be treated as having made the Capital Contributions and as
having received the distributions made to or received by its predecessors in
respect of any of such Member's Units.

  



  

(c) _Distributions In-Kind_. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement,
any distributions may be made in cash or in kind, or partly in cash and
partly in kind, as determined by the Managing Member. In the event of any
distribution of (i) property in kind or (ii) both cash and property in kind,
each Member shall be distributed its proportionate share of any such cash so
distributed and its proportionate share of any such property so distributed
in kind (based on the Fair Market Value of such property). To the extent that
the Company distributes property in-kind to the Members, the Company shall be
treated as making a distribution equal to the Fair Market Value of such
property for purposes of _Section 6.1(a)_ and such property shall be treated
as if it were sold for an amount equal to its Fair Market Value. Any
resulting gain or loss shall be allocated to the Member's Capital Accounts in
accordance with _Section 5.1_ and _Section 5.2_.

  



    

Ex D-28

 



    



  

Section 6.2 _Tax-Related Distributions_. On each Tax Distribution Date, the
Company will, subject to the availability of funds and any
restrictions contained in any agreement to which the Company is bound, make
distributions to the Members _pro rata_ in proportion to their respective
number of Units in an amount sufficient to cause PubCo to receive a
distribution equal to the sum of all of PubCo's federal, state, local and
non-U.S. tax liabilities during the Fiscal Year or other taxable period to
which the tax-related distribution under this _Section 6.2_ relates.

  



  

Section 6.3 _Distribution Upon Withdrawal_. No withdrawing Member shall be
entitled to receive any distribution or the value of such Member's Interest
in the Company as a result of withdrawal from the Company prior to the
liquidation of the Company, except as specifically provided in this
Agreement.

  



  

Article VII 
 MANAGEMENT

  



  

Section 7.1 _Managing Member Rights; Fiduciary Duties_.

  



  

(a) PubCo shall be the sole Managing Member of the Company. Except as
otherwise required by Law or expressly provided for in this Agreement, (i) the
Managing Member shall have full and complete charge of all affairs of the
Company, (ii) the management and control of the Company's business activities
and operations shall rest exclusively with the Managing Member, and the
Managing Member shall make all decisions regarding the business, activities
and operations of the Company (including the incurrence of costs and expenses)
in its sole discretion without the consent of any other Member and (iii) the
Members, other than the Managing Member (in their capacity as such),
shall not participate in the control, management, direction or operation of
the activities or affairs of the Company and shall have no power to act for
or bind the Company.

  



  

(b) In connection with the performance of its duties as the Managing Member
of the Company, except as otherwise set forth herein, the Managing
Member acknowledges that it will owe to the Members the same fiduciary duties
as it would owe to the stockholders of a Delaware corporation if it were a
member of the board of directors of such a corporation and the Members were
stockholders of such corporation. The Members acknowledge that the Managing
Member will take action through the Board, and that the members of the Board
will owe comparable fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Managing
Member.

  



  

Section 7.2 _Officers_.

  



  

(a) The Managing Member may appoint, employ or otherwise contract with any
Person for the transaction of the business of the Company or the
performance of services for or on behalf of the Company, and the Managing
Member may delegate to any such Persons such authority to act on behalf of
the Company as the Managing Member may from time to time deem appropriate.

  



  

(b) The Officers of the Company as of the date hereof are set forth on
_Exhibit B_ attached hereto.

  



  

(c) Except as otherwise set forth herein, the Chief Executive Officer will be
responsible for the general and active management of the business of
the Company and its Subsidiaries and will see that all orders of the Managing
Member are carried into effect. The Chief Executive Officer will report to
the Managing Member and have the general powers and duties of management
usually vested in the office of chief executive officer of a corporation
organized under the DGCL, subject to the terms of this Agreement, and will
have such other powers and duties as may be prescribed by the Managing Member
or this Agreement. The Chief Executive Officer will have the power to
execute bonds, mortgages and other contracts requiring a seal, under the seal
of the Company, except where required or permitted by Law to be otherwise
signed and executed, and except where the signing and execution thereof will
be expressly delegated by the Managing Member to some other Officer or agent
of the Company.

  



    

Ex D-29

 



    



  

(d) Except as set forth herein, the Managing Member may appoint Officers at
any time, and the Officers may include one or more vice presidents, a
secretary, one or more assistant secretaries, a chief financial officer, a
general counsel, a treasurer, one or more assistant treasurers, a chief
operating officer, an executive chairman, and any other officers that the
Managing Member deems appropriate. Except as set forth herein, the Officers
will serve at the pleasure of the Managing Member, subject to all rights, if
any, of such Officer under any contract of employment. Any individual may
hold any number of offices, and an Officer may, but need not, be a Member of
the Company. The Officers will exercise such powers and perform such duties as
specified in this Agreement or as determined from time to time by the
Managing Member.

  



  

(e) Subject to this Agreement and to the rights, if any, of an Officer under
a contract of employment, any Officer may be removed, either with or without
cause, by the Managing Member. Any Officer may resign at any time by giving
written notice to the Managing Member. Any resignation will take effect at
the date of the receipt of that notice or at any later time specified in that
notice and, unless otherwise specified in that notice, the acceptance of the
resignation will not be necessary to make it effective. Any resignation is
without prejudice to the rights, if any, of the Company under any contract to
which the Officer is a party. A vacancy in any office because of
death, resignation, removal, disqualification or any other cause will be
filled in the manner prescribed in this Agreement for regular appointments to
that office.

  



  

(f) The Officers, in the performance of their duties as such, shall owe to
the Company and the Members duties of loyalty and due care of the type
owed by the officers of a corporation to such corporation and its
shareholders under the DGCL.

  



  

Section 7.3 _Warranted Reliance by Officers on Others_. In exercising their
authority and performing their duties under this Agreement, the
Officers shall be entitled to rely on information, opinions, reports, or
statements of the following Persons or groups unless they have actual
knowledge concerning the matter in question that would cause such reliance to
be unwarranted:

  



  

(a) one or more employees or other agents of the Company or subordinates whom
the Officer reasonably believes to be reliable and competent in the
matters presented; and

  



  

(b) any attorney, public accountant, or other Person as to matters which the
Officer reasonably believes to be within such Person's professional or expert
competence.

  



    

Ex D-30

 



    



  

Section 7.4 _Indemnification_.

  



  

(a) _Right to Indemnification_. Each person who was or is made a party or is
threatened to be made a party to or is otherwise subject to or involved in any
claim, demand, action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative (a " _Proceeding_ "), by reason of the fact
that he or she is or was a director or an officer of the Company or is or was
serving at the request of the Company as a director, officer, employee or
agent of another company or of a partnership, joint venture, trust or other
enterprise, including service with respect to an employee benefit plan (an "
_Indemnitee_ "), whether the basis of such Proceeding is alleged action in an
official capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent or in any other
capacity while serving as a director, officer, employee or agent, shall be
indemnified by the Company to the fullest extent permitted or required by the
Act and any other applicable law, as the same exists or may hereafter be
amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the extent that such
amendment permits the Company to provide broader indemnification rights than
such law permitted the Company to provide prior to such amendment), against
all expense, Liability and loss (including attorneys' fees, judgments, fines,
ERISA excise taxes or penalties and amounts paid in settlement) reasonably
incurred or suffered by such Indemnitee in connection therewith ("
_Indemnifiable Losses_ "); _provided, however_ , that, except as provided in
_Section 7.4(d)_  with respect to Proceedings to enforce rights to
indemnification, the Company shall indemnify any such Indemnitee pursuant to
this  _Section 7.4_ in connection with a Proceeding (or part thereof)
initiated by such Indemnitee only if such Proceeding (or part thereof) was
authorized by the Board.

  



  

(b) _Right to Advancement of Expenses_. The right to indemnification
conferred in _Section 7.4(a)_ shall include the right to advancement by the
Company of any and all expenses (including, without limitation, attorneys'
fees and expenses) incurred in defending any such Proceeding in advance of
its final disposition (an " _Advancement of Expenses_ "); _provided, however_
, that, if the Act so requires, an Advancement of Expenses incurred by an
Indemnitee in his or her capacity as a director or officer (and not in any
other capacity in which service was or is rendered by such Indemnitee,
including without limitation service to an employee benefit plan) shall be
made pursuant to this _Section 7.4(b)_ only upon delivery to the Company of an
undertaking (an " _Undertaking_ "), by or on behalf of such Indemnitee, to
repay, without interest, all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be
determined by final judicial decision from which there is no further right to
appeal (a " _Final Adjudication_ ") that such Indemnitee is not entitled to
be indemnified for such expenses under this _Section 7.4(b)_. An Indemnitee's
right to an Advancement of Expenses pursuant to this _Section 7.4(b)_ is not
subject to the satisfaction of any standard of conduct and is not conditioned
upon any prior determination that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification
under  _Section 7.4(a)_ with respect to the related Proceeding or the absence
of any prior determination to the contrary.

  



  

(c) _Contract Rights_. The rights to indemnification and to the Advancement
of Expenses conferred in _Sections 7.4(a)_ and _(b)_ shall be contract rights
and such rights shall continue as to an Indemnitee who has ceased to be a
director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the
Indemnitee's heirs, executors and administrators.

  



    

Ex D-31

 



    



  

(d) _Right of Indemnitee to Bring Suit_. If a claim under _Sections 7.4(a)_
or _(b)_ is not paid in full by the Company within 60 calendar days after a
written claim has been received by the Company, except in the case of a claim
for an Advancement of Expenses, in which case the applicable period shall be
20 calendar days, the Indemnitee may at any time thereafter bring suit against
the Company to recover the unpaid amount of the claim. If successful in whole
or in part in any such suit, or in a suit brought by the Company to recover
an Advancement of Expenses pursuant to the terms of an Undertaking, the
Indemnitee shall be entitled to the fullest extent permitted or required by
the Act, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of
any such amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the
Company to provide broader reimbursements of prosecution or defense
expenses than such law permitted the Company to provide prior to such
amendment), to be paid also the expense of prosecuting or defending such
suit. In (i) any suit brought by the Indemnitee to enforce a right to
indemnification hereunder (but not in a suit brought by the Indemnitee to
enforce a right to an Advancement of Expenses) it shall be a defense that, and
(ii) any suit brought by the Company to recover an Advancement of Expenses
pursuant to the terms of an Undertaking, the Company shall be entitled to
recover such expenses, without interest, upon a Final Adjudication that, the
Indemnitee has not met any applicable standard for indemnification set forth
in the Act. Neither the failure of the Company (including its Managing Member
or independent legal counsel) to have made a determination prior to the
commencement of such suit that indemnification of the Indemnitee is proper in
the circumstances because the Indemnitee has met the applicable standard of
conduct set forth in the Act, nor an actual determination by the Company
(including the Managing Member or independent legal counsel) that the
Indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall create a
presumption that the Indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct
or, in the case of such a suit brought by the Indemnitee, be a defense to
such suit. In any suit brought by an Indemnitee to enforce a right to
indemnification or to an Advancement of Expenses hereunder, or brought by the
Company to recover an Advancement of Expenses hereunder pursuant to the terms
of an Undertaking, the burden of proving that the Indemnitee is not entitled
to be indemnified, or to such Advancement of Expenses, shall be on
the Company.

  



  

(e) _Appearance as a Witness_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
_Section 7.4_ , the Company shall pay or reimburse expenses incurred by any
Person entitled to be indemnified pursuant to this _Section 7.4_ in connection
with such Person's appearance as a witness or other participation in a
Proceeding at a time when he is not a named defendant or respondent in
the Proceeding.

  



  

(f) _Nonexclusivity of Rights_. The rights to indemnification and the
Advancement of Expenses conferred in this _Section 7.4_ shall not be
exclusive of any other right which a Person may have or hereafter acquire
under any statute, this Agreement, any agreement, any vote of stockholders or
disinterested directors or otherwise. Nothing contained in this _Section 7.4_
shall limit or otherwise affect any such other right or the Company's power
to confer any such other right.

  



  

(g) _No Duplication of Payments_. The Company shall not be liable under this
_Section 7.4_ to make any payment to an Indemnitee in respect of any
Indemnifiable Losses to the extent that the Indemnitee has otherwise actually
received payment (net of any expenses incurred in connection therewith and
any repayment by the Indemnitee made with respect thereto) under any insurance
policy or from any other source in respect of such Indemnifiable Losses.

  



  

(h) _Maintenance of Insurance or Other Financial Arrangements_. In compliance
with applicable Law, the Company (with the approval of the Managing Member)
may purchase and maintain insurance or make other financial arrangements on
behalf of any Person who is or was a Member, employee or agent of the
Company, or at the request of the Company, is or was serving as a manager,
director, officer, employee or agent of another limited liability company,
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, for any
Liability asserted against such Person and Liability and expenses incurred by
such Person in such Person's capacity as such, or arising out of such
Person's status as such, whether or not the Company has the authority to
indemnify such Person against such expense, Liability or loss under the Act.

  



    

Ex D-32

 



    



  

Section 7.5 _Resignation or Termination of Managing Member_. PubCo shall not,
by any means, resign as, cease to be or be replaced as Managing Member except
in compliance with this _Section 7.8_. No termination or replacement of PubCo
as Managing Member shall be effective unless proper provision is made, in
compliance with this Agreement, so that the obligations of PubCo, its
successor (if applicable) and any new Managing Member and the rights of all
Members under this Agreement and applicable Law remain in full force and
effect. No appointment of a Person other than PubCo (or its successor, as
applicable) as Managing Member shall be effective unless PubCo (or its
successor, as applicable) and the new Managing Member (as applicable) provide
all other Members with contractual rights, directly enforceable by such other
Members against PubCo (or its successor, as applicable) and the new Managing
Member (as applicable), to cause (a) PubCo to comply with all PubCo's
obligations under this Agreement (including its obligations under
_Section 4.6_ ) other than those that must necessarily be taken in its
capacity as Managing Member and (b) the new Managing Member to comply with
all the Managing Member's obligations under this Agreement.

  



  

Section 7.6 _No Inconsistent Obligations_. The Managing Member represents
that it does not have any contracts, other agreements, duties or obligations
that are inconsistent with its duties and obligations (whether or not in its
capacity as Managing Member) under this Agreement and covenants that, except
as permitted by _Section 7.1_ , it will not enter into any contracts or
other agreements or undertake or acquire any other duties or obligations that
are inconsistent with such duties and obligations.

  



  

Section 7.7 _Reclassification Events of PubCo_. If a Reclassification Event
occurs, the Managing Member or its successor, as the case may be, shall,
as and to the extent necessary, amend this Agreement in compliance with
_Section 12.1_ , and enter into any necessary supplementary or additional
agreements, to ensure that, following the effective date of the
Reclassification Event: (i) the redemption rights of holders of Units set
forth in _Section 4.6_ provide that each Unit (together with the surrender and
delivery of one share of Class B Common Stock) is redeemable for the same
amount and same type of property, securities or cash (or combination thereof)
that one share of Class A Common Stock becomes exchangeable for or converted
into as a result of the Reclassification Event and (ii) PubCo or the
successor to PubCo, as applicable, is obligated to deliver such property,
securities or cash upon such redemption. PubCo shall not consummate or agree
to consummate any Reclassification Event unless the successor Person, if any,
becomes obligated to comply with the obligations of PubCo (in whatever
capacity) under this Agreement.

  



    

Ex D-33

 



    



  

Section 7.8 _Certain Costs and Expenses_. The Company shall (i) pay, or cause
to be paid, all costs, fees, operating expenses and other expenses of the
Company (including the costs, fees and expenses of attorneys, accountants or
other professionals and the compensation of all personnel providing services
to the Company) incurred in pursuing and conducting, or otherwise related to,
the activities of the Company and (ii) upon the determination of the Managing
Member (acting in its sole discretion in accordance with the fiduciary duties
set forth in _Section 7.1(b)_ ), reimburse the Managing Member for any costs,
fees or expenses incurred by it in connection with serving as the Managing
Member. To the extent that the Managing Member determines in its sole
discretion that such expenses are related to the business and affairs of the
Managing Member that are conducted through the Company and/or
its Subsidiaries (including expenses that relate to the business and affairs
of the Company and/or its Subsidiaries and that also relate to other
activities of the Managing Member), the Managing Member may cause the Company
to pay or bear all expenses of the Managing Member, including, without
limitation, costs of securities offerings not borne directly by Members, board
of directors compensation and meeting costs, costs of periodic reports to its
stockholders, litigation costs and damages arising from litigation,
accounting and legal costs; _provided_ , that the Company shall not pay or
bear any income tax obligations of the Managing Member. In the event that (i)
shares of Class A Common Stock or other Equity Securities of PubCo were sold
to underwriters in any public offering after the Effective Time, in each
case, at a price per share that is lower than the price per share for which
such shares of Class A Common Stock or other Equity Securities of PubCo are
sold to the public in such public offering after taking into account
any Discount and (ii) the proceeds from such public offering are used to fund
the Cash Election Amount for any redeemed Units or otherwise contributed to
the Company, the Company shall reimburse the Managing Member for such Discount
by treating such Discount as an additional Capital Contribution made by the
Managing Member to the Company, issuing Units in respect of such deemed
Capital Contribution in accordance with _Section 4.6(b)(ii)_ , and increasing
the Managing Member's Capital Account by the amount of such Discount. For the
avoidance of doubt, any payments made to or on behalf of the Managing Member
pursuant to this _Section 7.11_  shall not be treated as a distribution
pursuant to _Section 6.1(a)_ but shall instead be treated as a cost or an
expense of the Company.

  



  

Article VIII 
 ROLE OF MEMBERS

  



  

Section 8.1 _Rights or Powers_. Other than the Managing Member, the Members,
acting in their capacity as Members, shall not have any right or power to
take part in the management or control of the Company or its business and
affairs, or to act for or bind the Company in any way. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Members have all the rights and powers specifically set forth
in this Agreement and, to the extent not inconsistent with this Agreement, in
the Act. Any Member, its Affiliates and its and their employees,
stockholders, agents, directors or officers may also be an employee or be
retained as an agent of the Company. Except as specifically provided herein,
a Member (other than the Managing Member) shall not, in its capacity as a
Member, take part in the operation, management or control of the Company's
business, transact any business in the Company's name or have the power to
sign documents for or otherwise bind the Company.

  



  

Section 8.2 _Voting_.

  



  

(a) Meetings of the Members may be called by the Managing Member. Such
request shall state the location of the meeting and the nature of the business
to be transacted at the meeting. Written notice of any such meeting shall be
given to all Members not less than two (2) Business Days and not more than 30
days prior to the date of such meeting. Members may vote in person, by proxy
or by telephone at any meeting of the Members and may waive advance notice of
such meeting. Whenever the vote or consent of Members is permitted or required
under this Agreement, such vote or consent may be given at a meeting of the
Members or may be given in accordance with the procedure prescribed in this
_Section 8.2_. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, the
affirmative vote of the Members holding a majority of the outstanding Units
shall constitute the act of the Members; _provided_ , that no shares of Class
B Common Stock may be Transferred unless a corresponding number of Units are
Transferred therewith in accordance with this Agreement.

  



    

Ex D-34

 



    



  

(b) Each Member may authorize any Person or Persons to act for it by proxy on
all matters in which such Member is entitled to participate, including
waiving notice of any meeting, or voting or participating at a meeting. Every
proxy must be signed by such Member or its attorney-in-fact. No proxy shall
be valid after the expiration of 11 months from the date thereof unless
otherwise provided in the proxy. Every proxy shall be revocable at the
pleasure of the Member executing it.

  



  

(c) Each meeting of Members shall be conducted by an Officer designated by
the Managing Member or such other individual Person as the Managing Member
deems appropriate.

  



  

(d) Any action required or permitted to be taken by the Members may be taken
without a meeting if the requisite Members whose approval is necessary
consent thereto in writing.

  



  

Section 8.3 _Various Capacities_. The Members acknowledge and agree that the
Members or their Affiliates will from time to time act in various capacities,
including as a Member or Company Representative.

  



  

Section 8.4 _Investment Opportunities_. To the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law, the doctrine of corporate opportunity, or any
analogous doctrine, shall not apply to any Member (other than Members who are
directors, officers, employees or other services providers of the Company,
PubCo or any of their respective subsidiaries), any of their respective
affiliates (other than the Company, the Managing Member or any of their
respective subsidiaries), or any of their respective officers, directors,
agents, shareholders, members, and partners (each, a " _Business
Opportunities Exempt Party_ "). The Company renounces any interest or
expectancy of the Company in, or in being offered an opportunity to
participate in, business opportunities that are from time to time presented
to any Business Opportunities Exempt Party. No Business Opportunities Exempt
Party who acquires knowledge of a potential transaction, agreement,
arrangement or other matter that may be an opportunity for the Company or any
of its subsidiaries shall have any duty to communicate or offer such
opportunity to the Company. No amendment or repeal of this Section 8.4 shall
apply to or have any effect on the liability or alleged liability of any
Business Opportunities Exempt Party for or with respect to any opportunities
of which any such Business Opportunities Exempt Party becomes aware prior to
such amendment or repeal. Any Person purchasing or otherwise acquiring any
interest in any Units shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to the
provisions of this _Section 8.4_. Neither the alteration, amendment or repeal
of this _Section 8.4_ , nor the adoption of any provision of this Agreement
inconsistent with this _Section 8.4_ , shall eliminate or reduce the effect of
this  _Section 8.4_ in respect of any business opportunity first identified
or any other matter occurring, or any cause of action, suit or claim that,
but for this _Section 8.4_ , would accrue or arise, prior to such alteration,
amendment, repeal or adoption. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set
forth in this Agreement, except as otherwise required by law, neither [●] nor
any of its Affiliates (including one or more associated investment funds or
portfolio companies) nor any of their respective directors, officers,
managers, members, equityholders or employees (each, an "Excluded
Person") shall have any duty (contractual or otherwise) to communicate or
present any corporate opportunities ("Excluded Opportunities") to the
Company, PubCo or any of their respective subsidiaries, Affiliates or
equityholders, and the Company and each of the Members, on its own behalf and
on behalf of their respective Affiliates and equityholders, hereby irrevocably
waive any right to require any Excluded Person to act in a manner
inconsistent with the provisions of this Section 8.4. Furthermore, none of the
Company or its subsidiaries or any Member will acquire or be entitled to any
interest or participation in any Excluded Opportunities as a result of the
participation therein by an Excluded Person.

Article IX 
 TRANSFERS OF INTERESTS

  



  

Section 9.1 _Restrictions on Transfer_.

  



  

(a) Except as provided in _Section 4.6_ , no Member shall Transfer all or any
portion of its Interest without the Managing Member's prior written consent,
which consent shall be granted or withheld in the Managing Member's sole
discretion. If, notwithstanding the provisions of this _Section 9.1(a)_ , all
or any portion of a Member's Interests are Transferred in violation of this
_Section 9.1(a)_ , involuntarily, by operation of law or otherwise, then
without limiting any other rights and remedies available to the other parties
under this Agreement or otherwise, the Transferee of such Interest (or portion
thereof) shall not be admitted to the Company as a Member nor be entitled to
any rights as a Member hereunder, and the Transferor will continue to be
bound by all obligations hereunder, unless and until the Managing Member
consents in writing to such admission, which consent shall be granted or
withheld in the Managing Member's sole discretion. Any attempted or purported
Transfer of all or a portion of a Member's Interests in violation of this
_Section 9.1(a)_ shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be null and
void and of no force or effect whatsoever. For the avoidance of doubt, the
restrictions on Transfer contained in this _Article IX_ shall not apply to
the Transfer of any capital stock of the Managing Member; _provided_ , that
no shares of Class B Common Stock may be Transferred unless a corresponding
number of Units are Transferred therewith in accordance with this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, but subject to any other restrictions on
Transfers set forth in this Agreement, (i) Atlas may distribute a number of
Common Units (and corresponding shares of Class B Common Stock) to its
limited partners (including Atlas Technical Consultants Management LLC) in
accordance with the provisions of Seller's limited partnership agreement and
Atlas Technical Consultants Management LLC may distribute the Common Units
(and corresponding shares of Class B Common Stock) it receives in such
distribution to its members; _provided_ , that (A) such limited partners are
not Affiliates of [Bernhard Capital Partners Management LP], which for the
avoidance of doubt shall not include Atlas Technical Consultants
Management LLC nor its members, (B) such distributions are made solely in
connection with the distribution of cash proceeds received in connection with
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement,

provisions of this Agreement to the extent of his or her community property or
quasi-community property interest, if any, in such Member's Interest. Unless

Agreement or any other Contract between the Managing Member, the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and such Transferor or any of its

withhold and giving a Member a reasonable opportunity to demonstrate that
withholding may not be required or, alternatively, that withholding at a
lesser tax rate may be permissible, the Company and its Subsidiaries may
withhold from distributions, allocations or portions thereof if it is required
to do so by any applicable rule, regulation or law, and each Member hereby
authorizes the Company and its Subsidiaries to withhold or pay on behalf of or
with respect to such Member any amount of taxes that the Managing Member

Ex D-39

 



    



  

(b) To the extent that any tax is paid by (or withheld from amounts payable
to) the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and the Managing Member
determines, in Good Faith, that such tax relates to one or more specific
Members (including any tax payable by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries pursuant to Section 6225 of the Code with respect to items of
income, gain, loss deduction or credit allocable or attributable to such
Member), such tax shall be treated as an amount of taxes withheld or paid with
respect to such Member pursuant to this  _Section 10.5_.

  



  

(c) For all purposes under this Agreement, any amounts withheld or paid with
respect to a Member pursuant to this _Section 10.5_ shall be treated as if
distributed to such Member at the time such withholding or payment is made.
Further, to the extent that the cumulative amount of such withholding or
payment for any period exceeds the distributions to which such Member is
entitled for such period, the amount of such excess shall be considered a
loan from the Company to such Member, with interest accruing at the Prime
Rate in effect from time to time, compounded annually. The Managing Member
may, in its discretion, either demand payment of the principal and accrued
interest on such demand loan at any time (which payment shall not be deemed a
Capital Contribution for purposes of this Agreement), and enforce payment
thereof by legal process, or may withhold from one or more distributions to a
Member amounts sufficient to satisfy such Member's obligations under any such
demand loan.

  



  

(d) Neither the Company nor the Managing Member shall be liable for any
excess taxes withheld in respect of any Member, and, in the event of over
withholding, a Member's sole recourse shall be to apply for a refund from the
appropriate Governmental Entity.

  



  

(e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, (i) any Person who
ceases to be a Member shall be treated as a Member for purposes of this
_Section 10.5_ and (ii) the obligations of a Member pursuant to this _Section

by the Company that relate to the period during which such Person was actually

Certificate of Non-foreign Status

  



  

[●], 2019

  



  

Section 1445 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_
") provides that a transferee of a U.S. real property interest must withhold
tax if the transferor is a foreign person. For U.S. tax purposes (including
Section 1445 of the Code), the owner of a disregarded entity (which has legal
title to a U.S. real property interest under local law) will be the transferor
of the property and not the disregarded entity. To inform Boxwood Merger
Corp., a Delaware corporation (" _Transferee_ "), that withholding of tax is
not required upon disposition of a U.S. real property interest by Atlas
Technical Consultants Holdings LP, a Delaware limited partnership ("
_Transferor_ "), the undersigned hereby certifies the following on behalf of
Transferor:

  



   | (i)| Transferor is not a foreign corporation, foreign partnership,
foreign trust or foreign estate (as those terms are defined in the Code and
Treasury Regulations); 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (ii)| Transferor's U.S. employer identification number is 82-2810333; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (iii)| Transferor's principal office address is 400 Convention Street,
Suite 1010, Baton Rouge, Louisiana 70802; and 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (iv)| Transferor is not a disregarded entity as defined in Treasury
Regulations § 1.1445-2(b)(2)(iii). 
---|---|--- 
  



  

Transferor understands that this certification may be disclosed to the
Internal Revenue Service by Transferee and that any false statement contained
herein could be punishable by fine, imprisonment or both.

  



  

Under penalties of perjury I declare that I have examined this certification
and to the best of my knowledge and belief it is true, correct and
complete, and I further declare that I have authority to sign this document
on behalf of the undersigned Transferor.

RESTRICTIVE COVENANT AGREEMENT

  



  

THIS RESTRICTIVE COVENANT AGREEMENT (this " _Agreement_ ") is made as of
[__], 2019,1 by and between Atlas TC Holdings LLC, a Delaware limited
liability company (" _Holdings_ "), Atlas Technical Consultants SPV, LLC, a
Delaware limited liability company (" _ATC SPV_ ") and Arrow Environmental
SPV, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (together with ATC SPV, "
_BCP_ ").

  



  

 _RECITALS_ :

  



  

A.  Reference herein is made to that certain Unit Purchase Agreement, dated
as of August [●], 2019 (as amended, restated or otherwise modified from time
to time, the " _Purchase Agreement_ "), by and among Boxwood Merger Corp., a
Delaware corporation (" _Parent_ "), Holdings, Atlas TC Buyer LLC, a Delaware
limited liability company (" _Buyer_ "), Atlas Intermediate Holdings LLC, a
Delaware limited liability company (" _Atlas_ ", and together with its
Subsidiaries, the " _Company_ "), and Atlas Technical Consultants Holdings
LP, a Delaware limited partnership and subsidiary of BCP (" _Seller_ "),
pursuant to which Buyer is purchasing certain issued and outstanding equity
interests of Atlas from Seller (the " _Transaction_ "). Capitalized terms not
expressly defined in this Agreement shall have the meanings ascribed to them
in the Purchase Agreement.

  



  

B.  BCP acknowledges and agrees that (i) this Agreement is being entered into
as part of the consummation of the Purchase Agreement and the Transaction,
(ii) the covenants and agreements set forth in this Agreement are a material
inducement to, and a condition precedent of, the Buyer Group consummating the
Transaction, (iii) BCP shall receive substantial benefits by the consummation
of the Transaction (including specifically its portion of the proceeds
received by Seller in connection with the Transaction) and (iv) the Buyer
Group and their Affiliates would not obtain the benefit of the bargain set
forth in the Purchase Agreement as specifically negotiated by the parties
thereto (including specifically the full benefit of the acquisition of the
Purchased Units of Atlas by Buyer) if BCP breached the provisions of this
Agreement.

  



  

C.  BCP further acknowledges and agrees that, as of the date of the
Transaction, it directly or indirectly owns an equity interest in Seller and,
pursuant to the Transaction, Seller is selling the Purchased Units to Buyer.
BCP acknowledges and understands that the following covenants and obligations
placed upon it are necessary and appropriate to protect the value of the
goodwill, confidential and proprietary information and trade secrets being
acquired by Buyer.

  



  

D.  BCP also acknowledges that prior to the Transaction, BCP may have been
provided access to the Company's Proprietary Information. Therefore, BCP
agrees that it is fair and reasonable for the Company to enter into this
Agreement with BCP to protect itself from the risk of misappropriation of
Proprietary Information. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Proprietary
Information" means information of the Company acquired by BCP or its
Affiliates (other than the Company) prior to the Closing Date (i) that is
designated as "confidential" by the Company, or (ii) that the Company
expressly indicates, prior to the Closing, through its policies, procedures,
or other instructions should not be disclosed to anyone outside each such
organization. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, Proprietary Information shall not include information that (a) is
or, other than as a result of BCP's disclosure in breach of this Agreement,
later becomes generally available to the public, (b) to the knowledge of BCP,
is properly obtained by BCP or its Affiliates from an independent source under
no obligation of confidentiality with respect to such information owed to
Buyer or the Company, (c) is information already in BCP's possession that is
not solely related or otherwise unique to the Company or (d) is information
developed by, or on behalf of, BCP or its Affiliates, without reference to or
the use of Proprietary Information. Proprietary Information may be provided in
any form, including electronic, oral, visual, or written form, whether or not
it is marked as being confidential. Proprietary Information need not be a
trade secret or know-how to be protected under this Agreement. By way of
illustration, but not limitation, Proprietary Information may include any
confidential information of the Company as of the Closing about the business,
methods, business plans, operations, products, processes, and services of the
Company or any Customer thereof. Proprietary Information may also include,
without limitation, confidentially held information of the Company as of the
Closing pertaining to: (i) the identities of the Company's actual Customers,
as well as the names, addresses, phone numbers and e-mail addresses of contact
persons and/or decision-makers employed by Customers; (ii) the volume of
business and the nature of the business relationship between Buyer or the
Company and their Customers; (iii) the pricing of the Company's products,
services and technology, including any deviations from its standard
pricing for particular Customers, as well as the financing methods employed
by and arrangements with existing or prospective Customers; (iv) information
regarding the Company's employees, including their identities, skills,
talents, knowledge, experience, compensation, and preferences; (v) business
plans and strategies, marketing and sales plans and strategies, revenue,
expense and profit projections, industry analyses, and any proposed or actual
implemented technology changes; (vi) information about financial results and
business condition; (vii) computer programs, software, source code, and
program designs developed by or for the Company and/or tailored to their
needs by their employees, independent contractors, consultants or vendors; and
(viii) all technology developed, enhanced, produced, employed, and/or
distributed by the Company. Proprietary Information includes trade secrets
and know-how.

  



  

  

  



  

1  _Note to Draft_ : To be executed as of the Closing Date.

    

  



  

   

Ex F-1

 



    



  

E.  BCP also agrees that the Company has developed, over a period of time,
and will continue to develop, goodwill between itself and its Customers. BCP
further acknowledges that this goodwill is a valuable asset belonging solely
to the Company, and the Company's successors and/or assigns. For purposes of
this Agreement, the term "Customer" means any individual,
proprietorship, partnership, corporation, association, or other entity that
has purchased or acquired products or services from, the Company during the
12 month period prior to the Closing.

  



  

F.  BCP agrees that, as part of its or its Affiliates ownership of the
Company, BCP is familiar with the compensation and benefits, capabilities,
experiences and skills of a number of the Company's employees. All such
information may constitute Proprietary Information.

  



  

 _AGREEMENT_ :

  



  

NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises and for other good
and valuable consideration, including the Proprietary Information that BCP
acquired as a result of BCP's position with, and ownership interest in, the
Company, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, it is
agreed:

  



       | 1.  | _Restrictive Covenants_. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

As an inducement for Parent, Holdings and Buyer to enter into the Purchase
Agreement, for the protection of the goodwill of the Company, and as
additional consideration for the consideration to be paid under the Purchase
Agreement, the parties hereto agree as follows:

  



       | (a)  | Ancillary  to the enforceable promises set forth
herein, BCP agrees that for a period of two years from and after the Closing
Date, BCP  shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, directly or
indirectly: 
---|---|--- 
  



       | (i)  | induce  or attempt to induce any of the persons set
forth on _Schedule 1_ hereto (each, an " _Executive_ " and,  collectively,
the " _Executives_ ") or other executive officer of the Company (as of the
Closing) to leave  the employ of the Company; _provided_ , _however_ , that
notwithstanding the promises and covenants within this _Section 1(a)(i)_, 
BCP shall not be precluded from (A) engaging in general solicitations or
advertising for personnel, including advertisements  and searches conducted
by a headhunter agency, provided that such solicitation, advertising or
searches are not specifically  directed at any such employees of the Company;
and (B) subject to _Section 1(a)(ii)_ , hiring any such person who contacts 
BCP or its Affiliates in response to solicitations or advertising under the
foregoing _clause (A)_ ; 
---|---|--- 
  



  

   

Ex F-2

 



    



       | (ii)  | hire  any Executive who was employed by the Company
at any time during the 12 month period prior to the Closing; or 
---|---|--- 
  



       | (iii)  | induce  or attempt to induce any Person that is, to
BCP's knowledge, a Customer, supplier or material business relation of the 
Company (including any Person that, to BCP's knowledge, was a Customer,
supplier or other material business relation  of the Company at any time
during the 12 month period immediately prior to the Closing) to cease doing
business with the Company. 
---|---|--- 
  



       | (b)  | From  and after the date hereof, each party hereto
agrees that it will not, and will direct its Affiliates not to, knowingly
make,  publish or communicate to any Person any oral or written statement
that disparages or places the other party hereto in respect  thereof in a
false light, except in connection with a legal proceeding, legal process or if
such party is otherwise required  by Law to cooperate with, or is responding
to a request from, a Governmental Entity or self-regulatory authority;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that nothing in this _Section 1(b)_ shall prohibit
any of the parties hereto or their Affiliates or any  parties to the Purchase
Agreement or any of the agreements entered into in connection therewith from
defending against claims,  or enforcing their rights, under this Agreement,
the Purchase Agreement or any of the other agreements entered in connection 
therewith. 
---|---|--- 
  



       | (c)  | From  and after the date hereof, except to the extent
consented to by Parent, Holdings, Buyer or the Company, BCP shall keep
confidential  (except as may be disclosed to its Affiliates, directors,
officers, partners, employees, agents, consultants, financing sources, 
investors (including direct and indirect limited partners or investors),
vehicles, managed accounts, attorneys, accountants,  financial advisors or
other representatives (collectively, " _Representatives_ ")) and not use or
disclose,  and shall direct its Representatives to keep confidential and to
not use or disclose, any and all Proprietary Information  relating directly
to the Company that remains in BCP's possession after the Closing. The
foregoing will not preclude  BCP and its Representatives from (i) disclosing
such Proprietary Information without liability hereunder if compelled  or
requested to disclose the same by legal, judicial or administrative process or
by other requirements of Law (including,  without limitation, by oral
questions, interrogatories, requests for information or documents in legal,
administrative, arbitration  or other formal proceedings, subpoena, civil
investigative demand or other similar process, including but not limited to
an  audit or examination by a regulator, bank examiner or self-regulatory
organization) (subject to the following sentence), (ii)  discussing or using
such Proprietary Information if the same hereafter is publically available
(other than as a result of  a breach of this _Section 1(c)_); (iii)
discussing or using such Proprietary Information to the extent such
information  is acquired or made available to BCP or its Representatives by a
Person that is not, to BCP's reasonable belief, subject  to an obligation of
confidentiality to the Company or any Person (other than BCP and its
Representatives) with respect to  such information; or (iv) using such
Proprietary Information in connection with its ownership of Equity Interests
of the Buyer  Group. If BCP or its Affiliates or their Representatives is
requested or required (by oral questions, interrogatories, requests  for
information or documents in legal, administrative, arbitration or other formal
proceedings, subpoena, civil investigative  demand or other similar process,
including but not limited to an audit or examination by a regulator, bank
examiner or self-regulatory  organization) to disclose any such Proprietary
Information, BCP shall, to the extent legally permissible, promptly notify 
Buyer Group of any such request or requirement so that Buyer Group may seek a
protective order or other appropriate remedy  (in each case, at Buyer Group's
sole expense) and/or waive compliance with the provisions of this _Section
1(c)_.  If based on the advice of counsel and in the absence of a protective
order or other remedy, BCP is required to disclose such  information, BCP,
without any liability hereunder, may disclose that portion of such information
that it believes in good  faith it is legally required to disclose.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, BCP shall not be
required  to give any notice and shall have no liability hereunder to the
extent BCP or its Representatives is requested or required  to disclose
Proprietary Information to the applicable regulatory or self-regulatory
authorities having supervisory jurisdiction  over BCP or its Representatives,
as applicable, during the course of any regulatory audit or examination. BCP
shall be liable  to the Company for the breach of this _Section 1(c)_ by any
of its Representatives. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

   

Ex F-3

 



    



       | (d)  | Notwithstanding  anything herein to the contrary,
nothing in this _Section 1_ shall in any way limit the activities of any
Affiliate (including  portfolio companies) of BCP or its Affiliates (or any
investment funds, vehicles or companies managed by Seller or its Affiliates) 
who are not in receipt of or otherwise provided any Proprietary Information;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing  shall not apply to the extent
any Affiliate (including portfolio companies) of BCP or its Affiliates is
acting at the specific  instruction of a Person in possession of Proprietary
Information who is using such Proprietary Information in making such 
instruction. For avoidance of doubt, no such Affiliate shall be deemed to be
"in receipt or otherwise provided any Proprietary  Information" solely as a
result of a Representative of BCP or its Affiliates (or any investment funds,
vehicles or companies  managed by BCP or its Affiliates) who is in possession
of Proprietary Information also being an officer, director or other  agent of
such portfolio company. 
---|---|--- 
  



       | 2.  | _Remedies_. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

In the event of a breach of any covenant set forth in _Section 1_ of this
Agreement, the non-breaching party may be entitled to have the following
rights and remedies, each of which rights and remedies shall be independent of
the others and severally enforceable, and each of which is in addition to,
and not in lieu of, any other rights and remedies available to the non-
breaching party at law or in equity:

  



       | (a)  | the  right and remedy to have the provisions of
_Section 1_ specifically enforced by any court of competent jurisdiction, 
it being agreed that any breach or threatened breach of such provisions may
cause irreparable injury to the non-breaching  party and that money damages
may not provide an adequate remedy to the non-breaching party; and 
---|---|--- 
  



       | (b)  | the  right to seek damages resulting from a breach of
the provisions of _Section 1_; and 
---|---|--- 
  



  

   

Ex F-4

 



    



       | (c)  | the  right to immediate injunctive relief, either by
temporary or permanent injunction to prevent such a breach. 
---|---|--- 
  



       | 3.  | _Tolling of Restriction_. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

If BCP is found to have violated any of the provisions of _Section 1_ , BCP
agrees that the restrictive period of each covenant so violated shall be
extended by a period of time equal to the period of such violation by BCP. It
is the intent of this paragraph that the running of the restrictive period of
any covenant shall be tolled during any period of violation of such covenants
so that the Company may obtain the full and reasonable protection for which
it contracted and so that BCP may not profit by any breach of such covenants.

  



       | 4.  | _Successors and Assigns;  Third Party Beneficiaries_. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

This Agreement will be binding upon the parties hereto and will inure to the
benefit of the parties hereto and their successors and permitted assigns. The
parties hereto expressly agree that Buyer is an intended third party
beneficiary of this Agreement.

  



       | 5.  | _Governing Law; Jurisdiction;  Venue_. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

The Laws of the State of Delaware shall govern (a) all claims or matters
related to or arising from this Agreement and (b) any questions concerning
the construction, interpretation, validity and enforceability of this
Agreement, and the performance of the obligations imposed by this Agreement,
in each case without giving effect to any choice-of-law or conflict-of-law
rules or provisions (whether of the State of Delaware or any other
jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the Law of any jurisdiction
other than the State of Delaware. Each party to this Agreement hereby
IRREVOCABLY waives all rights to trial by jury in any action, suit or
Proceeding brought to resolve any dispute between or among any of the parties
(whether arising in contract, tort or otherwise) arising out of, connected
with, related or incidental to this Agreement, the transactions contemplated
hereby and/or the relationships established among the parties hereunder. THE
PARTIES HERETO FURTHER WARRANT AND REPRESENT THAT EACH HAS REVIEWED THIS
WAIVER WITH ITS LEGAL COUNSEL, AND THAT EACH KNOWINGLY AND VOLUNTARILY WAIVES
ITS JURY TRIAL RIGHTS FOLLOWING CONSULTATION WITH LEGAL COUNSEL. Each of the
Parties submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of a state or federal court
sitting in the State of Delaware, County of New Castle. Nothing in this
_Section 4_, however, shall affect the right of any party to serve legal
process in any other manner permitted by Law or at equity. Each party hereto
agrees that a final judgment in any Proceeding so brought shall be conclusive
and may be enforced by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided
by Law or at equity.

  



       | 6.  | _Remedies_. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

In the event that BCP actually violates any of the provisions set forth
herein, BCP acknowledges that Buyer will suffer immediate and irreparable
harm which cannot be accurately calculated in monetary damages. Consequently,
BCP acknowledges and agrees that in the event BCP actually violates any of
the provisions set forth herein, in addition to any other remedy to which
Buyer may be entitled, Buyer shall be entitled to immediate injunctive
relief, either by temporary or permanent injunction, solely to the extent
necessary to prevent such a violation and may seek any other legal or
equitable relief to which it may be entitled. The parties hereto agree that
the bond to be posted if any injunction is sought in connection with this
Agreement shall not exceed $1,000.00. The pursuit of one remedy at any time
will not be deemed an election of remedies or waiver of the right to pursue
any other remedy.

  



  

   

Ex F-5

 



    



       | 7.  | _Severability_. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in
such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable Law, but if any
provision of this Agreement or the application of any such provision to any
Person or circumstance shall be held to be prohibited by or invalid, illegal
or unenforceable under applicable Law in any respect by a court of competent
jurisdiction, such provision shall be ineffective only to the extent of such
prohibition or invalidity, illegality or unenforceability,
without invalidating the remainder of such provision or the remaining
provisions of this Agreement. Furthermore, in lieu of such illegal, invalid
or unenforceable provision, such court of competent jurisdiction shall add as
a part of this Agreement a legal, valid and enforceable provision as similar
in terms to such illegal, invalid, or unenforceable provision as may be
possible.

  



       | 8.  | _Counterparts; Electronic  Delivery_. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

This Agreement may be executed and delivered in one or more counterparts and
by fax or email, each of which shall be deemed an original and all of which
shall be considered one and the same agreement. Neither party shall raise the
use of a fax machine or email to deliver a signature or the fact that any
signature or agreement or instrument was transmitted or communicated through
the use of a fax machine or email as a defense to the formation or
enforceability of this Agreement and each party forever waives any such
defense.

  



       | 9.  | _Section Headings;  Construction_. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

The headings of sections in this Agreement are provided for convenience only
and will not affect its construction or interpretation. All references to
"Section" or "Sections" refer to the corresponding Section or Sections of this
Agreement unless otherwise specified. All words used in this Agreement will
be construed to be of such gender or number as the circumstances require.
Unless otherwise expressly provided, the word "including" does not limit the
preceding words or terms.

  



       | 10.  | _Assignment_. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

Neither this Agreement nor any right, remedy, obligation or liability arising
hereunder or by reason hereof may be assigned by any party without the prior
written consent of the other party hereto.

Article II. 
  _REGISTRATIONS_

  



  

Section 2.1 _Registration Statement_. The Company shall, as soon as
practicable after the Closing Date, but in any event within 30 days after the
Closing Date, file a Registration Statement under the Securities Act to permit
the public resale of all the Registrable Securities held by the Holders from
time to time as permitted by Rule 415 under the Securities Act (or
any successor or similar provision adopted by the Commission then in effect)
on the terms and conditions specified in this _Section 2.1_ and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause such Registration Statement to be declared
effective as soon as practicable after the filing thereof, but in any event
no later than the earlier of (a) 60 days (or 90 days if the Commission
notifies the Company that it will "review" the Registration Statement) after
the Closing Date and (b) the tenth Business Day after the date the Company is
notified (orally or in writing, whichever is earlier) by the Commission that
such Registration Statement will not be "reviewed" or will not be subject to
further review (such earlier date, the " _Effectiveness Deadline_ "). The
Registration Statement filed with the Commission pursuant to this _Section
2.1_ shall be on Form S-1 or such other form of registration statement as is
then available to effect a registration for resale of such Registrable
Securities, covering such Registrable Securities, and shall contain a
Prospectus in such form as to permit any Holder to sell such Registrable
Securities pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act (or any successor or
similar provision adopted by the Commission then in effect) at any time
beginning on the effective date for such Registration Statement. If the
initial Registration Statement (the " _Initial Shelf_ ") filed by the Company
pursuant to this _Section 2.1_ is on Form S-1, upon the Company becoming
eligible to register the Registrable Securities for resale by the Holders on
Form S-3, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to amend the
Initial Shelf to a Registration Statement on Form S-3 or file a Registration
Statement on Form S-3 in substitution of the Initial Shelf (the "
_Replacement S-3 Shelf_ ") and cause the Replacement S-3 Shelf to be declared
effective as soon as practicable thereafter. A Registration Statement filed
pursuant to this _Section 2.1_ shall provide for the resale pursuant to any
method or combination of methods legally available to, and requested by, the
Holders. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause a
Registration Statement filed pursuant to this _Section 2.1_ to remain
effective, and to be supplemented and amended to the extent necessary to
ensure that such Registration Statement is available or, if not
available, that another registration statement is available, for the resale
of all the Registrable Securities held by the Holders until all such
Registrable Securities have ceased to be Registrable Securities. If at any
time a Registration Statement filed pursuant to this Section 2.1 is not
effective or is not otherwise available for the resale of all the Registrable
Securities held by the Holders, the majority of the Holders or [BCP] may
demand registration under the Securities Act of all or part of their
Registrable Securities at any time and from time to time, and the Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts to file with the Commission following
receipt of any such demand one or more Registration Statements with respect
to all such Registrable Securities and to cause such Registration Statement
to be declared effective by the Commission as soon as practicable after the
filing thereof. As soon as practicable following the effective date of a
Registration Statement filed pursuant to this _Section 2.1_ , but in any event
within three Business Days of such date, the Company shall notify the Holders
of the effectiveness of such Registration Statement. When effective, a
Registration Statement filed pursuant to this _Section 2.1_ (including any
documents incorporated therein by reference) will comply as to form in all
material respects with all applicable requirements of the Securities Act and
the Exchange Act and will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements therein not misleading (in the case of any Prospectus
contained in such Registration Statement, in the light of the
circumstances under which such statement is made).

  



  

   

Ex G-5

 



    



  

Section 2.2 _Underwritten Offering_.

  



  

(a) In the event that any Holder elects to dispose of Registrable Securities
under a Registration Statement pursuant to an Underwritten Offering of all or
part of such Registrable Securities that are registered by such Registration
Statement, then the Company shall, upon the written demand of [BCP] or its
designee (any such Holder, a " _Demanding Holder_ "), enter into an
underwriting agreement in a form as is customary in Underwritten Offerings of
equity securities with the managing Underwriter or Underwriters selected by
the Demanding Holder in consultation with the Company, and shall take all such
other reasonable actions as are requested by the managing Underwriter or
Underwriters in order to expedite or facilitate the disposition of such
Registrable Securities. In addition, the Company shall give prompt written
notice to each other Holder regarding such proposed Underwritten Offering,
and such notice shall offer such Holders the opportunity to include in the
Underwritten Offering such number of Registrable Securities as each such
Holder may request. Each such Holder shall make such request in writing to the
Company within five Business Days after the receipt of any such notice from
the Company, which request shall specify the number of Registrable Securities
intended to be disposed of by such Holder. Each Holder proposing to
distribute its Registrable Securities through an Underwritten Offering
pursuant to this _Section 2.2_ shall enter into an underwriting agreement
with the underwriters, which underwriting agreement shall contain such
representations, covenants, indemnities (subject to _Article IV_ ) and other
rights and obligations as are customary in underwritten offerings of equity
securities; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such Holder shall be required to
make any representations or warranties to or agreements with the Company or
the Underwriters other than representations, warranties or agreements
regarding such Holder's authority to enter into such underwriting agreement
and to sell, and its ownership of, the securities being registered on its
behalf, its intended method of distribution and any other representation
required by law.

  



  

(b) If the managing Underwriter or Underwriters in an Underwritten Offering,
in good faith, advises the Company and the Demanding Holder that the dollar
amount or number of Registrable Securities that the Demanding Holder desires
to sell, taken together with all other shares of Class A Common Stock or
other equity securities that the Company or any other Holder desires to sell
and the shares of Class A Common Stock, if any, as to which a Registration
has been requested pursuant to separate written contractual piggy-
back registration rights held by any other stockholders who desire to sell,
exceeds the maximum dollar amount or maximum number of equity securities that
can be sold in the Underwritten Offering without adversely affecting the
proposed offering price, the timing, the distribution method, or the
probability of success of such offering (such maximum dollar amount or maximum
number of such securities, as applicable, the " _Maximum Number of
Securities_ "), then the Company shall include in such Underwritten
Offering, as follows:

  



  

(i) _first_ , the Registrable Securities of the Demanding Holders pro rata
based on the respective number of Registrable Securities that each Demanding
Holder has requested be included in such Underwritten Offering and the
aggregate number of Registrable Securities that the Demanding Holders have
requested be included in such Underwritten Offering that can be sold without
exceeding the Maximum Number of Securities;

  



  

   

Ex G-6

 



    



  

(ii) _second_ , to the extent that the Maximum Number of Securities has not
been reached under the foregoing _clause (i)_ , pro rata to (A) Registrable
Securities of other Holders who have elected to participate in the
Underwritten Offering pursuant to _Section 2.2(a)_  and (B) Founder
Registrable Securities of Founder Holders exercising their rights to register
their Founder Registrable Securities pursuant to the Founder Registration
Rights Agreement, which can be sold without exceeding the Maximum Number of
Securities;

  



  

(iii) _third_ , to the extent that the Maximum Number of Securities has not
been reached under the foregoing clause (i) or clause (ii), to shares of
Class A Common Stock held by persons or entities that the Company is obligated
to register in a Registration pursuant to separate written contractual
arrangements with such persons, which collectively can be sold without
exceeding the Maximum Number of Securities; and

  



  

(iv) _fourth_ , to the extent that the Maximum Number of Securities has not
been reached under the foregoing _clause (i) , clause (ii)_, or clause
(iii), shares of Class A Common Stock or other equity securities that the
Company desires to sell, which can be sold without exceeding the Maximum
Number of Securities.

  



  

(c) A Demanding Holder shall have the right to withdraw all or any portion of
its Registrable Securities included in an Underwritten Offering pursuant to
this _Section 2.2_ for any or no reason whatsoever upon written notification
to the Company and the Underwriter or Underwriters of its intention to
withdraw from such Underwritten Offering prior to the pricing of such
Underwritten Offering and such withdrawn amount shall no longer be considered
an Underwritten Offering. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, the Company shall be responsible for the Registration
Expenses incurred in connection with an Underwritten Offering prior to its
withdrawal under this _Section 2.2(c)_.

  



  

   

Ex G-7

 



    



  

Section 2.3 _Piggyback Registration_.

  



  

(a) If at any time the Company proposes to file a Registration Statement
under the Securities Act with respect to an Underwritten Offering of equity
securities, or securities or other obligations exercisable or exchangeable
for, or convertible into equity securities, for its own account or for the
account of stockholders of the Company (or by the Company and by the
stockholders of the Company including, without limitation, pursuant to
_Section 2.2_ hereof) on a form that would permit registration of Registrable
Securities, other than a Registration Statement (i) filed in connection with
any employee stock option or other benefit plan, (ii) for an exchange offer
or offering of securities solely to the Company's existing stockholders, (iii)
for an offering of debt that is convertible into equity securities of the
Company, (iv) for a dividend reinvestment plan or (v) on Form S-4, then the
Company shall give written notice of such proposed filing to all of the
Holders of Registrable Securities as soon as practicable but not less than
ten days before the anticipated filing date of such Registration Statement,
which notice shall (A) describe the amount and type of securities to be
included in such offering, the intended method(s) of distribution, and the
name of the proposed managing Underwriter or Underwriters, if any, in such
offering, and (B) offer to all of the Holders of Registrable Securities the
opportunity to register the sale of such number of Registrable Securities as
such Holders may request in writing within five days after receipt of such
written notice (in the case of an "overnight" or "bought" offering, such
requests must be made by the Holders within three Business Days after the
delivery of any such notice by the Company) (such Registration a " _Piggyback
Registration_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that if the Company has
been advised in writing by the managing Underwriter(s) that the inclusion of
Registrable Securities for sale for the benefit of the Holders will have an
adverse effect on the price, timing or distribution of the Class A Common
Stock in the Underwritten Offering, then (1) if no Registrable Securities can
be included in the Underwritten Offering in the opinion of the managing
Underwriter(s), the Company shall not be required to offer such opportunity
to the Holders or (2) if any Registrable Securities can be included in the
Underwritten Offering in the opinion of the managing Underwriter(s), then the
amount of Registrable Securities to be offered for the accounts of Holders
shall be determined based on the provisions of _Section 2.3(b)_. Subject to
_Section 2.3(b)_ , the Company shall, in good faith, cause such Registrable
Securities to be included in such Piggyback Registration and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the managing Underwriter or Underwriters of a
proposed Underwritten Offering to permit the Registrable Securities requested
by the Holders pursuant to this _Section 2.3_ to be included in a Piggyback
Registration on the same terms and conditions as any similar securities of
the Company included in such Registration and to permit the sale or other
disposition of such Registrable Securities in accordance with the intended
method(s) of distribution thereof. If no written request for inclusion from a
Holder is received within the specified time, each such Holder shall have no
further right to participate in such Underwritten Offering. All such Holders
proposing to distribute their Registrable Securities through an Underwritten
Offering under this _Section 2.3_ shall enter into an underwriting agreement
in customary form with the Underwriter(s) selected for such Underwritten
Offering by the Company.

(b) If the managing Underwriter or Underwriters in an Underwritten Offering
that is to be a Piggyback Registration, in good faith, advises the Company
and the Holders of Registrable Securities participating in the Piggyback
Registration in writing that the dollar amount or number of shares of Class A
Common Stock that the Company desires to sell, taken together with (i) the
shares of Class A Common Stock, if any, as to which Registration has been
demanded pursuant to separate written contractual arrangements with
persons or entities other than the Holders of Registrable Securities
hereunder, (ii) the Registrable Securities as to which registration has been
requested pursuant to _Sections 2.2_ and _2.3_ , and (iii) the shares of Class
A Common Stock, if any, as to which Registration has been requested pursuant
to separate written contractual piggy-back registration rights of other
stockholders of the Company, exceeds the Maximum Number of Securities, then:

  



  

(i) If the Registration is undertaken for the Company's account, the Company
shall include in any such Registration (A) _first_ , shares of Class A
Common Stock or other equity securities that the Company desires to sell,
which can be sold without exceeding the Maximum Number of Securities; (B)
_second_ , to the extent that the Maximum Number of Securities has not been
reached under the foregoing _clause (A)_ , pro rata to (1) the Registrable
Securities of Holders exercising their rights to register their Registrable
Securities pursuant to _Sections 2.2_ and _2.3_ hereof; and (2) the Founder
Registrable Securities of Founder Holders exercising their rights to register
their Founder Registrable Securities pursuant to the Founder
Registration Rights Agreement, which can be sold without exceeding the
Maximum Number of Securities, and (C) _third_ , to the extent that the
Maximum Number of Securities has not been reached under the foregoing _clauses
(A)_ and _(B)_ , shares of Class A Common Stock, if any, as to which
Registration has been requested pursuant to written contractual piggy-back
registration rights of other stockholders of the Company, which can be sold
without exceeding the Maximum Number of Securities;

  



  

(ii) If the Registration is pursuant to a request by persons or entities
other than the Holders of Registrable Securities, then the Company shall
include in any such Registration (A) _first_ , shares of Class A Common Stock
or other equity securities, if any, of such requesting persons or entities,
other than the Holders of Registrable Securities, which can be sold without
exceeding the Maximum Number of Securities; (B) _second_ , to the extent
that the Maximum Number of Securities has not been reached under the
foregoing _clause (A)_ , pro rata to (1) the Registrable Securities of Holders
exercising their rights to register their Registrable Securities pursuant to
_Sections 2.2_ and _2.3_ hereof; and (2) the Founder Registrable
Securities of Founder Holders exercising their rights to register their
Founder Registrable Securities pursuant to the Founder Registration Rights
Agreement, which can be sold without exceeding the Maximum Number of
Securities; (C) _third_ , to the extent that the Maximum Number of
Securities has not been reached under the foregoing _clauses (A)_ and _(B)_ ,
shares of Class A Common Stock or other equity securities that the Company
desires to sell, which can be sold without exceeding the Maximum Number of
Securities; and (D) _fourth_ , to the extent that the Maximum Number of
Securities has not been reached under the foregoing  _clauses (A)_ , _(B)_
and _(C)_ , shares of Class A Common Stock or other equity securities for the
account of other persons or entities that the Company is obligated to
register pursuant to separate written contractual arrangements with such
persons or entities, which can be sold without exceeding the Maximum Number of
Securities.

  



  

(c) Any Holder of Registrable Securities shall have the right to withdraw
from a Piggyback Registration for any or no reason whatsoever upon written
notification to the Company and the Underwriter or Underwriters (if any) of
its intention to withdraw from such Piggyback Registration prior to the
pricing of such Underwritten Offering. The Company (whether on its own good
faith determination or as the result of a request for withdrawal by persons
pursuant to separate written contractual obligations) may withdraw a
Registration Statement filed with the Commission in connection with a
Piggyback Registration at any time prior to the effectiveness of
such Registration Statement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, the Company shall be responsible for the Registration Expenses
incurred in connection with the Piggyback Registration prior to its withdrawal
under this _Section 2.3_.

  



  

   

Ex G-9

 



    



  

(d) For purposes of clarity, any Registration effected pursuant to _Section
2.3_ hereof shall not be counted as a Registration effected under _Section
2.2_ hereof.

  



  

Section 2.4 _Registrations on Form S-3_. The Holders of Registrable
Securities may at any time, and from time to time, request in writing that
the Company, pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act (or any successor
rule promulgated thereafter by the Commission), register the resale of any or
all of their Registrable Securities on Form S-3 or similar short
form registration statement that may be available at such time (" _Form S-3_
"); _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not be obligated to
effect such request through an Underwritten Offering. Within five days of the
Company's receipt of a written request from a Holder or Holders of
Registrable Securities for a Registration on Form S-3, the Company
shall promptly give written notice of the proposed Registration on Form S-3
to all other Holders of Registrable Securities, and each Holder of
Registrable Securities who thereafter wishes to include all or a portion of
such Holder's Registrable Securities in such Registration on Form S-3 shall
so notify the Company, in writing, within ten days after the receipt by the
Holder of the notice from the Company. As soon as practicable thereafter, but
not more than 12 days after the Company's initial receipt of such written
request for a Registration on Form S-3, the Company shall register all or such
portion of such Holder's Registrable Securities as are specified in such
written request, together with all or such portion of Registrable Securities
of any other Holder or Holders joining in such request as are specified in
the written notification given by such Holder or Holders; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that the Company shall not be obligated to effect any such
Registration pursuant to _Section 2.3_ hereof if a Form S-3 is not available
for such offering.

  



  

Article III. 
  _COMPANY PROCEDURES_

  



  

Section 3.1 _General Procedures_. The Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to effect the Registration of Registrable Securities in accordance
with the intended plan of distribution thereof, and pursuant thereto the
Company shall, as expeditiously as practicable:

  



  

(a) subject to _Section 2.1_ , prepare and file with the Commission a
Registration Statement with respect to such Registrable Securities and use
its reasonable best efforts to cause such Registration Statement to become
effective and remain effective pursuant to the terms of this Agreement until
all of such Registrable Securities have been disposed of (if earlier);

  



  

(b) prepare and file with the Commission such amendments and post-effective
amendments to the Registration Statement, and such supplements to the
Prospectus, as may be required by the rules, regulations or instructions
applicable to the registration form used by the Company or by the Securities
Act or rules and regulations thereunder to keep the Registration Statement
effective until all of such Registrable Securities have been disposed of (if
earlier) in accordance with the intended plan of distribution set forth
in such Registration Statement or supplement to the Prospectus;

  



  

(c) prior to filing a Registration Statement or Prospectus, or any amendment
or supplement thereto, furnish without charge to the Underwriters, if any,
and the Holders of Registrable Securities included in such Registration, and
to one legal counsel selected by the Holders, copies of such Registration
Statement as proposed to be filed, each amendment and supplement to such
Registration Statement (in each case including all exhibits thereto and
documents incorporated by reference therein), the Prospectus included in such
Registration Statement (including each preliminary Prospectus), and such
other documents as the Underwriters and the Holders of Registrable Securities
included in such Registration or the legal counsel selected by such Holders
may request in order to facilitate the disposition of the Registrable
Securities owned by such Holders;

  



  

   

Ex G-10

 



    



  

(d) prior to any public offering of Registrable Securities, use its
reasonable best efforts to (i) register or qualify the Registrable Securities
covered by the Registration Statement under such securities or "blue sky" laws
of such jurisdictions in the United States as the Holders of Registrable
Securities included in such Registration Statement (in light of their
intended plan of distribution) may request and (ii) take such action
necessary to cause such Registrable Securities covered by the Registration
Statement to be registered with or approved by such other governmental
authorities as may be necessary by virtue of the business and operations of
the Company and do any and all other acts and things that may be necessary or
advisable to enable the Holders of Registrable Securities included in such
Registration Statement to consummate the disposition of such
Registrable Securities in such jurisdictions; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the Company shall not be required to qualify generally to do business or as a
dealer in securities in any jurisdiction where it would not otherwise be
required to qualify or take any action to which it would be subject to
general service of process or taxation in any such jurisdiction where it is
not then otherwise so subject;

  



  

(e) use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause all such Registrable
Securities to be listed on each securities exchange or automated quotation
system on which similar securities issued by the Company are then listed;

  



  

(f) provide a transfer agent and registrar for all such Registrable
Securities no later than the effective date of such Registration Statement;

  



  

(g) advise each seller of such Registrable Securities, promptly after it
shall receive notice or obtain knowledge thereof, of the issuance of any stop
order by the Commission suspending the effectiveness of such Registration
Statement or the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose
and promptly use its reasonable best efforts to prevent the issuance of any
stop order or to obtain its withdrawal if such stop order should be issued;

  



  

(h) at least five days prior to the filing of any Registration Statement or
Prospectus or any amendment or supplement to such Registration Statement or
Prospectus or any document that is to be incorporated by reference into such
Registration Statement or Prospectus, furnish a copy thereof to each seller
of such Registrable Securities or its counsel;

  



  

(i) notify the Holders at any time when a Prospectus relating to such
Registration Statement is required to be delivered under the Securities Act,
of the happening of any event as a result of which the Prospectus included in
such Registration Statement, as then in effect, includes a Misstatement, and
then to correct such Misstatement as set forth in _Section 3.4_ hereof;

  



  

   

Ex G-11

 



    



  

(j) permit a representative of the Holders, the Underwriters, if any, and any
attorney or accountant retained by such Holders or Underwriter to
participate, at each such person's own expense, in the preparation of the
Registration Statement, and cause the Company's officers, directors and
employees to supply all information reasonably requested by any such
representative, Underwriter, attorney or accountant in connection with the
Registration; _provided_ , _however_ , that such representatives or
Underwriters enter into a confidentiality agreement, in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the Company, prior to the release or disclosure of
any such information;

  



  

(k) obtain a "cold comfort" letter from the Company's independent registered
public accountants in the event of an Underwritten Offering, in customary
form and covering such matters of the type customarily covered by "cold
comfort" letters as the managing Underwriter may reasonably request;

  



  

(l) on the date the Registrable Securities are delivered for sale pursuant to
such Registration, obtain an opinion, dated as of such date, of counsel
representing the Company for the purposes of such Registration, addressed to
the placement agent or sales agent, if any, and the Underwriters, if any,
covering such legal matters with respect to the Registration in respect of
which such opinion is being given as are customarily included in such
opinions and negative assurance letters;

  



  

(m) in the event of any Underwritten Offering, enter into and perform its
obligations under an underwriting agreement, on terms agreed to by the
Company with the managing Underwriter of such offering;

  



  

(n) make available to its security holders, as soon as reasonably
practicable, an earnings statement (which need not be audited) covering the
period of at least twelve (12) months beginning with the first day of the
Company's first full calendar quarter after the effective date of the
Registration Statement which satisfies the provisions of Section 11(a) of the
Securities Act and Rule 158 thereunder (or any successor rule promulgated
thereafter by the Commission);

  



  

(o) if the Registration involves the Registration of Registrable Securities
involving gross proceeds in excess of $25,000,000, use its reasonable efforts
to make available senior executives of the Company to participate in customary
"road show" presentations that may be reasonably requested by the Underwriter
in such Underwritten Offering; and

  



  

(p) otherwise, in good faith, take such customary actions necessary to effect
the registration of such Registrable Securities contemplated hereby.

  



  

Section 3.2 _Registration Expenses_. The Registration Expenses of all
Registrations shall be borne by the Company. It is acknowledged by the
Holders and the Company that the Holders shall bear all incremental selling
expenses relating to the sale of Registrable Securities, such as
Underwriters' commissions and discounts, brokerage fees and, other than as set
forth in the definition of "Registration Expenses," all reasonable fees and
expenses of any legal counsel representing the Holders.

  



  

   

Ex G-12

 



    



  

Section 3.3 _Requirements for Participation in Underwritten Offerings_. No
person may participate in any Underwritten Offering for equity securities of
the Company hereunder unless such person (a) agrees to sell such person's
securities on the basis provided in the underwriting agreement for such
Underwritten Offering and (b) completes and executes all
customary questionnaires, powers of attorney, indemnities, lock-up
agreements, underwriting agreements and other customary documents as may be
reasonably required under the terms of such underwriting agreement.

  



  

Section 3.4 _Suspension of Sales; Adverse Disclosure_.

  



  

(a) Upon receipt of written notice from the Company that a Registration
Statement or Prospectus contains a Misstatement, each of the Holders shall
forthwith discontinue disposition of Registrable Securities until it has
received copies of a supplemented or amended Prospectus correcting the
Misstatement (it being understood that the Company hereby covenants to prepare
and file such supplement or amendment as soon as practicable after the time
of such notice), or until it is advised in writing by the Company that the use
of the Prospectus may be resumed (any such period, a " _Suspension Period_
").

  



  

(b) If the filing, initial effectiveness or continued use of a Registration
Statement in respect of any Registration (including in connection with an
Underwritten Offering) at any time would require the Company to make an
Adverse Disclosure or would require the inclusion in such Registration
Statement of financial statements that are unavailable to the Company for
reasons beyond the Company's control, then the Company may, upon giving
prompt written notice to the Holders, delay the filing or initial
effectiveness of, or suspend use of, such Registration Statement (including
in connection with an Underwritten Offering) for the shortest period of time,
but in no event more than 30 days, determined in good faith by the Company to
be necessary for such purpose (any such period, a " _Blackout Period_ "). In
the event the Company exercises its rights under the preceding sentence,
the Holders agree to suspend, immediately upon their receipt of the notice
referred to above, their use of the Prospectus relating to any Registration
in connection with any sale or offer to sell Registrable Securities.

  



  

(c) The Company shall immediately notify the Holders of the expiration of any
period during which it exercised its rights under this _Section 3.4_.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 3.4_ , in no event
shall any Suspension Period or any Blackout Period continue for more than 90
days in the aggregate during any 365-day period.

  



  

Section 3.5 _Reporting Obligations_. As long as any Holder shall own
Registrable Securities, the Company, at all times while it shall be a
reporting company under the Exchange Act, covenants to:

  



  

(a)  make and keep public information regarding the Company available, as
those terms are understood and defined in Rule 144, at all times from and
after the Closing Date until there are no Registrable Securities outstanding;

  



  

(b) file timely (or obtain extensions in respect thereof and file within the
applicable grace period) all reports required to be filed by the Company
after the date hereof pursuant to Sections 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act
and to promptly furnish the Holders with true and complete copies of all such
filings (the delivery of which will be satisfied by the Company's filing of
such reports on the Commission's EDGAR system); and

  



  

   

Ex G-13

 



    



  

(c)  The Company further covenants that it shall take such further action as
any Holder may reasonably request, all to the extent required from time to
time to enable such Holder to sell shares of Class A Common Stock held by such
Holder without registration under the Securities Act within the limitation of
the exemptions provided by Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act (or
any successor rule promulgated thereafter by the Commission), including
providing any legal opinions. Upon the request of any Holder, the
Company shall deliver to such Holder a written certification of a duly
authorized officer as to whether it has complied with such requirements.

  



  

Section 3.6 _Removal of Legend_. In connection with a sale of Registrable
Securities by a Holder in reliance on Rule 144, the Holder or its broker
shall deliver to the transfer agent and the Company a broker representation
letter providing to the transfer agent and the Company any information the
Company deems necessary to determine that the sale of the
Registrable Securities is made in compliance with Rule 144. Upon receipt of
such representation letter, the Company shall promptly direct its transfer
agent to remove the notation of a restrictive legend in the Holder's
certificate or the book entry account maintained by the transfer agent, and
the Company shall bear all costs associated therewith. At such time as the
Registrable Securities have been sold pursuant to an effective registration
statement under the Securities Act, if the book entry account or certificate
for such Registrable Securities still bears any notation of restrictive
legend, the Company agrees, upon request of the Holder or permitted assignee,
to take all steps necessary to promptly effect the removal of any restrictive
legend from the Registrable Securities, and the Company shall bear all costs
associated therewith, regardless of whether the request is made in connection
with a sale or otherwise, so long as the Holder or its permitted assigns
provide to the Company any information the Company deems reasonably necessary
to determine that the legend is no longer required under the Securities Act or
applicable state laws.

  



  

Article IV. 
  _INDEMNIFICATION AND CONTRIBUTION_

  



  

Section 4.1 _Indemnification_.

  



  

(a) The Company agrees to indemnify, to the extent permitted by law, each
Holder of Registrable Securities, its officers and directors and each person
who controls such Holder (within the meaning of the Securities Act) against
all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses (including attorneys'
fees) caused by any untrue or alleged untrue statement of material fact
contained in any Registration Statement, Prospectus or preliminary Prospectus
or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto or any omission or alleged
omission of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make
the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as the same are caused
by or contained in any information furnished in writing to the Company by such
Holder expressly for use therein. The Company shall indemnify the
Underwriters, their officers and directors and each person who controls such
Underwriters (within the meaning of the Securities Act) to the same extent as
provided in the foregoing with respect to the indemnification of the Holder.

  



  

   

Ex G-14

 



    



  

(b) In connection with any Registration Statement in which a Holder of
Registrable Securities is participating, such Holder shall furnish to the
Company in writing such information and affidavits as the Company reasonably
requests for use in connection with any such Registration Statement or
Prospectus and, to the extent permitted by law, shall indemnify the Company,
its directors and officers and agents and each person who controls the
Company (within the meaning of the Securities Act) against any losses, claims,
damages, liabilities and expenses (including without limitation reasonable
attorneys' fees) resulting from any untrue statement of material fact
contained in the Registration Statement, Prospectus or preliminary Prospectus
or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto or any omission of a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein
not misleading, but only to the extent that such untrue statement or omission
is contained in any information or affidavit so furnished in writing by such
Holder expressly for use therein; _provided_ , _however_ , that the obligation
to indemnify shall be several, not joint and several, among such Holders of
Registrable Securities, and the liability of each such Holder of Registrable
Securities shall be in proportion to and limited to the net proceeds received
by such Holder from the sale of Registrable Securities pursuant to such
Registration Statement. The Holders of Registrable Securities shall indemnify
the Underwriters, their officers, directors and each person who controls such
Underwriters (within the meaning of the Securities Act) to the same extent as
provided in the foregoing with respect to indemnification of the Company.

  



  

(c) Any person entitled to indemnification herein shall (i) give prompt
written notice to the indemnifying party of any claim with respect to which
it seeks indemnification (provided that the failure to give prompt notice
shall not impair any person's right to indemnification hereunder to the
extent such failure has not materially prejudiced the indemnifying party) and
(ii) unless in such indemnified party's reasonable judgment a conflict of
interest between such indemnified and indemnifying parties may exist with
respect to such claim, permit such indemnifying party to assume the defense of
such claim with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party. If
such defense is assumed, the indemnifying party shall not be subject to any
liability for any settlement made by the indemnified party without its
consent (but such consent shall not be unreasonably withheld).
An indemnifying party who is not entitled to, or elects not to, assume the
defense of a claim shall not be obligated to pay the fees and expenses of
more than one counsel for all parties indemnified by such indemnifying party
with respect to such claim, unless in the reasonable judgment of any
indemnified party a conflict of interest may exist between such indemnified
party and any other of such indemnified parties with respect to such claim.
No indemnifying party shall, without the consent of the indemnified
party, consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement
which cannot be settled in all respects by the payment of money (and such
money is so paid by the indemnifying party pursuant to the terms of such
settlement) or which settlement does not include as an unconditional term
thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such indemnified party of a
release from all liability in respect to such claim or litigation.

  



  

(d) The indemnification provided for under this Agreement shall remain in
full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of
the indemnified party or any officer, director or controlling person of such
indemnified party and shall survive the transfer of securities. The Company
and each Holder of Registrable Securities participating in an offering also
agrees to make such provisions as are reasonably requested by any indemnified
party for contribution to such party in the event the Company's or such
Holder's indemnification is unavailable for any reason.

  



  

   

Ex G-15

 



    



  

(e) If the indemnification provided under this _Section 4.1_ from the
indemnifying party is unavailable or insufficient to hold harmless an
indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities and
expenses referred to herein, then the indemnifying party, in lieu of
indemnifying the indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or
payable by the indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages,
liabilities and expenses in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the
relative fault of the indemnifying party and the indemnified party, as well
as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of the
indemnifying party and indemnified party shall be determined by reference to,
among other things, whether any action in question, including any untrue or
alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to
state a material fact, was made by, or relates to information supplied by,
such indemnifying party or indemnified party, and the indemnifying
party's and indemnified party's relative intent, knowledge, access to
information and opportunity to correct or prevent such action;  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the liability of any Holder under this _Section 4.1(e)_ shall
be limited to the amount of the net proceeds received by such Holder in such
offering giving rise to such liability. The amount paid or payable by a
party as a result of the losses or other liabilities referred to above shall
be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth in _Section
4.1(a)_ , _Section 4.1(b)_ and _Section 4.1(c)_ above, any legal or other
fees, charges or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection
with any investigation or proceeding. The parties hereto agree that it would
not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this _Section 4.1(e)_
were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation,
which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in
this _Section 4.1(e)_. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation
(within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled
to contribution pursuant to this _Section 4.1(e)_ from any person who was
not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.

or email as a defense to the formation or enforceability of a contract and
each party hereto forever waives any such defense.

  



  

Section 5.4 _Governing Law_. The law of the State of Delaware shall govern
(a) all claims or matters related to or arising from this Agreement
(including any tort or non-contractual claims) and (b) any questions
concerning the construction, interpretation, validity and enforceability of
this Agreement, and the performance of the obligations imposed by this
Agreement, in each case without giving effect to any choice-of-law or
conflict-of-law rules or provisions (whether of the State of Delaware or any
other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the law of any
jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware. Each party to this Agreement
hereby IRREVOCABLY waives all rights to trial by jury in any action, suit or
Proceeding brought to resolve any dispute between or among any of the parties
(whether arising in contract, tort or otherwise) arising out of, connected
with, related or incidental to this Agreement, the transactions contemplated
hereby and/or the relationships established among the parties hereunder. THE
PARTIES HERETO FURTHER WARRANT AND REPRESENT THAT EACH HAS REVIEWED THIS
WAIVER WITH ITS LEGAL COUNSEL, AND THAT EACH KNOWINGLY AND VOLUNTARILY WAIVES
ITS JURY TRIAL RIGHTS FOLLOWING CONSULTATION WITH LEGAL COUNSEL. Each of the
parties hereto submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of first, the Chancery
Court of the State of Delaware or if such court declines jurisdiction, then
to the Federal District Court for the District of Delaware, in any action or
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement, agrees that all
claims in respect of the action or proceeding shall be heard and determined in
any such court and agrees not to bring any proceeding arising out of or
relating to this Agreement in any other courts. Nothing in this _Section
5.4_, however, shall affect the right of any party hereunder to serve legal
process in any other manner permitted by law or at equity. Each party hereto
agrees that a final judgment in any proceeding so brought shall be conclusive
and may be enforced by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided
by law or at equity.

  



  

   

Ex G-18

 



    



  

Section 5.5 _Specific Performance_. Each party hereto recognizes and affirms
that in the event any of the provisions of this Agreement are not performed
in accordance with their specific terms or otherwise are breached, money
damages would be inadequate (and therefore the non-breaching party would have
no adequate remedy at law) and the non-breaching party would be irreparably
damaged. Accordingly, each party hereto agrees that each other party hereof
shall be entitled to specific performance, an injunction or other equitable
relief (without posting of bond or other security or needing to prove
irreparable harm) to prevent breaches of the provisions of this Agreement and
to enforce specifically this Agreement and the terms and provisions hereof in
any proceeding, in addition to any other remedy to which such person may be
entitled.

  



  

Section 5.6 _Severability_. Whenever possible, each provision of this
Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid
under applicable law, but if any provision of this Agreement or the
application of any such provision to any person or circumstance shall be held
to be prohibited by or invalid, illegal or unenforceable under applicable law
in any respect by a court of competent jurisdiction, such provision shall be
ineffective only to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity, illegality
or unenforceability, without invalidating the remainder of such provision or
the remaining provisions of this Agreement. Furthermore, in lieu of such
illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision, there shall be added
automatically as a part of this Agreement a legal, valid and enforceable
provision as similar in terms to such illegal, invalid, or
unenforceable provision as may be possible.

  



  

Section 5.7 _Interpretation_. The headings and captions used in this
Agreement have been inserted for convenience of reference only and do not
modify, define or limit any of the terms or provisions hereof.

  



  

Section 5.8 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement contains the entire agreement
and understanding between the parties hereto with respect to the subject
matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, whether
written or oral, relating to such subject matter in any way.

  



  

Section 5.9 _Amendments and Modifications_. Upon the written consent of the
Company and the Holders of at least a majority in interest of the Registrable
Securities at the time in question, compliance with any of the provisions,
covenants and conditions set forth in this Agreement may be waived, or any of
such provisions, covenants or conditions may be amended or modified;
_provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing, any amendment
hereto or waiver hereof that adversely affects one Holder, solely in its
capacity as a holder of the shares of capital stock of the Company, in a
manner that is materially different from the other Holders (in such capacity)
shall require the consent of the Holder so affected. No course of dealing
between any Holder or the Company and any other party hereto or any failure
or delay on the part of a Holder or the Company in exercising any rights or
remedies under this Agreement shall operate as a waiver of any rights or
remedies of any Holder or the Company. No single or partial exercise of any
rights or remedies under this Agreement by a party shall operate as a waiver
or preclude the exercise of any other rights or remedies hereunder or
thereunder by such party.

  



  

Section 5.10 _Other Registration Rights_. The Company represents and
warrants that no person, other than (a) a Holder of Registrable Securities
and (b) the Founder Holders, has any right to require the Company to register
any securities of the Company for sale or to include such securities of the
Company in any Registration filed by the Company for the sale of
securities for its own account or for the account of any other person.
Further, the Company represents and warrants that this Agreement
supersedes any other registration rights agreement or agreement with similar
terms and conditions among the parties and in the event of a conflict between
any such agreement or agreements and this Agreement, the terms of this
Agreement shall prevail.

  



  

   

Ex G-19

 



    



  

Section 5.11 _Term_. This Agreement shall terminate upon the date as of
which no Holders (or permitted assignees under _Section 5.2_ ) hold any
Registrable Securities. The provisions of _Section 3.5_ and _Article IV_ shall
survive any termination.

  



  

Section 5.12 _Limitation on Subsequent Registration Rights_. From and after
the date of this Agreement, the Company shall not, without the prior written
consent of [BCP], enter into any agreement with any holder or prospective
holder of any securities of the Company giving such holder or prospective
holder any registration rights the terms of which (a) are equivalent to or
more favorable than the registration rights granted to the Holders hereunder,
or (b) would reduce the amount of Registrable Securities the holders can
include in any registration filed pursuant to _Section 2.1_ , _Section 2.2_ ,
_Section 2.3_ or _Section 2.4_ hereof, unless such rights are subordinate to
those of the Holders.

  



  

Section 5.13 _In-Kind Distributions_. If any Holder seeks to effectuate an
in-kind distribution of all or part of its Registrable Securities to its
direct or indirect equityholders, the Company will, subject to applicable
lockups, work with such Holders and the Company's transfer agent to
facilitate such in-kind distribution in the manner reasonably requested by
such Holder.

  



  

Section 5.14 _No Recourse_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement
to the contrary, in no event shall any party hereto or any of its respective
affiliates or its or their representatives (a) seek to enforce this Agreement
or any documents or instruments delivered in connection with this Agreement
against, make any claims for breach of this Agreement against, or seek to
recover monetary damages from, any current or future director, officer,
employee, general or limited partner, member or equityholder of Atlas
Holdings, the Company and each Holder and, in each case, any of their
respective affiliates or representatives in connection with this Agreement
and (b) have any recourse under this Agreement or any documents or instruments
delivered in connection with this Agreement against, any current or future
director, officer, employee, general or limited partner, member or
equityholder of Atlas Holdings, the Company and each Holder and, in each
case, any of their respective affiliates or representatives in
connection with this Agreement, whether by the enforcement of any assessment
or by any legal or equitable proceeding, or by virtue of any statute,
regulation or other applicable law. It is expressly agreed and acknowledged
that no personal liability whatsoever shall attach to, be imposed on or
otherwise be incurred by any current or future officer, agent or employee of
Atlas Holdings, the Company or any Holder or any current or future member of
or any current or future director, officer, employee, partner, member or
equityholder of Atlas Holdings, the Company or any Holder or, in each case,
of any affiliate or assignee thereof, as such for any obligation of any party
hereto under this Agreement or any documents or instruments delivered in
connection with this Agreement for any claim based on, in respect of or by
reason of such obligations or their creation.

  



  

Section 5.15 _Further Assurances_. In connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, upon the written request by the Company,
each Holder shall execute and deliver any additional documents and instruments
and perform any additional acts that may be reasonably necessary to
effectuate and perform the provisions of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby.

WHEREAS, pursuant to that certain Unit Purchase Agreement, dated as of August

 _AGREEMENT_

  



  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants contained herein and
other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which
are hereby acknowledged, the Parties hereby agree as follows:

  



  

Section 1. _Board of Directors_.

  



  

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, from and after the
Effective Time and until a Termination Event (as defined below) shall have
occurred, BCP shall have the right to designate such number of persons to be
appointed or nominated, as the case may be (including any successor, each, a
" _Nominee_ "), for election to the board of directors of the Company (the "
_Board_ ") as provided in _Section 1(c)_ in connection with the annual or
special meeting of stockholders of the Company, as the case may be, in which
members of the Board are to be elected (each, a " _Meeting_ "), by giving
written notice to the Company not later than ten days after receiving notice
of the date of such Meeting provided to BCP;  _provided_ , _however_ _,_ that
the initial Nominees to be nominated for election to the Board by the
Company's stockholders in connection with the Meeting relating to those
matters to be submitted to the Company's stockholders for approval in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the
Purchase Agreement (the " _Business Combination Meeting_ ") shall be
appointed as set forth in _Section 1(b)_.

  



  

(b) The Company shall take all necessary actions within its control such

Ex H-1

 



    



  

(c) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, from and after the
Effective Time and until a Termination Event shall have occurred, the Company
shall, as promptly as practicable, take all necessary and desirable actions
within its control (including, without limitation, calling special meetings
of the Board and the stockholders and recommending, supporting and soliciting
proxies), so that:

  



  

(i) for so long as BCP (together with its Affiliates) Beneficially Owns
shares of Common Stock representing at least 50% of the voting power of all
shares of the Company's capital stock entitled to vote generally in the
election of directors, BCP shall have the right to nominate at least a
majority of all directors of the Board;

  



  

(ii) for so long as BCP (together with its Affiliates) Beneficially Owns
shares of Common Stock representing less than 50% and equal to or greater
than 35% of the voting power of all shares of the Company's capital stock
entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, BCP shall have the
right to nominate a number of Nominees equal to three (less the number of BCP
Directors who are not up for election);

  



  

(iii) for so long as BCP (together with its Affiliates) Beneficially Owns
shares of Common Stock representing less than 35% and equal to or greater
than 15% of the voting power of all shares of the Company's capital stock
entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, BCP shall have the
right to nominate a number of Nominees equal to two (less the number of BCP
Directors who are not up for election);

  



  

(iv) for so long as BCP (together with its Affiliates) Beneficially Owns
shares of Common Stock representing less than 15% and equal to or greater
than five percent of the voting power of all shares of the Company's capital
stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, BCP shall have
the right to nominate a number of Nominees equal to one (less the number of
BCP Directors who are not up for election); and

  



  

(v) the Board shall include the then sitting Chief Executive Officer of the
Company as a Director.

  



  

 _provided_ , _however_ , that, if at any time the number of shares of Common
Stock that BCP (together with its Affiliates) Beneficially Owns is reduced to
a percentage of the voting power of all shares of the Company's capital stock
entitled to vote generally in the election of directors that would entitle
BCP to nominate a lesser number of Nominees than the number of Directors
serving on the Board at such time that were BCP Nominees, BCP shall identify
such excess Director or Directors who are not affiliated with BCP and who
shall be required to immediately offer their resignation from the Board for
consideration by the Board (acting without any of the BCP Nominees then on
the Board).

  



  

   

Ex H-2

 



    



  

(d) During the time that BCP shall have the right to nominate a number of
Nominees that is equal to two or three pursuant to _Section 1(c)(iii)_  or
_(c)(ii)_ , respectively, the Company shall, in connection with the nomination
of such second or third Nominee, as the case may be, set the size of the
Board to seven or eight, respectively; _provided_ , _however_ , that if at any
time BCP no longer Beneficially Owns shares of Common Stock representing
equal to or greater than 35% of the voting power of all shares of the
Company's capital stock entitled to vote generally in the election of
directors as required under _Section 1(c)(ii) _ but does Beneficially Own
shares of Common Stock representing equal to or greater than 15% of the voting
power of all shares of the Company's capital stock entitled to vote generally
in the election of directors as required under _Section 1(c)(iii)_ , the size
of the Board shall be reduced by one director such that the size of the Board
is set at seven members. During the time that BCP shall have the right to
nominate a majority of all the directors of the Board pursuant to _Sections
1(c)(i)_ , the Company shall increase the size of the Board to the minimum
number necessary to permit the nomination of such number of Nominees as will
constitute a majority of the Board; _provided_ , _however_ , that if at any
time BCP no longer Beneficially Owns shares of Common Stock representing at
least 50% of the voting power of all shares of the Company's capital stock
entitled to vote generally in the election of directors as required under
_Sections 1(c)(i)_ , the Company shall set the size of the Board to seven or
eight in accordance with _Sections 1(c)(iii)_ or _(c)(ii)_ , as applicable at
such time. For the avoidance of doubt, no member of the Board that is not a
Nominee of BCP shall be required to resign from the Board to permit the
nomination or election of a Nominee of BCP. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if
the Board does not accept the resignation of a BCP Nominee who is not
affiliated with BCP tendered in accordance with _Section 1(c)_ , the size of
the Board shall not be reduced.

  



  

(e) The Company shall take all actions necessary to ensure that: (i) the
applicable Nominees are included in the Board's slate of nominees to the
stockholders of the Company for each election of Directors and recommended by
the Board at any meeting of stockholders called for the purpose of electing
directors; and (ii) each applicable Nominee up for election is included in the
proxy statement prepared by management of the Company in connection with the
Company's solicitation of proxies or consents in favor of the foregoing for
every meeting of the stockholders of the Company called with respect to the
election of members of the Board, and at every adjournment or postponement
thereof, and on every action or approval by written resolution of the
stockholders of the Company or the Board with respect to the election of
members of the Board.

  



  

(f) If a vacancy occurs because of the death, disability, disqualification,
resignation or removal of a BCP Director or for any other reason, BCP shall
be entitled to designate such person's successor, and the Company shall,
within ten days of such designation, take all necessary actions within its
control such that such vacancy shall be filled with such successor Nominee, it
being understood that any such successor designee shall serve the remainder
of the term of the Director whom such designee replaces.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the director position for such BCP
Director shall not be filled pending such designation and appointment, unless
BCP fails to designate such replacement for more than 15 days, after which the
Company may appoint an interim successor Director (an " _Interim Director_ ")
until BCP makes such designation. With respect to any Interim Director
appointed pursuant to this _Section 1(e)_ , as a condition to such Interim
Director's appointment to the Board, the Company shall cause such Interim
Director to deliver to the Company an irrevocable resignation letter pursuant
to which such Interim Director shall resign from the Board and all applicable
committees thereof effective within 10 days upon the designation of a BCP
Director to replace such Interim Director at any time following the date of
such Interim Director's appointment to the Board.

  



  

   

Ex H-3

 



    



  

(g) If a Nominee is not elected because of such Nominee's death, disability,
disqualification, withdrawal as a nominee or for any other reason, BCP shall
be entitled to designate promptly another Nominee and the Company shall take
all necessary actions within its control such that the director position for
which such Nominee was nominated shall not be filled pending such designation
or the size of the Board shall be increased by one and such vacancy shall be
filled with such successor Nominee within ten days of such designation.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the director position for which such
Nominee was nominated shall not be filled pending such designation and
appointment, unless BCP fails to designate such Nominee for more than 15 days,
after which the Company may appoint an Interim Director who may serve as a
director if duly elected until BCP makes such designation. With respect to
any Interim Director appointed pursuant to this _Section 1(f)_ , as a
condition to such Interim Director's appointment to the Board, the Company
shall cause such Interim Director to deliver to the Company an irrevocable
resignation letter pursuant to which such Interim Director shall resign from
the Board and all applicable committees thereof effective within 10 days upon
the designation of a BCP Director to replace such Interim Director at any time
following the date of such Interim Director's appointment to the Board.

  



  

(h) BCP Directors that are not employees or affiliates of BCP shall be
entitled to compensation consistent with the compensation received by other
non-employee Directors, including any fees and equity awards. In addition, the
Company shall pay the reasonable, documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred
by each BCP Director in connection with his or her services provided to or on
behalf of the Company, including attending meetings (including committee
meetings) or events attended on behalf of the Company at the
Company's request.

  



  

(i) In accordance with the Company's Organizational Documents, the Board may
from time to time by resolution establish and maintain one or more committees
of the Board, each committee to consist of one or more Directors. The Company
shall notify BCP in writing of any new committee of the Board to be
established at least 15 days prior to the effective establishment of such
committee. If requested by BCP, the Company shall take all necessary steps
within its control to cause at least one BCP Director (selected by BCP) to be
appointed as a member of each committee of the Board unless such designation
would violate any legal restriction on such committee's composition or the
rules and regulations of any applicable exchange on which the Company's
securities may be listed (subject in each case to any applicable exceptions).

  



  

(j) The Company shall (i) purchase directors' and officers' liability
insurance in an amount and pursuant to terms determined by the Board to be
reasonable and customary and (ii) for so long as any Director to the Board
nominated pursuant to the terms of this Agreement serves as a Director of the
Company, maintain such coverage with respect to such Directors; _provided_ ,
that upon removal or resignation of such Director for any reason, the Company
shall take all actions reasonably necessary to extend such directors' and
officers' liability insurance coverage for a period of not less than six years
from any such event in respect of any act or omission occurring at or prior
to such event.

  



  

   

Ex H-4

 



    



  

(k) For so long as any BCP Director serves as a Director of the Company, the
Company shall not amend, alter or repeal any right to indemnification or
exculpation covering or benefiting any Director nominated pursuant to this
Agreement as and to the extent consistent with applicable Law, including but
not limited to any such rights to indemnification or exculpation in the
Company's Organizational Documents (except to the extent such amendment or
alteration permits the Company to provide broader indemnification or
exculpation rights, in the aggregate and on an individual basis, on a
retroactive basis, than permitted prior thereto).

  



  

(l) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if BCP has the right to
designate one or more Nominees and either has not exercised such right or
such Nominee has not been elected as a BCP Director (in each case, such that
there are no BCP Directors on the Board), then BCP may elect at such time in
its sole discretion to designate one Board observer (regardless of how many
rights to designate Nominees BCP may have) (the " _Board Observer_ ") to
attend and participate in all meetings of the Board or any committees thereof
in a non-voting capacity by the giving of written notice to the Company of
such election (" _Observation Election_ "). In connection therewith, the
Company shall simultaneously give such Board Observer copies of all notices,
consents, minutes and other materials, financial or otherwise, which the
Company provides to the Board; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the Board
Observer does not, upon the written request of the Company, before attending
any meetings of the Board, execute and deliver to the Company an agreement to
abide by all Company policies applicable to members of the Board and a
confidentiality agreement reasonably acceptable to the Company, the Board
Observer may be excluded from access to any material or meeting or portion
thereof if the Board determines in good faith, upon advice of counsel, that
such exclusion is reasonably necessary to protect highly
confidential proprietary information of the Company or confidential
proprietary information of third parties that the Company is required to hold
in confidence, or for other similar reasons. BCP may revoke any such
Observation Election at any time upon written notice to the Company after
which BCP shall be entitled to designate a replacement Board Observer;
_provided_ , _further_ , that the Board Observer shall not share any such
information if the Company informs the Board Observer that such sharing could
be reasonably expected to compromise or otherwise adversely affect the
Company's and/or its affiliates' ability to assert any attorney-
client privilege or similar rights.

  



  

(m) The Company acknowledges and agrees that the BCP Directors may share any
information concerning the Company and its subsidiaries received by them,
from or on behalf of the Company or its designated representatives, with BCP
and its designated representatives; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that BCP and
its designated representatives shall be required to execute and deliver to the
Company an agreement to abide by all Company policies applicable to members
of the Board and a confidentiality agreement reasonably acceptable to
the Company to protect highly confidential proprietary information of the
Company or confidential proprietary information of third parties that the
Company is required to hold in confidence, or for other similar reasons;
_provided_ , _further_ , that the BCP Directors shall not share any such
information if the Company informs the BCP Directors that such sharing could
be reasonably expected to compromise or otherwise adversely affect the
Company's and/or its affiliates' ability to assert any attorney-
client privilege or similar rights.

  



   

Ex H-5

 



    



  

(n) At least 50% of the Nominees must qualify at all times as "independent"
pursuant to the applicable listing standards of the Approved Stock Exchange
and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

  



  

(o) If the Chief Executive Officer of the Company is serving as a Director
and shall cease to be the Chief Executive Officer of the Company for any
reason, the Company shall take all actions necessary to remove such Director
from the Board as soon as reasonably practicable.

  



  

(p) For the avoidance of doubt, a reduction in the percentage of Common Stock
Beneficially Owned by BCP and its Affiliates that occurs following a vacancy
resulting from a Nominee who is not affiliated with BCP ceasing to serve as a
Director for any reason shall not impact BCP's right to fill such vacancy. In
addition, BCP shall not be obligated to designate all (or any) of the
directors it is entitled to designate pursuant to this Agreement and the
failure to do so shall not constitute a waiver of its rights hereunder.

  



  

Section 2. _Actions Requiring Special Approval_. Without the prior approval
of BCP, from and after the Effective Time and at any time prior to
a Termination Event, the Company shall not take or omit to take, as
applicable, or agree to take or omit to take, as applicable, directly or
indirectly, any action to increase or decrease the size of the Board other
than as provided in Section 1 hereof or to make a change to the classes on
which the Directors serve.

  



  

Section 3. _Restrictions on Transfer of Common Stock_. Other than in
connection with the Purchase Agreement and the transactions contemplated
