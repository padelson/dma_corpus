shall have forty-five (45) days after Seller&rsquo;s receipt of the Closing Statement (the &ldquo;<U>Review Period</U>&rdquo;)
within which to review Parent&rsquo;s calculation of the Closing Items. If Seller disputes any of the Closing Items, Seller shall
notify Parent in writing of its objection to such Closing Item(s) within the Review Period, together with a description of the
basis for and dollar amount of such disputed items (to the extent possible) (and attaching reasonable supporting details to enable
a review thereof by Parent) (a &ldquo;<U>Dispute Notice</U>&rdquo;). The Closing Items, as set forth in the Closing Statement,
shall become final, conclusive and binding on the Parties unless Seller delivers to Parent a Dispute Notice within the Review
Period. If Seller timely delivers a Dispute Notice, any amounts on the Closing Statement not objected to by Seller in the Dispute
Notice (or by Parent as a result of the items disputed by Seller in any such Dispute Notice) shall be final, conclusive and binding
on the Parties, and Parent and Seller shall, within thirty (30) days following Parent&rsquo;s receipt of such Dispute Notice (the&nbsp;&ldquo;<U>Resolution
Period</U>&rdquo;), use reasonable best efforts to attempt to resolve in writing their differences with respect to the matters
set forth in the Dispute Notice (and any matters with respect to the Closing Items which Parent is disputing as a result of the
matters set forth in the Dispute Notice, or any disputed matters arising out of the foregoing), and any such resolution shall
be final, conclusive and binding on the Parties. If, at the conclusion of the Resolution Period, any amounts remain in dispute,
then each of Parent and Seller shall promptly, and in any event, within ten (10) days, execute any reasonable engagement letter
requested by the Valuation Firm and submit all items remaining in dispute to a nationally recognized accounting firm mutually
acceptable to Parent and Seller (the &ldquo;<U>Valuation Firm</U>&rdquo;) for resolution, acting as an accounting expert (and
not as an arbitrator) and in accordance with the standards set forth in this <U>Section&nbsp;2.4</U>, by delivering, within ten
(10) days after engagement of the Valuation Firm, their written position with respect to such items remaining in dispute. Parent
and Seller shall each cooperate fully with the Valuation Firm, including by using reasonable best efforts to provide the information,
data and work papers used by each Party and its representatives (including accountants) to prepare and/or calculate the Closing
Items, making its personnel and accountants available to explain any such information, data or work papers, so as to enable the
Valuation Firm to make such determination as quickly and as accurately as practicable; <U>provided</U>, that (i) each Party shall
substantially simultaneously provide the other party with a copy of all materials provided to, and communications with, the Valuation
Firm and (ii) no Party (or any of its Affiliates, advisors or representatives) shall engage in any <I>ex parte</I> communications
with the Valuation Firm as to any Closing Items then in dispute. The Valuation Firm shall determine, based solely on the submissions
by or written communications with Seller and Parent, and not by independent review, only those issues set forth in the Dispute
Notice (and those raised by Parent in response thereto) that remain in dispute and shall determine a value for any such disputed
item which is equal to or between the final values proposed by Parent and Seller in their respective submissions. The Parties
shall request that the Valuation Firm make a decision with respect to all disputed Closing Items within thirty (30) days after
the submissions of the Parties, as provided above, and in any event as promptly as practicable. The final determination with respect
to all disputed Closing Items shall be set forth in a written statement by the Valuation Firm delivered to Seller and Parent and
shall be final, conclusive and binding on the Parties except for manifest error. Judgment may be entered upon the determination
of the Valuation Firm in any court having jurisdiction over the Party against which such determination is to be enforced. The
fees and expenses of the Valuation Firm incurred pursuant to this <U>Section&nbsp;2.4(b)</U> shall be borne by Seller, on the
one hand, and Parent, on the other hand, in inverse proportion to the Final Allocation made by such Valuation Firm of any disputed
Closing Items, such that the prevailing Party pays the lesser proportion of such fees, costs and expenses. For example, if Seller
claims that the appropriate adjustments are one thousand dollars ($1,000) greater than the amount determined by Parent and if
the Valuation Firm ultimately resolves the dispute by awarding to Seller seven hundred dollars ($700) of the one thousand dollars
($1,000) disputed, then the fees, costs and expenses of the Valuation Firm will be allocated seventy percent (70%) (i.e., 700
&divide; 1,000) to Parent and thirty percent (30%) (i.e., 300 &divide; 1,000) to Seller.</FONT></P>

commitment letter dated August 12, 2019 (as amended, modified, supplemented, replaced or extended from time to time after the
date of this Agreement in compliance with </FONT><U>Section&nbsp;6.17</U>, the &ldquo;<FONT STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif"><U>Debt
Commitment Letter</U></FONT>&rdquo;) from the Debt Financing Sources party thereto (including any Debt Financing Sources who become
party thereto by joinder in accordance with the terms thereof) pursuant to which the Debt Financing Sources have agreed, subject
solely to the terms and conditions thereof and expressly stated therein, to provide (a) the debt amounts set forth therein which
is the full amount of the debt financing required to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (such debt financing,
together with any permitted Alternative Financing, the &ldquo;<FONT STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif"><U>Committed
Financing</U></FONT>&rdquo;) and which may be reduced pursuant to <U>Section&nbsp;6.1(d)(iii)</U>. Parent has delivered to Seller
true, complete and correct copies of the executed Commitment Letter and any fee letters referred to in, or contemplated by, the
Debt Commitment Letter (with only fee amounts, pricing caps and other economic <FONT STYLE="text-decoration: none">&ldquo;<FONT STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif">market
flex</FONT>&rdquo;</FONT> terms redacted, so long as such redaction does not cover terms that could affect the conditionality,
amount, timing, availability or termination of the Committed Financing) (each as amended, modified, supplemented, replaced or
extended from time to time after the date of this Agreement in compliance with <U>Section&nbsp;6.17</U>, the &ldquo;<FONT STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman, Times, Serif"><U>Fee
Letter</U></FONT>&rdquo;). Except as set forth in the applicable Commitment Letter, there are no conditions precedent to the obligations
of the Debt Financing Sources to provide the Committed Financing or any contingencies that would permit the Debt Financing Sources
to reduce the total amount of the Committed Financing. There are no other agreements, side letters or arrangements relating to
the Committed Financing to which Parent or any of its Affiliates is a party that could impose conditions to the funding of the
Committed Financing, other than those set forth in Debt Commitment Letters (or in the unredacted portions of the Fee Letter).
As of the date of this Agreement, Parent does not have any reason to believe that it will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis
all conditions to be satisfied by it in the Debt Commitment Letter or the Fee Letter at the time it is required to consummate
the Closing hereunder. Except for any amendments (in compliance with <U>Section&nbsp;6.17</U>) delivered to Seller on or prior
to the date of this Agreement, neither of the Debt Commitment Letter nor the Fee Letter have been modified, altered or amended
on or prior to the date of this Agreement, nor, to the Knowledge of Buyer, is any such amendment, modification, withdrawal, termination
or rescission currently contemplated or the subject of current discussions. None of the commitments under the Debt Commitment
Letter entered into on or prior to the date hereof have been withdrawn, terminated or rescinded prior to the date of this Agreement.
Subject to its terms and conditions, the Committed Financing, when funded in accordance with the Debt Commitment Letter, will
provide Buyer with acquisition financing proceeds on the Closing Date sufficient, together with available cash of the Buyer Group
from sources other than the Committed Financing, to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including making
all necessary payments of fees and expenses in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and both before and after
giving effect to any &ldquo;flex&rdquo; provisions contained in the Fee Letter). As of the date of this Agreement, the Debt Commitment
Letter is (as to the Buyer Group and to the Knowledge of Buyer, the other parties thereto) valid, binding and in full force and
effect and no event has occurred that, with or without notice, lapse of time, or both, which would reasonably be expected to constitute
a default or breach or a failure to satisfy a condition precedent on the part of Parent under the terms and conditions of the
Debt Commitment Letter, other than any such default, breach or failure that has been irrevocably waived by the Debt Financing
Sources, as applicable, or otherwise cured in a timely manner by Parent to the satisfaction of the Debt Financing Sources. As
of the date of this Agreement, the Buyer Group has paid in full any and all commitment fees or other fees required to be paid
pursuant to the terms of the Commitment Letters entered into as of the date hereof or Fee Letter on or before the date of this
Agreement, and will pay in full any such amounts due on or before the Closing Date.</P>

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (i) no Atlas Company nor Seller makes any representation or warranty regarding
any third party beneficiary rights or other rights which Parent might claim under any studies, reports, tests or analyses prepared

entitled to specific performance, an injunction or other equitable relief (without posting of bond or other security or needing

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">Section 1. <U>Number,
Election, and Terms of Directors</U>. Subject to the rights, if any, of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock to elect additional
directors under circumstances specified in any Preferred Stock Designation and to the terms of the Shareholders&rsquo; Agreement,
the number of directors will be fixed from time to time in the manner provided in the Bylaws of the Corporation. Subject to Section
6 of this Article VII, the directors, other than those who may be elected by the holders of any series of Preferred Stock, will
be classified with respect to the time for which they severally hold office into three classes, as nearly equal in number as possible,
designated Class&nbsp;I, Class II, and Class III. At any meeting of stockholders at which directors are to be elected, the number
of directors elected may not exceed the greatest number of directors then in office in any class of directors. The directors first
appointed to Class&nbsp;I will hold office for a term expiring at the first annual meeting of stockholders following the consummation
of the Initial Business Combination; the directors first appointed to Class II will hold office for a term expiring at the second
annual meeting of stockholders following the consummation of the Initial Business Combination; and the directors first appointed
to Class III will hold office for a term expiring at the third annual meeting of stockholders following the consummation of the
Initial Business Combination, with the members of each class to hold office until their successors are elected and qualified. At
each succeeding annual meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation, the successors to the class of directors whose term expires
at that meeting will be elected by plurality vote of all votes cast at such meeting to hold office for a term expiring at the annual
meeting of stockholders held in the third year following the year of their election and until their successors are elected and
qualified. Subject to the rights, if any, of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock to elect additional directors under circumstances
specified in any Preferred Stock Designation, directors may be elected by the stockholders only at an annual meeting of stockholders.
Election of directors of the Corporation need not be by written ballot unless requested by the presiding officer or by the holders
of a majority of the Voting Stock present in person or represented by proxy at a meeting of the stockholders at which directors
are to be elected. If authorized by the Board, such requirement of a written ballot shall be satisfied by a ballot submitted by
electronic transmission, provided that any such electronic transmission must either set forth or be submitted with information
from which it can be determined that the electronic transmission was authorized by the stockholder or proxy holder.</P>

Designation and Section 6 of this Article VII, newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the number of directors
and any vacancies on the Board resulting from death, resignation, disqualification, removal, or other cause will be filled solely
by the affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining directors then in office, even though less than a quorum of the Board, or
by a sole remaining director. Any director elected in accordance with the preceding sentence will hold office for the remainder
of the full term of the class of directors in which the new directorship was created or the vacancy occurred and until such director&rsquo;s
successor has been elected and qualified, subject, however, to such director&rsquo;s earlier death, resignation, retirement, disqualification
or removal. If the number of directors is changed, any increase or decrease shall be apportioned by the Board among the classes
so as to maintain the number of directors in each class as nearly equal as possible; <I>provided, however</I>, that no decrease

Stock to elect additional directors under circumstances specified in any Preferred Stock Designation and Section 6 of this Article
VII, any director may be removed from office by the stockholders only for cause and only in the manner provided in this Article
VII, Section&nbsp;4. At any annual meeting or special meeting of the stockholders, the notice of which states that the removal
of a director or directors is among the purposes of the meeting and identifies the director or directors proposed to be removed,
the affirmative vote of the holders of at least majority of the voting power of the outstanding Voting Stock, voting together as
a single class, may remove such director or directors for cause. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a stockholder
party to the Shareholders&rsquo; Agreement provides notice to the Corporation to remove a director designated by such stockholder
pursuant to the terms of the Shareholders&rsquo; Agreement, whether such removal is with or without cause, the Corporation may
take all necessary action to cause such removal, to the extent permitted by applicable law, and such director or director may be
removed with or without cause.</P>

shall be governed by the terms of such series of the Preferred Stock as set forth in this Second Amended and Restated Certificate,

Article VII unless expressly provided by such terms. Except as otherwise provided in a Preferred Stock Designation, whenever the
holders of any series of Preferred Stock having such right to elect additional directors are divested of such right pursuant to
the provisions of such stock, the terms of office of all such additional directors elected by the holders of such stock, or elected
to fill any vacancies resulting from the death, resignation, disqualification or removal of such additional directors, shall forthwith
terminate (in which case each such director thereupon shall cease to be qualified as, and shall cease to be, a director) and the
total authorized number of directors of the Corporation shall automatically be reduced accordingly.</P>

before the meeting date, the list shall reflect the stockholders entitled to vote as of the tenth day before the meeting date,
arranged in alphabetical order and showing the address and the number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder. Nothing
contained in this <U>Section 2.5(a) </U>shall require the Corporation to include electronic mail addresses or other electronic
contact information on such list. Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the
meeting, during ordinary business hours for a period of at least 10 days prior to the meeting: (i) on a reasonably accessible electronic
network, provided that the information required to gain access to such list is provided with the notice of the meeting, or (ii)
during ordinary business hours, at the principal place of business of the Corporation. In the event that the Corporation determines
to make the list available on an electronic network, the Corporation may take reasonable steps to ensure that such information
is available only to stockholders of the Corporation. If the meeting is to be held at a place, then the list shall be produced
and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof, and may be examined by any stockholder who is present.
If a meeting of stockholders is to be held solely by means of remote communication as permitted by <U>Section 9.5(a)</U>, the list

To the extent permitted by applicable Law and hereunder, and except as otherwise provided in <U>Section 11.3</U>, distributions
to Members may be declared by the Managing Member out of funds legally available therefor in such amounts and on such terms (including
the payment dates of such distributions) as the Managing Member shall determine (in its sole discretion in accordance with the
fiduciary duties set forth in <U>Section 7.1(b)</U>) using such record date as the Managing Member may designate. Any such
distribution shall be made to the Members as of the close of business on such record date on a <I>pro rata</I> basis (except that,
for the avoidance of doubt, repurchases or redemptions made in accordance with <U>Section 4.1(f)</U> or payments made in
accordance with <U>Sections 7.4</U> or <U>7.9</U> need not be on a <I>pro rata</I> basis), in accordance with the
number of Units owned by each Member as of the close of business on such record date; <U>provided</U><I>, </I><U>however</U>, that
the Managing Member shall have the obligation to make distributions as set forth in <U>Sections 6.2</U> and <U>11.3(b)(iii)</U>;

distributions shall be made to any Member to the extent such distribution would render the Company insolvent or violate the Act.
For purposes of the foregoing sentence, insolvency means the inability of the Company to meet its payment obligations when due.
Promptly following the designation of a record date and the declaration of a distribution pursuant to this <U>Section 6.1</U>,
the Managing Member shall give notice to each Member of the record date, the amount and the terms of the distribution and the payment
date thereof.</P>

cash and property in kind, each Member shall be distributed its proportionate share of any such cash so distributed and its proportionate
share of any such property so distributed in kind (based on the Fair Market Value of such property). To the extent that the Company
distributes property in-kind to the Members, the Company shall be treated as making a distribution equal to the Fair Market Value
of such property for purposes of <U>Section 6.1(a)</U> and such property shall be treated as if it were sold for an amount
equal to its Fair Market Value. Any resulting gain or loss shall be allocated to the Member&rsquo;s Capital Accounts in accordance
with <U>Section 5.1</U> and <U>Section 5.2</U>.</P>

BCP also acknowledges that prior to the Transaction, BCP may have been provided access to the Company&rsquo;s Proprietary Information.
Therefore, BCP agrees that it is fair and reasonable for the Company to enter into this Agreement with BCP to protect itself from

oral, visual, or written form, whether or not it is marked as being confidential. Proprietary Information need not be a trade
secret or know-how to be protected under this Agreement. By way of illustration, but not limitation, Proprietary Information may
include any confidential information of the Company as of the Closing about the business, methods, business plans, operations,
products, processes, and services of the Company or any Customer thereof. Proprietary Information may also include, without limitation,
confidentially held information of the Company as of the Closing pertaining to: (i) the identities of the Company&rsquo;s actual
Customers, as well as the names, addresses, phone numbers and e-mail addresses of contact persons and/or decision-makers employed

be supplemented and amended to the extent necessary to ensure that such Registration Statement is available or, if not available,
that another registration statement is available, for the resale of all the Registrable Securities held by the Holders until all
such Registrable Securities have ceased to be Registrable Securities. If at any time a Registration Statement filed pursuant to

Company shall notify the Holders of the effectiveness of such Registration Statement. When effective, a Registration Statement
filed pursuant to this <U>Section 2.1</U> (including any documents incorporated therein by reference) will comply as to form in
all material respects with all applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and will not contain an untrue
