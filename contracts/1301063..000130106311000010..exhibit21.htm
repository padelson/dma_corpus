AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "Agreement") dated as of January 28, 2011,
among MOUNTAIN MERGER SUB, INC., a Delaware corporation ("MergerCo"), ALPHA
NATURAL RESOURCES, INC., a Delaware corporation ("Parent" and, together with
MergerCo, the "Buyer Entities"), and MASSEY ENERGY COMPANY, a Delaware
corporation (the "Company").

  

  

WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of each of Parent, MergerCo and
the Company have approved this Agreement and determined that the terms of this
Agreement, including the Merger of MergerCo with and into the Company (the
"Merger") upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, are
in the best interests of Parent, MergerCo or the Company, as the case may be,
and their respective stockholders.

  

  

WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of each of MergerCo and the
Company have declared the advisability of this Agreement, recommended adoption
of this Agreement by their respective stockholders and directed that this
Agreement be submitted to their respective stockholders for adoption.

  

  

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of Parent has resolved to recommend approval
by the stockholders of Parent of the amendment of Parent's certificate of
incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of common stock, par
value $0.01 of Parent ("Parent Common Stock") and the issuance of shares of
Parent Common Stock in connection with the Merger, upon the terms and subject
to the conditions set forth herein.

  

  

WHEREAS, for U.S. Federal income tax purposes, the Merger is intended to
qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code
(the "Intended Tax Treatment"), and this Agreement is intended to be, and is
adopted as, a "plan of reorganization" for purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of
the Code.

  

  

WHEREAS, the Company, Parent and MergerCo desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the
Merger and also to prescribe various conditions to the Merger.

  

  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations, warranties, covenants
and agreements contained in this Agreement, and subject to the conditions set
forth herein, the parties hereto agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

  

  

The Merger

  

  

SECTION 1.01. The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the General Corporation Law of
the State of Delaware (the "DGCL"), MergerCo shall be merged with and into the
Company at the Effective Time. Following the Effective Time, the separate
corporate existence of MergerCo shall cease, and the Company shall continue as
the surviving corporation in the Merger (the "Surviving Corporation").

  

  

SECTION 1.02. Closing.

  

  

(a) The closing of the Merger (the "Closing") will take place at the offices
of Cleary Gottlieb Steen and Hamilton LLP, One Liberty Plaza, New York, New York
10006 (i) at 10:00 a.m., New York time, on the later of (A) the second
business day after satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by Law) waiver of
the conditions set forth in Article VI (other than those conditions that by
their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by Law) waiver of those conditions)
and (B) the earlier of (1) a date during the Marketing Period to be specified
by the Parent on no fewer than two business days' notice to the Company and
(2) the final day of the Marketing Period; provided, however, that if the
Closing would otherwise occur on or after the 20th day of a particular month,
then Parent may postpone the Closing until the last business day of such month
so long as the last business day of such month is no later than the Outside
Date, or (ii) such other time or date as agreed to in writing by the Company
and the Buyer Entities. The date on which the Closing occurs is referred to in
this Agreement as the "Closing Date".

  

  

(b) The term "Marketing Period" means the first period of 20 consecutive
business days after the date hereof throughout which: (i) the Buyer Entities
shall have the Required Financial Information that the Company is required to
provide to the Parent pursuant to Section 5.09(b) in connection with any
portion of the Financing to be consummated on the Closing Date; provided, that
if the Company shall in good faith reasonably believe it has delivered the
Required Financial Information, it may deliver to the Parent a written notice
to that effect (stating when it believes it completed such delivery), in which
case the Marketing Period shall be deemed to have commenced on the date of
such notice unless the Parent in good faith reasonably believes the Company
has not completed delivery of the Required Financial Information or cannot
obtain from the financing sources confirmation that the Required Financial
Information has been provided and, within four business days after the
delivery of such notice by the Company, delivers a written notice to the
Company to that effect (stating to the extent reasonably possible which
Required Financial Information the Company has not delivered) and (ii) the
conditions set forth in Section 6.01

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

3

  

  

and Section 6.02 shall be satisfied (other than those conditions that by their
nature can only be satisfied at the Closing) and nothing has occurred and no
condition exists that would cause any of the conditions set forth in Section
6.01 and Section 6.02 to fail to be satisfied assuming the Closing were to be
scheduled for any time during such 20-consecutive-business-day period;
provided that if the Marketing Period has not been completed (i) prior to
August 22, 2011, the Marketing Period shall commence no earlier than September
7, 2011 and (ii) prior to December 19, 2011, the Marketing Period shall
commence no earlier than January 3, 2012; provided, further, that November
24-25, 2011 shall not be considered business days for purposes of the
definition of "Marketing Period" but a period including such days shall be
considered a consecutive period for purposes of the definition of "Marketing
Period"; provided, further, that the Marketing Period shall not be deemed to
have commenced if, prior to the completion of such 20-consecutive-business-day
period, (A) the Company's auditor shall have withdrawn its audit opinion with
respect to any year end audited financial statements set forth in the Company
SEC Documents, (B) the financial statements included in the Required Financial
Information that is available to the Buyer Entities on the first day of any
such 20-consecutive-business-day period would be required to be updated under
Rule 3-12 of Regulation S-X in order to be sufficiently current on any day
during such 20-consecutive-business-day period to permit a registration
statement using such financial statements to be declared effective by the SEC
on the last day of such 20-consecutive-business-day period, in which case the
Marketing Period shall not be deemed to commence until the receipt by Parent
of updated Required Financial Information that would be required under Rule
3-12 of Regulation S-X to permit a registration statement using such financial
statements to be declared effective by the SEC on the last day of such new
20-consecutive-business-day period, (C) the Company shall have publicly
announced any intention to restate any material financial information included
in the Required Financial Information or that any such restatement is under
consideration, in which case the Marketing Period shall be deemed not to
commence unless and until such restatement has been completed and the Company
SEC Documents have been amended or the Company has determined that no
restatement shall be required or (D) the Company shall have been delinquent in
filing any annual, quarterly or periodic report with the SEC that would have
been required to be filed by it with the SEC, in which case the Marketing
Period will not be deemed to commence until all such delinquencies have been
cured; and provided, further, that the Marketing Period shall end on any
earlier date on which the entire Financing is consummated.

  

  

SECTION 1.03. Effective Time. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, as
promptly as practicable on the Closing Date, the parties shall file a
certificate of merger (the "Certificate of Merger") in such form as is
required by, and executed and acknowledged in accordance with, the relevant
provisions of the DGCL and

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

4

  

  

shall make all other filings and recordings required under the DGCL. The
Merger shall become effective at such date and time as the Certificate of
Merger is filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at
such subsequent date and time as the Company and MergerCo shall agree and
specify in the Certificate of Merger. The date and time at which the Merger
becomes effective is referred to in this Agreement as the "Effective Time".

  

  

SECTION 1.04. Effects of the Merger. The Merger shall have the effects set
forth in Section 259 of the DGCL.

  

  

SECTION 1.05. Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws. (a) The Amended and
Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company, as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time (the "Company Certificate of Incorporation"),
shall be amended at the Effective Time to be in the form of Exhibit A and, as
so amended, shall be the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by
applicable Law.

  

  

(b) The Amended and Restated Bylaws of the Company, as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time (the "Company Bylaws"), shall be amended at the
Effective Time to be in the form of the bylaws of MergerCo as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time and, as so amended, shall be the
Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as
provided therein or by applicable Law.

  

  

SECTION 1.06. Directors. The directors of MergerCo immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation until the
earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective successors
are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be.

  

  

SECTION 1.07. Officers. The officers of MergerCo immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation, until the
earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective successors
are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be.

  

  

  

ARTICLE II

  

  

Effect of the Merger on the Capital Stock of the

  

Constituent Corporations; Exchange of Certificates

  

  

SECTION 2.01. Effect on Capital Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, MergerCo, the Company or
the holder of any shares of common stock, par value $0.625 per share, of the
Company ("Company Common Stock") or any shares of capital stock or other
equity interests of Parent or MergerCo:

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

5

  

  

(a) Capital Stock of MergerCo. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01, of
MergerCo (the "MergerCo Common Stock") issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01
per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

  

  

(b) Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Certain Other Stock. Each share of
Company Common Stock that is directly owned by the Company, including as
treasury stock, or by Parent, MergerCo or any Subsidiaries of Parent
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be canceled and
shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange
therefor.

  

  

(c) Conversion of Company Common Stock. Subject to Sections 2.01(d) and
2.02(f), each share of Company Common Stock (including Company Restricted
Stock) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other
than shares to be canceled in accordance with Section 2.01(b) and as provided
in Section 2.01(e) with respect to the Appraisal Shares) shall be converted
into the right to receive (i) that number of fully paid and nonassessable
shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio (the "Stock Merger
Consideration") and (ii) $10.00 in cash, without interest (the "Cash Merger
Consideration" and together with the Stock Merger Consideration, the "Merger
Consideration"). All such shares of Company Common Stock, when so converted,
shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall
cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate (or evidence of shares in
book-entry form) that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any
such shares of Company Common Stock (each, a "Certificate") shall cease to
have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock
to be issued or paid in consideration therefor pursuant to Section 2.02(f) and
any dividends or other distributions to which holders become entitled upon the
surrender of such Certificate in accordance with Section 2.02(d), without
interest. For purposes of this Agreement, the "Exchange Ratio" means 1.025.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time (and solely as, and to the extent, permitted by Article IV) the
outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock shall have
been changed into a different number of shares or a different class of shares,
by reason of any stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification,
recapitalization, split, reverse split, combination or exchange of shares, or
any similar event shall have occurred, then the Exchange Ratio, the Cash
Merger Consideration and the consideration payable pursuant to Section 2.03
will be appropriately adjusted to provide to Parent and the holders of Company
Common Stock (including Company Restricted Stock), Company Stock Options,
Company Restricted Unit Awards, Company Performance Unit Awards and Director
Fee Units, the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement. As
provided in Section 2.02(k), the right of any holder of a Certificate to
receive the Merger Consideration shall be subject to and reduced by the amount
of any withholding under applicable Tax Law.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

6

  

  

(d) Restructuring. If a change in the direction of the Merger is necessary to
enable counsel to provide the opinions referred to in Sections 6.02(c) and
6.03(c), then the Company shall be merged with and into MergerCo, with
MergerCo continuing as the Surviving Corporation and, if Parent so determines,
MergerCo shall be converted into a limited liability company prior to the
Effective Time; provided, that neither the Buyer Entities nor the Company
shall be deemed to have breached any of its representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement by reason of the taking of
the measures described in this Section 2.01(d).

  

  

(e) Appraisal Rights. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, shares (the "Appraisal Shares") of Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that are held by any
holder who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such shares
pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, the provisions of Section
262 of the DGCL ("Section 262") shall not be converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration as provided in this Section 2.01, but instead
such holder shall be entitled to payment of the fair value of such shares in
accordance with the provisions of Section 262. At the Effective Time, the
Appraisal Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of Appraisal Shares shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the
fair value of such shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any such holder shall fail to perfect or
otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under Section
262 or a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is
not entitled to the relief provided by Section 262, then the right of such
holder to be paid the fair value of such holder's Appraisal Shares under
Section 262 shall cease and such Appraisal Shares shall be deemed to have been
converted at the Effective Time into, and shall have become, the right to
receive the Merger Consideration as provided in this Section 2.01. The Company
shall give prompt notice to the Buyer Entities of any demands for appraisal of
any shares of Company Common Stock, withdrawals of such demands and any other
instruments served pursuant to the DGCL received by the Company, and Parent
shall have the right to participate in and direct all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), voluntarily make
any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands,
or agree to do or commit to do any of the foregoing.

  

  

SECTION 2.02. Exchange of Certificates. (a) Exchange Agent. Prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall appoint Computershare or another bank or trust
company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as exchange agent (the
"Exchange Agent") for the payment of the Merger Consideration in accordance
with this Article II and, in connection therewith, shall enter into an
agreement with the Exchange Agent in a form reasonably acceptable to the
Company. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the
Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the holders of Certificates, for exchange
in accordance with this Article II through the Exchange Agent, certificates

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

7

  

  

representing the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued as Stock Merger
Consideration, cash sufficient to pay the aggregate Cash Merger Consideration
and shares of Parent Common Stock and to make payments in lieu of fractional
shares pursuant to Section 2.02(f). All such Parent Common Stock and cash
deposited with the Exchange Agent is hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange
Fund".

  

  

(b) Exchange Procedures. As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time,
but in any event within two business days thereafter, the Surviving
Corporation shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of
Company Common Stock a form of letter of transmittal (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and
shall be in such form (including customary provisions with respect to
delivering of an "agent's message" with respect to shares held in book-entry
form) and have such other provisions as Parent may specify, subject to the
Company's approval), together with instructions for use in effecting the
delivery of Certificates in exchange for Merger Consideration

  

  

(c) Merger Consideration Received in Connection with Exchange. Upon the later
of the Effective Time and the surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to
the Exchange Agent, together with the letter of transmittal, duly executed in
accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may
reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (i) the Merger Consideration
into which the shares of Company Common Stock theretofore represented by such
Certificate have been converted pursuant to Section 2.01 and (ii) any cash in
lieu of fractional shares that the holder has the right to receive pursuant to
Section 2.02(f) and in respect of any dividends or other distributions that
the holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.02(d). In the event
of a transfer of ownership of any share of Company Common Stock that is not
registered in the transfer records of the Company, a certificate representing
the Stock Merger Consideration with respect to such share pursuant to Section
2.01, the Cash Merger Consideration with respect to such share pursuant to
Section 2.01, any cash in lieu of fractional shares which the holder of such
share has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.02(f) and any dividends
and distributions which the holder of such share has the right to receive
pursuant to Section 2.02(d) may be issued or paid to a transferee if the
Certificate representing such Company Common Stock is presented to the
Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect
such transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock transfer Taxes have
been paid.

  

  

(d) Treatment of Unexchanged Shares. No dividends or other distributions
declared or made with respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date after
the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
Certificate with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon
surrender thereof, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares shall be
paid to any such holder pursuant to Section 2.02(f), until the surrender of
such Certificate in accordance with this Article II. Subject to escheat, Tax
or other applicable Law, following

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

8

  

  

surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be paid to the holder of such
Certificate, without interest, (i) at the time of such surrender, the amount
of any cash payable in lieu of a fractional share of Parent Common Stock that
such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.02(f) and the
amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such number of whole shares of
Parent Common Stock that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to
Section 2.01 and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends
or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior
to such surrender and a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with
respect to such number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock that such holder
has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.01.

  

  

(e) No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock. The shares of Parent
Common Stock issued and cash paid upon the surrender of Certificates in
accordance with the terms of this Article II shall be deemed to have been
issued and paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of
Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificates, subject,
however, to the Surviving Corporation's obligation to pay all dividends that
may have been declared by the Company (solely as permitted by Article IV) and
that remain unpaid at the Effective Time. At the close of business on the day
on which the Effective Time occurs, the stock transfer books of the Company
shall be closed, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on
the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company
Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.
If, after the close of business on the day on which the Effective Time occurs,
any Certificate is presented to the Surviving Corporation for transfer, it
shall be canceled against delivery to the holder thereof of Parent Common
Stock and cash as provided in this Article II.

  

  

(f) Fractional Shares. No certificates or scrip representing fractional shares
of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the conversion of Company Common
Stock pursuant to Section 2.01, and such fractional share interests shall not
entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights of a holder of Parent
Common Stock. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each
holder of shares of Company Common Stock converted pursuant to the Merger who
would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent
Common Stock (after taking into account all Certificates delivered by such
holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without interest) in an amount
equal to such fractional amount multiplied by the average of the volume
weighted average price per share of Parent Common Stock (the "Parent Closing
Price") on the New York Stock Exchange (as reported by The Wall Street Journal
or, if not reported therein, in another authoritative source mutually selected
by Parent and the Company) on each of the 5 consecutive trading days ending
prior to the date of the Effective Time, weighted by the total volume of
trading in Parent Common Stock on each such trading day, calculated to the

(g) Termination of the Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates for 12 months after
the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation, upon
demand, and any holders of the Certificates who have not theretofore complied
with this Article II shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation
for, and the Surviving Corporation shall remain liable for, payment of their
claims for the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares and
any dividends and distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to
the provisions of this Article II.

  

  

(h) No Liability. None of the Company, the Surviving Corporation, Parent,
MergerCo or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of any
cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official in compliance with
any applicable state, Federal or other abandoned property, escheat or similar
Law. If any Certificate shall not have been surrendered prior to the date on
which the related Merger Consideration would escheat to or become the property
of any Governmental Entity, any such Merger Consideration shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, immediately prior to such time become the
property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or
interest of any person previously entitled thereto.

  

  

(i) Investment of Exchange Fund. The Exchange Agent shall invest the cash in
the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent; provided, however, that such
investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of
America or any agency or instrumentality thereof and backed by the full faith
and credit of the United States of America, in commercial paper obligations
rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and
Poor's Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank
repurchase agreements or banker's acceptances of commercial banks with capital
exceeding $1.0 billion (based on the most recent financial statements of such
bank that are then publicly available). Any interest and other income
resulting from such investments shall be paid solely to Parent. Nothing
contained herein and no investment losses resulting from investment of the
Exchange Fund shall diminish the rights of any holder of Certificates to
receive (i) the applicable Merger Consideration and (ii) any cash in lieu of
fractional shares that the holder has a right to receive pursuant to Section
2.02(f) or in respect of any dividends or distributions that the holder has a
right to receive pursuant to Section 2.02(d).

  

  

(j) Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the
Surviving Corporation, the posting by such person of a bond or surety in such
reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct as indemnity against
any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the
Exchange Agent shall deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate (i) the applicable Merger Consideration and (ii) any cash in lieu
of fractional shares that the holder has a right to receive pursuant to
Section 2.02(f) or in respect of any dividends or distributions that the
holder has a right to receive pursuant to Section 2.02(d).

(k) Withholding Rights. The Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent
(without duplication) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of
shares of Company Common Stock such amounts as the Surviving Corporation or
the Exchange Agent are required to deduct and withhold with respect to the
making of such payment under any Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so
withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority by the Surviving
Corporation or the Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares
of Company Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made by the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent.

  

  

(l) Uncertificated Shares. In the case of any outstanding shares of Company
Common Stock that are not represented by Certificates, the parties shall make
such adjustments to this Section 2.02 as are necessary or appropriate to
implement the same purpose and effect that this Section 2.02 has with respect
to shares of Company Common Stock that are represented by Certificates.

  

  

SECTION 2.03. Company Incentive Awards. (a) Except as provided in Section
2.03(b):

  

  

(i) each Company Stock Option that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall become vested (to the extent then unvested) and
nonforfeitable, and shall be converted at the Effective Time into an option
(such option, an "Adjusted Option") to acquire, on substantially the same
terms and conditions as were applicable under such Company Stock Option, the
number of shares of Parent Common Stock (rounded down to the nearest whole
share), determined by multiplying the number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time
by the Rollover Exchange Ratio, at an exercise price per share of Parent
Common Stock (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to (A) the exercise
price per share of Company Common Stock otherwise purchasable pursuant to such
Company Stock Option divided by (B) the Rollover Exchange Ratio;

  

  

(ii) each share of Company Restricted Stock that is outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall become vested and nonforfeitable, and shall
be treated in the same manner as a share of Company Common Stock under Section
2.01;

  

  

(iii) each Company Restricted Unit Award that is outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be canceled, with the holder thereof becoming
entitled to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to (A) the
Equity Award Settlement Amount multiplied by (B) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to such Company Restricted Unit Award at the
Effective Time;

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

11

  

  

(iv) each Company Performance Unit Award that is outstanding immediately prior

entitled to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to (A) the
Equity Award Settlement Amount multiplied by (B) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to such Company Performance Unit Award, assuming
attainment of target performance levels; and

  

  

(v) each Director Fee Unit shall be canceled, with the holder thereof becoming
entitled to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to (A) the
Equity Award Settlement Amount multiplied by (B) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to such Director Fee Unit at the Effective Time.

  

  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 2.03(a):

  

  

(i) with respect to each Company Stock Option that is granted after January
27, 2011 (each, a "Post Signing Company Stock Option"), at the Effective Time
by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder
thereof, each such Post Signing Company Stock Option that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not then vested or
exercisable, shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part
of the holder thereof, be converted at the Effective Time into an option (such
option, an "Adjusted Post Signing Company Stock Option") to purchase shares of
Parent Common Stock (rounded down to the nearest whole share), on terms and
conditions substantially the same as those applicable under such Post Signing
Company Stock Option, except that (A) the number of shares of Parent Common
Stock subject to each such Adjusted Post Signing Company Stock Option shall be
determined by multiplying the number of shares of Company Common Stock
underlying such Post Signing Company Stock Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time by the Rollover Exchange Ratio and (B) the exercise price per
share of Parent Common Stock subject to such Adjusted Post Signing Company
Stock Option (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) shall equal (x) the per
share exercise price for the shares of Company Common Stock otherwise
purchasable pursuant to such Post Signing Company Stock Option immediately
prior to the Effective Time divided by (y) the Rollover Exchange Ratio;

  

  

(ii) with respect to each Company Restricted Stock Award, Company Restricted
Unit Award and Director Fee Unit (but not any Company Performance Unit Award)
that is granted after January 27, 2011 (each, a "Post Signing Company Unit
Award"), each such Post Signing Company Unit Award that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not then vested or earned,
shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the
holder thereof, be converted at the Effective Time into an award (such award,
an "Adjusted Post-Signing Company Unit Award") based upon or in respect of
shares of Parent Common Stock, on terms and conditions substantially the same
as those applicable under such Post Signing Company Unit Award, except that
the number of shares of Parent Common Stock underlying or subject to each such
Adjusted Post Signing Company Unit Award shall be (A) the number of shares of

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

12

  

  

Company Common Stock underlying or subject to such Post Signing Company Unit
Award prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (B) the Rollover Exchange
Ratio (rounded up to the nearest whole share); and

  

  

(iii) with respect to each Company Performance Unit Award that is granted
after January 27, 2011 (each, a "Post Signing Performance Unit Award"), each
such Post Signing Performance Unit Award that is outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time, whether or not then vested or earned, shall, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be
converted at the Effective Time into an award (such award, an "Adjusted Post
Signing Performance Unit Award") based upon shares of Parent Common Stock, on
terms and conditions substantially the same as those applicable to such Post
Signing Company Performance Unit Award, except that the number of shares of
Parent Common Stock underlying each such Adjusted Post Signing Company
Performance Unit Award shall be (A) the number of shares of Company Common
Stock underlying such Post Signing Company Performance Unit Award immediately
prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (B) the Rollover Exchange Ratio
(rounded up to the nearest whole share); provided, that such Adjusted Post
Signing Performance Unit Award shall be settled (if at all, and at such time
as provided under the applicable grant agreement awarding such Post Signing
Performance Unit Award) based upon actual performance (with applicable
performance goals being adjusted as the Parent shall deem necessary and
appropriate, acting in good faith, for the effects of the Merger).

  

  

(c) As soon as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement,
and in any event prior to the Effective Time, the Board of Directors of the
Company (or, if appropriate, any committee administering the Company Stock
Plans or the Deferred Directors' Fees Program) shall adopt such resolutions
and take such other actions as may be reasonably required to effectuate the
foregoing provisions of this Section 2.03.

  

  

(d) At the Effective Time, Parent shall assume all cash incentive awards
granted under the Company Stock Plans and that are not denominated in Company
Common Stock (the "Incentive Awards"), in each case, on substantially the same
terms and conditions as were in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time; provided that with respect to Incentive Awards for which the performance
period is scheduled to end following the Effective Time, (i) the performance
goals with respect thereto shall be deemed, as of the Effective Time, to have
been attained at the maximum performance level (except that, with respect to
any Incentive Awards that are granted on or after January 27, 2011, the
performance goals with respect thereto shall be deemed met, if at all, based
upon actual performance (with applicable performance goals being adjusted as
the Parent shall deem necessary and appropriate, acting in good faith, for the
effects of the Merger)) and (ii) all service-based vesting requirements shall
remain in effect without modification hereby.

  

  

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary under the terms of the applicable
Company Restricted Stock Award, Company Restricted Unit Award,

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

13

  

  

Company Performance Unit Award or Director Fee Unit, all amounts payable
pursuant to Section 2.03(a) shall be paid, without interest, as promptly as
practicable following the Effective Time, except as may be (x) necessary to
avoid the imposition of any additional taxes or penalties in respect thereof
pursuant to Section 409A of the Code or (y) required under a payment election
made by an individual award holder in respect of the applicable Company
Restricted Stock Award, Company Restricted Unit Award, Company Performance
Unit Award or Director Fee Unit.

  

  

(f) The adjustments provided in Section 2.03(a)(i) and 2.03(b)(i) with respect
to any Company Stock Options that are "incentive stock options" (as defined in
Section 422 of the Code) are intended to be effected in a manner that is
consistent with Section 424(a) of the Code. For the avoidance of doubt, the
exercise price of, and the number of shares subject to, each Adjusted Option
and Adjusted Post Signing Company Stock Option shall be determined in a manner
necessary to comply with Section 409A of the Code and the Treasury Regulations
thereunder.

  

  

(g) Parent shall either (i) prior to the Effective Time, file with the SEC a
registration statement on Form S-8 (or another appropriate form) registering a
number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the number of shares subject
to the Adjusted Options, the Adjusted Post Signing Company Stock Options, the
Adjusted Post Signing Company Unit Awards and the Adjusted Post Signing
Performance Unit Awards (collectively, the "Assumed Awards"), or (ii) assume
such Assumed Awards under an existing equity incentive plan of Parent or any
of its affiliates with respect to which a registration statement on Form S-8
(or another appropriate form) is currently effective. Any such registration
statement shall be effective on the Closing Date and Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts to maintain the effectiveness of any such registration
statement (and the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses required
thereby shall be maintained) for as long as any Assumed Award shall remain
outstanding. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
Parent shall not be required to issue any shares of Parent Common Stock in
respect of any Assumed Award unless a registration form on Form S-8 under
clause (i) or (ii) above is effective at the time of issuance.

  

  

(h) At the Effective Time, Parent shall assume the obligations and succeed to
the rights of the Company under the Company Stock Plans with respect to the
Assumed Awards. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company and Parent shall take
all actions reasonably determined by the Company or Parent (as applicable) to
reflect the transactions contemplated by this Section 2.03, including the
assumption of the Assumed Awards. From and after the Effective Time, all
references to the Company (other than any references relating to a "change in
control" of the Company) in each Company Stock Plan and in each agreement
evidencing any award of the Assumed Awards shall be deemed to refer to Parent.

Exchange Commission (the "SEC") since January 1, 2009 and publicly available
prior to the date of this Agreement (collectively, the "Company Filed SEC
Documents") (but excluding any forward-looking disclosures set forth in any
risk factor section, any disclosure in any section relating to forward-looking
statements and any other disclosures included in such Company Filed SEC
Document to the extent they are predictive or forward-looking in nature);
provided that in no event shall any disclosure in any Company Filed SEC
Document qualify or limit the representations and warranties of the Company
set forth in Sections 3.01(c), 3.01(d), 3.01(u), 3.01(v), 3.01(w) or 3.01(x),
or (B) as set forth in the corresponding section of the Company Disclosure

qualify the representation and warranty set forth in this Agreement to which
it corresponds in number and each other representation and warranty set forth
in this Section 3.01 to the extent that it is reasonably apparent on its face
that such information is relevant to such other representation and warranty),
the Company represents and warrants to the Buyer Entities as follows:

  

  

(a) Organization, Standing and Corporate Power. The Company and each of its
Significant Subsidiaries is duly organized and validly existing under the Laws
of its jurisdiction of organization and has all requisite corporate, company
or partnership power and authority to own its properties and carry on its
business as presently conducted. The Company and each of its Significant
Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in good
standing (where such concept is recognized under applicable Law) in each
jurisdiction where the nature of its business or the ownership, leasing or
operation of its properties makes such qualification or licensing necessary,
other than where the failure to be so qualified, licensed or in good standing
is not reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect. The Company has made available to Parent true,
correct and complete copies of the Company Certificate of Incorporation and
Company Bylaws as in effect on the date hereof, including all amendments
thereto.

  

  

(b) Subsidiaries. All the outstanding shares of capital stock of, or other
equity interests in, each Significant Subsidiary of the Company (i) have been
validly issued and are fully paid and nonassessable, and (ii) are owned,
directly or indirectly, by the Company free and clear of all pledges, liens
(statutory or other), charges, mortgages, security interests, easements,
rights-of-way, claims, covenants, conditions, restrictions (including transfer
restrictions), options, rights of first offer or refusal, third-party rights,
limitations on voting rights, easements, rights-of-way, encroachments, title
defects or encumbrances of any kind or nature whatsoever (collectively,
"Liens"), other than Company Permitted Liens. All outstanding shares of
capital stock (or equivalent equity interests of entities other than
corporations) of each Subsidiary of the Company are beneficially owned,
directly or indirectly, by the Company. As of the date of this Agreement, the
Company does not, directly or indirectly, own more than 5% but less than 100%
of the capital stock or other equity interest in any person other than the
Subsidiaries of the Company.

representation or warranty contained in this Section 3.01 or in a certificate
delivered by the Company in connection with the Closing. Notwithstanding the
foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement or otherwise, nothing
herein shall relieve the Company or any other person from liability for fraud.

Agreement (collectively, the "Parent Filed SEC Documents") (but excluding any
forward-looking disclosures set forth in any risk factor section, any
disclosure in any section relating to forward-looking statements and any other
disclosures included in such Parent Filed SEC Document to the extent they are
predictive or forward-looking in nature); provided that in no event shall any
disclosure in any Parent Filed SEC Documents qualify or limit the
representations and warranties of the Buyer Entities set forth in Sections
3.02(c), 3.02(d), 3.02(u), 3.02(v), 3.02(w) or 3.02(x), or (B) as set forth in

and warranty set forth in this Agreement to which it corresponds in number and
each other representation and warranty set forth in this Section 3.02 to the
extent that it is reasonably apparent on its face that such information is
relevant to such other representation and warranty), each Buyer Entity
represents and warrants, jointly and severally, to the Company as follows:

  

  

(a) Organization, Standing and Corporate Power. Each Buyer Entity and each of
its Significant Subsidiaries is duly organized and validly existing under the
Laws of its jurisdiction of organization and has all requisite corporate,
company or partnership power and authority to own its properties and carry on
its business as presently conducted. Each Buyer Entity and each of its
Significant Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed to do business and is
in good standing (where such concept is recognized under applicable Law) in
each jurisdiction where the nature of its business or the ownership, leasing
or operation of its properties makes such qualification or licensing
necessary, other than where the failure to be so qualified, licensed or in
good standing is not reasonably likely to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Parent has made available to the
Company true, correct and complete copies of the certificates of incorporation
and bylaws of each of the Buyer Entities as in effect on the date hereof,
including all amendments thereto.

  

  

(b) Subsidiaries. All the outstanding shares of capital stock of, or other

Parent free and clear of all Liens, other than Parent Permitted Liens. All
outstanding shares of capital stock (or equivalent equity interests of
entities other than corporations) of each Subsidiary of Parent are
beneficially owned, directly or indirectly, by Parent. As of the date of this
Agreement, Parent does not, directly or indirectly, own more than 5% but less
than 100% of the capital stock or other equity interest in any person other

Subsidiary, other than pursuant to the Parent Stock Awards and Parent Stock
Plans.

(x) Available Funds. The financing of the transactions contemplated hereby
will consist of debt financing provided to Parent (or loaned directly to the
Company or one of its Subsidiaries) (the "Financing"). Parent has delivered to
the Company true and complete copies of fully executed commitment letters
pursuant to which the parties thereto (the "Financing Sources") have committed

permitted by Section 5.09(a). No event has occurred that, with or without
notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a default or breach on the
part of either Buyer Entity under any term of the Financing Commitment.
Assuming the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 6.02, (i)
none of the Buyer Entities has any reason to believe that it or any of the
other parties to the Financing Commitment will be unable to satisfy on a
timely basis any term or condition of the Financing Commitment required to be
satisfied by it and (ii) none of the Buyer Entities has any reason to believe,
as of the date of this Agreement, that any portion of the Financing to be made

the Surviving Corporation on a timely basis to consummate the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby. Parent has fully paid any and all
commitment fees or other fees required by the Financing Commitment to be paid
by it on or prior to the date of this Agreement and shall in the future pay
any such fees as they become due. Assuming the satisfaction of the conditions
set forth in

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

56

  

  

Section 6.02, the Financing, when funded in accordance with the Financing
Commitment, together with the available cash, cash equivalents and marketable
securities of Parent, will provide the Buyer Entities and the Surviving
Corporation with funds sufficient to satisfy all of their obligations under
this Agreement, including the payment of the aggregate Merger Consideration,
the amounts pursuant to Sections 2.02(d) and 2.02(f) and all associated costs
and expenses. The obligations of the Lenders to fund the full amount of the
Financing to Parent, MergerCo or the Surviving Corporation pursuant to the
terms of the Financing Commitment are not subject to any conditions other than
the conditions set forth in the Financing Commitment. There are no side
Contracts or understandings (other than for customary fee letters and
engagement letters) related to the Financing other than as expressly set forth
in the Financing Commitment. As of the Closing, the Buyer Entities will have
readily available funds that are sufficient to effect the Closing on the terms
contemplated hereby. The engagement letter and fee letter provide that a
securities demand may be exercised for a sale of securities prior to the
Closing Date and on or after the 270th day from the date hereof as well as on
the closing date but otherwise do not contain any additional conditions to
funding.

  

  

(y) Ownership of Company Common Stock. None of the Buyer Entities beneficially
owns (within the meaning of Section 13 of the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder), or will prior to the Closing Date
beneficially own, any shares of Company Common Stock, or are a party, or will
prior to the Closing Date become a party, to any Contract, arrangement or
understanding (other than this Agreement) for the purpose of acquiring,
holding, voting or disposing of any shares of Company Common Stock.

  

  

(z) MergerCo Capitalization, Operations and Assets. MergerCo is a wholly owned
direct Subsidiary of Parent. The authorized capital stock of MergerCo consists

outstanding and no shares of MergerCo preferred stock issued or outstanding.

or in connection with this Agreement and the Merger, the Financing and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Since its date of
formation, MergerCo has not carried on any business nor conducted any
operations other than the execution of this Agreement, the performance of its
obligations hereunder and matters ancillary thereto.

  

  

(aa) No Other Representations or Warranties. Except for the representations
and warranties contained in this Section 3.02 or in any certificates delivered
by either Buyer Entity in connection with the Closing, the Company
acknowledges that neither Buyer Entity nor any person on behalf of either
Buyer Entity makes any other express or implied representation or warranty
with respect to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or with respect to any other
information provided or made available to the Company in connection with the
transactions contemplated by

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

57

  

  

this Agreement. Neither Buyer Entity nor any other person will have or be
subject to any liability or indemnification obligation to the Company or any
other person resulting from the distribution to the Company, or the Company's
use of, any such information, including any information, documents,
projections, forecasts or other material made available to the Company in
certain "data rooms" or management presentations in expectation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, unless and then only to the
extent that any such information is expressly included in a representation or
warranty contained in this Section 3.02 or in a certificate delivered by
Parent in connection with the Closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any
other provision of this Agreement or otherwise, nothing herein shall relieve
either Buyer Entity or any other person from liability for fraud.

SECTION 4.02. No Solicitation by the Company; Board of Directors of the
Company Recommendation.

  

  

(a) The Company shall not, nor shall it authorize or permit any of its
Affiliates or any of its or their respective representatives to, (i) directly
or indirectly solicit, initiate, induce, knowingly facilitate or knowingly
encourage (including by way of providing non-public information) any Company
Takeover Proposal or any inquiry, proposal or request for discussion that may
reasonably be expected to lead to a Company Takeover Proposal or (ii) directly
or indirectly participate in any discussions or negotiations with any person
regarding or cooperate in any way with any person (whether or not a person
making a Company Takeover Proposal) with respect to any Company Takeover
Proposal or any inquiry, proposal or request for discussion that may
reasonably be expected to lead to a Company Takeover Proposal. The Company
shall, and shall cause its Affiliates and its and their respective
representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated all existing
discussions or negotiations with any person conducted heretofore with respect
to any Company Takeover Proposal, or any inquiry or proposal that may
reasonably be expected to lead to a Company Takeover Proposal, request the
prompt return or destruction of all confidential information previously
furnished and immediately terminate all physical and electronic dataroom
access previously granted to any such person or its representatives. The
Company shall take all actions necessary to enforce its rights under the
provisions of any "standstill" agreement between the Company and any

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

68

  

  

person (other than Parent), and shall not grant any waiver of, or agree to any
amendment or modification to, any such agreement, to permit such person to
submit a Company Takeover Proposal.

  

  

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to obtaining the Company
Stockholder Approval, in response to a bona fide unsolicited written Company
Takeover Proposal that the Board of Directors of the Company determines in
good faith (after consultation with outside counsel and a financial advisor of
nationally recognized reputation) (i) constitutes or is reasonably likely to
lead to a Superior Company Proposal and (ii) that the failure to take the
actions described in clauses (x) and (y) below would be inconsistent with the
Board of Directors' fiduciary duties under applicable Law, and which Company
Takeover Proposal was made after the date of this Agreement and did not
otherwise result from a knowing or intentional breach of this Section 4.02,
the Company may, subject to compliance with this Section 4.02(b), (x) furnish
information with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the person
making such Company Takeover Proposal (and its representatives) (provided that
all such information has previously been provided to Parent or is provided to
Parent prior to or substantially concurrently with the time it is provided to
such person) pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement not less
restrictive of such person than the Confidentiality Agreement (including with
respect to standstill provisions, provided that under no circumstances shall
such standstill provisions expire earlier than the Outside Date), provided,
further, that the Company may grant a limited waiver of such standstill
provisions to the extent, and only to the extent reasonably necessary to
permit the Board of Directors of the Company to engage in the activities
expressly permitted by and in accordance with this Section 4.02(b) and Section
4.02(d) under the terms and conditions set forth in this Section 4.02(b) and
Section 4.02(d) and (y) participate in discussions regarding the terms of such
Company Takeover Proposal and the negotiation of such terms with, and only
with, the person making such Company Takeover Proposal (and such person's
representatives); provided, that the Company shall give written notice to
Parent after any such determination by the Board of Directors of the Company
and prior to taking any of the actions described in the foregoing clauses (x)
and (y). Without limiting the foregoing, it is agreed that any violation of
the restrictions set forth in this Section 4.02 by any representative of the
Company or any of its Affiliates shall constitute a breach of this Section
4.02 by the Company.

  

  

(c) Except as set forth below, neither the Board of Directors of the Company
nor any committee thereof shall (i) (A) withdraw (or qualify or modify in any
manner adverse to Parent), or propose publicly to withdraw (or qualify or
modify in any manner adverse to Parent), the Company Board Recommendation, (B)
take any action to exempt any person (other than the Buyer Entities and their
Affiliates) from the provisions of Section 203 of the DGCL or any other state
takeover statute, or (C) approve, recommend or declare advisable, or propose
publicly to approve, recommend or declare advisable, any Company Takeover
Proposal (any action in this clause (i) being referred to as a "Company
Adverse

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

69

  

  

Recommendation Change") or (ii) approve, recommend or declare advisable, or
propose publicly to approve, recommend or declare advisable, or cause or allow
the Company or any of its Affiliates to execute or enter into, any letter of
intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement,
acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, alliance
agreement, partnership agreement or other agreement or arrangement (an
"Acquisition Agreement") constituting or related to, or that is intended to or
would reasonably be expected to lead to, any Company Takeover Proposal, or
requiring, or reasonably expected to cause, the Company to abandon, terminate,
delay or fail to consummate, or that would otherwise impede, interfere with or
be inconsistent with, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, or requiring, or reasonably expected to cause, the Company
to fail to comply with this Agreement (other than a confidentiality agreement
referred to in Section 4.02(b)). Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time
prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval and other than in
connection with a Company Takeover Proposal, if the Board of Directors of the
Company determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel and
a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) that the failure to
take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law, the Board of Directors of the Company may make a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change; provided, that the Company has provided Parent
five business days' prior written notice advising Parent that it intends to
take such action and specifying, in reasonable detail, the reasons for such
action.

  

  

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to obtaining the Company
Stockholder Approval, if the Board of Directors of the Company determines in
good faith (after consultation with outside counsel and a financial advisor of
nationally recognized reputation) that (i) an unsolicited bona fide written
Company Takeover Proposal made after the date of this Agreement and not the
result of a breach of this Section 4.02 constitutes a Superior Company
Proposal and (ii) the failure to approve or recommend such Superior Company
Proposal would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law,
the Board of Directors of the Company may, subject to compliance with this
Section 4.02(d), cause the Company to terminate this Agreement in order to
enter into a definitive agreement relating to such Company Takeover Proposal
that constitutes a Superior Company Proposal after paying the Company
Termination Fee in accordance with Section 5.06(b). The Company shall provide
Parent with five business days' prior written notice advising Parent that it
intends to take such action and specifying, in reasonable detail, the reasons
for such action (a "Notice of Superior Proposal"). A Notice of Superior
Proposal shall advise Parent that the Board of Directors of the Company has
received a Superior Company Proposal and shall include any information and
materials required to be delivered under Section 4.02(e) that have not yet
been provided to Parent (including the most recent version of any written
agreement relating to the transaction that constitutes a Superior Company
Proposal or, if no such written agreement exists, a written summary of the
material terms and conditions of such Superior Company

Proposal). If Parent, within five business days following its receipt of a
Notice of Superior Proposal (the "Notice Period"), makes an offer that, as
determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Company (after
consultation with outside counsel and a financial advisor of nationally
recognized reputation) results in the applicable Company Takeover Proposal no
longer being a Superior Company Proposal, then the Company shall have no right
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.01(g) as a result of such
Company Takeover Proposal. If Parent shall not have made such an offer within
the Notice Period, then, within five business days following the expiration of
such Notice Period, the Board of Directors of the Company may cause the
Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.01(g) in order to
enter into a definitive agreement relating to such Company Takeover Proposal
that constitutes a Superior Company Proposal after paying the Company
Termination Fee in accordance with Section 5.06(b). During the Notice Period,
the Company shall and shall cause its representatives, including its financial
advisors and outside counsel, to negotiate in good faith with Parent and its
representatives (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) with respect to
any offer from Parent. Any (A) material revisions to the terms of a Superior
Company Proposal or (B) material revisions to a Company Takeover Proposal that
the Board of Directors of the Company had determined no longer constitutes a
Superior Company Proposal, shall constitute a new Company Takeover Proposal
and shall require the Company to deliver to Parent a new Notice of Superior
Proposal and a new Notice Period shall commence thereafter. Except after
compliance with the procedures set forth in this Section 4.02(d), the Company
shall have no right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.01(g).

  

  

(e) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in paragraphs (a),
(b), (c) and (d) of this Section 4.02, the Company shall promptly (and in any
event within 48 hours) advise Parent orally and in writing of any Company
Takeover Proposal or any inquiry, proposal or request for discussions that may
reasonably be expected to lead to a Company Takeover Proposal, the material
terms and conditions thereof (including any changes thereto) and the identity
of the person making any such inquiry, proposal, request for discussions or
Company Takeover Proposal. The Company shall (i) keep Parent promptly informed
in all material respects of the status and details (including any change to
the terms thereof) of any inquiry, proposal, request for discussions or
Company Takeover Proposal and (ii) provide to Parent as soon as practicable
(and in any event within 48 hours) after receipt or delivery thereof copies of
all correspondence and other written material exchanged between the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries and any person that describes any of the terms or
conditions of any inquiry, proposal, request for discussions or Company
Takeover Proposal.

  

  

(f) Nothing contained in this Section 4.02 shall prohibit the Company from (i)
taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule
14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) making any disclosure to
the

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

71

  

  

stockholders of the Company if, in the good faith judgment of the Board of
Directors of the Company (after consultation with outside counsel), failure to
do so would be inconsistent with its obligations under applicable Law;
provided, however, that in no event shall the Company or the Board of
Directors of the Company or any committee thereof take, or agree or resolve to
take, any action prohibited by Section 4.02(c).

  

  

(g) For the avoidance of doubt, the parties agree that none of the actions
contemplated or permitted by this Agreement (including this Section 4.02)
shall constitute a breach or violation of the Confidentiality Agreement by
Parent, its Affiliates or representatives.

  

  

(h) For purposes of this Agreement:

  

  

"Company Takeover Proposal" means any proposal or offer (whether or not in
writing) from any person other than the Buyer Entities and their Affiliates,
with respect to any (i) merger, consolidation, share exchange, other business
combination or similar transaction involving the Company, (ii) sale, lease,
contribution or other disposition, directly or indirectly (including by way of
merger, consolidation, share exchange, other business combination,
partnership, joint venture, sale of capital stock of or other equity interests
in a Company Subsidiary or otherwise) of any business or assets of the Company
or the Company Subsidiaries representing 20% or more of the consolidated
revenues, net income or assets of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, (iii) issuance, sale or other disposition, directly or
indirectly, to any person (or the stockholders of any person) or group of
securities (or options, warrants or other rights to acquire, or securities
convertible into or exchangeable for, such securities) representing 20% or
more of the voting power of the Company, (iv) transaction in which any person
(or the stockholders of any person) shall acquire, directly or indirectly,
beneficial ownership, or the right to acquire beneficial ownership, or
formation of any group which beneficially owns or has the right to acquire
beneficial ownership of, 20% or more of the Company Common Stock or (v) any
combination of the foregoing (in each case, other than the Merger).

  

  

"Superior Company Proposal" means any binding bona fide written offer made by
a third party or group pursuant to which such third party (or the stockholders
of such third party) or group would acquire, directly or indirectly, more than
50% of the Company Common Stock or substantially all of the assets of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (i) which the Board of
Directors of the Company determines in good faith (after consultation with
outside counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation)
is more favorable, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Company
Common Stock than the Merger, taking into account all the terms and conditions
of such proposal and this Agreement (including any changes proposed by Parent
to the terms of this Agreement) and the failure of the Board of Directors of
the

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

72

  

  

Company to approve or recommend such Company Competing Proposal would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, (ii) the
financing of which is fully committed and (iii) that is reasonably likely to
be completed on the terms set forth in such offer, taking into account all
financial, regulatory, legal and other aspects of such proposal.

  

  

SECTION 4.03. No Solicitation by Parent; Board of Directors of Parent
Recommendation.

  

  

(a) Parent shall not, nor shall it authorize or permit any of its Affiliates
or any of its or their respective representatives to, (i) directly or
indirectly solicit, initiate, induce, knowingly facilitate or knowingly
encourage (including by way of providing non-public information) any Parent
Takeover Proposal or any inquiry, proposal or request for discussion that may
reasonably be expected to lead to a Parent Takeover Proposal or (ii) directly
or indirectly participate in any discussions or negotiations with any person
regarding or cooperate in any way with any person (whether or not a person
making a Parent Takeover Proposal) with respect to any Parent Takeover
Proposal or any inquiry, proposal or request for discussion that may
reasonably be expected to lead to a Parent Takeover Proposal. Parent shall,
and shall cause its Affiliates and its and their respective representatives
to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated all existing discussions or
negotiations with any person conducted heretofore with respect to any Parent
Takeover Proposal, or any inquiry or proposal that may reasonably be expected
to lead to a Parent Takeover Proposal, request the prompt return or
destruction of all confidential information previously furnished and
immediately terminate all physical and electronic dataroom access previously
granted to any such person or its representatives. Parent shall take all
actions necessary to enforce its rights under the provisions of any
"standstill" agreement between Parent and any person (other than the Company),
and shall not grant any waiver of, or agree to any amendment or modification
to, any such agreement, to permit such person to submit a Parent Takeover
Proposal.

  

  

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to obtaining the Parent
Stockholder Approval, in response to a bona fide unsolicited written Parent
Takeover Proposal that the Board of Directors of Parent determines in good
faith (after consultation with outside counsel and a financial advisor of
nationally recognized reputation) (i) constitutes or is reasonably likely to
lead to a Superior Parent Proposal and (ii) that the failure to take the
actions described in clauses (x) and (y) below would be inconsistent with the
Board of Directors' fiduciary duties under applicable Law, and which Parent
Takeover Proposal was made after the date of this Agreement and did not
otherwise result from a knowing or intentional breach of this Section 4.03,
Parent may, subject to compliance with this Section 4.03(b), (x) furnish
information with respect to Parent and its Subsidiaries to the person making
such Parent Takeover Proposal (and its representatives) (provided that all
such information has previously been provided to the Company or is provided to
the Company prior to or substantially concurrently with the time

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

73

  

  

it is provided to such person) pursuant to a customary confidentiality
agreement not less restrictive of such person than the Confidentiality
Agreement (including with respect to standstill provisions, provided that
under no circumstances shall such standstill provisions expire earlier than
the Outside Date) provided, further, that Parent may grant a limited waiver of
such standstill provisions to the extent, and only to the extent reasonably
necessary to permit the Board of Directors of Parent to engage in the
activities expressly permitted by and in accordance with this Section 4.03(b)
and Section 4.03(d) under the terms and conditions set forth in this Section
4.03(b) and Section 4.03(d) and (y) participate in discussions regarding the
terms of such Parent Takeover Proposal and the negotiation of such terms with,
and only with, the person making such Parent Takeover Proposal (and such
person's representatives); provided, that Parent shall give written notice to
the Company after any such determination by the Board of Directors of Parent
and prior to taking any of the actions described in the foregoing clauses (x)
and (y). Without limiting the foregoing, it is agreed that any violation of
the restrictions set forth in this Section 4.03 by any representative of
Parent or any of its Affiliates shall constitute a breach of this Section 4.03
by Parent.

  

  

(c) Except as set forth below, neither the Board of Directors of Parent nor
any committee thereof shall (i) (A) withdraw (or qualify or modify in any
manner adverse to the Company), or propose publicly to withdraw (or qualify or
modify in any manner adverse to the Company), the Parent Board Recommendation,
(B) take any action to exempt any person (other than the Buyer Entities and
their Affiliates) from the provisions of Section 203 of the DGCL or any other
state takeover statute), or (C) approve, recommend or declare advisable, or
propose publicly to approve, recommend or declare advisable, any Parent
Takeover Proposal (any action in this clause (i) being referred to as a
"Parent Adverse Recommendation Change") or (ii) approve, recommend or declare
advisable, or propose publicly to approve, recommend or declare advisable, or
cause or allow Parent or any of its Affiliates to execute or enter into, any
Acquisition Agreement constituting or related to, or that is intended to or
would reasonably be expected to lead to, any Parent Takeover Proposal, or
requiring, or reasonably expected to cause, Parent to abandon, terminate,
delay or fail to consummate, or that would otherwise impede, interfere with or
be inconsistent with, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, or requiring, or reasonably expected to cause, Parent to
fail to comply with this Agreement (other than a confidentiality agreement
referred to in Section 4.03(b)). Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time
prior to obtaining the Parent Stockholder Approval and other than in
connection with a Parent Takeover Proposal, if the Board of Directors of
Parent determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel and a
financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) that the failure to
take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law, the Board of Directors of Parent may make a Parent Adverse
Recommendation Change; provided, that Parent has provided the Company five
business days' prior written notice advising the Company that it

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

74

  

  

intends to take such action and specifying, in reasonable detail, the reasons
for such action.

  

  

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to obtaining the Parent
Stockholder Approval, if the Board of Directors of Parent determines in good
faith (after consultation with outside counsel and a financial advisor of
nationally recognized reputation) that (i) an unsolicited bona fide written
Parent Takeover Proposal made after the date of this Agreement and not the
result of a breach of this Section 4.03 constitutes a Superior Parent Proposal
and (ii) the failure to approve or recommend such Superior Parent Proposal
would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, the
Board of Directors of Parent may, subject to compliance with this Section
4.03(d), cause Parent to terminate this Agreement in order to enter into a
definitive agreement relating to such Parent Takeover Proposal that
constitutes a Superior Parent Proposal after paying the Parent Termination Fee
in accordance with Section 5.06(c). Parent shall provide the Company with five
business days' prior written notice in the form of a Notice of Superior
Proposal. A Notice of Superior Proposal shall advise the Company that the
Board of Directors of Parent has received a Superior Parent Proposal and shall
include any information and materials required to be delivered under Section
4.03(e) that have not yet been provided to the Company (including the most
recent version of any written agreement relating to the transaction that
constitutes a Superior Parent Proposal or, if no such written agreement
exists, a written summary of the material terms and conditions of such
Superior Parent Proposal). If the Company, within the Notice Period, makes an
offer that, as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of Parent
(after consultation with outside counsel and a financial advisor of nationally
recognized reputation) results in the applicable Parent Takeover Proposal no
longer being a Superior Parent Proposal, then Parent shall have no right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.01(h) as a result of such
Parent Takeover Proposal. If the Company shall not have made such an offer
within the Notice Period, then, within five business days following the
expiration of such Notice Period, the Board of Directors of Parent may cause
Parent to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.01(h) in order to
enter into a definitive agreement relating to such Parent Takeover Proposal
that constitutes a Superior Parent Proposal after paying the Parent
Termination Fee in accordance with Section 5.06(c). During the Notice Period,
Parent shall and shall cause its representatives, including its financial
advisors and outside counsel, to negotiate in good faith with the Company and
its representatives (to the extent the Company desires to negotiate) with
respect to any offer from the Company. Any (A) material revisions to the terms
of a Superior Parent Proposal or (B) material revisions to a Parent Competing
Proposal that the Board of Directors of Parent had determined no longer
constitutes a Superior Parent Proposal, shall constitute a new Parent
Competing Proposal and shall require Parent to deliver to the Company a new
Notice of Superior Proposal and a new Notice Period shall commence thereafter.
Except after compliance with the procedures set forth in

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

75

  

  

this Section 4.03(d), Parent shall have no right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Section 7.01(h).

  

  

(e) In addition to the obligations of Parent set forth in paragraphs (a), (b),
(c) and (d) of this Section 4.03, Parent shall promptly (and in any event
within 48 hours) advise the Company orally and in writing of any Parent
Takeover Proposal or any inquiry, proposal or request for discussions that may
reasonably be expected to lead to a Company Takeover Proposal, the material
terms and conditions thereof (including any changes thereto) and the identity
of the person making any such inquiry, proposal, request for discussions or
Parent Takeover Proposal. Parent shall (i) keep the Company promptly informed
in all material respects of the status and details (including any change to
the terms thereof) of any inquiry, proposal, request for discussions or Parent
Takeover Proposal and (ii) provide to the Company as soon as practicable (and
in any event within 48 hours) after receipt or delivery thereof copies of all
correspondence and other written material exchanged between Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries and any person that describes any of the terms or conditions
of any inquiry, proposal, request for discussions or Parent Takeover Proposal.

  

  

(f) Nothing contained in this Section 4.03 shall prohibit Parent from (i)
taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule
14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) making any disclosure to
the stockholders of Parent if, in the good faith judgment of the Board of
Directors of Parent (after consultation with outside counsel), failure to do
so would be inconsistent with its obligations under applicable Law; provided,
however, that in no event shall Parent or the Board of Directors of Parent or
any committee thereof take, or agree or resolve to take, any action prohibited
by Section 4.03(c).

  

  

(g) For the avoidance of doubt, the parties agree that none of the actions
contemplated or permitted by this Agreement (including this Section 4.03)
shall constitute a breach or violation of the Confidentiality Agreement by the
Company, its Affiliates or representatives.

  

  

(h) For purposes of this Agreement:

  

  

"Parent Takeover Proposal" means any proposal or offer (whether or not in
writing) from any person other than the Buyer Entities and their Affiliates,
with respect to any (i) merger, consolidation, share exchange, other business
combination or similar transaction involving Parent, (ii) sale, lease,
contribution or other disposition, directly or indirectly (including by way of
merger, consolidation, share exchange, other business combination,
partnership, joint venture, sale of capital stock of or other equity interests
in a Parent Subsidiary or otherwise) of any business or assets of Parent or
Parent Subsidiaries representing 20% or more of the consolidated revenues, net
income or assets of Parent and Parent Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (iii)
issuance, sale or other disposition, directly or indirectly, to any person (or
the stockholders of any person) or group of securities (or options, warrants
or other rights to acquire, or securities

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

76

  

  

convertible into or exchangeable for, such securities) representing 20% or
more of the voting power of Parent, (iv) transaction in which any person (or
the stockholders of any person) shall acquire, directly or indirectly,
beneficial ownership, or the right to acquire beneficial ownership, or
formation of any group which beneficially owns or has the right to acquire
beneficial ownership of, 20% or more of Parent Common Stock or (v) any
combination of the foregoing (in each case, other than the Merger).

  

  

"Superior Parent Proposal" means any binding bona fide written offer made by a
third party or group pursuant to which such third party (or the stockholders
of such third party) or group would acquire, directly or indirectly, more than
50% of Parent Common Stock or substantially all of the assets of Parent and
Parent Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (i) which the Board of Directors of
Parent determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel and a
financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) is more favorable, from
a financial point of view, to the holders of Parent Common Stock than the
Merger, taking into account all the terms and conditions of such proposal and
this Agreement (including any changes proposed by the Company to the terms of
this Agreement) and the failure of the Board of Directors of Parent to approve
or recommend such Parent Competing Proposal would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law, (ii) the financing of which is fully
committed and (iii) that is reasonably likely to be completed on the terms set
forth in such offer, taking into account all financial, regulatory, legal and
other aspects of such proposal.

respective Subsidiaries to, afford to the other party, and to the other

advisors and other representatives, reasonable access during normal business
hours during the period prior to the Effective Time to all of its and its
Subsidiaries' properties, books and records, financial and operating data and
other information, and to its and its Subsidiaries' officers and employees,
and use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and its Subsidiaries'

reasonably requests access, and, during such period, each of the Company and
Parent shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, furnish, as promptly as

Subsidiaries' business, properties and personnel as such other party may
reasonably request and shall cause its and its Subsidiaries' respective

customary documentation reasonably requested by the auditors (it being agreed,
however, that the foregoing shall not permit any party or any of its
representatives to conduct any environmental testing or sampling).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Company, Parent or any of their
respective Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or disclose
information where such party reasonably determines that such access or
disclosure would jeopardize the attorney-

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

79

  

  

client privilege of such party or any of its Subsidiaries or contravene any
Law or any Contract to which such party or any of its Subsidiaries is a party;
provided, that each party shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain any
required consents and take such other action (such as the entry into a joint
defense agreement or other arrangement to avoid loss of attorney client
privilege) to permit such access or disclosure. Except for disclosures
expressly permitted by the terms of the confidentiality letter agreement dated
as of January 3, 2011, between Parent and the Company (as such agreement may
be amended from time to time, the "Confidentiality Agreement") and except for
disclosure by the Buyer Entities reasonably necessary to comply with customary
practice in connection with obtaining the Financing, each of Parent and the
Company shall hold, and shall cause its respective officers, employees,
accountants, counsel, financial advisors and other representatives to hold,

representatives in confidence in accordance with the Confidentiality
Agreement.

  

  

SECTION 5.03. Reasonable Best Efforts. (a) Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of the parties hereto agrees to
use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions,
and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other
parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to, consummate and
make effective, as promptly as is reasonably practical under the
circumstances, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including using reasonable best efforts to accomplish the
following: (i) the taking of all acts necessary to cause the conditions to
Closing to be satisfied as promptly as is reasonably practical under the
circumstances provided, however, nothing herein shall limit the right of
Parent to enter into Timing Agreements pursuant to Section 5.03(c), (ii) the
obtaining of all necessary, proper or advisable actions or nonactions,
waivers, consents and approvals from Governmental Entities and the making of
all necessary, proper or advisable registrations and filings (including
filings with Governmental Entities) and the taking of all steps as may be
necessary to obtain an approval or waiver from, or to avoid an action or
proceeding by, any Governmental Entity, (iii) the obtaining of consents,
approvals and waivers from third parties reasonably requested by Parent to be
obtained in connection with the Merger under the Company Material Contracts
and Company Real Property Leases, provided, however, that in no event shall
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries be required to pay, prior to the
Effective Time, any fee, penalty or other consideration to any landlord or
other person to obtain any such consent, approval or waiver, and (iv) the
execution and delivery of any additional instruments necessary to consummate
the transactions contemplated by, and to fully carry out the purposes of, this
Agreement.

  

  

(b) In connection with and without limiting Section 5.03(a), each of Parent
and the Company and their respective Boards of Directors shall (i) take all
action reasonably appropriate to ensure that no state takeover statute or
similar statute or regulation is or becomes applicable to this Agreement or
any transaction contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) if any state takeover
statute or similar statute or regulation becomes applicable to this Agreement
or any transaction contemplated by this Agreement, take all action reasonably
appropriate to ensure that the Merger and

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

80

  

  

the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated, as
promptly as is reasonably practical under the circumstances.

  

  

(c) In connection with and without limiting Section 5.03(a), promptly
following the execution and delivery by the parties to this Agreement, Parent
and the Company shall enter into discussions with the Governmental Entities
from whom Consents or nonactions are required to be obtained in connection
with the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement in order to obtain all such required Consents or nonactions
from such Governmental Entities and eliminate each and every other impediment
that may be asserted by such Governmental Entities, in each case with respect
to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, so as
to enable the Closing to occur as promptly as is reasonably practical under
the circumstances, provided, however, nothing herein shall limit the right of
Parent to enter into Timing Agreements pursuant to this Section 5.03(c). To
the extent necessary in order to accomplish the foregoing, Parent shall
propose, negotiate, commit to and effect, by consent decree, hold separate
order or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or disposition of, or prohibition or
limitation on the ownership or operation by Parent, the Company or any of
their respective Subsidiaries of any portion of their respective business,
properties or assets; (a "Divestiture Action"); provided, however,
notwithstanding the foregoing or anything herein to the contrary, the parties
shall not have any obligation to propose, negotiate, commit to or effect any
Divestiture Action that would have a material adverse effect on the assets and
liabilities (taken as a whole), business, financial condition or results of
operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or Parent
and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (a "MAE Burdensome Condition");
provided further, however, that no party shall be required pursuant to this
Section 5.03(c) to propose, commit to or effect any action that is not
conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger. If the actions taken pursuant
to the immediately preceding sentence do not result in the conditions set
forth in Section 6.01(b), 6.02(e) or 6.03(e) being satisfied, then each of
Parent and the Company shall jointly (to the extent practicable) initiate
and/or participate in any proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, in
order to (i) oppose or defend against any action by any Governmental Entity or
private party to prevent or enjoin the consummation of the Merger or any of
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and/or (ii) take such
action as necessary to overturn any regulatory action by any Governmental
Entity or action by any private party to block consummation of the Merger or
any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including by
defending any suit, action or other legal proceeding brought by any
Governmental Entity or private party in order to avoid the entry of, or to
have vacated, overturned or terminated, including by appeal if necessary, any
Restraint resulting from any suit, action or other legal proceeding that would
cause any condition set forth in Section 6.01(b), 6.02(e) or 6.03(e) not to be
satisfied. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Parent
shall have the right to determine and direct the strategy and process
(including all timing, substantive matters and decisions to propose,
negotiate, commit to or effect any Divestiture Action) by which the parties
will seek required consents, approvals, clearances, waivers, waiting period
expirations and terminations and

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

81

  

  

removal of all impediments (including all elements of any suit, action or
other legal proceeding and communications with Governmental Entities), in each
case under the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Law, including the right to
enter into reasonable timing agreements with Governmental Entities as
customary in reviews under the HSR Act and other Antitrust Laws ("Timing
Agreements"); provided, however that Parent shall use its reasonable best
efforts to regularly consult with the Company and keep the Company reasonably
informed of such strategy and process and the results thereof.

  

  

(d) In connection with and without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
each of Parent and the Company shall:

  

  

(i) make or cause to be made, in consultation and cooperation with the other
and as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement,
(A) an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the
HSR Act relating to the Merger and (B) all other necessary, proper or
advisable registrations, declarations, notices and filings relating to the
Merger with other Governmental Entities under any other Antitrust Law;

  

  

(ii) use its reasonable best efforts to furnish to the other all assistance,
cooperation and information required for any such registration, declaration,
notice or filing;

  

  

(iii) give the other reasonable prior notice of any such registration,
declaration, notice or filing and, to the extent reasonably practicable, of
any communication with any Governmental Entity regarding the Merger (including
with respect to any of the actions referred to in Section 5.03(c)), and permit
the other to review and discuss in advance, and consider in good faith the
views of, and use its reasonable best efforts to secure the participation of,
the other in connection with any such registration, declaration, notice,
filing or communication;

  

  

(iv) respond as promptly as practicable under the circumstances to any
inquiries received from any Governmental Entity or any other authority
enforcing applicable antitrust, competition, trade regulation or similar Laws
for additional information or documentation in connection with antitrust,
competition, trade regulation or similar matters (including a "second request"
under the HSR Act) and not enter into any agreement with such Governmental
Entities or other authorities not to consummate the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except with the prior written
consent of the other parties hereto (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed and which reasonableness shall be determined
in light of each party's obligation to do all things necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner
practicable, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement), provided, however, nothing herein shall limit the right of Parent
to enter into Timing Agreements pursuant to Section 5.03(c); and

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

82

  

  

(v) unless prohibited by applicable Law or by the applicable Governmental
Entity, (A) to the extent reasonably practicable, not participate in or attend
any meeting, or engage in any substantive conversation with any Governmental
Entity in respect of the Merger (including with respect to any of the actions
referred to in Section 5.03(c)) without the other, (B) to the extent
reasonably practicable, give the other reasonable prior notice of any such
meeting or conversation, (C) in the event one party is prohibited by
applicable Law or by the applicable Governmental Entity from participating in
or attending any such meeting or engaging in any such conversation, keep such
party reasonably apprised with respect thereto, (D) cooperate in the filing of
any substantive memoranda, white papers, filings, correspondence or other
written communications explaining or defending this Agreement and the Merger,
articulating any regulatory or competitive argument, and/or responding to
requests or objections made by any Governmental Entity and (E) furnish the
other party with copies of all correspondence, filings and communications (and
memoranda setting forth the substance thereof) between it and its Affiliates
and their respective representatives on the one hand, and any Governmental
Entity or members of any Governmental Entity's staff, on the other hand, with
respect to this Agreement and the Merger, provided that such material may be
redacted as necessary (1) to comply with contractual arrangements, (2) to
address good faith legal privilege or confidentiality concerns and (3) to
comply with applicable Law.

  

  

(e) Immediately following the execution and delivery of their Agreement by
each of the parties hereto, Parent, as sole stockholder of MergerCo, will
adopt this Agreement.

  

  

SECTION 5.04. Benefit Plans. (a) For a period commencing at the Effective Time
and ending on December 31, 2012, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, provide employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries (other
than employees whose terms and conditions of employment are governed by a
collective bargaining agreement, the terms and conditions of which shall be
respected by Parent and the Surviving Corporation who remain in the active
employment of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries (the "Company
Employees") with compensation and employee benefits that are no less favorable
in the aggregate than the compensation and employment benefits provided to
such Company Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time.

  

  

(b) Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, honor, in
accordance with its terms, each Company Benefit Plan and Company Benefit
Agreement and all obligations thereunder including any rights or benefits
arising as a result of the transactions contemplated under this Agreement
(either alone or in combination with any other event, including termination of
employment), and Parent hereby agrees and acknowledges that the consummation
of the Merger constitutes a "change of control" or a "change in control", as
the case may be, for all purposes under the Company Benefit Plans and Company
Benefit Agreements.

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

83

  

  

  

(c) With respect to any "employee benefit plan", as defined in Section 3(3) of
ERISA, maintained by the Surviving Corporation or any of its Affiliates
(including any vacation, paid time-off and severance plans), for all purposes,
including determining eligibility to participate, level of benefits, vesting,
benefit accruals and early retirement subsidies, each Company Employee's
service with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (as well as service with
any predecessor employer of the Company or any such Subsidiary, to the extent
service with the predecessor employer is recognized by the Company or such
Subsidiary) shall be treated as service with the Surviving Corporation or its
Affiliates; provided, however, that such service need not be recognized to the
extent that such recognition would result in any duplication of benefits.

  

  

(d) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to waive any pre-
existing condition limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and
waiting periods under any welfare benefit plan maintained by the Surviving
Corporation or any of its Affiliates in which Company Employees (and their
eligible dependents) will be eligible to participate from and after the
Effective Time, except to the extent that such pre-existing condition
limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and waiting periods
would not have been satisfied or waived under the comparable Company Benefit
Plan immediately prior to the Effective Time. Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to recognize the dollar amount of all co-payments,
deductibles and similar expenses incurred by each Company Employee (and his or
her eligible dependents) during the calendar year in which the Effective Time
occurs for purposes of satisfying such year's deductible and co-payment
limitations under the relevant welfare benefit plans in which they will be
eligible to participate from and after the Effective Time.

  

  

(e) The provisions of this Section 5.04 are for the sole benefit of the
parties to this Agreement and nothing herein, expressed or implied, is
intended or shall be construed to confer upon or give to any person (including
for the avoidance of doubt any current or former employees, directors, or
independent contractors of any of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, or on or after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries), other than the parties
hereto and their respective permitted successors and assigns, any legal or
equitable or other rights or remedies with respect to the matters provided for
in this Section 5.04. Nothing contained herein shall be construed as
requiring, and the Company shall take no action that would have the effect of
requiring, Parent or the Surviving Corporation to continue any specific
employee benefit plans or to continue the employment of any specific person.
No provision in this Agreement shall modify or amend any Company Benefit Plan
or Company Benefit Agreement unless this Agreement explicitly states that the
provision "amends" such Company Benefit Plan or Company Benefit Agreement.
This shall not prevent the parties entitled to enforce this Agreement from
enforcing any provision in this Agreement, but no other party shall be
entitled to enforce any provision in this Agreement on the grounds that it is
an amendment to such Company Benefit Plan or Company Benefit Agreement. If a
party not entitled to enforce this Agreement brings a lawsuit or other action
to enforce any

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

84

  

  

provision in this Agreement as an amendment to such Company Benefit Plan or
Company Benefit Agreement and that provision is construed to be such an
amendment despite not being explicitly designated as one in this Agreement,
that provision shall lapse retroactively as of its inception, thereby
precluding it from having any amendatory effect.

  

  

SECTION 5.05. Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance. (a) All rights to
indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time and rights to advancement of
expenses relating thereto now existing in favor of any person who is, or prior
to the Effective Time becomes, or has been at any time prior to the date of
this Agreement, a director, officer, employee or agent (including as a
fiduciary with respect to an employee benefit plan) of the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective predecessors (each, an "Indemnified
Party") as provided in the Company Certificate of Incorporation, the Company
Bylaws, the organizational documents of any Subsidiary of the Company or any
indemnification agreement between such Indemnified Party and the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries (in each case, as in effect on the date hereof or
entered into after the date hereof (i) with a newly hired officer, director,
employee or agent in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice or (ii) with Parent's prior written consent, not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed, to the extent the terms thereof are no more
favorable in any material respect to the Indemnified Party that is the
beneficiary thereof than the terms of any indemnification agreement or
indemnification provisions in any Benefit Agreements included as an exhibit in
the Company Filed SEC Documents) shall survive the Merger and shall not be
amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely
affect any right thereunder of any such Indemnified Party without the consent
of such Indemnified Party.

  

  

(b) Without limiting Section 5.05(a) or any rights of any Indemnified Party
pursuant to any indemnification agreement, from and after the Effective Time,
in the event of any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation (a "Claim"), whether civil, criminal or administrative in which
any person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date of this
Agreement, or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director or officer
of the Company is or is threatened to be, made a party in his or her capacity
as a director or officer of the Company, each of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent the
Company would have been permitted to do so under applicable Law (for the
avoidance of doubt, subject to the limitations on the Company's ability to
indemnify its directors and officers under Section 145 of the DGCL), each such
Indemnified Party in his or her capacity as a director or officer of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any of their respective predecessors,
against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs, expenses (including
reasonable attorney's fees and expenses in advance of the final disposition of
any Claim to each Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted by Law
upon receipt of any undertaking in favor of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation of a type contemplated by the Company Certificate of
Incorporation), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement of or in
connection with any such threatened or actual Claim, arising out of, or
pertaining to (i) the fact that such an Indemnified Party was a

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

85

  

  

director (including in a capacity as a member of any committee of the Board of
Directors of the Company) or officer of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries
or any of their respective predecessors, or a fiduciary with respect to any
employee benefit plan maintained by any of the foregoing, prior to the
Effective Time or (ii) this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated
hereby, whether in any case asserted or arising before or after the Effective
Time. Neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall settle, compromise or
consent to the entry of any judgment in any threatened or actual Claim for
which indemnification could be sought by an Indemnified Party hereunder,
unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional
release of such Indemnified Party from all liability arising out of such Claim
or such Indemnified Party otherwise consents in writing to such settlement,
compromise or consent. Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall cooperate
with an Indemnified Party in the defense of any matter for which such
Indemnified Party could seek indemnification hereunder. Parent's and the
Surviving Corporation's obligations under this Section 5.05(b) shall continue
in full force and effect for a period of six years from the Effective Time;
provided, however, that all rights to indemnification in respect of any Claim
asserted or made within such period shall continue until the final disposition
of such Claim.

  

  

(c) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to obtain, at or prior to the
Effective Time, prepaid (or "tail") directors' and officers' liability
insurance policies, in a form reasonably acceptable to the Company, in respect
of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time for six years
from the Effective Time, covering each Indemnified Party on terms with respect
to such coverage and amounts no less favorable than those of such policies in
effect on the date of this Agreement; provided, that Parent shall not be
required to pay an aggregate premium in excess of 200% of the annual premium
paid as of the date hereof by the Company for such policies in effect on the
date of this Agreement (the "Premium Cap"); provided, further, that if
equivalent coverage cannot be obtained or can be obtained only by paying an
aggregate premium in excess of the Premium Cap, the Surviving Corporation
shall only be required to obtain as much tail coverage as can be obtained by
paying an aggregate premium equal to the Premium Cap.

  

  

(d) In the event that Parent or any of its successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other person and is not the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii)
transfers or conveys all or a substantial portion of its properties and other
assets to any person, or is dissolved, then, and in each such case, Parent
shall cause proper provision to be made so that the applicable successors and
assigns or transferees expressly assume the obligations set forth in this
Section 5.05.

  

  

(e) The provisions of this Section 5.05 are intended to be for the benefit of,
and will be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, his or her heirs and his
or her representatives, and are in addition to, and not in substitution for,
any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such person may
have by contract or otherwise. This provision of this Section 5.05 shall
survive the consummation of the Merger.

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

86

  

  

SECTION 5.06. Fees and Expenses. (a) Except as provided in Sections 5.06(b)
through (e), all fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement,
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, shall be
paid by the party incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not the Merger
is consummated.

  

  

(b) In the event that (i) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant
to Section 7.01(g), (ii) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to
Section 7.01(i) or 7.01(k), or (iii) (A) after the date of this Agreement, and
prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting, a Company Takeover Proposal shall
have been made to the Company or shall have been made directly to the
stockholders of the Company or shall have otherwise become publicly known, (B)
thereafter, this Agreement is terminated by either Parent or the Company
pursuant to Section 7.01(b)(i) (but only if the Company Stockholder Approval
has not been obtained) or by Parent pursuant to Section 7.01(c) or 7.01(e) (to
the extent such breach does not relate solely to a breach of any
representation or warranty in this Agreement) and (C) within 12 months after
such termination, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries enters into a
definitive agreement to consummate a Company Takeover Proposal, a Company
Takeover Proposal is consummated or the Company's Board of Directors
recommends a Company Takeover Proposal, then the Company shall pay to the
Buyer Entities an aggregate amount equal to $251 million (the "Company
Termination Fee") by wire transfer of same-day funds in the case of a payment
required by (1) clause (i) above, concurrently with the termination of this
Agreement, (2) clause (ii) above, on the business day following the date of
termination of this Agreement and (3) clause (iii) above, on the date of the
first to occur of the events referred to in clause (iii)(C). For purposes of
this Section 5.06(b), the term "Company Takeover Proposal" shall have the
meaning assigned to such term in Section 4.02(h), except that all references
to 20% therein shall be deemed to be references to 50%. The parties understand
and agree that in no event shall the Company be required to pay the Company
Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

  

  

(c) In the event that (i) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to
Section 7.01(h), (ii) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to
Section 7.01(j) or Section 7.01(l) or (iii) (A) after the date of this
Agreement and prior to the Parent Stockholders Meeting, a Parent Takeover
Proposal shall have been made to Parent or shall have been made directly to
the stockholders of Parent or shall have otherwise become publicly known, (B)
thereafter, this Agreement is terminated by either Parent or by the Company
pursuant to Section 7.01(b)(i) (but only if the Parent Stockholder Approval
has not been obtained) or by the Company pursuant to Section 7.01(d) or
7.01(f) (to the extent such breach does not relate solely to a breach of any
representation or warranty in this Agreement) and (C) within 12 months after
such termination, the Buyer Entities or any of their respective Subsidiaries
enter into a definitive agreement to consummate a Parent Takeover Proposal,
Parent Takeover Proposal is consummated or Parent's Board of Directors
recommends a Parent Takeover Proposal, then the Buyer Entities shall jointly
and severally pay to the Company an aggregate amount equal to $252 million
(the "Parent Termination Fee")

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

87

  

  

by wire transfer of same-day funds in the case of a payment required by (1)
clause (i) above, concurrently with the termination of this Agreement, (2)
clause (ii) above, on the business day following the date of termination of
this Agreement and (3) clause (iii) above, on the date of the first to occur
of the events referred to in clause (iii)(C). For purposes of this Section
5.06(c), the term "Parent Takeover Proposal" shall have the meaning assigned
to such term in Section 4.03(h), except that all references to 20% therein
shall be deemed to be references to 50%. The parties understand and agree that
(x) in no event shall the Buyer Entities be required to pay the Parent
Termination Fee on more than one occasion, (y) in the event the Parent Vote
Down Termination Fee has already been paid under Section 5.06(e), the Buyer
Entities shall be entitled to credit the amount of the Parent Vote Down
Termination Fee paid against the amount of the Parent Termination Fee it is
required to pay under this Section 5.06(c), and (z) in no event shall the
Buyer Entities be required to pay the Parent Termination Fee if the Funding
Failure Termination Fee has already been paid.

  

  

(d) In the event that this Agreement has been terminated by the Company
pursuant to Section 7.01(m), on the business day following such termination
the Buyer Entities shall jointly and severally pay to the Company an aggregate
amount equal to $360 million (the "Funding Failure Termination Fee") by wire
transfer of same-day funds. The parties understand and agree that (x) in no
event shall the Buyer Entities be required to pay the Funding Failure
Termination Fee on more than one occasion, and (y) in no event shall the Buyer
Entities be required to pay the Funding Failure Termination Fee if the Parent
Termination Fee or the Parent Vote Down Termination Fee has already been paid.

  

  

(e) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company
pursuant to Section 7.01(d), then the Buyer Entities shall jointly and
severally pay to the Company an aggregate amount equal to $72 million (the
"Parent Vote Down Termination Fee") by wire transfer of same-day funds on the
business day following the date of termination of this Agreement. The parties
understand and agree that (x) in no event shall the Buyer Entities be required
to pay the Parent Vote Down Termination Fee on more than one occasion and (y)
in no event shall the Buyer Entities be required to pay the Parent Vote Down
Termination Fee if the Parent Termination Fee or the Funding Failure
Termination Fee has already been paid.

  

  

(f) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the agreements contained in
this Section 5.06 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the other parties hereto
would not have entered into this Agreement. If the Company fails to pay the
Company Termination Fee pursuant to Section 5.06(b), or if Parent fails to pay
the Parent Termination Fee pursuant to Section 5.06(c), the Funding Failure
Termination Fee pursuant to Section 5.06(d) or the Parent Vote Down
Termination Fee pursuant to Section 5.06(e), in each case pursuant to this
Section 5.06 when due, and, in order to obtain such payment, any other party
hereto commences a suit that results in a judgment against such party for the
Company Termination Fee, the Parent Termination Fee, the Funding Failure
Termination Fee or the Parent Vote Down Termination Fee,

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

88

  

  

as the case may be, such party shall pay to such other party its costs and
expenses (including attorneys' fees and expenses) in connection with such
suit, together with interest on the amount of the Company Termination Fee, the
Parent Termination Fee, the Funding Failure Termination Fee or the Parent Vote
Down Termination Fee, as the case may be, from the date such payment was
required to be made until the date of payment at the prime rate of JPMorgan
Chase Bank, N.A. in effect on the date such payment was required to be made.

  

  

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if the Buyer
Entities fail to complete the Closing by the date the Closing is required to
have occurred pursuant to Section 1.02(a) (whether willfully, intentionally,
unintentionally or otherwise) or fail to perform hereunder (whether willfully,
intentionally, unintentionally or otherwise) solely as a result of a breach by
the Lenders of their obligation to make available to Parent and MergerCo the
full amount of the Financing Commitment (or if definitive agreements have been
entered into in connection with the Financing, pursuant to such definitive
agreements), then the Company's and its Affiliates' (other than Parent and its
Subsidiaries) sole and exclusive remedy (whether at law, in equity, in
contract, in tort or otherwise) against the Buyer Entities, their Affiliates,
the Lenders and their respective assignees for any breach, loss or damage
shall be to terminate this Agreement and receive payment of the Funding
Failure Termination Fee, in each case, only to the extent provided by Section
5.06(d), and none of the Buyer Parties, their Affiliates, the Lenders or their
respective assignees will have any liability or obligation to the Company or
any of its Affiliates (other than Parent and its Subsidiaries) relating to or
arising out of this Agreement or in respect of any other document or theory of
law or equity or in respect of any oral representations made or alleged to be
made in connection herewith or therewith, whether at law or equity, in
contract, in tort or otherwise. The Lenders and their affiliates are express
third party beneficiaries of this Section 5.06(g).

  

  

SECTION 5.07. Public Announcements. The Buyer Entities and the Company shall
consult with each other before issuing, and give each other the opportunity to
review and comment upon, any press release or other public statements with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the
Merger and the Financing, and shall not issue any such press release or make
any such public statement prior to such consultation, except as may be
required by applicable Law, court process or the rules and regulations of any
national securities exchange or national securities quotation system. The
parties agree that the initial press release to be issued with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be in the form heretofore
agreed to by the parties.

  

  

SECTION 5.08. Stockholder Litigation. The Company shall give the Buyer
Entities the opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any
stockholder litigation against the Company and/or its directors relating to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and no such settlement shall
be agreed to without the prior written consent of the Buyer Entities (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). The Buyer
Entities shall give the Company the opportunity to

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

89

  

  

participate in the defense or settlement of any stockholder litigation against
Parent and/or its directors relating to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and no such settlement shall be agreed to without the prior written
consent of the Company (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed).

  

  

SECTION 5.09. Financing. (a) Each of the Buyer Entities shall use, and shall
cause its Affiliates to use, reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable to arrange the Financing on the terms and conditions
described in the Financing Commitment, including using reasonable best efforts
(i) to negotiate and enter into the definitive agreements with respect thereto
on the terms and conditions contained in the Financing Commitment (or on other
terms acceptable to Parent, provided such terms do not contain any conditions
to funding on the Closing Date that are not set forth in the Financing
Commitment and would not otherwise reasonably be expected to impair or delay
the consummation of the Financing), (ii) to satisfy (or cause its Affiliates
to satisfy) on a timely basis all conditions to obtaining the Financing set
forth in the Financing Commitment and (iii) to consummate the Financing
contemplated by the Financing Commitment at or prior to the Closing, including
using its reasonable best efforts to cause the Lenders and the other persons
providing such Financing to fund the Financing required to consummate the
Merger at the Closing (including by taking enforcement action to cause such
Lenders and other persons providing such Financing to fund such Financing). In
the event that any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable on the terms
and conditions set forth in the Financing Commitment, Parent shall promptly
notify the Company, and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain, as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event, any
such portion from alternative sources ("Alternative Financing") on terms that
will still enable the Buyer Entities to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and that are approved by the Company (such
approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Parent
shall deliver to the Company true and complete copies of all agreements (other
than any fee letters and engagement letters) pursuant to which any such
alternative source shall have committed to provide Parent or the Surviving
Corporation with any portion of the Financing. Each of the Buyer Entities
shall refrain (and shall cause its Affiliates to refrain) from taking,
directly or indirectly, any action that would reasonably be expected to result
in a failure of any of the conditions contained in the Financing Commitment or
in any definitive agreement related to the Financing. None of the Buyer
Entities shall agree, without the Company's prior written consent, to or
permit any amendment, supplement or other modification of, or waive any of its
rights under, the Financing Commitment if such amendment, supplement,
modification or waiver (x) reduces the aggregate amount of the Financing or
(y) imposes new or additional conditions or otherwise expands, amends or
modifies any of the conditions to the receipt of the Financing in a manner
that would reasonably be expected to (I) delay or prevent the Closing Date,
(II) make the funding of the Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions to
obtaining the Financing) less likely to occur or (III) adversely impact the
ability of each of the Buyer Entities to enforce its rights against other
parties to the Financing Commitment or the definitive agreements relating to
the Financing. Parent shall keep the Company informed on a current basis of
the status of its efforts to obtain the Financing,

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

90

  

  

provide the Company copies of all documents related to the Financing and give
the Company prompt notice of any material breach by any party to the Financing
Commitment of which Parent becomes aware or any termination of the Financing
Commitment. The parties shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to
market the Financing concurrently with the solicitation of proxies in
connection with the Company Stockholders Meeting and the Parent Stockholders
Meeting, subject to the concurrence of the underwriters and lead arrangers
that doing so will not adversely affect the marketing of the Financing or any
debt tenders or consent solicitations, with the objective of completing the
Merger as promptly as practicable after the date of the Company Stockholders
Meeting and the Parent Stockholders Meeting.

  

  

(b) The Company shall provide, shall cause its Subsidiaries to provide and
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and their representatives
to provide such reasonable cooperation in connection with the arrangement of
the Financing as may be reasonably requested by Parent, including (i)
participation in meetings, drafting sessions, presentations, road shows and
due diligence and sessions with the financing sources, investors and rating
agencies, (ii) furnishing Parent and the financing sources as promptly as
practicable with financial and other pertinent information regarding the
Company and its Subsidiaries as may be reasonably requested by Parent to
consummate the Financing, including all financial statements and financial and
other data of the type required by Regulation S-X and Regulation S-K under the
Securities Act for registered offerings of debt securities, and of the type
and form customarily included in offering documents used in private placements
under Rule 144A of the Securities Act (including pro forma financial
information) and other documents required to satisfy any customary negative
assurance opinion, to consummate the Financing at the time or times the
Financing is to be consummated, including all of the information and data
related to the Company and its Subsidiaries necessary to satisfy the
conditions set forth in paragraphs 2, 3, 5a and 5b of Exhibit D of the
Financing Commitment and appropriate comparable information if a portion of
the Financing is consummated prior to the Closing Date (information and data
required to be delivered pursuant to this clause (ii) being referred to as the
"Required Financial Information"), (iii) assisting Parent and its financing
sources in the preparation of documents and materials (A) any offering
documents, private placement memoranda, bank information memoranda,
prospectuses and other informational and marketing materials and documents for
any portion of the Financing, (B) documents relating to the redemption of or
tender offer for the Company's 6.875% Senior Notes due 2013 (the "6.875%
Senior Notes"), (C) documents relating to the tender offer for the Company's
3.25% Convertible Senior Notes due 2015 (the "3.25% Convertible Notes"), (D)
documents relating to the redemption of or tender offer for the Company's
2.25% Convertible Senior Notes due 2024 (the "2.25% Convertible Notes" and,
together with the 3.25% Convertible Notes, the "Convertible Notes"), and (E)
materials for rating agency presentations, (iv) reasonably cooperating with
the marketing efforts of Parent and the financing sources for any portion of
the Financing, (v) executing and delivering any necessary pledge and security
documents and otherwise reasonably facilitating the granting of a security
interest (and perfection thereof) in collateral, guarantees, mortgages, other
definitive financing documents or other certificates or

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

91

  

  

documents as may reasonably be requested by the Parent; provided that no such
pledge or security document shall be effective prior to the Effective Time,
(vi) obtaining customary authorization letters with respect to the bank
information memoranda and consents of accountants for use of their reports in
any materials relating to the Financing, (vii) using reasonable best efforts
to obtain accountants' comfort letters, legal opinions, surveys and title
insurance as reasonably requested by Parent and (viii) taking all corporate
actions, subject to the occurrence of the Closing, necessary to permit the
consummation of the Financing; provided that (I) none of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries shall be required to pay any commitment or other fee, provide
any security or incur any other liability in connection with the Financing or
any Alternative Financing prior to the Effective Time, (II) such requested
cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, (III) all non-public or otherwise confidential
information regarding the Company obtained by the Buyer Entities or their
representatives pursuant to this Section 5.09(b) shall be kept confidential in
accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement, except that such information
may be disclosed to potential syndicate members during syndication, other
potential Lenders or potential participants, subject to customary
confidentiality undertakings by such potential syndicate members, other
potential Lenders or potential participants, and except as may be permitted by
applicable securities and other laws (to the extent such party is advised by
counsel that such disclosure is so required), and (IV) the Company shall be
permitted a reasonable period to comment on any documents or other information
circulated to potential financing sources that contain or are based upon any
such non-public or other confidential information. Parent (x) shall, promptly
upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company for all reasonable out-of-
pocket costs (including reasonable attorney's fees) incurred by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries in connection with such cooperation, (y) acknowledges
and agrees that the Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective
representatives shall not have any responsibility for, or incur any liability
to any person prior to the Effective Time under, the Financing or any
Alternative Financing and (z) shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company,
its Subsidiaries and their respective representatives from and against any and
all losses, damages, claims, costs or expenses suffered or incurred by them in
connection with the arrangement of the Financing and any information utilized
in connection therewith.

  

  

(c) For the avoidance of doubt, the Buyer Entities acknowledge that, subject
to the conditions set forth herein and compliance by the Company with its
obligations under Section 5.09(b), the Buyer Entities' obligations to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement on the terms set
forth herein are not conditioned upon the availability or consummation of the
Financing or receipt of the proceeds therefrom and reaffirm their obligation
to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement irrespective and
independently of the availability of the Financing or any Alternative
Financing, subject to Section 5.06(g), Section 8.10(b) and the applicable
conditions set forth in Sections 6.01 and 6.02.

  

  

SECTION 5.10. Stock Exchange Listing. Parent shall take all actions necessary
to cause the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in the Merger to be

party knows is reasonably likely to prevent such qualification and (ii)

efforts to obtain the tax opinions described in Sections 6.02(c) and 6.03(c),

hereto as Exhibit B at such time or times as may reasonably be requested by
such law firms, including the date on which the Form S-4 is filed and the
Closing Date. The Company and the Buyer Entities shall each use its reasonable
best efforts not to take or cause to be taken any action that would cause to
be untrue (or fail to take or cause not to be taken any action which inaction
would cause to be untrue) any of the representations included in the
certificates described in this Section 5.12(b).

(m) by the Company, in the event that the Marketing Period has ended and all
of the conditions set forth in Section 6.01 and 6.02 have been satisfied
(other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the
Closing), and Parent and MergerCo have failed to complete the Closing by the
date the Closing is required to have occurred pursuant to Section 1.02(a) as a
result of a breach by the Lenders of their obligations to make available to
Parent and MergerCo the full amount of the Financing Commitment (or if
definitive agreements have been entered into in connection with the Financing,
pursuant to such definitive agreements).

  

  

SECTION 7.02. Effect of Termination. In the event of termination of this
Agreement by either the Company or Parent as provided in Section 7.01, this
Agreement shall forthwith become void and have no effect, without any
liability or obligation on the part of the Company, either Buyer Entity or the
Lenders (or any of their respective Affiliates, officers, directors, employees
or controlling persons), other than the provisions of Section 3.01(w) (Brokers
and Other Advisors), Section 3.02(w) (Brokers and Other Advisors), the last
sentence of Section 5.02 (Access to Information; Confidentiality), Section
5.06 (Fees and Expenses), clause (III) and the last sentence of Section
5.09(b) (Financing), this Section 7.02 and Article VIII, which provisions
shall survive such termination; provided, however, that, subject to such
provisions, any such termination shall not relieve the Company or either Buyer
Entity from liability for any willful and material breach hereof prior to such
termination or relieve any Lenders from any liability to the Buyer Entities
under the Financing Commitments. For purposes of this Agreement, "willful and
material breach" shall mean a material breach or failure to perform an
obligation or agreement that is a consequence of an act undertaken by the
breaching party with the actual knowledge that the taking of such act would,
or would reasonably be expected to, cause a material breach of this Agreement.
The Lenders and their Affiliates shall be express third party beneficiaries of
this Section 7.02.

  

  

SECTION 7.03. Amendment. This Agreement may be amended by the Company and the
Buyer Entities at any time before or after receipt of the Company Stockholder
Approval or the Parent Stockholder Approval; provided, however, that after
such approval has been obtained, there shall be made no amendment that by Law
requires further approval by the stockholders of the Company or Parent without
such approval having been obtained. This Agreement may not be amended except
by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto.

  

  

SECTION 7.04. Extension; Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the
parties may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations
or

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

100

  

  

other acts of the other parties, (b) to the extent permitted by Law, waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained herein or in any
document delivered pursuant hereto or (c) subject to the proviso to the first
sentence of Section 7.03 and to the extent permitted by Law, waive compliance
with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein. Any agreement on
the part of a party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set
forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. The failure
of any party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this
Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such rights.

  

  

SECTION 7.05. Procedure for Termination or Amendment. A termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 7.01 or an amendment of this Agreement pursuant
to Section 7.03 shall, in order to be effective, require, in the case of
MergerCo and the Company, action by its Board of Directors or, with respect to
any amendment of this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.03, the duly authorized
committee of its Board of Directors to the extent permitted by Law.
Termination of this Agreement prior to the Effective Time shall not require
the approval of the stockholders of either Parent or the Company.

Agreement. Whenever reference is made to "the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement" such language shall be deemed to include, solely in the
context of any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or other
obligation of either Buyer Entity hereunder, the Financing. The word "or" when
used in this Agreement is not exclusive. All terms defined in this Agreement

SECTION 8.05. Consents and Approvals. For any matter under this Agreement
requiring the consent or approval of any party to be valid and binding on the
parties hereto, such consent or approval must be in writing.

  

  

SECTION 8.06. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts (including by facsimile or other electronic transmission), all of
which shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become
effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the
parties and delivered to the other parties.

  

  

SECTION 8.07. Entire Agreement; Third-Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement (a)
together with the Confidentiality Agreement (other than Sections 3, 8(a)
(solely to the extent inconsistent with any provision of this Agreement,
including Section 5.03 hereof) and 9 thereof), constitutes the entire
agreement, and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both
written and oral, among the parties and their affiliates with respect to the
subject matter hereof and thereof, it being understood that the
Confidentiality Agreement (other than Sections 3, 8(a) (solely to the extent
inconsistent with any provision of this Agreement, including Section 5.03
hereof) and 9 thereof) shall survive the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, and (b) except, from and after the Effective Time, for Sections
2.02(c) and 5.05, is not intended to confer upon any person other than the
parties hereto any legal or equitable rights. Notwithstanding

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

106

  

  

the foregoing clause (b), the Lenders and their Affiliates shall be express
third party beneficiaries of Sections 5.06(g), 7.02 and 8.12.

  

  

SECTION 8.08. GOVERNING LAW. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND
CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE, REGARDLESS OF
THE LAWS THAT MIGHT OTHERWISE GOVERN UNDER APPLICABLE PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS
OF LAWS THEREOF.

  

  

SECTION 8.09. Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by
operation of law or otherwise by any of the parties without the prior written
consent of the other parties, and any assignment without such consent shall be
null and void, provided, however, that the Buyer Entities may assign any or
all of their rights and obligations under this Agreement to any wholly owned
Subsidiary of Parent (except that no such assignment shall relieve either
Buyer Entity of its obligations hereunder), providedfurther, that on and after
the Closing Date, each of the Buyer Entities may assign all of its rights
hereunder to its Lenders and debt providers for collateral security purposes
only. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon,
inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties and their
respective successors and assigns.

  

  

SECTION 8.10. Specific Enforcement; Consent to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury
Trial. (a) The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur and that the
parties would not have any adequate remedy at law in the event that any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached and it is accordingly agreed that
the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement (including the parties' obligation to consummate
the Merger and the Buyer Entities' obligation to pay the aggregate Merger
Consideration and enforce their rights under the Financing Commitment), in
each case, in accordance with this Section 8.10 in the Delaware Court of
Chancery or any Federal court sitting in the State of Delaware, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.

  

  

(b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, it is acknowledged and
agreed that the Company shall be entitled to seek specific performance of
Parent's and MergerCo's obligations to consummate the Merger only in the event
that each of the following conditions has been satisfied: (i) the Marketing
Period has ended and all of the conditions set forth in Section 6.01 and 6.02
have been satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that by their
nature are to be satisfied or waived at the Closing), (ii) Parent and MergerCo
fail to complete the Closing by the date the Closing is required to have
occurred pursuant to Section 1.02(a), (iii) the Lenders have not breached
their obligations to make available to Parent and MergerCo the full amount of
the Financing Commitment pursuant to the terms thereof (or if definitive
agreements have been entered into in connection with the Financing, pursuant
to such definitive agreements), and (iv) the Company has

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

107

  

  

confirmed in a written notice delivered to Parent that if specific performance
is granted and the Financing is funded, then the Closing will occur. For the
avoidance of doubt, while the Company may pursue both a grant of specific
performance as and only to the extent expressly permitted by this Section 8.10
and the payment of the Funding Failure Termination Fee (only to the extent
expressly permitted by Section 5.06), under no circumstances shall the Company
be permitted or entitled to receive both such grant of specific performance
and payment of the Funding Failure Termination Fee.

  

  

(c) Each of the parties hereto (i) consents to submit itself to the exclusive
personal jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of Chancery and any Federal court
sitting in the State of Delaware in the event any dispute arises out of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) agrees that
it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or
other request for leave from any such court and (iii) agrees that it will not
bring any action relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement in any court other than the Delaware Court of Chancery (or,
if the Delaware Court of Chancery shall be unavailable, any other court of the
State of Delaware or any Federal court sitting in the State of Delaware).

  

  

(d) EACH PARTY HERETO IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW, ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING
DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE
MERGER OR THE OTHER TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

  

  

SECTION 8.11. Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect. Upon such determination that any
term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced,
the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so
as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law in an acceptable manner to the end
that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent
possible.

  

  

SECTION 8.12. Covered Claims. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, each of the parties hereto agrees that (i) any claim, suit,
action or proceeding of any kind or description, whether in law or in equity,
whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against the Lenders or any
affiliate thereof arising out of or relating to (x) the Financing Commitment,
any of the transactions contemplated by the Financing Commitment or the
performance of services thereunder and (y) this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (each of the foregoing, a "Covered
Claim"), shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Supreme Court
of the State of New York, County of New York, or, if under applicable law
exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the federal courts, the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York (and appellate courts
thereof) and (ii) that it will not bring any Covered Claim, or permit any of
its affiliates to bring any Covered Claim in any

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

108

  

  

forum other than the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New
York, or, if under applicable law exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the
federal courts, the United States District Court for the Southern District of
New York (and appellate courts thereof). Each of the parties hereto agrees
that, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, such party
irrevocably waives any right to trial by jury in any Covered Claim. The
Lenders and their affiliates are express third party beneficiaries of this
Section 8.12.

MASSEY ENERGY COMPANY

  

  


 

  

I, THE UNDERSIGNED, in order to form a corporation for the purposes
hereinafter stated, under and pursuant to the provisions of the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, do hereby certify as follows:

  

FIRST: The name of the corporation is Massey Energy Company (hereinafter
referred to as the "Corporation").

  

SECOND: The registered office of the Corporation is to be located at 1209
Orange Street, in the City of Wilmington, in the County of New Castle, in the

authorized to issue is one thousand one hundred (1,100) shares of stock. One
thousand (1000) shares shall be designated common stock ("Common Stock"). One
hundred (100) shares shall be designated preferred stock ("Preferred Stock"),
all of which are presently undesignated to a series. The Board of Directors of
the Corporation is hereby authorized from time to time to provide by
resolution for the issuance of shares of Preferred Stock in one or more series
not exceeding the aggregate number of shares of Preferred Stock authorized by
this Certificate of Incorporation, as amended from time to time; and to
determine with respect to each such series the voting powers, if any (which
voting powers if granted may be full or limited), designations,

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

  

preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special rights, and
the qualifications, limitations or restrictions relating thereto; including
without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the voting rights relating
to shares of Preferred Stock of any series (which may be one or more votes per
share or a fraction of a vote per share, which may vary over time and which
may be applicable generally or only upon the happening and continuance of
stated events or conditions), the rate of dividend to which holders of
Preferred Stock of any series may be entitled (which may be cumulative or
noncumulative), the rights of holders of Preferred Stock of any series in the
event of liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the
Corporation, the rights, if any, of holders of Preferred Stock of any series
to convert or exchange such shares of Preferred Stock of such series for
shares of any other class or series of capital stock or for any other
securities, property or assets of the Corporation or any subsidiary (including
the determination of the price or prices or the rate or rates applicable to
such rights to convert or exchange and the adjustment thereof, the time or
times during which the right to convert or exchange shall be applicable and
the time or times during which a particular price or rate shall be
applicable), whether or not the shares of that series shall be redeemable,
and, if so, the terms and conditions of such redemption, including the date or
dates upon or after which they shall be redeemable, and the amount per share
payable in case of redemption, which amount may vary under different
conditions and at different redemption dates, and whether any shares of that
series shall be redeemed pursuant to a retirement or sinking fund or otherwise
and the terms and conditions of such obligation.

  

Each share of Preferred Stock shall have a par value of $0.01 and each share
of Common Stock shall have a par value of $0.01.

  

FIFTH: The name and address of the incorporator is as follows:

  

Kenneth Blazejewski

  

c/o Cleary Gottlieb Steen and Hamilton LLP

  

One Liberty Plaza

  

New York, NY 10006

  

SIXTH: The following provisions are inserted for the management of the
business and for the conduct of the affairs of the Corporation, and for
further definition, limitation and regulation of the powers of the Corporation
and of its directors and stockholders:

  

(1) The number of directors of the Corporation shall be such as from time to
time shall be fixed by, or in the manner provided in, the by-laws. Election of
directors need not be by ballot unless the by-laws so provide.

  

(2) The Board of Directors shall have powers without the assent or vote of the
stockholders to make, alter, amend, change, add to or repeal the by-laws of
the Corporation; to fix and vary the amount to be reserved for any proper
purpose; to authorize and cause to be executed mortgages and liens upon all or
any part of the property of the Corporation; to determine the use and
disposition of any surplus or net profits; and to fix the times for the
declaration and payment of dividends.

  

(3) The directors in their discretion may submit any contract or act for
approval or ratification at any annual meeting of the stockholders or at any
meeting of the stockholders called for the purpose of considering any such act
or contract, and any contract or act that shall be approved or be ratified by
the vote of the holders of a majority of the stock of the Corporation which is
represented in person or by proxy at such meeting and entitled to vote thereat
(provided that a lawful quorum of stockholders be there represented in person
or by proxy) shall be as valid and as binding upon the Corporation and upon
all the stockholders as though it had been approved or ratified by every
stockholder of the Corporation, whether or not

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

  

the contract or act would otherwise be open to legal attack because of
directors' interest, or for any other reason.

  

(4) In addition to the powers and authorities hereinbefore or by statute
expressly conferred upon them, the directors are hereby empowered to exercise
all such powers and do all such acts and things as may be exercised or done by
the Corporation; subject, nevertheless, to the provisions of the statutes of
Delaware, of this certificate, and to any by-laws from time to time made by
the stockholders; provided, however, that no by-laws so made shall invalidate
any prior act of the directors which would have been valid if such by-law had
not been made.

  

SEVENTH: Each person who was or is made a party or is threatened to be made a
party to or is involved in any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative (hereinafter a "proceeding"), by
reason of the fact that he or she, or a person of whom he or she is the legal
representative, is or was a director or officer of the Corporation or is or
was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee
or agent of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust or
other enterprise, including service with respect to employee benefit plans,
whether the basis of such proceeding is alleged action in an official capacity
as a director, officer, employee or agent or in any other capacity while
serving as a director, officer, employee or agent, shall be indemnified and
held harmless by the Corporation to the fullest extent authorized by the
Delaware General Corporation Law, as the same exists or may hereafter be
amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the extent that such
amendment permits the Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights
than said law permitted the Corporation to provide prior to such amendment),
against all expense, liability and loss (including attorneys\' fees,
judgments, fines,

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

  

ERISA excise taxes or penalties and amounts paid or to be paid in settlement)
reasonably incurred or suffered by such person in connection therewith and
such indemnification shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a
director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of his or
her heirs, executors and administrators; provided, however, that, except as
provided in paragraph (1) hereof, the Corporation shall indemnify any such
person seeking indemnification in connection with a proceeding (or part
thereof) initiated by such person only if such proceeding (or part thereof)
was authorized by the Board of Directors of the Corporation. The right to
indemnification conferred in this Article shall be a contract right and shall
include the right to be paid by the Corporation the expenses incurred in
defending any such proceeding in advance of its final disposition; provided,
however, that, if the Delaware General Corporation Law requires, the payment
of such expenses incurred by a director or officer in his or her capacity as a
director or officer (and not in any other capacity in which service was or is
rendered by such person while a director or officer, including, without
limitation, service to an employee benefit plan) in advance of the final
disposition of a proceeding, shall be made only upon delivery to the
Corporation of an undertaking, by or on behalf of such director or officer, to
repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined that such
director or officer is not entitled to be indemnified under this Article or
otherwise. The Corporation may, by action of its Board of Directors, provide
indemnification to employees and agents of the Corporation with the same scope
and effect as the foregoing indemnification of directors and officers.

  

(1) If a claim under the foregoing paragraph is not paid in full by the
Corporation within thirty days after a written claim has been received by the
Corporation, the claimant may at any time thereafter bring suit against the
Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim and, if successful in
whole or in part, the claimant shall be entitled to be

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

  

paid also the expense of prosecuting such claim. It shall be a defense to any
such action (other than an action brought to enforce a claim for expenses
incurred in defending any proceeding in advance of its final disposition where
the required undertaking, if any is required, has been tendered to the
Corporation) that the claimant has not met the standards of conduct which make
it permissible under the Delaware General Corporation Law for the Corporation
to indemnify the claimant for the amount claimed, but the burden of proving
such defense shall be on the Corporation. Neither the failure of the
Corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel, or
its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of
such action that indemnification of the claimant is proper in the
circumstances because he or she has met the applicable standard of conduct set
forth in the Delaware General Corporation Law, nor an actual determination by
the Corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel,
or its stockholders) that the claimant has not met such applicable standard of
conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that the
claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct.

  

(2) The right to indemnification and the payment of expenses incurred in
defending a proceeding in advance of its final disposition conferred in this
Article shall not be exclusive of any other right which any person may have or
hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of the Restated Certificate of
Incorporation, bylaw, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested
directors or otherwise.

  

(3) The Corporation may maintain insurance, at its expense, to protect itself
and any director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation or another
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any
such expense, liability or loss, whether or not

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

  

the Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such
expense, liability or loss under the Delaware General Corporation Law.

  

EIGHTH: Whenever a compromise or arrangement is proposed between the
Corporation and its creditors or any class of them and/or between the
Corporation and its stockholders or any class of them, any court of equitable
jurisdiction within the State of Delaware, may, on the application in a
summary way of the Corporation or of any creditor or stockholder thereof or on
the application of any receiver or receivers appointed for the Corporation
under the provisions of section 291 of Title 8 of the Delaware Code or on the
application of trustees in dissolution or of any receiver or receivers
appointed for the Corporation under the provisions of section 279 of Title 8
of the Delaware Code order a meeting of the creditors or class of creditors,
and/or of the stockholders or class of stockholders of the Corporation, as the
case may be, to be summoned in such manner as the said court directs. If a
majority in number representing three-fourths in value of the creditors or
class of creditors, and/or of the stockholders or class of stockholders of the
Corporation, as the case may be, agree to any compromise or arrangement and to
any reorganization of the Corporation as consequence of such compromise or
arrangement, the said compromise or arrangement and the said reorganization
shall, if sanctioned by the court to which the said application has been made,
be binding on all the creditors or class of creditors, and/or on all the
stockholders or class of stockholders, of the Corporation, as the case may be,
and also on the Corporation.

  

NINTH: The Corporation reserves the right to amend, alter, change or repeal
any provision contained in this certificate of incorporation in the manner now
or hereafter prescribed by law, and all rights and powers conferred herein on
stockholders, directors and officers are subject to this reserved power.

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

  

TENTH: To the fullest extent permitted by the Delaware General

  

Corporation Law, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended, a director of
the Corporation shall not be personally liable to the Corporation or its
stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director.

Representations Relating to the Tax Treatment of the Merger

  

  

Ladies and Gentlemen:

  

  

The undersigned, an officer of [Parent], a Delaware corporation ("Parent"), is
making the representations in this letter on behalf of Parent in connection
with the opinions to be delivered pursuant to Sections 6.02(c) and 6.03(c) of
the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of [*], 2011 (the "Merger
Agreement"), among Parent, [Company], a Delaware corporation ("Company") and
[MOUNTAIN MERGER SUB, INC.], a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned
subsidiary of Parent ("MergerCo"), and in connection with the filing with the
Securities and Exchange Commission of the registration statement on Form S-4
(the "Registration Statement"), each as amended or supplemented through the
date hereof.

  

  

Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, MergerCo shall be merged with and into
Company (the "Merger") with Company surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of
Parent. Alternatively, if the direction of the Merger is reversed pursuant to
section 2.01(d) of the Merger Agreement (the "Restructuring"), Company shall
be merged with and into MergerCo with MergerCo continuing as the surviving
entity, which may be a limited liability company if Parent so elects (such
entity, "Surviving Entity"). Capitalized terms used but not defined herein
shall have the meaning given to such terms in the Merger Agreement. All
Section references are to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended,
unless otherwise noted.

  

  

The undersigned, after due inquiry and investigation, hereby certifies and
represents on behalf of Parent as follows:

  

  

1. The facts relating to the Merger as described in the Merger Agreement, the Registration Statement and the other documents described in the Registration Statement are, insofar as those facts pertain to Parent and its subsidiaries, true, correct and complete in all material respects. The Merger will be consummated in

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

2

  

  

accordance with the Merger Agreement (without waiver or modification of any
provisions thereof) and the descriptions contained in the Registration
Statement. Other than those described or referenced in the Merger Agreement
and the Registration Statement, there are no agreements, arrangements or
understandings, either written or oral, between or among (a) any of Parent,
its affiliates or shareholders, on the one hand, and (b) any of Company, its
affiliates or shareholders on the other hand, concerning the Merger or
otherwise.

  

  

2. Unless a Restructuring occurs, shares of Company stock representing at least 80 percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of Company stock entitled to vote and at least 80 percent of the total number of shares of all other classes of Company stock will be exchanged solely for Parent voting stock pursuant to the Merger. For purposes of this representation, shares of Company stock exchanged for cash or other property provided, directly or indirectly, by Parent (including cash paid to dissenting stockholders) will be treated as outstanding Company stock on the Closing Date.

  

  

3. At least 40 percent of the aggregate consideration received by Company shareholders in the Merger will be comprised of Parent common stock (based on the fair market value of Parent common stock on the business day before the Merger Agreement was executed). For purposes of this representation, the aggregate consideration shall include payments, if any, made to dissenters in connection with the Merger.

  

  

4. Cash payments to be made to Company shareholders in lieu of fractional shares of Parent stock that would otherwise be issued to such holders in the Merger will be made solely for the purpose of saving Parent the expense and inconvenience of issuing and transferring fractional shares of Parent stock and will not represent separately bargained-for consideration. To the knowledge of Parent, the total cash consideration that will be paid in the Merger to holders of Company stock in lieu of fractional shares of Parent stock will not exceed one percent of the total consideration that will be issued in the Merger to Company shareholders. No Company shareholder, with the possible exception of shareholders whose holdings are in multiple accounts or with multiple brokers, will receive cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent stock in an amount equal to or greater than the value of one full share of Parent stock.

  

  

5. The fair market value of Parent stock and other consideration received by each Company shareholder will be approximately equal to the fair market value of Company stock surrendered in the exchange, as determined by arm's-length negotiations between the respective managements of Parent and Company.

  

  

6. None of the Parent stock that will be received in connection with the Merger by any Company employee or independent contractor who is also a shareholder of Company represents separately bargained-for consideration that is allocable to the performance of any services. The compensation paid to any Company employee or independent contractor who is also a shareholder of Company will be for 

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

3

  

  

services actually rendered (or to be rendered) and has been or will be
determined by bargaining at arm's length.

  

  

7. Except for expenses directly related to the Merger within the guidelines set forth in Revenue Ruling 73-54, 1973-1 C.B. 187, (i) Parent, MergerCo, Company and the shareholders of Company will pay their respective expenses, if any, incurred in connection with the Merger, and (ii) neither Parent nor MergerCo has agreed to assume, nor will it directly or indirectly assume, any expense or other liability, whether fixed or contingent, of any shareholder of Company, nor, for the avoidance of doubt, will Company stock be subject to any such liability.

  

  

8. To the knowledge of Parent, Company's liabilities were incurred by Company in the ordinary course of its business.

  

  

9. Parent has no plan or intention to make any distributions after, but in connection with, the Merger to holders of Parent stock, other than dividends paid in the ordinary course of business.

  

  

10. Neither Parent nor, to the knowledge of Parent, any person related to Parent within the meaning of Section 1.368-1(e)(3) of the Treasury Regulations has any plan or intention to reacquire or redeem any of its stock issued in the transaction, either directly or indirectly through any transaction, agreement or arrangement with any other person (including by derivative transactions such as equity swaps which would have the economic effect of an acquisition), except in connection with any plan or intention to purchase stock on the open market as part of a repurchase program consistent with Revenue Ruling 99-58, 1999-2 C.B. 701. For purposes of this representation, a person is considered to own or acquire stock owned or acquired (as the case may be) by a partnership in which such person is a partner in proportion to such person's interest in the partnership.

  

  

11. Following the Merger, Company (or Surviving Entity, as applicable) will continue to conduct Company's coal business in a manner substantially similar to Company's conduct of that business prior to the Merger.

  

  

12. At all times during MergerCo's existence, Parent has directly owned all of the stock of MergerCo, and Parent will continue to own all such stock until the Merger. MergerCo is a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Parent that was formed solely to effectuate the Merger. MergerCo (i) has not held and will not hold, at any time prior to the Merger, any assets (other than cash contributed by Parent upon incorporation) and (ii) has not conducted, and will not conduct at any time prior to the Merger, any business activities or other operations of any kind, other than any activities in connection with the Merger.

  

  

13. In the Merger, MergerCo will have no liabilities assumed by Company and will not transfer to Company any assets subject to liabilities.

  

  

14. Parent will have control of Company immediately after the Merger. Parent has no plan or intention to, following the Merger, (i) cause or allow Company to 

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

4

  

  

issue additional shares of stock to any person other than Parent or (ii) take
any other action (including issuing any rights to acquire stock in Company or
transferring stock in Company to any other person) that could result in Parent
losing control of Company. For purposes of this representation, "control"
means ownership of at least 80 percent of the total combined voting power of
all classes of stock entitled to vote and at least 80 percent of the total
number of shares of each other class of stock. For purposes of this
representation, all references to "Company" shall be deemed to refer to
"Surviving Entity" in the case of a Restructuring.

  

  

15. After the Merger, Company will hold (i) to the knowledge of Parent, at least 90 percent of the fair market value of the net assets and at least 70 percent of the fair market value of the gross assets held by Company immediately prior to the Merger and (ii) at least 90 percent of the fair market value of the net assets and at least 70 percent of the fair market value of the gross assets held by MergerCo immediately prior to the Merger. Alternatively, if a Restructuring occurs, to the knowledge of Parent, MergerCo will acquire at least 90 percent of the fair market value of the net assets and at least 70 percent of the fair market value of the gross assets held by Company immediately prior to the Merger. For purposes of this representation, the following amounts will be treated as assets of Company or MergerCo, as applicable, held immediately prior to the Merger: amounts, if any (i) used (or to be used) by Company or MergerCo to pay Merger expenses, (ii) paid (or to be paid) by Company or MergerCo to holders of shares of Company stock in lieu of fractional shares or pursuant to the exercise of dissenters' rights under applicable laws, (iii) paid (or to be paid) by Company or MergerCo to redeem stock, securities, warrants, or options of Company as part of any overall plan of which the Merger is a part, and (iv) distributed (or to be distributed) by Company or MergerCo to the holders of Company stock (except for regular, normal dividends) as part of any overall plan of which the Merger is a part. Any dispositions of assets held by Company or MergerCo prior to the Merger which were made in contemplation of, or as part of, the Merger will be for fair market value, and the proceeds thereof will be retained by Company.

  

  

16. Parent has no plan or intention to (i) liquidate Company, (ii) merge Company with or into another corporation or other entity, (iii) otherwise dispose of the stock of Company, or (iv) cause Company to sell or otherwise dispose of any of the assets of Company acquired in the Merger, except for dispositions made in the ordinary course of business or transfers permitted by both Section 368(a)(2)(C) and Section 1.368-2(k) of the Treasury Regulations. For purposes of this representation, all references to "Company" shall be deemed to refer to "Surviving Entity" in the case of a Restructuring.

  

  

17. At the Effective Time, the fair market value of the assets of Parent will exceed the sum of its liabilities, plus the amount of liabilities, if any, to which those assets are subject.

  

  

18. Neither Parent nor any of its subsidiaries owns or has owned within the last five years, directly or indirectly, more than 2,000 shares of stock or any debt securities of Company or any of its subsidiaries or any instrument giving the holder the right to acquire any such stock or debt securities.

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

5

  

  

19. The Merger is being undertaken for purposes of enhancing the business of Parent and for other good and valid business purposes of Parent.

  

  

20. There is no intercorporate indebtedness existing between Parent or any of its subsidiaries, on the one hand, and Company or any of its subsidiaries, on the other hand, that was issued, acquired, or will be settled at a discount.

  

  

21. Neither Parent nor MergerCo is under the jurisdiction of a court in a case under Title 11 of the United States Code or under any receivership, foreclosure or similar proceeding.

  

  

22. Neither Parent nor MergerCo is an investment company as defined in Sections 368(a)(2)(F)(iii) and (iv).

  

  

23. Neither Parent nor MergerCo has taken, agreed to take or failed to take any action, and does not know of any fact, agreement, plan or other circumstance the result of which is reasonably likely, in the aggregate, to prevent the Merger from qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a).

  

  

24. Neither Parent nor MergerCo (or Surviving Entity, as applicable) will take any position on any Federal, state or local income or franchise tax return, or take any other tax reporting position, that is inconsistent with the treatment of the Merger as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code or any representations or certifications herein, unless otherwise required by a "determination" (as defined in Section 1313(a)(1) of the Code) or by applicable state or local tax law (and then only to the extent required by such applicable state or local tax law).

  

  

25. The undersigned is authorized to make all the representations set forth herein on behalf of Parent, MergerCo and the management thereof.

  

  

The undersigned acknowledges that (i) your opinion will be based on the
accuracy of the representations set forth herein and on the accuracy of the
representations and warranties and the satisfaction of the covenants and
obligations contained in the Merger Agreement and the various other documents
related thereto, and (ii) your opinion will be subject to certain limitations
and qualifications, including that it may not be relied upon if any such
representations or warranties are not accurate or if any of such covenants or
obligations are not satisfied in all material respects. The undersigned
further represents that, for purposes of rendering your opinion, you may
consider each of the representations contained herein to be true, correct and
complete without regard to any knowledge qualification.

Very truly yours,

Representations Relating to the Tax Treatment of the Merger

  

  

Ladies and Gentlemen:

  

  

The undersigned, an officer of [Company], a Delaware corporation ("Company"),

connection with the opinions to be delivered pursuant to Sections 6.02(c) and
6.03(c) of the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of [*], 2011 (the "Merger
Agreement"), among [Parent], a Delaware corporation ("Parent"), Company and
[MOUNTAIN MERGER SUB, INC.], a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned
subsidiary of Parent ("MergerCo"), and in connection with the filing with the
Securities and Exchange Commission of the registration statement on Form S-4
(the "Registration Statement"), each as amended or supplemented through the
date hereof.

  

  

Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, MergerCo shall be merged with and into
Company (the "Merger") with Company surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of
Parent. Alternatively, if the direction of the Merger is reversed pursuant to
section 2.01(d) of the Merger Agreement (the "Restructuring"), Company shall
be merged with and into MergerCo with MergerCo continuing as the surviving
entity, which may be a limited liability company if Parent so elects (such
entity, "Surviving Entity"). Capitalized terms used but not defined herein
shall have the meaning given to such terms in the Merger Agreement. All
Section references are to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended,
unless otherwise noted.

  

  

The undersigned, after due inquiry and investigation, hereby certifies and
represents on behalf of Company as follows:

  

  

1. The facts relating to the Merger as described in the Merger Agreement, the Registration Statement and the other documents described in the Registration Statement are, insofar as those facts pertain to Company, true, correct and complete in all material respects. The Merger will be consummated in accordance with 

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

2

  

  

the Merger Agreement (without waiver or modification of any provisions
thereof) and the descriptions contained in the Registration Statement. Other
than those described or referenced in the Merger Agreement and the
Registration Statement, there are no agreements, arrangements or
understandings, either written or oral, between or among (a) any of Company,
its affiliates or shareholders, on the one hand, and (b) any of Parent, its
affiliates or shareholders on the other hand, concerning the Merger or
otherwise.

  

  

2. All the outstanding shares of Company stock as of the date hereof consist of [103,300,348] shares of common stock, all of which are entitled to vote in elections of the Board of Directors. Company has not treated any other right or instrument, including any debt instrument, warrant, option or convertible security, as equity for U.S. Federal income tax purposes.

  

  

3. Unless a Restructuring occurs, shares of Company stock representing at least 80 percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of Company stock entitled to vote and at least 80 percent of the total number of shares of all other classes of Company stock will be exchanged solely for Parent voting stock pursuant to the Merger. For purposes of this representation, shares of Company stock exchanged for cash or other property provided, directly or indirectly, by Parent (including cash paid to dissenting stockholders) will be treated as outstanding Company stock on the Closing Date.

  

  

4. At least 40 percent of the aggregate consideration received by Company shareholders in the Merger will be comprised of Parent common stock (based on the fair market value of Parent common stock on the business day before the Merger Agreement was executed). For purposes of this representation, the aggregate consideration shall include payments, if any, made to dissenters in connection with the Merger.

  

  

5. Cash payments to be made to Company shareholders in lieu of fractional shares of Parent stock that would otherwise be issued to such holders in the Merger will be made solely for the purpose of saving Parent the expense and inconvenience of issuing and transferring fractional shares of Parent stock and will not represent separately bargained-for consideration. To the knowledge of Company, the total cash consideration that will be paid in the Merger to holders of Company stock in lieu of fractional shares of Parent stock will not exceed one percent of the total consideration that will be issued in the Merger to Company shareholders. No Company shareholder, with the possible exception of shareholders whose holdings are in multiple accounts or with multiple brokers, will receive cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent stock in an amount equal to or greater than the value of one full share of Parent stock.

  

  

6. The fair market value of Parent stock and other consideration received by each Company shareholder will be approximately equal to the fair market value of Company stock surrendered in the exchange, as determined by arm's-length negotiations between the respective managements of Parent and Company.

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

3

  

  

7. None of the compensation received (or to be received) by any Company employee or independent contractor who is also a shareholder of Company (including pursuant to any consulting agreement) represents separate consideration for, or is allocable to, any of their Company stock. None of the Parent stock that will be received in connection with the Merger by any Company employee or independent contractor who is also a shareholder of Company represents separately bargained-for consideration that is allocable to the performance of any services. The compensation paid to any Company employee or independent contractor who is also a shareholder of Company will be for services actually rendered (or to be rendered) and has been or will be determined by bargaining at arm's length.

  

  

8. Except for expenses directly related to the Merger within the guidelines set forth in Revenue Ruling 73-54, 1973-1 C.B. 187, (i) Parent, MergerCo, Company and the shareholders of Company will pay their respective expenses, if any, incurred in connection with the Merger, and (ii) to the knowledge of Company, neither Parent nor MergerCo has agreed to assume, nor will it directly or indirectly assume, any expense or other liability, whether fixed or contingent, of any shareholder of Company, nor, for the avoidance of doubt, will Company stock be subject to any such liability.

  

  

9. Company's liabilities were incurred by Company in the ordinary course of its business.

  

  

10. Company has not made, and does not have any plan or intention to make, any distributions prior to, in contemplation of or otherwise in connection with, the Merger to holders of Company's stock, other than dividends paid in the ordinary course of business.

  

  

11. Neither Company nor, to the knowledge of Company, any person related to Company within the meaning of Section 1.368-1(e)(3) of the Treasury Regulations has, either directly or indirectly through any transaction, agreement or arrangement with any other person (including by derivative transactions such as equity swaps which would have the economic effect of an acquisition), redeemed or acquired or has any plan or intention to redeem or acquire any Company stock in contemplation of the Merger, or otherwise as part of a plan of which the Merger is a part. For purposes of this representation, a person is considered to own or acquire stock owned or acquired (as the case may be) by a partnership in which such person is a partner in proportion to such person's interest in the partnership.

  

  

12. To the knowledge of Company, there is no plan or intention by the shareholders of Company to directly or indirectly sell (or otherwise transfer ownership) to Parent or any person related to Parent within the meaning of Section 1.368-1(e)(3) of the Treasury Regulations any Parent stock received in the Merger. For purposes of this representation, a person is considered to own or acquire stock owned or acquired (as the case may be) by a partnership in which such person is a partner in proportion to such person's interest in the partnership.

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

4

  

  

13. Company has a "historic business" or significant "historic business assets", in either case within the meaning of Section 1.368-1(d) of the Treasury Regulations. No assets of Company have been sold, transferred or otherwise disposed of that would prevent Parent from conducting Company's coal business following the Merger.

  

  

14. At the time of the Merger, Company will not have outstanding any warrants, options, convertible securities, or any other type of right pursuant to which any person could acquire stock in Company that, if exercised or converted, would affect Parent's acquisition or retention of control of Company. For purposes of this representation, "control" means ownership of at least 80 percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote and at least 80 percent of the total number of shares of each other class of stock.

  

  

15. On the date of the Merger, the fair market value of the assets of Company will exceed the sum of its liabilities, plus the amount of liabilities, if any, to which such assets are subject.

  

  

16. After the Merger, Company will hold (i) at least 90 percent of the fair market value of the net assets and at least 70 percent of the fair market value of the gross assets held by Company immediately prior to the Merger and (ii) to the knowledge of Company, at least 90 percent of the fair market value of the net assets and at least 70 percent of the fair market value of the gross assets held by MergerCo immediately prior to the Merger. Alternatively, if a Restructuring occurs, MergerCo will acquire at least 90 percent of the fair market value of the net assets and at least 70 percent of the fair market value of the gross assets held by Company immediately prior to the Merger. For purposes of this representation, the following amounts will be treated as assets of Company or MergerCo, as applicable, held immediately prior to the Merger: amounts, if any (i) used (or to be used) by Company or MergerCo to pay Merger expenses, (ii) paid (or to be paid) by Company or MergerCo to holders of shares of Company stock in lieu of fractional shares or pursuant to the exercise of dissenters' rights under applicable laws, (iii) paid (or to be paid) by Company or MergerCo to redeem stock, securities, warrants, or options of Company as part of any overall plan of which the Merger is a part, and (iv) distributed (or to be distributed) by Company or MergerCo to the holders of Company stock (except for regular, normal dividends) as part of any overall plan of which the Merger is a part. Any dispositions of assets held by Company or MergerCo prior to the Merger which were made in contemplation of, or as part of, the Merger will be for fair market value, and the proceeds thereof will be retained by Company.

  

  

17. There is no intercorporate indebtedness existing between Parent or any of its subsidiaries, on the one hand, and Company or any of its subsidiaries, on the other hand, that was issued, acquired, or will be settled at a discount.

  

  

18. Company is not under the jurisdiction of a court in a case under Title 11 of the United States Code or under any receivership, foreclosure or similar proceeding.

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

5

  

  

19. Company is not an investment company as defined in Sections 368(a)(2)(F)(iii) and (iv).

  

  

20. Company has not taken, agreed to take or failed to take any action, and does not know of any fact, agreement, plan or other circumstance the result of which is reasonably likely, in the aggregate, to prevent the Merger from qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a).

  

  

21. Company will not take any position on any Federal, state or local income or franchise tax return, or take any other tax reporting position, that is inconsistent with the treatment of the Merger as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code or any representations or certifications herein, unless otherwise required by a "determination" (as defined in Section 1313(a)(1) of the Code) or by applicable state or local tax law (and then only to the extent required by such applicable state or local tax law).

  

  

22. The undersigned is authorized to make all the representations set forth herein on behalf of Company and the management thereof.

  

  

The undersigned acknowledges that (i) your opinion will be based on the
accuracy of the representations set forth herein and on the accuracy of the
representations and warranties and the satisfaction of the covenants and
obligations contained in the Merger Agreement and the various other documents
related thereto, and (ii) your opinion will be subject to certain limitations

further represents that, for purposes of rendering your opinion, you may
consider each of the representations contained herein to be true, correct and
complete without regard to any knowledge qualification.

  

  

Very truly yours,

  


 

  

Company
