other Parties to determine the qualification of the Mergers for the Intended Tax Treatment, including in connection with the preparation and filing of the Joint Proxy Statement or the Form <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">S-4.</FONT> Such
cooperation shall include, if applicable, providing a certificate executed by an officer of the applicable Party with applicable representations and warranties reasonably requested by another Party&#146;s tax advisors in connection with the delivery
of an opinion regarding the qualification of the Mergers for the Intended Tax Treatment (but only to the extent the applicable Party believes in good faith such representations and warranties are true and correct). In addition, as promptly as
reasonably practicable after the date hereof, the Parties shall consider in good faith whether it would be advisable to convert Merger Sub II to a limited liability company (or to assign Merger Sub II&#146;s rights and obligations under this
Agreement to a limited liability company) prior to the Effective Time, including whether such conversion or assignment would reasonably be expected to facilitate the qualification of the Mergers for the Intended Tax Treatment. If the Company (acting
upon the recommendation of the Special Committee) and Parent mutually agree that such conversion (or assignment) is advisable, Parent shall take all actions necessary or appropriate to effect such conversion (or assignment) and, to the extent
required by applicable Law, the Parties shall negotiate and cooperate in good faith to enter into an appropriate amendment to this Agreement to give effect to such conversion (or assignment) and provide for other changes necessitated thereby;
<U>provided</U> that Parent shall not cause such a conversion (or assignment) if it would reasonably be expected to impose material adverse consequences to any Party (or the stockholders of any Party), including if it would reasonably be expected to
delay the Effective Time. The provisions of this Section&nbsp;7.16 shall no longer apply if the Parties determine in good faith, after consultation with their respective tax advisors, that the Mergers should not qualify for the Intended Tax
Treatment. For the avoidance of doubt, each Party acknowledges and agrees that their respective obligations to effect the Mergers are not subject to any condition or contingency with respect to (a)&nbsp;the qualification of the Mergers for the
Intended Tax Treatment or (b)&nbsp;the delivery of any certificate or opinion described in this Section&nbsp;7.16. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:24pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="center">ARTICLE&nbsp;VIII </P>
