ARTICLE IV

_Effect of the Mergers on Capital Stock;_

_Exchange of Eligible Shares_

 

4.1. _Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any
capital stock of the Company or on the part of the sole stockholder of Merger
Sub:

 

(a) _Merger Consideration_. Other than the Shares owned by the Company as
treasury stock or otherwise owned by the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, Merger
Sub II or any other direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent and,
in each case, not held on behalf of third parties (such Shares, the "
_Excluded Shares_ ") and other than Shares that are subject to Company
Restricted Share Awards (which shall be treated as provided in Section
4.4(b)), each Share that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (such Shares, the " _Eligible Shares_ ") shall be converted
into the right to receive, subject to Sections 4.1(b), 4.3(h) and 4.5:

(i) in the case of a Share with respect to which an election to receive
Parent Shares (a " _Stock Election_ ") has been properly made and not revoked
or lost pursuant to Section 4.3 or with respect to which no election has been
made (each, a " _Stock Electing Share_ " and, collectively, the " _Stock
Electing Shares_ "), a number of Parent Shares equal to the Stock Election
Exchange Ratio (the " _Stock Election Consideration_ "); or

 

(ii) in the case of a Share with respect to which an election to receive
cash (a " _Cash Election_ ") has been properly made and not revoked or lost
pursuant to Section 4.3 (each, a " _Cash Electing Share_ " and, collectively,
the " _Cash Electing Shares_ "), the Per Share Election Amount in cash,
without interest (as adjusted pursuant to Section 4.1(b), the " _Cash
Election Consideration_ ").

From and after the Effective Time, subject to Section 4.5, all of such Shares
shall cease to be outstanding, shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist,
and (A) each certificate formerly representing any of the Eligible Shares

 



-4- 

    

 (each, a " _Certificate_ "), and (B) each book-entry account formerly
representing any non-certificated Eligible Shares (each, a " _Book-Entry
Share_ "), shall thereafter represent only the right to receive, as
applicable, the Stock Election Consideration or Cash Election Consideration
(collectively, the " _Merger Consideration_ "), including cash in lieu of any
fractional Parent Shares which such Certificate or Book-Entry Share has been
converted into the right to receive, if any, pursuant to this Section 4.1(a)
and Section 4.3(h) (the " _Fractional Share Consideration_ "), together with
the amounts, if any, payable pursuant to Section 4.3(i).

 

(b) _Proration_. Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this
Agreement, the Cash Election Consideration shall be subject to adjustment
pursuant to this Section 4.1(b):

(i) if the Aggregate Cash Election Amount exceeds the Available Cash
Election Amount, then (x) each Stock Electing Share shall be converted into
the right to receive the Stock Election Consideration and (y) each Cash
Electing Share shall be converted into the right to receive:

(A) an amount (without interest) of cash equal to the quotient of (1) the
Available Cash Election Amount _divided by_ (2) the number of Cash Electing
Shares (the " _Per Share Prorated Cash Amount_ "); and

(B) a number of Parent Shares equal to the product of (1) the Stock Election
Exchange Ratio _multiplied by_ (x) one _minus_ (y) a fraction, (A) the
numerator of which is the Available Cash Election Amount and (B) the
denominator of which is the Aggregate Cash Election Amount; and

(ii) if the Available Cash Election Amount is equal to or exceeds
the Aggregate Cash Election Amount, then:

(A) each Stock Electing Share shall be converted into the right to receive the
Stock Election Consideration; and

(B) each Cash Electing Share shall be converted into the right to receive an
amount of cash (without interest) equal to the Per Share Election Amount.

For purposes of this Agreement:

 

" _Aggregate Cash Election Amount_ " means the product of (i) the number of
Cash Electing Shares _multiplied by_  (ii) the Per Share Election Amount.

" _Available Cash Election Amount_ " means $175,000,000.

 

" _Per Share Election Amount_ " means $73.26.

 

(c) _Treatment of Excluded Shares_. Each Excluded Share shall
automatically be cancelled without payment of any consideration therefor and
shall cease to exist.

(d) _Merger Sub_. Each share of common stock, par value $0.0001 per
share, of Merger Sub, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time, shall be converted into one (1) share of common stock, par
value $0.0001 per share, of the Initial Surviving Corporation.

 

4.2. _Effect of Subsequent Merger on Capital Stock_. At the Subsequent
Merger Effective Time, by virtue of the Subsequent Merger and without any
action on the part of the holder of any capital stock of the Initial Surviving
Corporation or on the part of the sole stockholder of Merger Sub II:

 

(a) each share of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of Merger Sub

Effective Time, shall be converted into one share of common stock, par value
$0.0001 per share, of the Surviving Corporation; and

 



-5- 

    

(b) each share of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of
the Initial Surviving Corporation, issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time, shall be cancelled for no consideration.

 4.3. _Exchange of Eligible Shares and Delivery of Merger Consideration_.

 

(a) _Deposit of Merger Consideration and Exchange Agent_.

 

(i) At the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited,
with an exchange agent selected by Parent and reasonably acceptable to the
Company (such acceptance not to be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or
delayed) (the " _Exchange Agent_ "), (A) a sufficient number of Parent Shares
(whether represented in certificated or non-certificated direct registration
form) to be issued as Stock Consideration pursuant to Section 4.1(a) or
4.1(b), as applicable, and (B) an amount in cash in immediately available
funds sufficient to make payments of (x) the aggregate Cash Consideration,
(y) Fractional Share Consideration, if any, and (z) any dividends or
distributions pursuant to Section 4.3(i), if any, in each case, in respect of
the Eligible Shares (such Parent Shares and cash being hereinafter referred
to as the " _Exchange Fund_ ").

(ii) The agreement pursuant to which Parent shall appoint the Exchange
Agent (the " _Exchange Agent Agreement_ ") shall be in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to the Company (such acceptance not to be unreasonably
conditioned, withheld or delayed). Pursuant to the Exchange Agent Agreement,
among other things, the Exchange Agent shall (A) act as the exchange agent for
the issuance or payment, as applicable, and delivery of the Merger
Consideration and (B) invest the cash portion of the Exchange Fund, if and as
directed by Parent; _provided_ that (1) such investments shall be in
obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America or any agency or
instrumentality thereof and backed by the full faith and credit of the United
States of America, in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better
by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation,
respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or
bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $1,000,000,000
(based on the most recent financial statements of such bank that are then
publicly available) and, in any such case, no instrument or investment shall
have a maturity exceeding three (3) months and (2) to the extent that there
are losses with respect to such investments, or the cash portion of
the Exchange Fund diminishes for other reasons below the level required to
make prompt cash payment of the aggregate Cash Consideration, Fractional Share
Consideration or any dividends or distributions payable pursuant to Section
4.3(i), Parent shall promptly replace or restore or cause the replacement or
restoration of the cash in the Exchange Fund lost through such investments or
other events so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all times maintained
at a level sufficient to make such cash payments. Subject to the terms of the
Exchange Agent Agreement, any interest and other income resulting from such
investment (if any) shall become a part of the Exchange Fund, and any amounts
(if any) in excess of the amounts payable under Section 4.1(a) or 4.1(b), as
applicable, shall, subject to Section 4.3(d), be promptly returned to Parent
or the Surviving Corporation, as requested by Parent.

 

(b) _Procedures for Surrender_.

 

(i) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (and in
any event within five (5) Business Days thereafter), the Surviving
Corporation (with the assistance of Parent if necessary) shall cause the
Exchange Agent to provide or make available to each holder of record of
Eligible Shares (each a " _Holder_ ") that are (A) Certificates or (B) Book-
Entry Shares not held through The Depository Trust Company (" _DTC_ ") notice
advising such holders of the effectiveness of the Merger, which notice shall
include (I) appropriate transmittal materials (including a customary letter
of transmittal) specifying that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss
and title to the Certificates or such Book-Entry Shares shall pass, only upon
delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent (or affidavits of loss in
lieu of the Certificates, as provided in Section 4.3(e)) or the surrender of
such Book-Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent (which is deemed to have been
effected upon the delivery of a customary "agents message" with respect to
such Book-Entry Shares or such other evidence reasonably acceptable to Parent
or the Exchange Agent, if any, of such surrender), such materials to be in
such form and have such other provisions as Parent desires and reasonably
acceptable to the Company (such

 



-6- 

    

 acceptance not to be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed) and (II)
instructions for effecting the surrender of the Certificates (or affidavits of
loss in lieu of the Certificates, as provided in Section 4.3(e)) or the Book-
Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent in exchange for the Merger Consideration
including the Fractional Share Consideration, if any, and dividends or
distributions payable pursuant to Section 4.3(i), if any, that such holder is
entitled to receive as a result of the Merger pursuant to Section 4.1(a) or
4.1(b), as applicable.

 

(ii) With respect to Book-Entry Shares held through DTC, Parent and the
Company shall cooperate to establish procedures with the Exchange Agent, DTC
and such other necessary or desirable third-party intermediaries to ensure
that the Exchange Agent will transmit to DTC or its nominees as promptly as
reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (and in any event within
three (3) Business Days thereafter), upon surrender of Eligible Shares held of
record by DTC or its nominees in accordance with DTCs customary surrender
procedures and such other procedures as agreed by Parent, the Company,
the Exchange Agent, DTC and such other necessary or desirable third-party
intermediaries, the Merger Consideration including the Fractional Share
Consideration, if any, and dividends or distributions payable pursuant to
Section 4.3(i), if any, to which the beneficial owners thereof are entitled
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.

(iii) Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of Eligible Shares that (A) are
Certificates, by physical surrender of such Certificate (or affidavits of loss
in lieu of the Certificates, as provided in Section 4.3(e)) together with the
letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed, and such other
documents as may be reasonably required by the Exchange Agent in accordance
with the terms of the materials and instructions provided by the Exchange
Agent, (B) are Book-Entry Shares not held through DTC, by book-receipt of an
"agents message" by the Exchange Agent in connection with the surrender of
Book-Entry Shares (or such other evidence, if any, of surrender with respect
to such Book-Entry Shares), in each case, pursuant to such materials and
instructions as contemplated by Section 4.3(b)(i), or (C) are Book-Entry
Shares held through DTC, in accordance with DTCs customary surrender
procedures and such other procedures as agreed by the Company, Parent, the
Exchange Agent, DTC and such other necessary or desirable third-party
intermediaries pursuant to Section 4.3(b)(ii), the holder of such Certificate
or Book-Entry Share shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor,
and Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to issue or pay, as applicable, and
deliver as promptly as reasonably practicable to such holders, (1) the number
of Parent Shares (whether represented in certificated or non-certificated
direct registration form) issued pursuant to Section 4.1(a) or 4.1(b), as
applicable, and (2) an amount in cash in immediately available funds (after
giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in Section 4.3(g))
sufficient to make payments of any cash consideration payable pursuant to
Section 4.1(a) or 4.1(b), as applicable, and Fractional Share Consideration,
if any, and any dividends or distributions payable pursuant to Section
4.3(i), if any, in each case, in respect of the Eligible Shares represented by
such Certificate (or an affidavit of loss in lieu of the Certificate, as
provided in Section 4.3(e)) or such Book-Entry Share.

(iv) For the avoidance of doubt, no interest will be paid or accrued for
the benefit of any holder of Eligible Shares on any amount payable upon the
surrender of any Eligible Shares as contemplated by the foregoing provisions
of this Section 4.3(b), and any Certificates and Book-Entry Shares so
surrendered shall be cancelled by the Exchange Agent. Any Merger
Consideration (including any Fractional Share Consideration), together with
any dividends or distributions payable pursuant to Section 4.3(i), issued or
paid upon surrender of a Certificate or a Book-Entry Share will be deemed to
have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such
Certificate or such Book-Entry Share.

 

(v) In the event of a transfer of ownership of any Eligible Shares that are
not registered in the stock transfer books of the Company or if the
applicable Merger Consideration is to be issued or paid in a name other than
that in which the Certificate or Certificates surrendered are registered in
the stock transfer books or ledger of the Company, it shall be a condition of
the issuance or payment of the applicable Merger Consideration that the
Certificate formerly representing such Eligible Shares is properly endorsed
and otherwise in proper form for surrender and presented to the Exchange
Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such
transfer and to evidence that any applicable transfer, documentary, sales,
use, stamp or registration Taxes or other similar Taxes have been paid or are
not applicable, in each case, in form and substance, reasonably

 



-7- 

    

 satisfactory to Parent and the Exchange Agent. Issuance or payment of the
applicable Merger Consideration with respect to Book-Entry Shares shall only
be made to the Person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares are registered in
the stock transfer books of the Company.

(vi) Subject to the terms of the Exchange Agent Agreement, Parent, in the
exercise of its reasonable discretion, shall have the right to make all
determinations, consistent with the terms of this Agreement, governing the
validity of any such transmittal materials described herein and compliance by
any holder of Shares with the procedures contemplated by this Agreement.

(c) _Transfers_. From and after the Effective Time, the stock transfer
books of the Company shall be closed with respect to the Shares outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and there shall be no transfers on the
stock transfer books of the Company of any Shares outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any Certificate or
acceptable evidence of a Book-Entry Share formerly representing any Shares is
presented to the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Exchange Agent for
transfer, it shall be cancelled or, in the case such Shares are Eligible
Shares, cancelled and exchanged for the applicable Merger Consideration
including the Fractional Share Consideration, if any, and dividends or
distributions payable pursuant to Section 4.3(i), if any, to which the holder
thereof is entitled in accordance with this Article IV.

 

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including the proceeds of any investments thereof (if any)) that remains
unclaimed by the holders of Shares for one (1) year from and after the Closing
Date shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation. Any holder of Eligible
Shares who has not theretofore complied with the procedures, materials and
instructions contemplated by this Article IV shall thereafter look only to the
Surviving Corporation for issuance or payment of the Merger Consideration
(after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in Section
4.3(g)) payable pursuant to Section 4.1(a) or 4.1(b), as applicable.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing, none of the
Surviving Corporation, Parent, the Exchange Agent or any other Person shall be
liable to any former holder of Shares for any portion of the Exchange Fund
properly delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Laws. Any Merger Consideration remaining
unclaimed by the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares immediately
prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to, or become
property of, any Governmental Entity will, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation or
an Affiliate thereof designated by the Surviving Corporation, free and clear
of any claim or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 

(e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificate
representing Eligible Shares shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the
posting by such Person of a bond in customary amount and upon such terms as
may be reasonably required by Parent as indemnity against any claim that may
be made against it or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such
Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue or pay the applicable Merger
Consideration issuable or payable pursuant to Section 4.1(a) or 4.1(b), as
applicable, including the Fractional Share Consideration, if any, and
dividends or distributions payable pursuant to Section 4.3(i), if any,
deliverable in respect of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate.

(f) _No Appraisal Rights_. In accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL,
no appraisal rights shall be available to holders of the Shares in connection
with the Merger, the Subsequent Merger or otherwise under this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

(g) _Withholding Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, each of Parent, the Exchange Agent and the Surviving
Corporation (and any of their Affiliates) shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement
to any Person such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold
with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), or any other applicable state, local or
non-U.S. Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld, such withheld
amounts (i) shall be remitted to the applicable Governmental Entity and

 



-8- 

    

 (ii) shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid
to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

 

(h) _Fractional Shares_.

 

(i) No certificates, receipts or scrip representing fractional Parent
Shares will be issued upon the surrender or transfer for exchange of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, no dividend or distribution of Parent will
relate to such fractional Parent Shares, and such fractional Parent Shares
will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights of a holder of
Parent Shares.

(ii) Parent shall pay to the Exchange Agent an amount in cash to be
deposited promptly following the Effective Time, sufficient for the Exchange
Agent to pay each holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares an amount in
cash (rounded to the nearest cent) equal to the product of (1) the fraction of
a Parent Share (rounded to the nearest thousandth when expressed in decimal
form) to which such holder (taking into account all fractional Parent Shares
to be received by such holder) would otherwise have been entitled to receive
pursuant to Section 4.1(a) or 4.1(b), as applicable,  _multiplied by_ (2) the
Reference Price.

(i) _Dividends or Distributions with Respect to Parent Shares_. No
dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Shares with a record
date after the Effective Time will be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
Certificate or Book-Entry Share with respect to the right to receive the
Parent Shares represented thereby, and all such dividends and other
distributions will be paid by Parent to the Exchange Agent and will be
included in the Exchange Fund, in each case, until the surrender of such
Certificate (or an affidavit of loss in lieu of the Certificate, as provided
in Section 4.3(e)) or Book-Entry Share in accordance with this Agreement.
Subject to applicable Laws, following surrender of any such Certificate (or an
affidavit of loss in lieu of the Certificate, as provided in Section 4.3(e))
or Book-Entry Share there will be paid to the holder thereof, without
interest, (i) promptly, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a
record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such
Parent Shares to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 4.1(a) or
4.1(b), as applicable, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective
Time but prior to such surrender and with a payment date subsequent to such
surrender payable with respect to such Parent Shares.

 

(j) _Election_. Each Holder shall have the right, subject to the
limitations set forth in this Article IV, to submit an Election in accordance
with this Section 4.3(j) on or prior to the Election Deadline. The Company
shall not waive the Election Deadline unless such Election Deadline is waived
with respect to all Holders, the new election deadline is publicly disclosed
by the Company to all Holders on a date agreed to by Parent, and Parent has
otherwise given its prior written consent to such waiver (such agreement or
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). " _Election
Deadline_ " means 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the date which the Parties
shall agree is as near as practicable to three (3) Business Days preceding the
Closing Date or such other time or date as the Parties shall mutually agree
in writing. The Parties shall cooperate to issue a press release in accordance
with Section 7.9 that is reasonably satisfactory to each of them announcing
the date of the Election Deadline at least five (5) Business Days prior to
the Election Deadline.

(i) Each Holder may specify in a request made in accordance with
the provisions of this Section 4.3(j) (an " _Election_ ") (A) the number of
Shares with respect to which such Holder desires to make a Stock Election and
(B) the number of Shares with respect to which such Holder desires to make a
Cash Election.

(ii) Parent shall prepare a form of election that is reasonably acceptable
to the Company (the " _Form_ __ _ of Election_"), and Parent shall mail, or
shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail and deliver, together with the Joint
Proxy Statement, the Form of Election to Holders as of the record date
for notice of the Stockholders Meeting not less than twenty (20) Business
Days prior to the anticipated Election Deadline (the period between such
mailing and the Election Deadline, the " _Election Period_ "). Parent shall
make available one or more Forms of Election as may reasonably be requested
from time to time by all Persons who become Holders during the period
following

 



-9- 

    

 the record date for the Stockholders Meeting and prior to the Election
Deadline. Any Holder that holds any Shares as nominee, as trustee or in other
representative capacity may, through proper instructions and documentation,
submit a separate Form of Election prior to the Election Deadline with respect
to each beneficial owner for whom such nominee, trustee or representative
holds such Shares.

 

(iii) Any Election shall have been made properly only if the Exchange Agent
shall have received, by the Election Deadline, a Form of Election properly
completed and signed. Any Share with respect to which the Holder does not make
a valid Election by the Election Deadline shall be deemed to be a Stock
Electing Share.

 

(iv) Any Holder may, at any time during the Election Period, revoke his,
her or its Election by written notice to the Exchange Agent prior to the
Election Deadline, together with a properly completed and signed revised Form
of Election. Any subsequent transfer of any Shares after the Holder of such
Shares has made an Election shall automatically revoke such Election as to
such Shares (and such subsequent transferee may make a new Election pursuant
to and if permitted by the terms of this Section 4.3(j)). Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, all Elections shall
be automatically deemed revoked upon receipt by the Exchange Agent of written
notification from the Company or Parent that this Agreement has been
terminated in accordance with Article IX. The Exchange Agent shall have
reasonable discretion to determine if any Election is not properly made,
changed or revoked with respect to any Shares (none of the Company, Parent,
Merger Sub, Merger Sub II or the Exchange Agent being under any duty to notify
any Holder of any applicable defect). In the event the Exchange Agent makes a
good faith determination that an Election (A) was not properly made (including
as a result of the Exchange Agent not receiving an Election by the Election
Deadline) or (B) has been otherwise revoked or lost, such Election shall be
deemed to be ineffective, and the Shares covered by such Election shall, for
purposes hereof, be deemed to be Stock Electing Shares.

 

4.4. _Treatment of_ _Equity Awards; Employee Stock Purchase Plan_.

 

(a) _Treatment of Company Options_. Immediately prior to the Effective
Time, each unexpired, unexercised and outstanding stock option to purchase
Shares granted under the Company Stock Plans or otherwise (a " _Company
Option_ ") shall, automatically and without any action on the part of the
holder thereof, cease to represent a right to purchase Shares and be
converted immediately prior to the Effective Time into an option, on the same
terms and conditions applicable to such Company Option immediately prior to
the Effective Time (including any terms and conditions that provide
for accelerated vesting in connection with the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement), to purchase the number of Parent
Shares, rounded down to the nearest whole share, that is equal to the product
of (i) the number of Shares subject to such Company Option immediately prior
to the Effective Time, _multiplied by_ (ii) the Stock Award Exchange Ratio, at
an exercise price per Parent Share (rounded up to the nearest cent) equal to
(A) the exercise price for such Shares subject to such Company Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time _divided by_ (B) the Stock Award
Exchange Ratio; _provided_ that the adjustments provided in this Section
4.4(a) with respect to any Company Options are intended to be effected in a
manner that is consistent with Section 424(a) of the Code and Section 409A of
the Code.

 

(b) _Treatment of Company Restricted Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, each outstanding award of Shares granted
under the Company Stock Plans or otherwise that is subject to forfeiture
conditions, but excluding any Shares that are subject solely to a repurchase
condition based on the fair market value of a Share (each, a " _Company
Restricted Share Award_ "), shall, automatically and without any action on the
part of the holder thereof, be converted into an award of Parent restricted
shares covering a number of Parent Shares equal to the product of (x) the
number of Shares subject to such Company Restricted Share Award immediately
prior to the Effective Time _multiplied by_ (y) the Stock Election Exchange
Ratio, which Parent Shares shall be subject to the same terms and conditions
as were applicable to such Company Restricted Share Award immediately prior to
the Effective Time (including any terms and conditions that provide for
accelerated vesting in connection with the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement); _provided_ that no fractional
Parent Shares will be issued in respect of any such Company Restricted Share
Award, and Parent shall instead pay, or cause to be paid by the Surviving
Corporation or any of its Affiliates, to the

 



-10- 

    

 holder of such Company Restricted Share Award as soon as practicable, but in
no event later than ten (10) Business Days following the Closing Date, an
amount in cash (rounded to the nearest cent), without interest but after
giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in Section 4.3(g),
equal to the product of (1) the fraction of a Parent Share (rounded to the
nearest thousandth when expressed in decimal form) to which such holder
(taking into account all fractional Parent Shares to be received by such
holder) would otherwise have been entitled to receive pursuant to this Section
4.4(b) _multiplied by_ (2) the Reference Price, without regard to any vesting
requirements.

(c) _Corporate Actions_. At or prior to the Effective Time, the
Company, the Company Board and the compensation committee of the Company
Board (the " _Compensation Committee_ "), as applicable, shall adopt any
resolutions and take any actions which are necessary to effectuate the
provisions of Sections 4.4(a) and 4.4(b). In addition, the Company shall take
all actions necessary to ensure that, from and after the Effective Time,
neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation will be required to deliver
Shares or other capital stock of the Company to any Person pursuant to or in
settlement of any Company Options or Company Restricted Share Awards
(collectively, the " _Company Equity Awards_ "). At the Effective Time, Parent
shall assume all of the obligations of the Company relating to Company Equity
Awards outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, including under
the applicable Company Stock Plans and the agreements evidencing the grants
thereof. Prior to the delivery of any Parent Shares in respect of any
Company Options converted pursuant to this Section 4.4, Parent shall file a
registration statement on Form S-8 (or other applicable form) with respect to
the Parent Shares subject to such Company Options converted pursuant to this
Section 4.4 and shall maintain the effectiveness of such registration
statement or registration statements (and maintain the current status of the
prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for so long as such converted
Company Options remain outstanding. As soon as practicable after the Effective
Time, Parent shall deliver to the holders of Company Equity Awards appropriate
notices setting forth such holders rights pursuant to the
respective applicable Company Stock Plans, and the agreements evidencing the
grants of such Company Equity Awards shall continue in effect on the same
terms and conditions, subject to the adjustments required by this Section 4.4
after giving effect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(d) _Employee Stock Purchase Plan_ _._ Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company Board or the Compensation Committee will adopt such resolutions and
take such other reasonable actions as may be reasonably necessary to provide
that (i) participants in the Companys 2018 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the
" _Employee Stock Purchase Plan_ ") may not increase the amount of their
payroll deductions from those in effect on the date of this Agreement; (ii) no
participation period under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan will commence
after the date of this Agreement; (iii) each right to purchase Shares under
the Employee Stock Purchase Plan that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall, immediately prior to the Effective Time, be
exercised to purchase Shares in accordance with the terms of the Employee
Stock Purchase Plan as if such date was the last day of the applicable
participation period and each Share so purchased shall be deemed to be a Stock
Electing Share in accordance with Section 4.1(a)(i); and (iv) the Employee
Stock Purchase Plan shall be terminated immediately prior to the Effective
Time. Any remaining accumulated but unused payroll deductions shall be
distributed to the relevant participants without interest as soon as
administratively practicable following the Effective Time.

 

4.5. _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, if, from the date hereof to the earlier of the
Effective Time and termination of this Agreement in accordance with Article
IX, the issued and outstanding Shares or Parent Shares, as applicable, or
securities convertible or exchangeable thereinto or exercisable therefor
shall have been changed into a different number of shares or securities or a
different class by reason of any reclassification, stock split (including a
reverse stock split), stock dividend or distribution, recapitalization,
merger (other than the Mergers), issuer tender offer or exchange offer, or
other similar transaction, or a stock dividend with a record date within such
period shall have been declared, then the Stock Consideration, Cash
Consideration, and any other similarly dependent items, as the case may be,
shall be equitably adjusted in order to provide the holders of Shares the same
economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , nothing in this Section 4.5 shall be construed to
permit

 



-11- 

    

 the Company, Parent or any other Person to take any action except to the
extent consistent with, and not otherwise prohibited or restricted by, the
terms of this Agreement.

 

ARTICLE V

 

 _Representations and Warranties of the Company_

 

Except as set forth in the publicly available Company Reports filed with the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") on or after June 19,
2018 and prior to the date hereof (excluding, in each case, any disclosures
contained or referenced therein under the captions "Risk Factors," "Forward-
Looking Statements," "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market
Risk" and any other disclosures contained or referenced therein of
information, factors or risks that are cautionary, predictive or forward-
looking in nature) or in the corresponding sections or subsections of the
confidential disclosure letter delivered to Parent by the Company prior to or
concurrently with entering into this Agreement (the " _Company Disclosure
Letter_ ") (it being agreed that, for purposes of the representations and
warranties set forth in this Article V, disclosure of any item in any section
or subsection of the Company Disclosure Letter shall be deemed disclosure with
respect to any other section or subsection to which the relevance of such
item is reasonably apparent on its face), the Company hereby represents and
warrants to Parent, Merger Sub and Merger Sub II that:

 

5.1. _Organization, Good Standing and Qualification_. The Company (a) is
a legal entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under
the Laws of the State of Delaware, (b) has all requisite corporate power and
authority to own, lease and operate its properties, rights and assets and to
carry on its business as presently conducted and (c) is qualified to do
business and, to the extent such concept is applicable, is in good standing as
a foreign corporation or other legal entity in each jurisdiction where the
ownership, leasing or operation of its assets or properties or conduct of its
business requires such qualification, except, in the case of clauses (b) and
(c), where the failure to have such power or authority or to be so qualified
or, to the extent such concept is applicable, in good standing (i) does not
constitute a Company Material Adverse Effect and (ii) would not, individually
or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay or
impair the ability of the Company to consummate the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Company has no Subsidiaries.

 5.2. _Capital Structure_.

(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of (i)
150,000,000 Shares, of which 38,592,203 Shares were issued and outstanding as
of the close of business on October 2, 2020 (the " _Measurement Date_ "), of
which 251,404 were subject to Company Restricted Share Awards, and (ii)
5,000,000 preferred shares, par value $0.001 per share, of which none are
issued and outstanding as of the date hereof. All of the outstanding Shares
have been duly authorized and are validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable. As of the Measurement Date, other than 3,274,911 Shares
reserved for future issuance under the Company Stock Plans and the Employee
Stock Purchase Plan, of which 1,911,632 Shares are subject to issuance
pursuant to Company Options and 9,052 Shares are subject to outstanding
restricted stock units entitling the holder thereof to Shares or cash equal to
the value of Shares with only time-based vesting requirements, the Company has
no Shares reserved for issuance. Except as set forth above, there are
no preemptive or other outstanding rights, options, warrants, conversion
rights, stock appreciation rights, restricted share units, performance units,
phantom stock rights, profit participation rights, redemption rights,
repurchase rights, agreements, arrangements, calls, commitments or rights,
obligations or contracts of any kind that obligate the Company to issue or
sell any shares of capital stock or other securities of the Company or any
securities or obligations convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable
for, or giving any Person a right to subscribe for or acquire, any securities
of the Company, and no securities or obligations evidencing such rights are
authorized, issued or outstanding. Upon any issuance of any Shares
in accordance with the terms of the Company Stock Plans, such Shares will be
duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and free and
clear of any lien, charge, pledge, security interest, claim, 

 



-12- 

    

 adverse ownership interest or other encumbrance (each, a " _Lien_ "). The

 5.5. _Company Reports; Financial Statements_.

(a) The Company has filed or furnished, as applicable, on a timely basis,
all forms, statements, certifications, reports and documents required to be
filed by it with or furnished by it to the SEC pursuant to the Exchange Act or
the Securities Act since June 19, 2018 (the forms, statements,
certifications, reports and other documents filed with or furnished to the SEC
since June 19, 2018 and those filed with or furnished to the SEC subsequent to
the date hereof, including any amendments thereto, the " _Company Reports_
"). Each of the Company Reports, at the time of its filing or being furnished
complied as to form in all material respects with the applicable requirements
of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002
(the " _Sarbanes-Oxley Act_ ") applicable to the Company Reports. As of their
respective dates (or, if amended prior to

 



-14- 

    

 the date hereof, as of the date of such amendment), the Company Reports did
not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements made therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were
made, not misleading. Since January 1, 2019, the Company has not consummated
any unregistered offering of securities that by the terms of such offering
requires subsequent registration under the Securities Act.

(b) Each of the chief executive officer of the Company and the chief
financial officer of the Company (or each former chief executive officer of

15d-14 under the Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act with respect to the Company Reports, and the statements contained in
such certifications are true and accurate in all material respects. For
purposes of this Agreement, "chief executive officer" and "chief financial
officer" have the meanings given to such terms in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The
Company does not have outstanding nor has it arranged any outstanding
"extensions of credit" to directors or executive officers within the meaning
of Section 402 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. As of the date hereof, to the
Knowledge of the Company, there is no reason to believe that the Companys
chief executive officer and chief financial officer will not be able to give
the certifications required pursuant to the rules and regulations adopted
pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in connection with the
filing of the Companys Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period
ended September 30, 2020.

 

(c) The Company is in compliance in all material respects with the
applicable listing and corporate governance rules and regulations of NASDAQ.
Except as permitted by the Exchange Act, including Sections 13(k)(2) and (3)
or rules of the SEC, since the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, neither
the Company nor any of its Affiliates has made, arranged or modified (in any
material respect) any extensions of credit in the form of a personal loan to
any executive officer or director of the Company.

 

(d) The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures required
by Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15 under the Exchange Act. Such disclosure controls and
procedures are effective to ensure that all information required to be
disclosed by the Company is reported on a timely basis to the individuals
responsible for the preparation of the Companys filings with the SEC and
other public disclosure documents. The Companys internal control over
financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15, as applicable, under
the Exchange Act) is effective in providing reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP and includes policies
and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that are in
reasonable detail and accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the Company, (ii) provide reasonable assurance
that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the
Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management
and directors of the Company and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition
of the Companys assets that could have a material effect on its financial
statements.

(e) The Company has disclosed, based on the most recent evaluation by its
chief executive officer and its chief financial officer prior to the date
hereof, to the Companys auditors and the audit committee of the Company
Board, (i) any significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in the design
or operation of its internal control over financial reporting that are
reasonably likely to adversely affect the Companys ability to record,
process, summarize and report financial information and (ii) any fraud,
whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have
a significant role in the Companys internal control over financial reporting.

 

(f) Each of the balance sheets included in or incorporated by reference
into the Company Reports (including the related notes and schedules) presents
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of
its date and each of the related statements of operations and comprehensive
loss, of redeemable convertible preferred stock and stockholders equity
(deficit) and of cash flows included in, or incorporated by

 



-15- 

    

 reference into, the Company Reports (including any related notes and
schedules) presents fairly, in all material respects, the results of
operations, retained earnings (loss) and changes in financial position, as
the case may be, of the Company for the periods set forth therein (subject, in
the case of unaudited statements, to notes and normal year-end audit
adjustments that will not be material in amount or effect in accordance with
GAAP consistently applied during the periods involved, except as may be noted
therein). Each such balance sheet or related statements of operations and
comprehensive loss, of redeemable convertible preferred stock and
stockholders equity (deficit) and of cash flows included in or incorporated
by reference into the Company Reports (including the related notes and
schedules) complied as to form at the time it was filed (or, if amended prior
to the date hereof, as of the date of such amendment) in all material
respects with applicable accounting requirements and the published rules and
regulations of the SEC with respect thereto and was prepared in conformity
with GAAP (except, in the case of unaudited interim financial statements, as
permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC) applied on a consistent basis during the
periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto).

 

(g) The Company is not a party to, nor does it have any commitment to
become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet partnership or any
similar Contract (including any Contract or arrangement relating to any
transaction or relationship between or among the Company, on the one hand, and
any Affiliate, including any structured finance, special purpose or limited
purpose entity or Person, on the other hand, or any "off-balance sheet
arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K under the Exchange
Act)), where the result, purpose or intended effect of such Contract is to
avoid disclosure of any material transaction involving, or material
liabilities of, the Company in the Companys published financial statements
or other Company Reports.

5.6. _Absence of Certain Changes_.

(a) Since December 31, 2019 through the date of this Agreement, except for

practice since the date of such balance sheet, the Company does not have any
liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether accrued, absolute, matured,
unmatured, contingent or otherwise) required by GAAP to be set forth on a

Company Material Adverse Effect.

the relevance of such item is reasonably apparent on its face), Parent, Merger
Sub and Merger Sub II each hereby represents and warrants to the Company

business requires such qualification, except, in the case of clauses (b) and
(c), where the failure to have such power or authority or to be so qualified
or, to the extent such concept is applicable, in good standing (i) does not
constitute a Parent Material Adverse Effect and (ii) would not, individually
or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay or

or exercisable for, or giving any Person a right to subscribe for or acquire,
any securities of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, and no securities or
obligations evidencing such rights are authorized, issued or outstanding. Upon
any issuance of any Parent Shares in accordance with the terms of the Parent

for securities having the right to vote) with the stockholders of Parent on
any matter. From September 30, 2020 to the date of this Agreement, no Parent

and delivered by each of Parent, Merger Sub and Merger Sub II and, assuming

-25- 

    

6.5. _Parent Reports; Financial Statements_.

(a) Parent has filed or furnished, as applicable, on a timely basis, all
forms, statements, certifications, reports and documents required to be filed
by it with or furnished by it to the SEC pursuant to the Exchange Act or the
Securities Act since June 26, 2019 (the forms, statements, certifications,
reports and other documents filed with or furnished to the SEC since June 26,
2019 and those filed with or furnished to the SEC subsequent to the date
hereof, including any amendments thereto, the " _Parent Reports_ "). Each of
the Parent Reports, at the time of its filing or being furnished complied as
to form in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the
Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act applicable to the
Parent Reports. As of their respective dates (or, if amended prior to the
date hereof, as of the date of such amendment), the Parent Reports did not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
made therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were made, not
misleading. Since January 1, 2019, Parent has not consummated any unregistered
offering of securities that by the terms of such offering requires subsequent
registration under the Securities Act.

(b) Each of the chief executive officer of Parent and the chief financial
officer of Parent (or each former chief executive officer of Parent and each
former chief financial officer of Parent, as applicable) has made all
applicable certifications required by Rule 13a-14 or 15d-14 under the Exchange
Act and Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act with respect to the
Parent Reports, and the statements contained in such certifications are true
and accurate in all material respects. Neither Parent nor any of its
Subsidiaries has outstanding or has arranged any outstanding "extensions of
credit" to directors or executive officers within the meaning of Section 402
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. As of the date of this Agreement, to the Knowledge
of Parent, there is no reason to believe that Parents chief executive officer
and chief financial officer will not be able to give the certifications
required pursuant to the rules and regulations adopted pursuant to Section
404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in connection with the filing of Parents
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30,
2020.

 

(c) Parent is in compliance in all material respects with the applicable
listing and corporate governance rules and regulations of NASDAQ. Except as
permitted by the Exchange Act, including Sections 13(k)(2) and (3) or rules of
the SEC, since the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, neither Parent nor any
of its Affiliates has made, arranged or modified (in any material respect)
any extensions of credit in the form of a personal loan to any executive
officer or director of Parent.

 

(d) Parent maintains disclosure controls and procedures required by Rule
13a-15 or 15d-15 under the Exchange Act. Such disclosure controls and
procedures are effective to ensure that all information required to be
disclosed by Parent is reported on a timely basis to the individuals
responsible for the preparation of Parents filings with the SEC and other
public disclosure documents. Parents internal control over financial
reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15, as applicable, under the
Exchange Act) is effective in providing reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP and includes
policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that
are in reasonable detail and accurately and fairly reflect the transactions
and dispositions of the assets of Parent, (ii) provide reasonable assurance
that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of
Parent are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management
and directors of Parent and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition
of Parents assets that could have a material effect on its financial
statements.

(e) Parent has disclosed, based on the most recent evaluation by its chief
executive officer and its chief financial officer prior to the date hereof,
to Parents auditors and the audit committee of the Parent Board, (i) any
significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in the design or operation of
its internal control over financial reporting that are reasonably likely to
adversely affect Parents ability to record, process, summarize and report
financial information and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that
involves management or other employees who have a significant role in
Parents internal control over financial reporting.

 



-26- 

    

(f) Each of the consolidated balance sheets included in or incorporated by
reference into the Parent Reports (including the related notes and schedules)
presents fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position
of Parent, its Subsidiaries and controlled entities as of its date and
each of the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive
loss, of redeemable convertible noncontrolling interests and stockholders
equity (deficit) and of cash flows included in, or incorporated by reference
into, the Parent Reports (including any related notes and schedules) presents
fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated results of operations,
retained earnings (loss) and changes in financial position, as the case may
be, of Parent, its Subsidiaries and controlled entities for the periods set
forth therein (subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to notes and
normal year-end audit adjustments that will not be material in amount or
effect in accordance with GAAP consistently applied during the periods
involved, except as may be noted therein); _provided_ , _however_ , that, for
purposes of this Section 6.5(f), the proviso in the definition of "Subsidiary"
shall not apply. Each such consolidated balance sheet or related consolidated
statements of operations and comprehensive loss, of redeemable noncontrolling
interests and stockholders equity (deficit) and of cash flows included in or
incorporated by reference into the Parent Reports (including the related
notes and schedules) complied as to form at the time it was filed (or, if
amended prior to the date hereof, as of the date of such amendment) in all
material respects with applicable accounting requirements and the published
rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto and was prepared in
conformity with GAAP (except, in the case of unaudited interim financial
statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC) applied on a consistent
basis during the periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes
thereto).

 

(g) Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, or has any
commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet
partnership or any similar Contract (including any Contract or arrangement
relating to any transaction or relationship between or among Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any Affiliate, including any
structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or Person, on
the other hand, or any "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item
303(a) of Regulation S-K under the Exchange Act)), where the result, purpose
or intended effect of such Contract is to avoid disclosure of any material
transaction involving, or material liabilities of, Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries in Parents or such Subsidiarys published financial statements
or other Parent Reports.

 6.6. _Absence of Certain Changes_.

(a) Since December 31, 2019 through the date of this Agreement, except for
actions taken in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby, Parent and each of its Subsidiaries
has conducted its business in the ordinary course of business consistent with
past practice in all material respects.

(b) Since December 31, 2019, there has not been any change, event,
occurrence, state of facts, condition, circumstance or effect that constitutes
a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 6.7. _Litigation_ _and Liabilities_.

(a) There are no Proceedings pending or, to Parents Knowledge, threatened
against Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, except for those that (i) do not
constitute a Parent Material Adverse Effect and (ii) would not, individually
or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay or
impair the ability of Parent, Merger Sub or Merger Sub II to consummate the

 7.2. _Company Acquisition Proposals_.

(a) _No Solicitation or Negotiation_. The Company agrees that, except as
expressly permitted by this Section 7.2, neither it nor any of its directors,
officers and employees shall, and that it shall instruct and use its
reasonable best efforts to cause its investment bankers, attorneys,

the making of any proposal or offer that constitutes, or would reasonably be
expected to lead to, any Company Acquisition Proposal;

information in response to a request therefor by a Person who has made an
unsolicited _bona fide_ written Company Acquisition Proposal after the date

this Section 7.2 if the Company receives from the Person so requesting such
information an executed confidentiality agreement on terms not less
restrictive to such Person than those contained in the Confidentiality
Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that such information has previously been
made available to Parent or is made available to Parent prior to or
promptly after the time such information is made available to such Person;
and (B) engage or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations
with any Person who has made such an unsolicited _bona fide_ written Company

-37- 

    

 (acting upon the recommendation of the Special Committee) or the Special
Committee determines in good faith after consultation with its outside legal
counsel that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the
directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law and (II) in each such case
referred to in clause (A) or (B) directly above, the Company Board (acting
upon the recommendation of the Special Committee) or the Special Committee
has determined in good faith based on the information then available and after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor that such
Company Acquisition Proposal either constitutes a Company Superior Proposal
or could reasonably be expected to result in a Company Superior Proposal.

(b) _No Change in Company Recommendation or Alternative Acquisition
Agreement_. The Company Board and each committee of the Company Board

structured as a tender offer or exchange offer is commenced, fail to recommend
against acceptance of such tender offer or exchange offer by the Companys
stockholders within ten (10) Business Days of the commencement thereof
pursuant to Rule 14d-2 of the Exchange Act or (E) fail to publicly reaffirm
the Company Recommendation within ten (10) Business Days after receiving a
written request to do so from Parent promptly after any Company Acquisition
Proposal or any material modification thereto shall have first been publicly
made, sent or given to the holders of Shares, or within two (2) Business Days
of such request in the event such Company Acquisition Proposal or material
modification is publicly made, sent or given less than ten (10) Business Days
prior to the then-scheduled Stockholders Meeting ( _provided_ that Parent may
only make such request once with respect to any Company Acquisition Proposal
and once for each material modification thereto) (any of the foregoing actions
or inactions in this Section 7.2(b)(i) by the Company Board or any committee
of the Company Board (including the Special Committee), a " _Change of
Company Recommendation_ ") or otherwise resolve or agree to take any of the
foregoing actions in this Section 7.2(b)(i); or

 

(ii) cause or permit the Company to enter into any letter of intent,
memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement,
merger agreement or other similar agreement (other than a confidentiality

_Alternative Company Acquisition Agreement_ ") or otherwise resolve or agree
to do so.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Section 7.2(b),
the Company Board (acting upon the recommendation of the Special Committee) or
the Special Committee may, prior to but not after the time the Requisite
Company Stockholder Approvals are obtained, make a Change of Company
Recommendation if, and only if, (A) an Intervening Event has occurred and the
Company Board (acting upon the recommendation of the Special Committee) or the
Special Committee has determined in good faith, after consulting with its
financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that failure to take such action
would be inconsistent with such directors fiduciary duties under applicable
Law, or (B) the Company receives a Company Acquisition Proposal and
the Company Board (acting upon the recommendation of the Special Committee)
or the Special Committee has determined in good faith, after consulting with
its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that such Company Acquisition
Proposal constitutes a Company Superior Proposal and that failure to take
such action would be inconsistent with such directors fiduciary duties under
applicable Law; _provided_ that neither the Company Board nor the Special
Committee may take any such action (and the Special Committee may not
recommend to the Company Board to take such action) unless (I) prior to making
such Change of Company Recommendation, the Company provides prior written
notice to Parent at least four (4) Business Days in advance (the " _Notice
Period_ ") of its intention to take such action and the basis thereof, which
notice shall include, in the case of a Company Superior Proposal, the
information required under Section 7.2(e) and, in the case of an Intervening

 



-38- 

    

 Event, a reasonably detailed description of such Intervening Event, (II)
during the Notice Period, the Company shall, and shall cause its employees,
financial advisor and outside legal counsel to, be reasonably available to
negotiate with Parent in good faith should Parent propose to make amendments
or other revisions to the terms and conditions of this Agreement such that, in
the case of a Company Superior Proposal, such Company Acquisition Proposal no
longer constitutes a Company Superior Proposal or, in the case of an
Intervening Event, the failure to take such action would no longer be
inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law
as determined in the good faith judgment of the Company Board (acting upon
the recommendation of the Special Committee) or the Special Committee, after
consulting with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, and (III) the
Company Board (acting upon the recommendation of the Special Committee) or
the Special Committee, as the case may be, has taken into account any
amendments or other revisions to the terms and conditions of this Agreement
agreed to by Parent in writing prior to the end of the Notice Period and has
determined in good faith, after consulting with its financial advisor and
outside legal counsel, that a failure to make such Change of Company
Recommendation would still be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary
duties under applicable Law; it being understood that any amendments or other
revisions to any Company Acquisition Proposal will be deemed to be a new
Company Acquisition Proposal, including for purposes of the Notice Period; 
_provided_ , _however_ , subsequent to the initial Notice Period, the Notice
Period shall be reduced to two (2) Business Days.

 

(c) _Certain Permitted Disclosure_. Nothing contained in this Section 7.2

disclosure that constitutes a "stop, look and listen" communication pursuant
to Section 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act or (iii) making any
disclosure to the stockholders of the Company that is required by applicable
Law, which actions shall not constitute or be deemed to constitute a Change of
Company Recommendation; _provided_ , _however_ , that (A) any such disclosure
permitted under clause (i) above that relates to an Company Acquisition
Proposal (other than a "stop, look and listen" communication) shall be deemed
a Change of Company Recommendation unless the Company Board (acting upon the
recommendation of the Special Committee) expressly publicly reaffirms the
Company Recommendation in connection with such disclosure and (B) any Change
of Company Recommendation may only be made in accordance with Section 7.2(b).

 

(d) _Existing Discussions_. The Company agrees that, as of the date
hereof, it has ceased and caused to be terminated any existing activities,
solicitations, discussions or negotiations with any parties conducted
heretofore with respect to any Company Acquisition Proposal. The Company also

Business Days of the date hereof) (i) request each Person that has, during the
period from August 24, 2020 to the date of this Agreement, executed a
confidentiality agreement in connection with any Company Acquisition Proposal
or its consideration of any Company Acquisition Proposal to return or destroy
all confidential information heretofore furnished to such Person by or on
behalf of it or any of its Subsidiaries and (ii) terminate any data room or
other diligence access of such Persons.

(e) _Notice_. The Company agrees that it will promptly (and, in any
event, within twenty-four (24) hours) notify Parent if any inquiries,
proposals or offers with respect to any Company Acquisition Proposal or that
would reasonably be expected to lead to any Company Acquisition Proposal are
received by, any information in connection therewith is requested from, or
any such discussions or negotiations related thereto are sought to be
initiated or continued with, it or any of its Representatives indicating, in
connection with such notice, the name of such Person making the Company
Acquisition Proposal and providing unredacted copies of any written requests,
proposals or offers, including proposed agreements and the material terms and
conditions of any oral proposals or offers, and thereafter shall keep Parent
reasonably informed, on a reasonably current basis, of the status and terms of
any such inquiries, proposals or offers (including any amendments thereto) and
the status of any such discussions or negotiations.

 

(f) _Standstills_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, the Company Board or the Special Committee shall be
permitted, in their sole discretion, to terminate, amend, modify, waive or
fail to

 



-39- 

    

 enforce any standstill provision of any confidentiality agreement,
Standstill Agreement or similar obligation of any Person to the extent the
Company Board or the Special Committee determines in good faith after
consultation with its outside legal counsel that such action or failure to
take such action would be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties
under applicable Law. The Company acknowledges and agrees that nothing in the
Confidentiality Agreement shall prohibit, prevent or restrict the ability of
Parent or any Person acting on behalf of Parent to propose or make amendments
or other revisions to the terms and conditions of this Agreement or otherwise
exercise its rights under Section 7.2(b) and any acts taken in connection
therewith shall under no circumstances be considered a breach of the
Confidentiality Agreement.

fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any
Proceeding to the extent arising out of or related to such Indemnified
Partys service as a director or officer of the Company at or prior to the
Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Effective Time, to the fullest extent that the Company would have been
permitted under the DGCL and its certificate of incorporation or bylaws in
effect on the date hereof to indemnify such Person (and Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall also advance expenses as incurred to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable Law and the Companys certificate of
incorporation or bylaws in effect on the date hereof; _provided_ that the
Person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such

Effective Time with benefits and levels of coverage at least as favorable as
the Companys existing policies (including in connection with this Agreement
or the transactions or actions contemplated hereby) with respect to those
Indemnified Parties who are currently (and any additional Indemnified Parties
who prior to the Effective Time become) covered by the Companys DandO
Insurance; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) in no event shall the Surviving
Corporation be required to expend for such "tail" insurance policies an
annual premium amount in excess of three hundred percent (300%) of the annual
premium currently paid by the Company for such insurance and (ii) if the
annual premium of such "tail" insurance policies exceeds three hundred
percent (300%) of the annual premium currently paid by the Company for such
insurance, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to obtain and fully
pay for policies covering such Indemnified Parties with the greatest coverage
as is then available at a cost up to but not exceeding such amount. Parent
shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, use its reasonable best
efforts to cause such "tail" insurance policies to be maintained in full force
and effect, for their full term, and to honor all of its obligations
thereunder.

(c) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) shall consolidate with or merge into any other
corporation or entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation
or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) shall transfer all or

indemnification provided for in this Section 7.12 is not prior to or in
substitution of any such claims under such policies.

of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties and their
respective heirs and legal representatives.

securities) pursuant to the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated by

Parent reasonably informed with respect to the status thereof. The Company

Stockholders Meeting taken in accordance with this Agreement; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that such agreement to vote in favor of the adoption of this
Agreement and the approval of the Mergers and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall terminate, and Parent and its
Subsidiaries shall have no obligation with respect thereto, in the event that
the Company Board (acting upon the recommendation of the Special

7.16. _Certain Tax Matters_. None of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub,
Merger Sub II, or the Surviving Corporation shall knowingly take, agree to
take or fail to take any action that would reasonably be expected to prevent
or impede the Mergers from qualifying for the Intended Tax Treatment
(including by causing Opco to be treated as other than a disregarded entity
for U.S. federal income tax purposes or by causing or permitting any Person
other than Parent to own any interests in Opco). Each Party shall cooperate in
good faith with reasonable requests made by the other Parties to determine
the qualification of the Mergers for the Intended Tax Treatment, including in
connection with the preparation and filing of the Joint Proxy Statement or the
Form S-4. Such cooperation shall include, if applicable, providing a
certificate executed by an officer of the applicable Party with applicable
representations and warranties reasonably requested by another Partys tax
advisors in connection with the delivery of an opinion regarding the
qualification of the Mergers for the Intended Tax Treatment (but only to the
extent the applicable Party believes in good faith such representations and
warranties are true and correct). In addition, as promptly as reasonably
practicable after the date hereof, the Parties shall consider in good faith
whether it would be advisable to convert Merger Sub II to a limited liability
company (or to assign Merger Sub IIs rights and obligations under
this Agreement to a limited liability company) prior to the Effective Time,
including whether such conversion or assignment would reasonably be expected
to facilitate the qualification of the Mergers for the Intended Tax Treatment.
If the Company (acting upon the recommendation of the Special Committee) and
Parent mutually agree that such conversion (or assignment) is advisable,
Parent shall take all actions necessary or appropriate to effect such
conversion (or assignment) and, to the extent required by applicable Law, the
Parties shall negotiate and cooperate in good faith to enter into an
appropriate amendment to this Agreement to give effect to such conversion (or
assignment) and provide for other changes necessitated thereby;  _provided_
that Parent shall not cause such a conversion (or assignment) if it would
reasonably be expected to impose material adverse consequences to any Party
(or the stockholders of any Party), including if it would reasonably be
expected to delay the Effective Time. The provisions of this Section 7.16
shall no longer apply if the Parties determine in good faith, after
consultation with their respective tax advisors, that the Mergers should not
qualify for the Intended Tax Treatment. For the avoidance of doubt, each
Party acknowledges and agrees that their respective obligations to effect the
Mergers are not subject to any condition or contingency with respect to (a)
the qualification of the Mergers for the Intended Tax Treatment or (b) the
delivery of any certificate or opinion described in this Section 7.16.

(b) there has been a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or

-53- 

    

(b) In the event that:

 

(i) (A) this Agreement is terminated (I) by either the Company or Parent
pursuant to Section 9.2(a), (II) by either the Company or Parent pursuant to
Section 9.2(b) or (III) by Parent pursuant to Section 9.4(b) due to a breach
by the Company of Section 7.2; and (B) (I) a _bona fide_ Company Acquisition
Proposal shall have been (1) made known to the Special Committee or publicly
made or disclosed and (2) not withdrawn (which withdrawal shall be public if
such Company Acquisition Proposal has been publicly made or disclosed) prior
to the earlier of the date of the Stockholders Meeting (including any
adjournment, recess or postponement thereof) and the time of termination of
this Agreement and (II) concurrently with or within twelve (12) months of such
termination, the Company shall have consummated a Company Acquisition
Proposal or entered into an Alternative Company Acquisition Agreement relating
to a Company Acquisition Proposal (whether or not, in each case, such Company
Acquisition Proposal is the same one as the Company Acquisition Proposal
referred to in clause (B)(I)); _provided_ that, for purposes of clause (B) of
this Section 9.5(b)(i), references to "fifteen percent (15%)" in the
definition of "Company Acquisition Proposal" shall be deemed to be references
to "fifty percent (50%)"; or

(ii) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 9.4(a);

then the Company shall pay to Parent (or its designee(s)), by wire transfer
of same-day funds, a termination fee of $35,000,000 (the " _Termination Fee_
") (x) in the case of Section 9.5(b)(ii), no later than two (2) Business Days
after the date of such termination or (y) in the case of Section 9.5(b)(i),
immediately prior to or substantially concurrent with the last to occur of the
events set forth in Section 9.5(b)(i). It is understood and agreed that in no
event shall the Company be required to pay the Termination Fee on more than
one occasion.

(c) In the event that:

 

(i) (A) this Agreement is terminated (I) by either the Company or Parent
pursuant to Section 9.2(a), (II) by either the Company or Parent pursuant to
Section 9.2(c) or (III) by the Company pursuant to Section 9.3(b) due to a
breach by Parent of Section 7.3; and (B) (I) a _bona fide_ Parent Acquisition
Proposal shall have been (1) made known to Parent or publicly made or
disclosed and (2) not withdrawn (which withdrawal shall be public if such
Parent Acquisition Proposal has been publicly made or disclosed) prior to the
earlier of the date of the Parent Stockholders Meeting (including any
adjournment, recess or postponement thereof) and the time of termination of
this Agreement and (II) concurrently with or within twelve (12) months of such
termination, Parent shall have consummated a Parent Acquisition Proposal or
entered into an Alternative Parent Acquisition Agreement relating to a Parent
Acquisition Proposal (whether or not, in each case, such Parent Acquisition
Proposal is the same one as the Parent Acquisition Proposal referred to in
clause (B)(I)); _provided_ that, for purposes of clause (B) of this Section
9.5(c)(i), references to "fifteen percent (15%)" in the definition of "Parent
Acquisition Proposal" shall be deemed to be references to "fifty percent
(50%)"; or

(ii) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section
9.3(a);

then Parent shall pay to the Company (or its designee(s)), by wire transfer
of same-day funds, a termination fee of $100,000,000 (the " _Parent
Termination Fee_ ") (x) in the case of Section 9.5(c)(ii), no later than two
(2) Business Days after the date of such termination or (y) in the case of
Section 9.5(c)(i), immediately prior to or substantially concurrent with the
last to occur of the events set forth in Section 9.5(c)(i). It is understood
and agreed that in no event shall Parent be required to pay the Parent
Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

(d) Each of the Company and Parent acknowledges that the agreements
contained in Section 9.5(b) and Section 9.5(c) are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these
agreements, the Parties would not enter into this Agreement and the damages
resulting from termination of this Agreement under circumstances where a
Termination Fee or a Parent Termination Fee is payable are uncertain and
incapable of accurate calculation and, therefore, each of the Termination Fee
payable pursuant to Section 9.5(b) and the Parent Termination Fee payable
pursuant to Section 9.5(c) is not a penalty but rather

 



-54- 

    

 constitutes an amount akin to liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that
will compensate Parent or the Company, as applicable, for the efforts and
resources expended and opportunities forgone while negotiating this Agreement
and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation
of the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Accordingly, if (i) the Company fails to promptly pay the Termination Fee due
by it pursuant to Section 9.5(b) or (ii) Parent fails to promptly pay the
Parent Termination Fee due by it pursuant to Section 9.5(c) and, in order to
obtain such payment Parent or the Company, as applicable, commences a
Proceeding that results in a judgment against the Company or Parent, as
applicable, for the Termination Fee set forth in Section 9.5(b) or the Parent
Termination Fee set forth in Section 9.5(c), the Company or Parent,
as applicable, shall pay to Parent or the Company, as applicable, their costs
and expenses (including attorneys fees) in connection with such Proceeding,
together with interest on the amount of the fee at the prime rate set forth in
_The Wall Street Journal, Eastern Edition_ , in effect on the date such
payment was required to be made from the date such payment was required to be
made through the date of payment.

 

(e) In the event that the Termination Fee is paid to Parent in
circumstances in which such fee is payable pursuant to Section 9.5(b),
payment of the Termination Fee, together with any costs and expenses and
interest payable pursuant to Section 9.5(d), shall be the sole and exclusive
remedy of Parent and its Related Persons against the Company and its Related
Persons (the " _Company Related Persons_ ") for any cost, expense, loss,
damage, liability or obligation suffered as a result of the failure of the
Mergers or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement to
be consummated or for a breach or failure to perform hereunder or otherwise,
and upon payment of such amount none of the Company or any Company Related
Persons shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising
out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The
provisions of this Section 9.5(e) are intended to be for the benefit of, and
shall be enforceable by, each of the Company Related Persons.

 

(f) In the event that the Parent Termination Fee is paid to the Company in
circumstances in which such fee is payable pursuant to Section 9.5(c),
payment of the Parent Termination Fee, together with any costs and expenses
and interest payable pursuant to Section 9.5(d), shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy of the Company and its Related Persons against Parent and
its Related Persons (the " _Parent Related Persons_ ") for any cost, expense,
loss, damage, liability or obligation suffered as a result of the failure of
the Mergers or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be
consummated or for a breach or failure to perform hereunder or otherwise, and
upon payment of such amount none of Parent or any Parent Related Persons shall
have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The provisions
of this Section 9.5(f) are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, each of the Parent Related Persons.

obligations to consummate the Mergers are for the sole benefit of such Party
and may be waived by such Party in whole or in part to the extent permitted by

power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any
single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise
thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege.

 

10.4. _GOVERNING LAW AND VENUE; WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_.

 

(a) THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE DEEMED TO BE MADE IN AND IN ALL RESPECTS SHALL
BE INTERPRETED, CONSTRUED AND GOVERNED BY AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW OF

PRINCIPLES THEREOF (OR ANY OTHER JURISDICTION) TO THE EXTENT THAT SUCH LAWS,
RULES OR PRINCIPLES WOULD DIRECT A MATTER TO ANOTHER JURISDICTION. 

(b) The Parties hereby irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of
the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, or, in the event that such
court does not have subject matter jurisdiction, the Superior Court of the
State of Delaware (Complex Commercial Division) located in New Castle County

of Delaware solely in respect of the interpretation and enforcement of the
provisions of this Agreement and of the documents referred to in this
Agreement, and in respect of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby,
and hereby waive, and agree not to assert, as a defense in any Proceeding for
the interpretation or enforcement hereof or of any such document, that it is
not subject thereto or that such Proceeding may not be brought or is not
maintainable in said courts or that the venue thereof may not be appropriate
or that this Agreement or any such document may not be enforced in or by such
courts, and the Parties irrevocably agree that all claims relating to such
Proceeding or transactions shall be heard and determined in such a Delaware
state or federal court. The Parties hereby consent to and grant any such court
jurisdiction over the person of such Parties and, to the extent permitted by
Law, over the subject matter of such dispute and agree that mailing of
process or other papers in connection with any such Proceeding in the manner
provided in Section 10.6 or in such other manner as may be permitted by Law
shall be valid and sufficient service thereof.

 

(c) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES,
AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES TO
THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE
TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE DOCUMENTS REFERRED TO HEREIN
OR THE MERGERS AND THE OTHER TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH

SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE
FOREGOING WAIVER, (ii) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE
IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (iii) EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY
AND (iv) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL

10.5. _Specific Performance_. The Parties acknowledge and agree that the
rights of each Party to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby are
special, unique and of extraordinary character and that if for any reason any
of the provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or are otherwise breached, immediate and irreparable harm
or damage would be caused for which money damages would not be an adequate
remedy. Accordingly, each Party agrees that, in addition to any other
available remedies the Parties may have in equity or at law, each Party
shall, unless this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms,
be entitled to specific performance and injunctive relief as a remedy for any
such breach including an injunction restraining any breach or violation or
threatened breach or violation of the provisions of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement exclusively in
the courts specified in Section 10.4(b), in each case without necessity of
posting a bond or other form of security. In the event that any Proceeding
should be brought in equity to enforce the provisions of this Agreement, no
Party shall allege, and each Party hereby waives the defense, that there is
an adequate remedy at law.

10.6. _Notices_. All notices, requests, instructions, consents, claims,
demands, waivers and other communications to be given or made hereunder by any
Party shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given or made
on the date of receipt by the recipient thereof if received prior to 5:00

the next succeeding Business Day) if (a) served by personal delivery or by a
nationally recognized overnight courier service upon the Party for whom it is
