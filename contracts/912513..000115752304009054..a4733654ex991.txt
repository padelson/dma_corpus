Schedule 1.1(e) in respect of the relevant plan.

                  "DEFINED BENEFIT OBLIGATION" means the present value of all
benefits attributed to past service. The actuarial method to be used to
calculate the Defined Benefit Obligation is projected unit credit. Thus, for
each future date at which a benefit might be payable under the plan, a projected
benefit value ("PBV") is calculated. If the benefit formula is based on future
compensation levels, then the PBV is calculated using an assumption as to future
compensation levels, as specified in Schedule 1.1(e). If the projected benefit
is to be paid out as an annuity, then the PBV is calculated by multiplying the
projected benefit by an annuity present value calculated taking into account the
mortality assumptions specified in Schedule 1.1(e). If benefits paid as an
annuity will be indexed for inflation, either under the terms of the plan or
under applicable law, then that indexation will also be included in the value of
the annuity, using the inflation assumption specified in Schedule 1.1(e). The
PBV so calculated is then divided into the portion attributed to past service
and the portion attributed to future service. Attribution of the PBV to past and
future service is on a straight-line basis from the date the employee was first
hired to the earlier of the date when the benefit is assumed to be paid or the
date when further service by the employee will lead to no further material
accumulation under the plan of the particular benefit being valued, other than
from future salary increases. To calculate the DBO, the present value of the PBV
attributable to past service is calculated using discount rates, turnover,
retirement, mortality, and such other assumptions as are appropriate, as
specified in Schedule 1.1(e).

to the contrary contained in this Agreement, to the extent that the sale,
assignment, sublease, transfer, conveyance or delivery or attempted sale,
sublease, assignment, transfer, conveyance or delivery to Buyer of any asset
that would be a Transferred Asset or any claim or right or any benefit arising
thereunder or resulting therefrom is prohibited by any applicable Law or would
require any governmental or third party authorizations, approvals, consents or
waivers, and such authorizations, approvals, consents or waivers shall not have
been obtained prior to the Closing, the Closing shall proceed without the sale,
assignment, sublease, transfer, conveyance or delivery of such asset, claim,
right or benefit unless such failure causes a failure of any of the


                                      -35-
<PAGE>


conditions to Closing set forth in Article 6, in which event the Closing shall
proceed only if the failed condition is waived by the party or parties entitled
to the benefit thereof. In the event that such lack of authorization, approval,
consent or waiver does not cause a failure of any of the conditions to Closing
or the failed condition is waived and the Closing proceeds without the sale,
assignment, sublease, transfer, conveyance or delivery of any such asset, claim,
right or benefit, then (i) such asset, claim, right or benefit shall be regarded
as a Transferred Asset for purposes of the calculations required under Section
2.6 if such asset is a Current Asset and (ii) following the Closing, the parties
shall use their reasonable best efforts, and cooperate with each other, to
obtain promptly such authorizations, approvals, consents or waivers; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that none of Seller or Buyer or any of their respective Affiliates
shall be required to pay any consideration therefor other than filing,
recordation or similar fees, which shall be shared equally by Buyer and Seller.
Pending such authorization, approval, consent or waiver, the parties shall
cooperate with each other in any mutually agreeable, reasonable and lawful
arrangements designed to provide to Buyer the benefits of use of such asset,
claim, right or benefit and to Seller or its Affiliates the benefits, including
any indemnities, that they would have obtained had the asset, claim, right or
benefit been conveyed to Buyer at the Closing. Once authorization, approval,
consent or waiver for the sale, assignment, sublease, transfer, conveyance or
delivery of any such asset, claim, right or benefit not sold, assigned,
subleased, transferred, conveyed or delivered at the Closing is obtained, Seller
shall or shall cause the relevant Affiliates to, assign, transfer, convey and
deliver such asset, claim, right or benefit to Buyer at no additional cost. To
the extent that any such asset, claim, right or benefit cannot be transferred or
the full benefits of use of any such asset, claim, right or benefit cannot be
provided to Buyer following the Closing pursuant to this Section 2.10, then
Buyer and Seller shall enter into such arrangements (including subleasing,
sublicensing or subcontracting) to provide to the parties hereto the economic
(taking into account Tax costs and benefits) and operational equivalent, to the
extent permitted, of obtaining such authorization, approval, consent or waiver
and the performance by Buyer of the obligations thereunder. Seller shall hold in
trust for and pay to Buyer promptly upon receipt thereof, all income, proceeds
and other monies received by Seller or any of its Affiliates in connection with
its use of any asset, claim, right or benefit (net of any Taxes and any other
costs imposed upon Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than the Transferred
Subsidiaries)) in connection with the arrangements under this Section 2.10.
Without limiting in any respect the foregoing, subject to applicable Law and the
provisions of the applicable Contracts, in the event that any consents or
waivers in respect of any restrictions on changes in control or assignment
contained in any Contract with respect to any partnership, joint venture or
similar Person in which a Transferred Subsidiary is a member or participant have
not been obtained prior to the Closing, Seller shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates to, with a view to putting Buyer or one of its Affiliates in the same
position as if it were directly a member or participant therein:

                  (i) provide to Buyer any and all economic benefits Seller or
         any of its Affiliates may have as a member of or participant in any
         such partnership, joint venture or similar Person (net of any Taxes and
         any other costs imposed on Seller or any of its Affiliates as a result
         of being a member of or participant in any such partnership, joint
         venture or similar Person or by making any assignment pursuant to this
         Section 2.10) as if Buyer were a member or participant thereof,
         including any (i) distribution of cash flow, (ii) allocation of tax
         losses, (iii) distribution of proceeds from any capital transactions
         (including refinancings, proceeds in liquidation and sales or transfers
         of assets), (iv) return of capital contributions, either in cash or in
         tangible or intangible property, (v) taxable income or gain allowable
         to the partners, and (vi) proceeds of sale, in such form as are
         received, of any transfer of all or part of such partnership, joint
         venture or similar interests;

                  (ii) provide to Buyer a written accounting of each payment
         made to Buyer pursuant to this Section 2.10, which accounting shall set
         forth the amounts received by Seller and its Affiliates and the amounts
         paid by Seller and its Affiliates pursuant to this Section 2.10;

                  (iii) at Buyer's request, in Buyer's sole discretion,
         designate one or more representatives of Buyer to attend and
         participate in, and vote at, any meetings of any boards of directors,
         committees or other governance bodies of such partnerships, joint
         ventures or similar Persons;

                  (iv) only take such actions or vote on, consent to or approve
         of any actions pertaining to such partnership, joint venture or similar
         Person as it or they shall be directed to take, elect, consent to or
         approve by Buyer, in Buyer's sole discretion;

                  (v) negotiate, agree and/or enter into only such agreements,
         contracts, leases and subleases, purchase orders, arrangements,
         commitments and licenses in respect of such partnership, joint venture
         or similar Person as Buyer shall direct Seller and its Affiliates to
         negotiate, agree and/or enter into, in Buyer's sole discretion; and

                  (vi) exercise only such rights, and perform only such
         obligations, with respect to such partnership, joint venture or similar
         Person as Buyer shall request Seller and its Affiliates to exercise and
         perform, in Buyer's sole discretion.

                  (b) Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller and its
         Affiliates against all Liabilities under each such Contract to the
         extent such Liabilities would have been incurred by Buyer if the
         applicable waiver or consent had been obtained prior to the Closing and
         Buyer had assumed such Contract.

         Section 2.11 INTERCOMPANY RECEIVABLES AND INTERCOMPANY PAYABLES. Seller
shall take all actions necessary so that, effective as of the Closing, all
Intercompany Receivables and Intercompany Payables then existing shall be
settled or otherwise eliminated and any Taxes arising from any such settlement
or elimination shall be borne by Seller in accordance with Section 5.6; PROVIDED
that the foregoing shall not apply to the Intercompany Payables described as of
the Closing on Schedule 2.11 (the "TRANSFERRED INTERCOMPANY PAYABLES"). Not less
than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall prepare and
deliver to Buyer an updated statement of the amount of each Transferred
Intercompany Payable. Subject to Buyer's consent which shall be provided within
two (2) Business Days after Seller delivers such updated statement, if at all,
such statement shall thereafter constitute Schedule 2.11.

         Section 2.12 ALLOCATION OF PURCHASE PRICE. As soon as practicable after
the final determination of the Closing Net Working Capital Value in accordance
with Section 2.6, Seller shall deliver to Buyer a statement (the "PROPOSED
ALLOCATION STATEMENT") allocating the Purchase Price (plus Assumed Liabilities,
to the extent properly taken into account under applicable Tax Laws), adjusted
as appropriate under applicable Tax Law to reflect any payments made under
Section 2.6, among the Transferred Assets, the GmbH Shares and the Shares in
accordance with applicable Tax Laws. If, within thirty (30) days after receipt
of the Proposed Allocation Statement, Buyer shall not have objected in writing
to such Proposed Allocation Statement, the Proposed Allocation shall become
binding on Buyer and Seller (the "ALLOCATION STATEMENT"). In the event that
Buyer objects in writing on a timely basis, the parties shall cooperate in good
faith to resolve any discrepancies and attempt to agree on an allocation
statement which shall become binding on Buyer and Seller. In the event that the
parties are unable in good faith to reach an agreement regarding the Allocation
Statement, each of the parties may prepare and file its Tax Returns and take any
position it sees fit. The parties agree that, except as otherwise required by
Law, Buyer and Seller shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, act
in accordance with the allocations contained in the Allocation Statement, if
any, as it may be adjusted from time to time for all Tax purposes and that
neither of them will take, or permit their respective Affiliates to take, any
position inconsistent therewith in any Tax Returns or similar filings, any
refund claim, any litigation or otherwise. If an adjustment is made to the
Purchase Price pursuant to this Agreement after an Allocation Statement is
determined, the Allocation Statement shall be adjusted in accordance with
applicable Law and as mutually agreed by Buyer and Seller under principles
similar to those required to originally determine the Allocation Statement. The
parties agree to consult with one another with respect to any Tax audit,
controversy or litigation relating to the allocation made pursuant to this
Section 2.12.

Seller or its Affiliates are obligated to treat as confidential, in each case to
the extent Related to the Business. Seller and its Affiliates have taken
reasonable steps in accordance with normal industry practice to obtain ownership
of all material works of authorship, inventions and other Intellectual Property
made by its employees, consultants and contractors not already owned by Seller
or its Affiliates by operation of Law. Without limiting the foregoing sentence,
Seller and its Affiliates have taken reasonable measures in agreements with
employees and contractors who contribute to the development of Intellectual
Property on behalf of Seller and its Affiliates to ensure that the ownership of
such Intellectual Property vests in, or is assigned to, Seller or its
Affiliates.

         (h) Except as set forth on Schedule 3.14(h), Seller and its Affiliates
are not obligated to make and have not within the past three (3) years made
payments by way of royalties, advances, profit sharing, commissions or fees to
any Person in amounts totaling (euro)300,000 or more per year in respect of any
individual Intellectual Property Contract currently in effect.

         (i) Except as set forth on Schedule 3.14(i), the Owned Intellectual
Property, the rights under the Intellectual Property Contracts including the
Licensed-In Intellectual Property, the rights under the IT Hardware Contracts
and the Licensed IP constitute all Intellectual Property necessary to conduct
the Business as conducted at any time between January 1, 2004 and the Closing
and, immediately after the Closing, necessary for Buyer to continue to operate
and conduct the Business as conducted at any time between January 1, 2004 and
the Closing. The Licensed Computer Software is not primarily related to the
Business.

         (j) The IT Assets used in the Business operate and perform in all
material respects in accordance with their documentation and functional
specifications and otherwise as required by Seller and its Affiliates in
connection with the Business, and have not materially malfunctioned or
materially failed within the past two (2) years. As set forth in Schedule
3.14(j), Seller maintains, and causes the Transferred Subsidiaries to maintain,
systems and procedures designed to protect the Seller's and Transferred
Subsidiaries' computer systems against damage by "malicious code" (as defined in
Schedule 3.14(j)), including by detecting and preventing the intrusion of
malicious code. To the Knowledge of Seller, no Computer Software comprising
Owned Intellectual Property is subject to the terms of any "open source,"
"copyleft," or other similar licenses in a manner that would require the source
code of the Computer Software to be licensed or publicly distributed. Seller and
its Affiliates have implemented reasonable backup and disaster recovery
technology for the Business consistent with industry practices.

         (k) Except as set forth on Schedule 3.14(k), in connection with the
Films Separation, neither Seller nor its Affiliates have licensed, provided or
otherwise made available to any Person (other than a Transferred Subsidiary) any
Business Intellectual Property in any fields of use encompassed within the
Business, or competitive with or reasonably expected to be competitive with the
Business. Except as set forth on Schedule 3.14(k), since January 1, 2004,
neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates have licensed, provided or otherwise
made available to any of its Affiliates (other than a Transferred Subsidiary)
any business Intellectual Property in any fields of use encompassed within the
Business, or competitive with or reasonably expected to be competitive with the
Business. The agreements entered into between Seller and/or its Affiliates and
Hamsard 2724 Limited or its Affiliates in connection with the Films Separation
are not used in or held for use in the Seller Amino Resins Business.

         Section 3.15 EMPLOYEE BENEFITS. (a) Except as set forth on Schedule
3.15(a), all current employees of Seller and its Affiliates who have devoted
more than fifty percent of their working hours to the Business since January 1,
2004 (together with the individuals listed on Schedule 3.15(a), the "BUSINESS
DESIGNATED EMPLOYEES") are employed by a Transferred Subsidiary, and (ii) no
current employees of Seller and its Affiliates who have devoted less than fifty
percent of their working hours to the Business since January 1, 2004 are
employed by a Transferred Subsidiary.

         (b) As of or prior to the Closing, Seller shall cause (i) the
employment of those employees of the Transferred Subsidiaries who devote their
working hours to the Films Business to be transferred to Seller or an Affiliate
of Seller that is not a Transferred Subsidiary and (ii) the accrued benefits and
rights of such employees and of former employees of the Films Business who are
not Transferred Employees and Liabilities related to such accrued benefits and
rights to be transferred to a Benefit Plan of Seller or an Affiliate of Seller
that is not a Transferred Subsidiary and Seller shall be responsible for the

         (c) The Financial Statements and the Most Recent Balance Sheet reflect
accrual of all unpaid bonuses and vacation days in respect of all Business
Designated Employees, other than the integration bonuses referred to in Section
5.7(e).

Non-U.S. Benefit Plans and Schedule 3.15(d)(ii) sets forth a complete list of
all written U.S. Benefit Plans; PROVIDED that in each case Seller will not be
obligated to list (i) any Benefit Plan that is immaterial in relationship to the
total compensation and benefits paid or provided to the group of employees
covered under each such Benefit Plan or (ii) individual employment agreements
that do not require payment of base compensation in excess of (euro)150,000.

         (e) Seller has provided or made available to Buyer true and complete
copies of all material written Non-U.S. Benefit Plans and any related trust
agreements or other funding documents and a summary of the material terms of any
material unwritten Benefit Plan.

         (f) NON-U.S. BENEFIT PLANS.

                  (i) All benefit and compensation plans, contracts, policies,
         agreements or arrangements (other than U.S. Benefit Plans and plans,
         contracts, policies, agreements or arrangements operated by any
         Government Entity) (A) maintained by a Transferred Subsidiary or Seller
         or any of its Affiliates (other than a Transferred Subsidiary) for the
         benefit of Business Designated Employees or current or former employees
         or directors of a Transferred Subsidiary, (B) in respect of which any
         Transferred Subsidiary or, in relation to the Business Designated
         Employees, Seller or any of its other Affiliates has contributed, or
         (C) in respect of which any Transferred Subsidiary has any material
         liability (whether actual or contingent), including, but not limited to
         plans providing benefits on retirement, early retirement, death,
         termination of employment (whether voluntary or not), or during periods
         of sickness or disablement, or any deferred or incentive compensation,
         welfare, healthcare, medical, stock or stock-related award plans,
         including, without limitation, individual pension commitments,
         "jubilee" pension benefits and retirement and termination indemnity
         arrangements (such plans, contracts, agreements, policies and
         arrangements hereinafter being referred to as "NON-U.S. BENEFIT PLANS")
         have been administered in accordance with their terms and are in
         compliance with applicable Laws and contracts, except for any failures
         to so administer or be in compliance that, individually and in the
         aggregate, are not reasonably likely to have a Business Material
         Adverse Effect. To the Knowledge of Seller, no proposal has been
         announced to establish any new Non-U.S. Benefit Plan that would result
         in a material increase in the liability of the Transferred Subsidiaries
         for employment or other benefit obligations. All required filings for
         all Non-U.S. Benefit Plans have been made on time and with the
         appropriate Government Entity, except for any failures to timely file
         that, individually and in the aggregate, are not reasonably likely to
         have a Business Material Adverse Effect. As of the date hereof, there
         is no pending or, to the Knowledge of Seller, threatened material
         litigation relating to Non-U.S. Benefit Plans.

         employment practices, terms and conditions of employment, occupational
         health, safety, wages and hours, (ii) have withheld all amounts

         Non-U.S. Benefit Plans to be withheld from the wages, salaries or other
         payments to the Business Designated Employees and former employees of
         the Transferred Subsidiaries, (iii) in respect of the Business
         Designated Employees or former employees of the Transferred
         Subsidiaries, are not liable for any arrears, wages, Taxes or any
         penalty for failure to comply with the foregoing, and (iv) are not
         liable for any payment to any trust or other fund or to any Government
         Entity with respect to unemployment compensation benefits, workers
         compensation, social security or other benefits for Business Designated
         Employees or former employees of the Transferred Subsidiaries for any
         amounts other than payments not yet due, in each case under any
         applicable provisions of Non-U.S. Benefit Plans and any applicable
         Laws, except, in any such case, for any failures to comply, failures to
         withhold or liabilities that, individually and in the aggregate, are
         not reasonably likely to have a Business Material Adverse Effect.

                  (iii) All material contributions that the Transferred
         Subsidiaries (or in relation to the Business Designated Employees,
         Seller or any other Affiliate of Seller) are required to make to any
         Non-U.S. Benefit Plan have been fully and timely paid when due.

     (g) U.S. BENEFIT PLANS.

          (i) True and complete copies of all benefit and compensation plans,
     contracts, policies, agreements or arrangements (A) maintained by a
     Transferred Subsidiary for the benefit of Business Designated Employees or
     current or former employees or directors of a Transferred Subsidiary, (B)
     in respect of which any Transferred Subsidiary or, in relation to the
     Business Designated Employees, Seller or any of its other Affiliates has
     contributed, or (C) in respect of which any Transferred Subsidiary has any
     material liability (whether actual or contingent), in each case maintained
     in the United States primarily for the benefit of employees working inside
     the United States, including, but not limited to, "employee benefit plans"
     within the meaning of Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income
     Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA"), and deferred compensation,
     stock option, stock purchase, stock appreciation rights, stock based,
     incentive and bonus plans (the "U.S. BENEFIT PLANS"), have been provided or
     made available to Buyer, to the extent any such U.S. Benefit Plan is in
     writing, and any related trust instruments, insurance contracts and, with
     respect to any employee stock ownership plan, loan agreements forming a
     part of any U.S. Benefit Plan, and all amendments thereto have been
     provided or made available to Buyer. Each U.S. Benefit Plan that has
     received a favorable opinion or determination letter from the Internal
     Revenue Service National Office, including any master or prototype plan,
     has been separately identified on Schedule 3.15(e).


                                      -54-
<PAGE>

          (ii) All U.S. Benefit Plans, other than "multiemployer plans" within
     the meaning of Section 3(37) of ERISA (each, a "MULTIEMPLOYER PLAN"), are
     in compliance with ERISA, the Code and other applicable Laws, except for
     any failures to comply that, individually and in the aggregate, are not
     reasonably likely to have a Business Material Adverse Effect. Each U.S.
     Benefit Plan which is subject to ERISA (the "ERISA PLANS") that is an
     "employee pension benefit plan" within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA
     (a "U.S. PENSION PLAN") and that is intended to be qualified under Section
     401(a) of the Code, has received a favorable determination letter from the
     Internal Revenue Service covering all Tax Law changes prior to the Economic
     Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 or has applied to the
     Internal Revenue Service for such favorable determination letter within the
     applicable remedial amendment period under Section 401(b) of the Code, and
     Seller has no Knowledge of any circumstances likely to result in the loss
     of the qualification of such ERISA Plan under Section 401(a) of the Code.
     Neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates has engaged in a transaction with
     respect to any ERISA Plan that, assuming the taxable period of such
     transaction expired as of the date hereof, is reasonably likely to subject
     any Transferred Subsidiary to a Tax or penalty imposed by either Section
     4975 of the Code or Section 502(i) of ERISA in an amount which is
     reasonably likely to have a Business Material Adverse Effect.

          (iii) No liability under Subtitle C or D of Title IV of ERISA has been
     or is expected to be incurred by Seller or any of its Affiliates with
     respect to any ongoing, frozen or terminated "single-employer plan", within
     the meaning of Section 4001(a)(15) of ERISA, currently or formerly
     maintained by any of them, or the single-employer plan of any entity which
     is considered one employer with Seller and its Affiliates under Section
     4001 of ERISA or Section 414 of the Code (an "ERISA AFFILIATE"), other than
     any such liability that, individually and in the aggregate, has not and
     would not reasonably be expected to result in the incurrence of any
     material liability by any Transferred Subsidiary or, following the Closing,
     Buyer or any of its Affiliates. Seller and its Affiliates have not incurred
     and do not reasonably expect to incur any material withdrawal liability
     with respect to a Multiemployer Plan under Subtitle E of Title IV of ERISA
     (regardless of whether based on contributions of an ERISA Affiliate).


                                      -55-

          (iv) All material contributions required to be made by the Transferred
     Subsidiaries and, with respect to the Business Designated Employees, Seller
     and its other Affiliates under each U.S. Benefit Plan, as of the date
     hereof, have been timely made. Neither any U.S. Pension Plan nor any
     single-employer plan of an ERISA Affiliate has an "accumulated funding
     deficiency" (whether or not waived) within the meaning of Section 412 of
     the Code or Section 302 of ERISA and no ERISA Affiliate has an outstanding
     funding waiver.

     (h) Except as may be provided under the terms of the Benefit Plans,
required under the Laws of a Government Entity that is not a U.S. entity or
contemplated by this Agreement, the execution of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will not alone or together
with a related event (i) entitle any of the Business Designated Employees to
severance pay or any increase in severance pay upon any termination of
employment after the date hereof, (ii) other than as expressly provided in this
Agreement, accelerate the time of payment or vesting, or require any payment or
funding (through a grantor trust or otherwise) of material compensation or
benefits under, or increase by a material amount the amount payable under, any
of the Benefit Plans in respect of any Transferred Employee, or (iii) result in
payments under any of the U.S. Benefit Plans which would not be deductible under
Section 162(m) of the Code.

     Section 3.16 LABOR. (a) Except as set forth in Schedule 3.16(a), neither
Seller nor any of its Affiliates is a party to or bound by any company specific
labor agreements, union contracts and collective bargaining agreements in
respect of the Business Designated Employees.

     (b) The Transferred Subsidiaries and, with respect to the Business
Designated Employees, Seller and its other Affiliates are in compliance with all
labor Laws applicable to the Business and the Business Designated Employees, and
are not engaged in any unfair labor practices or similar prohibited practices
with respect to Business Designated Employees, except for any failures to comply
or engagement in such practices that, individually or in the aggregate, are not
reasonably likely to have a Business Material Adverse Effect.

     (c) There is no pending or, to the Knowledge of Seller, threatened, strike,
walkout or other work stoppage or any union organizing effort by any of the
Business Designated Employees.

     (d) There is no material unfair labor practice charge or complaint against
the Business or any of the Transferred Subsidiaries pending or, to the Knowledge
of Seller, threatened, before any Government Entity.

     (e) Neither the Transferred Subsidiaries nor, with respect to the Business,
Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than the Transferred Subsidiaries) has
taken any action which could be construed as a "plant closing" or "mass layoff,"
as those terms are defined in WARN.

     (f) As of the date hereof, Seller and its Affiliates have complied in all
material respects with all applicable obligations under the labor Laws of any
jurisdiction and any collective bargaining agreements applicable to the Business
Designated Employees to inform and consult with the shop committees, workers'
councils or other employee bodies of Seller and its Affiliates in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby, the Films Separation, the Pre-Signing
Restructuring Transactions, the Post-Signing Restructuring Transactions.

     Affiliates at a price less than Seller's or its Affiliates' cost of
     producing such goods or providing such services;

          (vi) all Contracts providing for any loan or advance to, or investment
     in, any Person;

          (vii) all Contracts that would require Buyer or any of its Affiliates
     or any of their respective successors or assigns to provide for
     indemnification or contribution with respect to any matter;

          (xiii) all Contracts to which any Government Entity is a party.

     The Contracts described in sections (i)-(xii) hereof are collectively, the
"MATERIAL CONTRACTS").

     (b) Each Material Contract and each Contract required to be listed on
Schedule 3.14(a)(iii), (iv), (v) or (vi) is a valid and binding agreement of
Seller or one or more of its Affiliates, as the case may be, and is in full
force and effect and, to the Knowledge of Seller, is enforceable against each
party thereto in accordance with the express terms thereof. There does not exist
under any Material Contract or any Contract required to be listed on Schedule
3.14(a)(iii), (iv), (v) or (vi) any violation, breach or event of default, or
alleged violation, breach or event of default, or event or condition that, after
notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a violation, breach or event
of default thereunder on the part of Seller or any of its Affiliates or, to the
Knowledge of Seller, any other party thereto, except as described in Schedule
3.17(b).

     Section 3.18 SUFFICIENCY OF ASSETS. The Transferred Assets and the assets
of the Transferred Subsidiaries (other than the Retained Assets), when taken
together with any assets or services to be provided by Seller or its Affiliates
(other than the Transferred Subsidiaries) pursuant to the Ancillary Agreements
and the Excluded Assets (other than those contemplated by Sections 2.2(i) and
2.2(iv)), constitute all the assets, properties and rights of Seller and its
Affiliates other than the Intellectual Property necessary to conduct the
Business as conducted at any time between January 1, 2004 and the Closing

been transferred to a third party in the Ordinary Course or that have become
obsolete or unusable in the Ordinary Course) and, immediately after the Closing,
necessary for Buyer to continue to operate and conduct the Business as conducted
at any time between January 1, 2004 and the Closing. No assets that are Related
to the Business have been transferred or are contemplated to be transferred to a

Retained Liabilities). No part of the Business is currently operated by Seller
through any entity other than Seller, the Transferred Subsidiaries and the
Seller Subsidiaries described in Schedule 3.18 in respect of the Transferred
Assets held by such Seller Subsidiaries as of the date hereof that are listed
for each such Seller Subsidiary on Schedule 3.18. For the avoidance of doubt, no
representation or warranty is made under this Section 3.18 with respect to
sufficiency of any Intellectual Property, the sole representation and warranties

Subsidiaries do not own any real property other than the Owned Real Property

party thereto.

defects, with no material alterations or repairs required thereto under
applicable Law or insurance company requirements; and (ii) is suitable in all
material respects for its current use, operation and occupancy.

     (c) The ownership, occupancy, use and operation of the Owned Real Property
and, to the Knowledge of Seller, the Leased Real Property has complied and

Transferred Subsidiaries or any services provided by the Business or any
Transferred Subsidiaries (a "PRODUCT"), or claim or lawsuit involving a Product
which is pending or, to the Knowledge of Seller, threatened, by any Person, and
(b) there has not been, nor is there under consideration by the Business or any

hereunder is necessary to avoid violating applicable Law, then Buyer or Seller,
as applicable, shall provide the other party with prompt notice of such

other party to the extent it may seek to limit such disclosure. In such case, in

disclosing party, the disclosing party may disclose such information, knowledge
or data without liability hereunder, but such disclosing party shall disclose

reasonable best efforts to obtain a confidentiality order or undertaking with
respect to such information.

     (f) In the event of a breach of the obligations hereunder by Buyer or

     (g) Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to restrict either Buyer
or Seller or their respective Affiliates from using any skills or experience of
a general nature (as distinguished from the tangible embodiment of such skills
or experience) that are retained in the unaided memory of any such Person's
current or former employees or consultants who have had access or exposure to
information belonging to the other party.

     authority, Buyer shall commit to (x) "hold separate" and to divest
     particular assets located or utilized at the Brazilian and Spanish Plants
     to the extent those assets relate to the Seller Amino Resins Business;
     and/or (y) enter into ancillary agreements pursuant to which Buyer would
     (i) produce products relating to the Seller Amino Resins Business using the
     Brazilian and Spanish Plants for purchase on an arms-length basis by any
     Person that purchases the Seller Amino Resins Business from Buyer and its
     Affiliates (including the Transferred Subsidiaries), and/or (ii) agree not

     indemnify Seller for all reasonable expenses, costs and Liabilities
     incurred by Seller in fulfillment of its obligation to use its reasonable
     best efforts to separate the Seller Amino Resins Business pursuant to
     Section 5.5(c)(ii); PROVIDED that the parties' allocation of responsibility
     for any Liabilities of Seller and its Affiliates existing prior to such
     divesture shall not be affected by this sentence; provided, further, that
     Buyer shall not be liable for Seller's costs and expenses to the extent
     such costs and expenses result from any Taxes that Seller would have
     incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby without
     regard to Seller's actions pursuant to Section 5.5(c).

          (v) From and after the date hereof until the Closing, Seller and its
     Affiliates shall not, without Buyer's consent, make individual or related
     series of capital expenditures with respect to the Seller Amino Resins

     (d) OTHER ACTIONS. Except as set forth in subsection (c), nothing in this

Subsidiaries, in whole or in part, (A) sell, divest, dispose of or hold separate
any other assets or businesses or license any rights, or otherwise take or
commit to take, or refrain or commit to refrain from taking, any action that

retain, one or more businesses, product lines, intellectual property rights or
assets, or its ability to operate any business or exercise any intellectual
property right; or (B) litigate or defend against any administrative or judicial
action or proceeding (including any proceeding seeking a temporary restraining
order or preliminary or permanent injunction or any decision prohibiting the
sale of the Transferred Subsidiaries or the Transferred Assets pursuant to this

Ancillary Agreements or by the Stockholder's Agreement as violative of any U.S.
Antitrust Law, the EC Merger Regulation or any other Law, except, in the case of
each of clauses (A) and (B), for filing, recordation or similar fees and for
such other actions such as are, individually and in the aggregate, immaterial
relative to the Business, Buyer and its Affiliates (taken as a whole) and the
synergies or other benefits expected to be received by Buyer from the
transactions contemplated hereby (each action listed in clause (A) or clause
(B), a "BUYER ADVERSE CONDITION"). If, at any time, Buyer determines that it is
not prepared to accept an action requested by a Government Antitrust Entity that
is additional to that required by Section 5.5(c) above, Buyer shall promptly
notify Seller in writing of that determination. Such notice will state whether,
in the good faith judgment of Buyer, such action constitutes a Buyer Adverse
Condition.

contribute to the payment of a Tax determined on a consolidated, combined fiscal
unity or similar foreign basis, or unitary basis with respect to a group of
corporations that includes or included any Transferred Subsidiary and Taxes
resulting from a Transferred Subsidiary ceasing to be a member of Seller's group
of Affiliates) (i) of Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than the
Transferred Subsidiaries) for any taxable year except as provided in Section
5.6(c), or (ii) of the Transferred Subsidiaries, in respect of the Transferred
Assets or for which any Transferred Subsidiary may otherwise be liable, for any
taxable year or period that ends on or before the Closing Date (each, a
"PRE-CLOSING PERIOD") and, with respect to any taxable year or period beginning
before and ending after the Closing Date (each, a "STRADDLE PERIOD"), the
portion of such taxable year ending on and including the Closing Date, PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that Seller shall not be liable for (i) any value added Taxes
attributable to any Transferred Subsidiary that are properly reflected as
accrued in the statutory accounts of the Transferred Subsidiary, (ii) any
employment Taxes imposed in respect of any Transferred Employee not due and
payable on or before the Closing Date and attributable to, and to be withheld
from, employee compensation payments to be made after the Closing Date, (iii)
any Taxes that result, in whole or in part, from an action taken solely by or at
the direction of the Buyer on or after the Closing, which actions for the
avoidance of doubt exclude the transactions between Buyer and Seller that are
described in Section 2.1, (iv) any Taxes that result, in whole or in part, from
an election under Section 338 of the Code (or any corresponding or similar
elections under state, local or foreign Tax law), and that Buyer shall be liable
for and indemnify, defend and hold Seller harmless from and against any and all
such Taxes. Except as set forth in Section 5.6(f), Seller shall be entitled to

     (c) BUYER LIABILITY FOR TAXES. Except as set forth in Sections 5.6(a) and
(b), Buyer shall be liable for and indemnify, defend and hold Seller harmless
from and against any and all Taxes of the Transferred Subsidiaries or in respect
of the Transferred Assets for any taxable year or period that begins after the
Closing Date (each, a "POST-CLOSING PERIOD") and, with respect to any Straddle
Period, the portion of such Straddle Period beginning after the Closing Date,
and any and all Taxes allocated to Buyer under the proviso of Section 5.6(b).
Buyer shall be entitled to any refund of Taxes of the Transferred Subsidiaries
or in respect of Transferred Assets received for such periods or in respect of
Taxes allocated to Buyer under the provision of Section 5.6(b). Seller shall
promptly pay to Buyer the amount of any refund made available to Seller to which
Buyer is entitled under this Section 5.6.

     (d) ALLOCATION OF TAXES FOR SHORT TAXABLE YEAR. For purposes of Section
5.6(b) and (c), whenever it is necessary to determine the liability for Taxes of
a Transferred Subsidiary or in respect of a Transferred Asset for a Straddle
Period, the determination of the Taxes of the Transferred Subsidiary or in
respect of the Transferred Asset for the portion of the year or period ending
on, and the portion of the year or period beginning after, the Closing Date
shall be determined by, in the case of Taxes that are based upon or related to
income or receipts, assuming that the Transferred Subsidiary had, and the
allocation of Taxes in respect of the Transferred Asset is made with respect to,
a taxable year or period which ended at the close of the Closing Date, and in
the case of any Taxes other than Taxes based upon or related to income or
receipts, be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire Taxable period
multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days in the
Taxable period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the
number of days in the entire Taxable period, except that (i) exemptions,
allowances or deductions that are calculated on an annual or other periodic
basis, such as the deduction for depreciation, shall be apportioned on a time
basis, and (ii) Tax items addressed in Sections 5.6(b) and (c) shall be
allocated consistently under this Section 5.6(d).

     (e) ADJUSTMENT TO PURCHASE PRICE. To the extent permitted by applicable
Law, any payment by Buyer or Seller under this Section 5.6 shall be treated by
Buyer and Seller as an adjustment to the Purchase Price and allocated according
to Section 2.12.

     (f) REFUNDS FROM CARRYBACKS. To the extent permissible under applicable Tax
Law, Buyer or Seller, as the case may be, shall make the appropriate elections
to waive any option to carryback to a Pre-Closing Period any losses, credits or
similar items realized in a Post-Closing Period by a Transferred Subsidiary or
with respect to a Transferred Asset ("POST-CLOSING TAX ATTRIBUTES"). If Seller
becomes entitled to a refund, reduction or credit of Taxes for any Pre-Closing
Period and such amounts are attributable to the carryback of any Post-Closing
Tax Attributes, then Seller shall within ten (10) Business Days of receipt of
payment, pay to Buyer the amount of such refund, reduction or credit received
together with any interest actually collected thereon, PROVIDED, HOWEVER, Seller
shall only be liable for the payment of amounts under this Section 5.6(f) to the
extent in the reasonable judgment of Seller's tax director that Seller has
realized a net Tax savings as a result of the carryback of Post-Closing Tax
Attributes. In the event a refund is paid to Buyer pursuant to this Section
5.6(f) and a Tax authority subsequently claims that all or a portion of the
refund was not payable, Buyer shall repay the refund together with interest
within ten (10) Business Days of Seller's written demand. For the sake of
clarity and avoidance of doubt, to the extent permissible under applicable Tax
Law, Seller shall be permitted to carryback any losses, credits or similar items
realized by a Transferred Subsidiary or with respect to a Transferred Asset in a
Pre-Closing Period.

     (g) TAX RETURNS. Except as set forth in Section 5.6(a), Seller shall
prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed all Tax Returns
with respect to the Transferred Subsidiaries or any Transferred Asset for all
Pre-Closing Periods and all Straddle Periods (if any) ending on or prior to
December 31, 2004. Buyer shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause
to be filed all Tax Returns with respect to the Transferred Subsidiaries or any
Transferred Asset for all Post-Closing Periods and all Straddle Periods (if any)
ending after December 31, 2004, it being understood that Buyer shall (i) file,
or shall cause to filed, any amended Tax Return and claims for refunds or
credits reasonably requested by Seller, and (ii) elect, or cause the appropriate
Affiliate of Buyer to elect, to carry back any item of loss, deduction or credit
(which arises with respect to a Pre-Closing Period) to the extent permitted by
applicable Tax Law. The party that is not responsible for preparing a Tax Return
with respect to a Straddle Period shall be entitled to review and comment on
such Tax Return before it is filed, and the party preparing such Tax Return
shall use reasonable efforts to accommodate requests to review such Tax Return.
Any Taxes payable from any amount allocated pursuant to Sections 5.6(b) or
5.6(c) to a party that is not responsible for the filing of the Tax Return to
which such amount relates shall be paid to the party preparing such Tax Return
no later than ten (10) Business Days prior to the filing of the underlying Tax
Return.

     (h) CONTEST PROVISIONS. Buyer shall promptly notify Seller in writing upon
receipt by Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including the Transferred
Subsidiaries) of notice of any pending or threatened Tax audits or assessments
which may affect the Tax Liabilities for which Seller would be required to
indemnify Buyer pursuant to Section 5.6(a) or (b), PROVIDED that any failure to
comply with this provision shall not affect Buyer's right to indemnification
hereunder to the extent such failure does not prejudice Seller's ability to
defend such audit or assessment or increases the amount of such Taxes. Seller
shall have the sole right to represent the relevant Transferred Subsidiary's
interests in any Tax audit or administrative or court proceeding relating to
Pre-Closing Periods, and to employ counsel of its choice at its expense, except
that Buyer shall have the sole right to represent the Transferred Subsidiaries
in any Tax audit or administrative or court proceeding relating to issues that
might give rise to an indemnification obligation of Buyer with respect to any
Pre-Closing Periods pursuant to Section 5.6(b). Seller shall be entitled to
settle either administratively or after the commencement of litigation without
the consent of Buyer any claim for Taxes related to Tax audits or proceedings
described in Schedule 5.6(h). Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller shall not be
entitled to settle, either administratively or after the commencement of
litigation, any claim for Taxes represented by Seller that is not described in
Schedule 5.6(h) and that may materially affect the liability for Taxes of Buyer
or any Transferred Subsidiary for any period ending after the Closing Date to
any extent (including, but not limited to, the imposition of income Tax
deficiencies, the reduction of asset basis or cost adjustments, the lengthening
of any amortization or depreciation periods, the denial of amortization or
depreciation deductions, or the reduction of loss or credit carryforwards,
except for such reductions of loss or credit carryforward realized in a
Pre-Closing Period) without the prior written consent of Buyer, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld. Such consent shall not be necessary to the
extent that Seller has agreed in writing to indemnify Buyer against the effects
of any such settlement. Seller shall be entitled to participate at its expense
in the defense of any claim for Taxes for a year or period ending after the
Closing Date which may be the subject of indemnification by Seller pursuant to
Section 5.6(b) and, with the written consent of Buyer, and at its sole expense,
may assume the entire defense of such Tax claim. Neither Buyer nor any
Transferred Subsidiary may agree to settle any Tax claim for the portion of the
year or period ending on the Closing Date which may be the subject of
indemnification by Seller under Section 5.6(b) without the prior written consent
of Seller, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

     (i) TERMINATION OF TAX ALLOCATION AGREEMENTS. Any Tax allocation or sharing
agreement or arrangement, whether or not written, that has been entered into by
Seller or any Affiliate of Seller (other than the Transferred Subsidiaries) on
the one hand and any Transferred Subsidiary on the other shall be extinguished
and terminated as to each affected Transferred Subsidiary as of the Closing
Date, and any rights or obligations existing under any such agreement or
arrangement to be no longer enforceable and no payments that are owed by or to a
Transferred Subsidiary pursuant thereto shall be made thereunder.

all information, records, and documents relating to Taxes of Seller, its
Affiliates or any Transferred Subsidiary or in respect of any Transferred Asset;
(iv) provide timely notice to the other in writing of any pending or threatened
Tax audits or assessments of Seller, its Affiliates or any Transferred
Subsidiary or in respect of any Transferred Asset for taxable periods for which
the other may have a liability under this Section 5.6; and (v) furnish the other
with copies of all correspondence received from any taxing authority in
connection with any Tax audit or information request with respect to any such
taxable period. Such cooperation shall include making employees available on a
mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of
any material provided hereunder that are reasonably relevant to any such Tax
Returns, audit, litigation or other proceeding. Seller will provide to Buyer
upon request all necessary information in order to permit Buyer to apply the
provisions of Section 41(f)(3)(A) of the Code.

          (ii) From and after the Closing, Buyer shall, or shall cause the Buyer
     Subsidiaries (including the Transferred Subsidiaries) to, cause each Buyer
     Benefit Plan in which Transferred Employees are or will become eligible to
     participate to credit for purposes of eligibility to participate or receive
     any level of benefits and vesting thereunder (but not for purposes of
     benefit accrual) the service of such employees with Seller or its
     Affiliates (including the Transferred Subsidiaries) prior to the Closing as
     if such service were with Buyer or its Affiliates, to the same extent as
     such service was credited for such purpose by Seller or its Affiliates
     prior to the Closing, PROVIDED that no such service credit will be required
     to the extent it would result in a duplication of benefits; PROVIDED
     FURTHER, that Transferred Employees covered under the Retained Plans shall,
     in addition to the foregoing, receive credit for service for purposes of
     benefit accrual under each Buyer Benefit Plan that receives assets
     transferred from a Retained Plan, either through an asset transfer or
     through the purchase price adjustment in accordance with Article II of this
     Agreement. Subject to compliance with Section 5.7(b) and (c), nothing
     herein shall limit the ability of Buyer or the Buyer Subsidiaries
     (including the Transferred Subsidiaries) to amend or terminate any of their
     respective Buyer Benefit Plans in accordance with their terms and
     applicable Law at any time. Seller and its Affiliates (other than the
     Transferred Subsidiaries) shall retain all Liabilities in respect of
     severance or other termination costs or indemnities for any employee of
     Seller or its Affiliates (other than the Transferred Subsidiaries);

     aggregate cost of (euro)200,000.

          (iii) If any Transferred Employee becomes eligible to participate in a
     Buyer Benefit Plan that provides medical, dental, vision or other health
     benefits or disability or life insurance benefits, Buyer shall use its
     commercially reasonable efforts to cause each such Buyer Benefit Plan to
     (A) waive any preexisting condition limitations to the extent such
     conditions would have been covered under an analogous Benefit Plan that was
     applicable to such Transferred Employee (or his or her eligible dependents)
     immediately prior to the Closing Date or, if later, the commencement of
     such Transferred Employee's participation in such Buyer Benefit Plan, (B)
     waive any waiting period limitation or evidence of insurability requirement
     which would otherwise be applicable to such Transferred Employee (or his or
     her eligible dependents) on or after the Closing Date to the extent such
     Transferred Employee (or his or her eligible dependents) had satisfied any
     similar limitation or requirement under an analogous Benefit Plan that was
     applicable to such Transferred Employee immediately prior to the Closing
     Date or, if later, the commencement of such Transferred Employee's
     participation in such Buyer Benefit Plan, and (C) recognize under such
     Buyer Benefit Plan any co-payments, deductible payments, premium amounts

     Employee's participation in such Buyer Benefit Plan.

          (iv) Within the later of (i) 90 days following the Closing Date and
     (ii) 15 days from the final determination of the amount of the assets to be
     transferred pursuant to this Section 5.7(c)(iv), the Seller shall use its
     commercially reasonable efforts to transfer, and to cause any of its
     Affiliates or any third party holding relevant assets to transfer, the
     amount under each of the Asset Transfer Plans that may be transferred in
     respect of the Transferred Employees who are participants in each such
     Asset Transfer Plan immediately prior to the Closing to a Buyer Benefit
     Plan that is defined benefit plan maintained in accordance with all
     applicable laws of relevant jurisdiction and rules and regulations of
     applicable Government Entities and that are intended to qualify for any
     special tax treatment under the applicable Tax Laws of such jurisdiction
     for which the corresponding Asset Transfer Plan is intended to qualify. The
     amount of assets to be transferred in respect of the Transferred Employees
     participating in each Asset Transfer Plan shall be determined in accordance
     with applicable Law, the rules of the relevant plan and the principles set
     forth in Schedule 1.1(d). Buyer shall provide evidence to Seller of the

     its commercially reasonable efforts to transfer, and to cause any of its

     under each of the Seller DC Plans that are held in respect of the
     Transferred Employees participating in each such Seller DC Plan immediately
     prior to the Closing to Buyer Benefit Plans that are defined contribution
     plans in accordance with all applicable Laws of the relevant jurisdictions
     and rules and regulations of applicable Government Entities and that are
     intended to qualify for any special tax treatment under the applicable Tax
     Laws of such jurisdiction for which the corresponding Seller DC Plan is
     intended to qualify. The amount of assets to be transferred in respect of
     the Transferred Employees participating in each such Seller DC Plan shall
     equal the sum of the account balances of the applicable Transferred
     Employees under such plan, determined as of the last valuation date for the
     relevant plan immediately prior to the actual date of the transfer of
     assets and otherwise in accordance with applicable Law and the rules of the
     relevant Seller DC Plan (and, for the avoidance of doubt, the full balance
     of each such Transferred Employee shall be vested regardless of service).
     The transferred amount shall include interest at LIBOR on each account
     balance, credited based on the time elapsed between the date of the
     relevant valuation and the date of the transfer. Buyer shall provide
     evidence to Seller of the tax, legal and regulatory qualification of the
     relevant Buyer Defined Contribution Plans reasonably satisfactory to Seller
     prior to the transfer of any such assets. Seller and Buyer agree to
     cooperate in good faith to implement the foregoing.

     the formalities for transferring assets under defined benefit plans
     organized in the U.K., if any Transferred Employee who participates in the
     U.K. Retained Plan (a "U.K. EMPLOYEE PARTICIPANT") so elects, Seller shall
     use its commercially reasonable efforts to arrange a transfer of the assets
     and liabilities held in respect of such U.K. Employee Participant under the
     U.K. Retained Plan to a Buyer Benefit Plan that is a defined benefit plan
     maintained by Buyer in accordance with the applicable laws of the U.K. and
     any rules and regulations of any applicable U.K. Government Entity and that
     is intended to qualify for any special tax treatment under the applicable
     Tax Laws of the U.K. for which the U.K. Retained Plan is intended to
     qualify. The amount of assets to be transferred in respect of those U.K.
     Employee Participants who so elect shall be determined in accordance with
     applicable Law and the rules of the U.K. Retained Plan. Buyer shall provide
     evidence to Seller of the tax, legal and regulatory qualification of the
     relevant Buyer Benefit Plan reasonably satisfactory to Seller prior to the
     transfer of any such assets. Seller and Buyer agree to cooperate in good
     faith to implement the foregoing.

          (viii) Seller shall fully vest the Transferred Employees in their

     Transferred Employees who receives an eligible rollover distribution (as
     defined in Section 402(c)(4) of the Code) from Seller's 401(k) Plan, if
     any, to roll such eligible rollover distribution into an account under

     Employees who are U.S. employees shall, as of the Closing Date, become
     eligible to participate in Buyer's Employees Savings and Profit Sharing
     Plan in accordance with its terms and the service recognition provisions of
     Section 5.7(c)(ii) of this Agreement.

terms of Seller's integration bonus arrangement a pro rata portion of the amount
of any such bonus earned by such Transferred Employee under such arrangement for
the portion of the 2004 calendar year preceding the Closing Date, as determined
by Seller, in its discretion, but only to the extent such bonus amount exceeds
the amount reflected in respect thereof on the Closing Date Net Working Capital
Statement. Promptly following the final determination of the Final Net Working

28, 2005, Seller shall pay to eligible Transferred Employees the portion of such
integration bonus payable by Seller under this paragraph (e) and Buyer shall

     grants to the Transferred Subsidiaries a limited, transitional,
     non-exclusive, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-transferable,
     non-assignable (subject to Section 5.8(h)) right to use those trademarks
     identified on Schedule 5.8(a) (each, a "LICENSED TRADEMARK") in the
     territory where such Licensed Trademark was so used by the Seller and its
     Affiliates in the conduct of the Business, in each case solely for the
     limited purpose of winding down the use of each Licensed Trademark in such
     territory solely in connection with business activities and products and
     services in existence prior to the Closing, and in the manner used in the
     Business as of the Closing ("TRANSITIONAL USE"). For the avoidance of
     doubt, Transitional Use consists primarily of use of a Licensed Trademark
     on existing signage and existing inventory of the Business, including
     stationery, displays, product packaging, phone numbers, fax numbers,
     promotional materials or other similar materials in the manner and to the
     extent used in the Business in the one-year period prior to the Closing
     Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer covenants to take the necessary
     action to change, as promptly as reasonably practicable after the Closing
     Date, the legal name of each Transferred Subsidiary so that the name UCB is
     no longer employed.

          (ii) The Transferred Subsidiaries shall maintain quality control
     standards that are substantially equivalent to or stricter than those
     standards used by Seller and its Affiliates immediately prior to the
     Closing Date with respect to the Licensed Trademarks, which quality control
     standards shall be provided by Seller to the Transferred Subsidiaries prior
     to the Closing. Seller shall have the right to monitor and inspect any
     products or services provided by the Transferred Subsidiaries under the
     Licensed Trademarks if such right is used at reasonable times and upon
     reasonable advance written notice for the purpose of enabling Seller to
     ensure the Transferred Subsidiaries' compliance with this Section 5.8,
     PROVIDED that such inspection shall not unreasonably burden or
     inconvenience the Transferred Subsidiaries.

          (iii) Without the prior written consent of Seller, Buyer shall not,
     and shall cause its Affiliates not to, knowingly, for a period of five (5)
     years from and after the Closing Date, apply for, or contest, the
     registration or renewal of registration of any Licensed Trademark or of any
     Trademark that is identical or confusingly similar to any Licensed
     Trademark, and Buyer shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to,
     knowingly, for a period of five (5) years from and after the Closing Date,
     take any action reasonably likely to impair the validity of any Licensed
     Trademark or the goodwill therein. Buyer and its Affiliates shall not
     combine any Licensed Trademark with any other marks or words to form a new
     mark or alter the design of any Licensed Trademark. Without the prior
     written consent of Buyer, Seller shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates
     not to, knowingly, for a period of five (5) years from and after the
     Closing Date, apply for, or contest, the registration or renewal of
     registration of any Trademark that is Owned Intellectual Property or of any
     Trademark that is identical or confusingly similar to any Trademark that is
     Owned Intellectual Property, and Seller shall not, and shall cause its
     Affiliates not to, knowingly, for a period of five (5) years from and after
     the Closing Date take any action reasonably likely to impair the validity
     of any Trademark that is included in the Owned Intellectual Property or the
     goodwill therein. Seller and its Affiliates shall not combine any Trademark
     that is Owned Intellectual Property with any other marks or words to form a
     new mark or alter the design of any Trademark that is Owned Intellectual
     Property.

          (iv) Buyer acknowledges that the Licensed Trademarks and all goodwill
     associated therewith are, and shall remain, the sole property of Seller and
     no rights are conferred upon Buyer or its Affiliates or the Transferred
     Subsidiaries with respect to the Licensed Trademarks except as specifically
     set forth herein. All uses of the Licensed Trademarks, and all goodwill
     arising therefrom, shall inure to the exclusive benefit of Seller and its
     Affiliates (other than the Transferred Subsidiaries). Seller and its
     Affiliates (other than the Transferred Subsidiaries) reserve all rights in
     the Licensed Trademarks not expressly granted in this Agreement. This
     Agreement shall not preclude (i) Buyer or its Affiliates from using the
     Licensed Trademarks as required by Law or in other manners permitted by the
     doctrine of Trademark fair use, but for logos only in non-promotional
     contexts or (ii) Seller or its Affiliates from using the Trademarks that
     are Owned Intellectual Property as required by Law, or in other manners
     permitted by the doctrine of Trademark fair use, but for logos only in
     non-promotional contexts.

     (b) Effective as of the Closing, Seller, on behalf of itself and its
Affiliates (other than the Transferred Subsidiaries), hereby grants to Buyer and
its Affiliates a non-exclusive, irrevocable, perpetual, royalty-free license,
which license may be transferred, divided or sublicensed consistent with the
terms of Section 5.8(h) to use, reproduce, modify and create derivative works
of, for any purpose, including to conduct the Business as it may now or
hereafter exist, all (or any portion(s) of) Computer Software owned by Seller
and its Affiliates (other than the Transferred Subsidiaries), in object code and
source code form, that are used in the Business prior to the Closing, but which
are not Transferred Assets (the "LICENSED COMPUTER SOFTWARE"). Seller shall
deliver to Buyer on or before the Closing Date all reasonably available
documentation relating to the Licensed Computer Software and on the Closing Date
shall deliver or make available in source code form the Licensed Computer
Software (either in tangible form or via access to a server, which server shall
be delivered to Buyer or its designee as mutually agreed in writing by the
parties) sufficient to enable Buyer to enjoy the full benefit of the licensed
rights hereby granted as enjoyed prior to the date hereof.

          (i) Other than pursuant to the Ancillary Agreements, Seller and its
     Affiliates have no obligation to provide Buyer or its Affiliates with any
     improvements to the Licensed Computer Software or to provide Buyer or its
     Affiliates with any updates, maintenance or support with respect thereto.
     Buyer and its Affiliates have no obligation to provide Seller or its
     Affiliates with any improvements to the Licensed Computer Software that
     Buyer or its Affiliates may develop, PROVIDED, that Buyer hereby grants
     Seller and its Affiliates a non-exclusive, irrevocable, perpetual,
     royalty-free license, which license may be transferred, divided or
     sublicensed consistent with the terms of Section 5.8(h) under any Patents
     that Buyer or any of its Affiliates may receive or obtain which are derived
     from and based on such improvements.

          (ii) Buyer acknowledges and agrees that Seller and its Affiliates are
     the sole and exclusive owners of the Licensed IP. Seller hereby
     acknowledges that, other than the licenses expressly granted herein, this
     Agreement transfers no right, title or interest to Buyer or its Affiliates
     in the Licensed IP. Seller and its Affiliates (other than the Transferred
     Subsidiaries) expressly reserve all rights in the Licensed IP not expressly
     granted in this Agreement.

          (iii) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed as
     conferring on (A) Seller or any of its Affiliates an obligation to file,
     secure, protect, maintain and/or enforce any of its rights in the Licensed
     Trademarks or the Licensed Computer Software (the Licensed Trademarks and
     the Licensed Computer Software, collectively, the "LICENSED IP"), and
     Seller and its Affiliates (other than the Transferred Subsidiaries) may
     bring or decline to bring actions to enforce their rights in the Licensed
     IP in their sole discretion or (B) Buyer any right to bring any action on
     behalf of Seller and its Affiliates or otherwise, based on or related to
     the Licensed IP. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall limit Seller or
     any of its Affiliates' (other than the Transferred Subsidiaries') ability
     to use the Licensed IP in any manner it chooses, except as contemplated
     under the terms of this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreements.

          (iv) EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE PROVIDED IN ARTICLE III AND WITHOUT LIMITING
     ARTICLE VII: THE LICENSED IP IS PROVIDED HEREUNDER "AS IS", "WITH ALL
     FAULTS" AND WITHOUT REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, AND WITHOUT
     LIMITING THE FOREGOING, SELLER AND ITS AFFILIATES EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL
     REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, STATUTORY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING
     ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS OR
     SUITABILITY FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE (EVEN IF ON NOTICE OF SUCH PURPOSE),
     NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND CUSTOM OR USAGE IN THE TRADE, AND WITHOUT LIMITING
     THE FOREGOING, NO REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY IS GIVEN THAT THE LICENSED IP
     OR ANY PORTION THEREOF WILL CONFORM TO ANY DESCRIPTION THEREOF OR BE FREE
     OF DEFECTS OR IS, OR WILL OPERATE WITHOUT ERRORS. EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE
     PROVIDED IN ARTICLE III AND WITHOUT LIMITING ARTICLE VII, WITH RESPECT TO
     THE LICENSED TRADEMARKS ONLY, EACH OF BUYER AND ITS AFFILIATES WAIVES ANY
     CLAIMS IT MIGHT HAVE AGAINST ANY OF SELLER OR ITS AFFILIATES WHICH ARISE
     OUT OF OR RELATE TO BUYER'S OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES' EXERCISE OF THE
     RIGHTS UNDER THE LICENSED TRADEMARKS GRANTED TO IT BY THIS SECTION 5.8.

          (v) Buyer shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless Seller and its
     Affiliates (other than the Transferred Subsidiaries) and their respective
     employees, directors, officers, consultants and agents from and against all
     Losses arising out of, or relating to, any claim by any third party arising
     out of, or relating to Buyer's use of the Licensed Trademarks in any manner
     not authorized by this Agreement and different from how used by Seller and
     its Affiliates in the Business in the 12 months immediately prior to the
     Closing Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer will not have any
     indemnification obligation to Seller or its Affiliates under this Section
     5.8 or otherwise, with respect to any Loss to the extent such Loss arises
     out of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Seller or its
     Affiliates (other than the Transferred Subsidiaries with respect to actions
     taken by them after the Closing Date).


                                      -92-
<PAGE>

     (c) Effective as of the Closing, Buyer, on behalf of itself and its
Affiliates, hereby grants to Seller and its Affiliates a non-exclusive,
irrevocable, perpetual, royalty-free license, which license may be transferred,
divided or sublicensed consistent with the terms of Section 5.8(h), to use,
reproduce, modify and create derivative works of, for any purpose, including to
conduct the businesses of Seller as they may now or hereafter exist, all (or any
portion(s) of) Computer Software (in object code and source code form) that are
Transferred Assets used by Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than the
Transferred Subsidiaries) prior to the Closing (the "LICENSED-BACK COMPUTER
SOFTWARE"). Seller may retain on the Closing Date tangible copies of all
Licensed-Back Computer Software. If the Films Business shall have been
transferred back to Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than the Transferred
Subsidiaries) rather than to a third party purchaser as part of the Films
Separation, the license provided in this subsection shall extend to the Films
Business. Seller and its Affiliates have no obligation to provide Buyer or its
Affiliates with any improvements to the Licensed-Back Computer Software that
Seller or its Affiliates may develop, PROVIDED, that Seller hereby grants Buyer
and its Affiliates a non-exclusive, irrevocable, perpetual, royalty-free
license, which license may be transferred, divided or sublicensed consistent
with the terms of Section 5.8(h) under any Patents that Seller or any of its
Affiliates may receive or obtain which are derived from and based on such
improvements. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed as
conferring on (A) Buyer or any of its Affiliates an obligation to file, secure,
protect, maintain and/or enforce any of its rights in the Licensed-Back Computer
Software, and Buyer and its Affiliates may bring or decline to bring actions to
enforce their rights in the Licensed-Back Computer Software in their sole
discretion or (B) Seller or its Affiliates any right to bring any action on
behalf of Buyer and its Affiliates or otherwise, based on or related to the
Licensed-Back Computer Software.

     (d) Except as may be consented to in writing by Buyer, after the date of
this Agreement and before the Closing:

          (i) Seller and its Affiliates shall make such payments and take such
     other actions as are reasonably necessary to maintain IP-Registered Owned
     Intellectual Property, including the payment of any registration,
     maintenance or renewal fees or the filing of any responses to office
     actions by the patent, copyright, trademark or other authorities in any
     jurisdiction, documents, applications or certificates for the purposes of
     obtaining, maintaining, perfecting or preserving or renewing such
     IP-Registered Owned Intellectual Property; and

          (ii) Seller and its Affiliates shall provide information to Buyer upon
     Buyer's reasonable written request about the status of any pending
     applications for IP-Registered Owned Intellectual Property (including
     reissues, renewals and the like) and, subject to compliance with any Law
     relating to competition, restrictive trade practices, unfair competition,
     antitrust, monopolies, fair trading or restraint of trade or other legal
     requirements, Seller and Buyer shall consult and cooperate in good faith
     regarding the prosecution of pending applications for IP-Registered Owned
     Intellectual Property and Seller shall allow Buyer to provide reasonable
     instruction and direction as to the prosecution of such applications.


                                      -93-
<PAGE>

     (e) Subject to Sections 5.8(f) and 5.8(g), from and after the Closing,
Buyer shall have responsibility for the prosecution and maintenance of all Owned
Intellectual Property and shall pay all fees relating to the aforesaid.

     (f) With a view to enabling Buyer to prosecute, file and maintain,
including coordinating payments to patent, trademark, copyright or other
authorities in any jurisdiction ("PATENT AND TRADEMARK OFFICES"), all Owned
Intellectual Property on and after the Closing in a manner consistent with the
manner in which Seller and its Affiliates performed such prosecution, filing,
maintenance prior to the Closing, Seller shall, prior to the Closing, use its
reasonable best efforts to cause one or more of the Transferred Employees to
acquire such skills as are reasonably required to enable such Transferred
Employee to carry out administrative functions related to the prosecution,
filing, (including preparing foreign filing papers) maintaining and coordination
of payments to Patent and Trademark Offices with respect to all Owned
Intellectual Property other than Trademarks. For the avoidance of doubt, such
Transferred Employee shall not be required to be trained to perform any
functions with respect to the prosecution, filing, and maintenance of Owned
Intellectual Property that have been performed by and outsourced to Intellectual
Property counsel, Patent agents or Trademark agents that are not within the
employment of Seller and its Affiliates. Seller shall also cause all Books and
Records relating to the Owned Intellectual Property in the possession of Seller
or its Affiliates (excluding the Transferred Subsidiaries) to be in the physical
possession of the Transferred Subsidiaries on the Closing Date, as necessary to
continue prosecution, filing and maintenance of the Owned Intellectual Property
after the Closing as conducted prior to the Closing. Seller shall, and shall
cause its Affiliates to, include in the Business Designated Employees all of
those individuals who in the twelve months prior to Closing primarily conducted
prosecution and maintenance for Patents which are Owned Intellectual Property.
With respect to Trademarks that are Owned Intellectual Property, from and after
the Closing, pursuant to the Transition Services Agreement, Seller shall, and
shall cause its Affiliates (other than the Transferred Subsidiaries) to provide
or cause their respective employees to provide such assistance and information
as may be reasonably requested by Buyer for the prosecution, maintenance and
renewal of such Trademarks.

     (g) With respect to (i) Transferred Intellectual Property Assets and (ii)
Intellectual Property Contracts that are Transferred Contracts, Seller and its
Affiliates (other than the Transferred Subsidiaries) shall complete the
assignment of record ownership of such assets to Buyer or its designee and the
transfer to Buyer or its designee, at Seller's expense, of files relating
thereto promptly after the Closing but in any event within 60 days after the
Closing Date. Prior to any transfer to Buyer or its designee of physical files,
Seller and its Affiliates shall retain responsibility for prosecution, filing
and maintenance of such Owned Intellectual Property, including responding to all
matters and paying all fees due within sixty (60) days of transfer and shall pay
all fees relating to the foregoing obligation, which fees shall be reimbursed by
Buyer, as and to the extent incurred by Seller or its Affiliates after the
Closing. Buyer shall make available to Seller Transferred Employees as necessary
to assist Seller in connection with Seller's obligations pursuant to this
Section 5.8(g).

     (h) Buyer and each of the Transferred Subsidiaries may assign or otherwise
transfer the licenses granted in the Licensed Computer Software pursuant to
Section 5.8 (or a portion thereof) and in the Patents pursuant to Section
5.8(b)(i) to a successor to (i) all or a portion of its assets, or (ii) all or a
portion of the assets of the Business. Buyer may assign, sublicense or otherwise
transfer the licenses granted in the Licensed IP pursuant to Section 5.8 (or a
portion thereof) to a successor to all or substantially all of the assets of the
Seller Amino Resins Business. As and to the extent required by Law, Buyer may
assign, sublicense or otherwise transfer the licenses granted in the Licensed
Trademarks. Seller and its Affiliates may assign or otherwise transfer the
licenses granted in the Licensed-Back Computer Software pursuant to Section 5.8
(or a portion thereof) and in the Patents pursuant to Section 5.8 to a successor
to (i) all or a portion of its assets or (ii) all or a portion of the assets of
the business to which the Licensed-Back Computer Software relates.

     (i) From and after the date hereof until the Closing, neither Seller nor
its Affiliates shall, in connection with the Films Separation, license, provide
or otherwise make available to any third Person any Owned Intellectual Property
or exclusively-held Licensed-In Intellectual Property in any fields of use
encompassed within the Business, or competitive with or reasonably expected to
be competitive with the Business.

     (j) Buyer shall use its reasonable efforts to obtain substitute licenses
for the Computer Software set forth on Schedule 2.2 as of the Closing and, in
any event, shall obtain such substitute licenses within six (6) months after the
Closing Date. Seller shall reasonably cooperate with Buyer with respect to the
foregoing; PROVIDED that, for the avoidance of doubt, such reasonable
cooperation shall not include the payment of fees or other consideration to any
Person.

     (k) Seller and its Affiliates shall at Seller's sole cost and expense make
commercially reasonable efforts to submit to the appropriate Patent and
Trademark Offices for recordation as promptly as reasonably practicable all
documents reasonably necessary to evidence true and complete chain of title
ownership immediately prior to the Closing of Seller or its Affiliates, as the
case may be, of each item of IP-Registered Intellectual Property required to be
listed on Schedule 3.14(a)(i) from such items' inception (collectively, the "IP
RECORDATIONS") solely to the extent that, with respect to each item of
IP-Registered Intellectual Property, it is commercially reasonable for such
recordation to be made (when considering the relative value, utility or
significance of the Intellectual Property item that is the subject of such
recordation). On and after the Closing, to the extent that Buyer and its
Affiliates desire that additional IP Recordations be made, which recordations
are commercially reasonable (when considering the relative value, utility or
significance of the Intellectual Property item that is the subject of such
recordation), Buyer shall notify Seller as to each such additional IP
Recordation and shall specify to Seller the estimated aggregate costs and
expenses of such additional IP Recordation(s). Within thirty (30) days of
receiving such notice, Seller shall (i) approve the estimate, in which case
Seller promptly shall reimburse Buyer upon receipt of an invoice for its actual
costs and expenses for such recordations (but excluding Buyer's internal costs);
provided that they do not materially exceed the estimate previously approved by
Seller or (ii) agree to make such recordations (either itself or with the
assistance of a third Person designee of Seller's choice and at Seller's option)
at Seller's sole cost and expense, in which case Seller promptly shall do so. On
and after the Closing, Seller shall have no obligation to reimburse Buyer for
any costs and expenses with respect to any IP Recordations that are not
commercially reasonable to be made (when considering the relative value, utility
or significance of the Intellectual Property item that is the subject of such
recordation). Seller and its Affiliates promptly shall deliver to Buyer true and
complete copies of all documentation filed with and received from the applicable
Patent and Trademark Offices concerning all IP Recordations filed by Seller or
its Affiliates or their third Person designees.

     Section 5.9 ANCILLARY AGREEMENTS AND STOCKHOLDER'S AGREEMENT. At the
Closing, Seller shall, and shall cause each of its Affiliates party to an
Ancillary Agreement to, execute and deliver each Ancillary Agreement to which it
is a party, and Buyer shall, and shall cause each of its Affiliates party to an
Ancillary Agreement to, execute and deliver each of the Ancillary Agreements to
which it is a party. At the Closing, each of Buyer and Seller shall execute and
deliver the Stockholder's Agreement.

     Section 5.10 ASSIGNMENT OF RETAINED ASSETS AND ASSUMPTION OF RETAINED
LIABILITIES. Prior to the Closing, Seller shall use its reasonable best efforts
to cause the Retained Assets to be distributed or otherwise transferred by the
applicable Transferred Subsidiary to another Person (other than any other
Transferred Subsidiary), and to cause a Person (other than any Transferred
Subsidiary) to assume the Retained Liabilities from the applicable Transferred
Subsidiary; PROVIDED that there shall not be the imposition of any Liability on
Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including the Transferred Subsidiaries) for any
violation of applicable Law in connection therewith. Seller shall make available
to Buyer in a timely manner for review all agreements, instruments and other
documentation relating to the transfer prior to the Closing by any Transferred
Subsidiary of any assets intended to be Retained Assets to Seller or any of its
Affiliates, or the assumption by Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than the
Transferred Subsidiaries) of any Liabilities intended to be Retained Liabilities
from any of the Transferred Subsidiaries, and Seller shall consider in good
faith Buyer's comments thereon. To the extent that the distribution or transfer
of the Retained Assets or the assumption of the Retained Liabilities, or
attempted distribution, transfer or assumption, as provided for in this Section
5.10 is prohibited by any applicable Law or would require any governmental or
third party authorizations, approvals, consents or waivers, and such
authorizations, approvals, consents or waivers shall not have been obtained at
or prior to the Closing, then the provisions of Section 2.10 shall apply MUTATIS
MUTANDIS. Without limiting the foregoing, in the event that a Transferred
Subsidiary is unable to assign any rights to seek indemnity against third
parties in respect of any Retained Assets or Retained Liabilities, or that any
such assignment is held to be invalid or unenforceable, Buyer shall, or shall
cause the relevant Transferred Subsidiary to, reasonably cooperate with Seller
and take such steps as Seller may reasonably request and at Seller's expense in
pursuing the claims for indemnity.

     Section 5.11 INSURANCE PROCEEDS. (a) From and after the Closing, Seller
shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, assign, to the extent assignable, to
Buyer any proceeds of Seller's or any of its Affiliates' (other than the
Transferred Subsidiaries) third party insurance policies to the extent related
to any Assumed Liabilities or Liabilities of the Transferred Subsidiaries (other
than any Excluded Liabilities or any Retained Liabilities). Seller agrees to use
its reasonable efforts to obtain any necessary consents or approvals of any
insurance company or other third party relating to any such assignment. If such
proceeds are not assignable, Seller agrees to pay any such proceeds received by
it or any of its Affiliates to Buyer promptly upon the receipt thereof.

     (b) From and after the Closing, Buyer shall, or shall cause its Affiliates
to, assign, to the extent assignable, to Seller any proceeds of the third party
Transferred Insurance Policies to the extent related to any Retained Liabilities
or Excluded Liabilities. Buyer agrees to use its reasonable efforts to obtain
any necessary consents or approvals of any insurance company or other third
party relating to any such assignment. If such proceeds are not assignable,
Buyer agrees to pay any such proceeds received by it or any of its Affiliates to
Seller promptly upon the receipt thereof.

     Section 5.12 RESTRUCTURING TRANSACTIONS. (a) Seller shall cause the actions
and transactions described on Schedule 5.12 (the "POST-SIGNING RESTRUCTURING
TRANSACTIONS") to be implemented as set forth on Schedule 5.12. Seller shall
make available to Buyer in a timely manner for review all drafts of agreements,
instruments and other documents relating to the Post-Signing Restructuring
Transactions, and Seller shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to,
execute any such agreements, instruments or other documentation, or take any
actions or consummate any transactions contemplated thereby, without Buyer's
prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed.

     (b) Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, use reasonable best
efforts to complete the Films Separation prior to the Closing Date.

     Section 5.13 SUPPLEMENTAL LISTING APPLICATION. Buyer shall use its best
efforts to cause the Purchase Price Shares to be issued in the transactions
contemplated hereby to be approved for listing on the NYSE, to the extent not
already so approved, subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the
Closing Date.

     Section 5.14 ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. (a) Seller shall, not later
than the tenth Business Day of each calendar month from and after the date
hereof until the Closing Date, provide Buyer an unaudited statement showing (i)
the sales by legal entity for the Business, and any consolidated results (to the
extent available) for the preceding calendar month, and comparing such sales to
the comparable figure for the same month of the prior year, and (ii) the
operating results, after financial charges, by legal entity for the Business,
and any consolidated results (to the extent available) for the preceding month,
in each case prepared in accordance with Belgian GAAP for periods through
December 31, 2004 and prepared in accordance with International Accounting

shall be performed in accordance with Schedule 2.6(a). Seller shall cause a firm
of independent certified public accountants that is registered with the U.S.
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board to audit the Belgian GAAP Audited
Financial Statements. All costs and expenses incurred by Seller and its
Affiliates in connection with the preparation of and audit of the Belgian GAAP

prepare, or caused to be prepared, an unaudited combined interim balance sheet

cooperate with Buyer with respect to the preparation of the foregoing and
provide to Buyer and to the firm of independent certified public accountants
engaged by Buyer for purposes of auditing the U.S. GAAP Audited Financial
Statements such data as is reasonably necessary for the preparation and audit of
the financial statements described in this Section 5.14(c), and shall execute
and cause their respective officers, directors and employees to execute such
customary representation letters as such firm of independent certified public
accountants may reasonably request with respect to the data and information
underlying such financial statements, the conformity of such financial
statements to U.S. GAAP and the procedures used in the preparation of such
financial statements. Buyer shall, promptly upon receiving a written request
from Seller, reimburse Seller for all of Seller's and its Affiliates' reasonable
costs and expenses incurred in connection with the preparation of and audit of
the U.S. GAAP Audited Financial Statements.

     Section 5.15 UPDATING OF INFORMATION. Each party hereto shall, as soon as
reasonably practicable after it obtains Knowledge thereof prior to the Closing,
deliver to the other parties hereto any information concerning a change or any
event occurring subsequent to the date hereof and prior to the Closing that
causes any representation and warranty of such party contained herein to become
incorrect or incomplete in any material respect, it being understood and agreed
that the delivery of such information shall not in any manner constitute a
waiver by any other party of any of the conditions precedent to the Closing
hereunder and that in determining whether there is a breach of any
representation and warranty for purposes of any indemnification to be provided
pursuant to Article VII, such representation and warranty shall not be qualified
by any information provided pursuant to this Section 5.15. Without limiting the
foregoing, if, at any time after the date hereof, Buyer receives notice from its
lenders that the Financing Commitments will not be funded or Buyer determines
that it will not obtain alternative financing necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Buyer shall promptly notify Seller
in writing of that notice and/or determination and, if applicable, advise Seller
of any reason given by such lenders for such action.

     Section 5.16 CERTAIN GUARANTEES AND INDEBTEDNESS. (a) Seller shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause itself or one or more of its Affiliates (other
than the Transferred Subsidiaries) to be substituted in all respects for the
Transferred Subsidiaries and for the Transferred Subsidiaries to be otherwise
removed or released, effective as of the Closing, in respect of all obligations
of the Transferred Subsidiaries under each of the guarantees, indemnities,
surety bonds, letters of credit and letters of comfort obtained by the
Transferred Subsidiaries for the benefit of Seller or its Affiliates (other than
the Transferred Subsidiaries) (collectively, the "TRANSFERRED SUBSIDIARY
GUARANTEES"), including the guarantees described in Schedule 5.16(a), which sets
forth all such guarantees that are material, and for all obligations of the
Transferred Subsidiaries in respect thereof to be terminated, with, in each
case, such substitution, removal, release and termination to be in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to Buyer. In the event that Seller has been
unable to effect any such substitution, removal, release or termination with
respect to any Transferred Subsidiary Guarantee effective as of the Closing,
Seller agrees that after the Closing it shall use its reasonable best efforts to
effect such substitution, removal and release and termination as soon as
reasonably practicable, including, without limitation, by providing substitute
cash collateral. Seller agrees to indemnify and hold Buyer and its Affiliates
(including the Transferred Subsidiaries) harmless from and against and in
respect of any and all Losses incurred by Buyer and its Affiliates (including
the Transferred Subsidiaries) after the Closing under or pursuant to any
Transferred Subsidiary Guarantee.

     (b) Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause Seller and its
Affiliates (other than the Transferred Subsidiaries) to be removed or released,
effective as of the Closing or, if not possible, as soon thereafter as
reasonably practicable, in respect of all obligations of Seller and such
Affiliates under each of the guarantees, indemnities, surety bonds, letters of
credit and letters of comfort obtained by Seller and such Affiliates for the
benefit of the Transferred Subsidiaries that are described in Schedule 5.16(b),
and, to the extent commercially reasonable to achieve such removal or release,
to agree to substitute itself in the place of Seller and its Affiliates. Buyer
agrees to indemnify and hold Seller and its Affiliates harmless from and against
any Losses incurred by Seller and its Affiliates after the Closing under or
pursuant to any such guarantee.

     (c) Seller shall defease or repay or otherwise settle or cause itself or
one or more of its Affiliates (other than the Transferred Subsidiaries) to be
substituted in all respects for the Transferred Subsidiaries and for the
Transferred Subsidiaries to be otherwise removed or released, effective as of
the Closing, in respect of all Indebtedness of the Transferred Subsidiaries,
other than the Transferred Intercompany Payables and the Actual Acceptable
Indebtedness Amount, and for all obligations of the Transferred Subsidiaries in
respect thereof to be terminated, with, in each case, such substitution, release
and termination to be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Buyer.
Not less than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall
prepare and deliver to Buyer an updated statement of the amount of the
Acceptable Indebtedness of each Transferred Subsidiary. If Buyer consents to
such updated statement, then such statement shall replace for all purposes the
version of Schedule 1.1(b) delivered as of the date hereof. If Buyer does not
consent to such updated statement, then Schedule 1.1(b), as delivered as of the
date hereof, shall remain in effect for all purposes.

and its Affiliates shall permit Buyer and its Affiliates to file and prosecute
one or more new applications for trademark registration for the "Surface
Specialties" designations and logos (or similar designations or logos, with or
without other elements), but excluding the "UCB" name and logo and other
trademarks owned by Seller and its Affiliates (other than the Transferred
Subsidiaries) and not transferred to Buyer pursuant to this Agreement. At
Buyer's sole cost and expense as and to the extent beyond the 180 period after
Closing, but at Seller's sole cost and expense prior thereto, Seller and its
Affiliates will use commercially reasonable efforts to not cause or permit the
Retained Surface Specialties Trademark Filings to cancel, abandon or otherwise
lapse unless (i) Buyer directs Seller and its Affiliates to do so in writing, in
which case Seller and its Affiliates promptly will do so as directed by Buyer,
or (ii) Buyer provides its prior written consent, which consent shall not be
withheld unreasonably. At Buyer's sole cost and expense as and to the extent
beyond the 180 period after Closing, but at Seller's sole cost and expense prior
thereto, Seller and its Affiliates shall deliver to Buyer true and complete
copies of all documentation filed with and received from the applicable Patent
and Trademark Offices evidencing same. At Buyer's sole cost and expense as and
to the extent beyond the 180 period after Closing, but at Seller's sole cost and
expense prior thereto, Seller and its Affiliates shall assist Buyer and its
Affiliates as reasonably requested with preparing, filing, prosecuting and
defending oppositions of such new applications (including providing any consents
to registration requested by the Patent and Trademark Offices), and shall not
use its rights in any Retained Surface Specialties Trademark Filings or the
trademark rights represented thereby as a basis for opposing, canceling or
otherwise challenging such applications or their resulting registrations or the
trademark rights represented thereby. Seller and its Affiliates acknowledge that
after the Closing, the "Surface Specialties" name and mark (but not any UCB name
or logo used in connection therewith) shall be transferred to Buyer and its
Affiliates and Seller and its Affiliates shall have no ownership or use rights
thereto. Neither Buyer nor its Affiliates shall be responsible for any internal
costs of Seller and its Affiliates or other costs and expenses attributable to
work done with respect to the Retained Surface Specialties Trademark Filings by
employees of Seller or its Affiliates.

not transferred at Closing, Seller shall or shall cause its Affiliates promptly
to assign and transfer to Buyer all right, title and interest in such asset or
(ii) any asset that was intended to be a Retained Asset or an Excluded Asset

IT/IS Agreement and shall not increase the level of service compared to the
level of service provided to the Business in the one-year period prior to the
Closing;

indemnification hereunder; and PROVIDED FURTHER that the Buyer Indemnified
Parties shall not be entitled to indemnification hereunder (i) with respect to
any Environmental Damages that arise out of or relate to Known Conditions, or

Damages Percentage Allocation applicable to each such claim for Environmental
Damages determined under Section 7.3(c) below for any such Environmental Damages

purposes of the foregoing, any series of related Environmental Damages shalL be

     (d) Prior to the exhaustion of the Environmental Deductible, Buyer will
provide a summary of the claims and costs taken into account by Buyer in its
assessment of the matters that should be counted against the Environmental
Deductible, together with sufficient information to substantiate Buyer's
position that such claims and costs would otherwise qualify as indemnifiable
Environmental Damages under this Section 7.3. Buyer and Seller shall make good
faith efforts to reach agreement with respect to the claims and costs asserted
against the Environmental Deductible, so that both parties can assess and seek
agreement on when the Environmental Deductible has been exhausted. In the event
that Buyer has a claim for Environmental Damages following the exhaustion of the
Environmental Deductible, Buyer will provide written notice to Seller of the
claim, providing as much detail as to cost, scope and the basis thereof as is
then available, within 30 days of receiving information that gives rise to the
claim; provided, however, that the failure to timely give notice of the claim
shall affect the rights of Seller hereunder only to the extent that such failure
has a prejudicial effect on the defenses or other rights available to Seller
with respect to the claim. Buyer shall continue to supplement this initial
written notice by providing further detail on the cost, scope and basis for the
claim to Seller as it becomes available, in order to enhance the ability of
Seller and Buyer to assess whether the claim presents indemnifiable
Environmental Damages under this Section 7.3. Upon receipt of such notice,
Seller shall indicate in writing, within 30 days, whether it accepts tender of
the claim, or whether it disputes the claim. If Seller does not dispute the
claim or upon dispute of the claim, is found to be responsible for the
Environmental Damages, and if such claim is presented to Seller by the Buyer
Indemnified Parties prior to the fifth anniversary of the Closing Date (the
"SELLER MANAGEMENT PERIOD"), Seller shall have the option, but not the
obligation, to assume the management of any investigation, remediation activity
or any other activity that is the subject of the claim for Environmental
Damages. If Seller disputes the tender of the claim, Buyer shall assume
management of the remediation activity. In the event that the Seller disputes
the claim for Environmental Damages, it shall set out in detail in writing the
reasons for the dispute and also describe in reasonable detail the basis for its
refusal to accept the tender of the claim. Buyer and Seller shall consult and
cooperate with respect to the protection of any confidential or privileged
information shared in connection with these activities. Any internal costs
incurred by any party with respect to any of these activities or procedures set
forth in this Section 7.3 shall not qualify as Environmental Damages for
purposes of this Agreement. The parties will endeavor to resolve any dispute of
a claim for Environmental Damages amicably within 90 days of the date upon which
Buyer makes the claim.

     (e) In the event that Seller elects to assume the management of any
activities that are the subject of a claim for Environmental Damages that was
presented during the Seller Management Period, then Seller's management of such
activities shall be conducted in accordance with the procedures set out in
Section 7.3(h) below. In the event that Seller does not elect to assume the
management of any activities that are the subject of a claim for Environmental
Damages that was presented during the Seller Management Period, then Buyer shall
assume the management of any such activities and shall manage such activities in
accordance with the procedures set out in Section 7.3(h) below. At any time
after submission of an initial notice of claim during the Seller Management
Period, during the time period prior to Seller's decision regarding either
acceptance or management of the claim, Buyer shall manage the activities that
are the subject of the claim in accordance with the procedures set out in
Section 7.3(h) below. In addition, Buyer shall have the obligation to assume the
management of any activities that are the subject of a claim for Environmental
Damages, where such claim is presented by Buyer Indemnified Parties during years
6 or 7 after Closing (the "BUYER MANAGEMENT PERIOD"), and shall manage such
activities in accordance with the procedures set out in Section 7.3(h) below.

     (f) The Buyer Indemnified Parties agree to provide reasonable access to
Seller and its representatives, agents and contractors to any of the Owned Real
Properties or the Leased Real Properties, facilities, structures or equipment in
order to enable Seller and its representatives, agents and contractors to (i)
undertake and manage any activities or conditions that are the subject of a
claim for Environmental Damages for which Seller has assumed the management
obligation pursuant to Section 7.3(d) above, or (ii) inspect, audit or assess
any activities or conditions that are the subject of a claim for Environmental
Damages for which Buyer has assumed the management obligation pursuant to
Section 7.3(f) above. In addition, the parties agree to cooperate in good faith
with each other with respect to the implementation and completion of all such
activities and to execute such documents, notices, consents and recordations as
may be necessary to enable the implementation and completion of such activities
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

     (g) Whichever party assumes the management of any activities or conditions
that are the subject of a claim for Environmental Damages, pursuant to Section
7.3(f) above, the management of any investigation, remediation activity or other
activity that is the subject of a claim for indemnification for Environmental
Damages shall, for purposes of this subsection (h) be referred to as the
"MANAGING PARTY" and the party that has not assumed that management
responsibility shall be referred to as the "NON-MANAGING PARTY." With respect to
all such activities for which indemnification is sought, both the Managing Party
and the Non-Managing Party shall comply with each of the procedures set out in
this section. The Managing Party shall consult with the Non-Managing Party in
advance of developing, selecting, proposing and implementing any investigations
or remedial measures or other actions or alternatives, preparing and issuing any
documents, attending any meetings or hearings or taking any step or action in
relation to the relevant activities, to the extent that such documents,
meetings, consultations, actions and activities would reasonably be expected to
impact the development, assessment, cost, scope, choice and timing of the
Remediation Activity or of any other activities for which indemnification is
sought or the operation of the Owned or Leased Properties (hereinafter referred
to as "SIGNIFICANT REMEDIATION OR COMPLIANCE ACTIVITY"). The Managing Party
shall provide the Non-Managing Party with reasonable notice of and a reasonable
opportunity to attend any consultations with consultants or third parties,
meetings or hearings or the carrying out of any Significant Remediation or
Compliance Activity (including the opportunity to take split samples). The
Managing Party shall provide the Non-Managing Party with any and all documents
or information relating to any Significant Remediation or Compliance Activity
and, at the Non-Managing Party's request, any document concerning any
indemnified matter or any information related to any activities or costs needed
to evaluate a claim for Environmental Damages. The Managing Party and
Non-Managing Party shall consult and cooperate with respect to the protection of
any confidential or privileged information shared in connection with these
activities. The Non-Managing Party shall have the right to review in advance and
comment on the scope of such investigation or remedial work or any other work
for which it may share costs under this Section 7.3. The Managing Party shall
consider in good faith and implement all reasonable comments on, and
modifications to, such investigation or remedial work or any other work proposed
by the Non-Managing Party. The Managing Party shall provide the Non-Managing
Party with a reasonable opportunity to audit costs. The Managing Party shall
provide the Non-Managing Party in advance with all information documenting any
proposed remedial, investigative or compliance activities to be undertaken. Any
Remediation Activity shall employ the most cost-effective,
commercially-reasonable measures that are either (a) reasonably required to
comply with Environmental Laws or pursuant to the request or the demand of any
Government Entity; (b) undertaken in a good faith belief that they are
reasonably necessary to prevent a pending or threatened enforcement action or
investigation by any Government Entity or an imminent and substantial threat to
human health or the environment, including employee safety. Any Remediation
Activity shall be conducted in a manner that minimizes interference with the
operation of the business. Such measures may include, where appropriate, natural
attenuation, long-term monitoring, deed restrictions, institutional controls and
caps. Any Significant Remediation or Compliance Activity to be undertaken by the
Managing Party shall be subject to the prior approval of the Non-Managing Party,
with such approval not to be unreasonably withheld. In the event that the
Non-Managing Party determines to refuse to grant such approval, the Non-Managing
Party shall set out in detail in writing the reasons for the non-approval and
also describe in reasonable detail the alternative course of action proposed to
be taken and its justification. The Managing Party shall provide the
Non-Managing Party with copies of all correspondence and reports prepared in
connection with any remedial, investigative or compliance activities. The
Managing Party and the Non-Managing Party shall consult and cooperate with
respect to the protection of any confidential or privileged information shared
in connection with these activities. Any internal costs incurred by any party
with respect to any of these activities or procedures shall not qualify as
Environmental Damages for purposes of this Agreement.

     (h) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 7.3, Seller
shall have no indemnification obligation with respect to any Environmental
Damages to the extent that such Environmental Damages would not have arisen but
for any intrusive investigation or disclosure to a third party by any Buyer
Indemnified Party, unless (i) such intrusive investigation or disclosure was
reasonably required by Environmental Law or any other applicable Law; (ii) the
discovery of the relevant condition was inadvertent, and the purpose of such
investigation was not to identify the condition for purposes of developing a
claim for indemnification under this Agreement; (iii) the investigation or
disclosure was reasonably necessary to respond to a request or demand by any
Government Entity; (iv) the investigation or disclosure was undertaken in a good
faith belief that such measures were reasonably necessary to prevent a
threatened enforcement action or investigation by any Government Entity or an
imminent and substantial threat to human health or the environment, including
employee safety; or (v) the condition was inadvertently discovered or disclosed
in connection with any repair, maintenance, operations or construction activity
not undertaken in a manner to allow a claim for indemnification to be developed
under this Agreement at or adjacent to any facility.

     (i) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 7.3, Seller
shall have no indemnification obligation with respect to any Environmental
Damages to the extent that such Environmental Damages would not have arisen but
for (i) any change in use after Closing, to a use other than chemical or
industrial manufacturing, which change subjects the property or operations to
more stringent cleanup requirements than would apply absent such change, or (ii)
any permanent cessation of manufacturing operations or other closure at a site
other than the San Fernando, Spain site after the Closing, and only to the
extent that such Environmental Damages were incurred as a result of a written
notice or claim to Buyer from a Government Entity or third party indicating that
such site is required to be investigated, cleaned up or remediated under any
Environmental Law.

     (j) Subject to the other limitations set out in this Section 7.3, any
Pre-Closing Environmental Condition that does not does not require any
Remediation Activity as of the Closing but following the Closing requires any
Remediation Activity due to a change in a Hazardous Substances regulatory
classification or a change in a regulatory classification of a substance as a
Hazardous Substance or a change in a remedial standard relating to any
Environmental Law after the Closing during the Environmental Indemnity Period
shall nevertheless be covered by the indemnity provisions and procedures set out
in this Section 7.3.

     (k) The indemnification provisions contained in this Section 7.3 shall
constitute the sole and exclusive recourse and remedy of the Buyer Indemnified
Parties for any Environmental Damages, for any breach of any representation or
warranty under Section 3.13, or for any other Losses of any sort whatsoever
arising under or related to any Environmental Law or to the presence or release
of any Hazardous Substances at the Owned Real Property, the Leased Real Property
or any other real property.

     Section 7.4 INDEMNIFICATION BY BUYER. Buyer hereby agrees that from and
after the Closing it shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Seller, its
Affiliates, and their respective directors, officers, attorneys, accountants,
agents, representatives and employees and their heirs, successors and permitted
assigns, each in their capacity as such (the "SELLER INDEMNIFIED PARTIES" and,
collectively with the Buyer Indemnified Parties, the "INDEMNIFIED PARTIES")
from, against and in respect of any Losses imposed on, sustained, incurred or
suffered by, or asserted against, any of Seller Indemnified Parties, whether in
respect of third party claims, claims between the parties hereto, or otherwise,
directly or indirectly relating to, arising out of or resulting from, (i) any
breach of any representation or warranty made by Buyer contained in this
Agreement for the period such representation or warranty survives, PROVIDED that
for purposes of this Section 7.4 any qualifications as to materiality or Buyer
Material Adverse Effect included in such representation or warranty shall be
disregarded for purposes of determining whether such representation or warranty
was breached; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that no Seller Indemnified Party shall be
entitled to indemnification hereunder if, on the date of this Agreement, Seller
had Knowledge of the claimed breach of any representation or warranty with
respect to which such Seller Indemnified Party is seeking indemnification
hereunder; (ii) any breach of a covenant or agreement of Buyer contained in this
Agreement; or (iii) any of the Assumed Liabilities and any Liabilities of the
Transferred Subsidiaries that are not Retained Liabilities.

     Section 7.5 THIRD PARTY CLAIM INDEMNIFICATION PROCEDURES. (a) In the event
that any written claim or demand for which an indemnifying party (an
"INDEMNIFYING PARTY") may have liability to any Indemnified Party hereunder,
other than those relating to Taxes (which are the subject of Section 5.6), or
Environmental Damages (which are the subject of Section 7.3), is asserted
against or sought to be collected from any Indemnified Party by a third party (a
"THIRD PARTY CLAIM"), such Indemnified Party shall promptly, but in no event
more than ten Business Days following such Indemnified Party's receipt of a
Third Party Claim, notify the Indemnifying Party in writing of such Third Party
Claim, the amount or the estimated amount of damages sought thereunder to the
extent then ascertainable (which estimate shall not be conclusive of the final
amount of such Third Party Claim), any other remedy sought thereunder, any
relevant time constraints relating thereto and, to the extent practicable, any
other material details pertaining thereto (a "CLAIM NOTICE"); PROVIDED, HOWEVER,
that the failure timely to give a Claim Notice shall affect the rights of an
Indemnified Party hereunder only to the extent that such failure has a
prejudicial effect on the defenses or other rights available to the Indemnifying
Party with respect to such Third Party Claim. The Indemnifying Party shall have
30 days (or such lesser number of days set forth in the Claim Notice as may be
required by court proceeding in the event of a litigated matter) after receipt
of the Claim Notice (the "NOTICE PERIOD") to notify the Indemnified Party that
it desires to defend the Indemnified Party against such Third Party Claim.


                                     -114-
<PAGE>

     (b) In the event that the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party
within the Notice Period that it desires to defend the Indemnified Party against
a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to defend the
Indemnified Party by appropriate proceedings and shall have the sole power to
direct and control such defense, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the
Indemnified Party, at its expense. Once the Indemnifying Party has duly assumed
the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall have the right,
but not the obligation, to participate in any such defense and to employ
separate counsel of its choosing. The Indemnified Party shall participate in any
such defense at its expense unless (i) the Indemnifying Party and the
Indemnified Party are both named parties to the proceedings and the Indemnified
Party shall have reasonably concluded that representation of both parties by the
same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing
interests between them, or (ii) the Indemnified Party assumes the defense of a
Third Party Claim after the Indemnifying Party has failed to diligently pursue a
Third Party Claim it has assumed, as provided in the first sentence of Section
7.5(c). The Indemnifying Party shall not, without the prior written consent of
the Indemnified Party, settle, compromise or offer to settle or compromise any
Third Party Claim on a basis that would result in (i) the imposition of a order,
writ, injunction or decree that would restrict the future activity or conduct of
the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates, (ii) a finding or admission of a
violation of Law or violation of the rights of any Person by the Indemnified
Party or any of its Affiliates, (iii) a finding or admission that would have an
adverse effect on other claims made or threatened against the Indemnified Party
or any of its Affiliates, or (iv) any monetary Liability of the Indemnified
Party that will not be promptly paid or reimbursed by the Indemnifying Party.

     (c) If the Indemnifying Party (i) elects not to defend the Indemnified
Party against a Third Party Claim, whether by not giving the Indemnified Party
timely notice of its desire to so defend or otherwise, (ii) is not entitled to
defend the Third Party Claim as a result of the Indemnified Party's election to
defend the Third Party Claim as provided in Section 7.5(b), or (iii) after
assuming the defense of a Third Party Claim, fails to take reasonable steps
necessary to defend diligently such Third Party Claim within ten Business Days
after receiving written notice from the Indemnified Party to the effect that the
Indemnifying Party has so failed, the Indemnified Party shall have the right but
not the obligation to assume its own defense; IT BEING UNDERSTOOD THAT the
Indemnified Party's right to indemnification for a Third Party Claim shall not
be adversely affected by assuming the defense of such Third Party Claim. The
Indemnified Party shall not settle a Third Party Claim without the consent of
the Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.


                                     -115-
<PAGE>

     (d) The Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall cooperate in
order to ensure the proper and adequate defense of a Third Party Claim,
including, to the extent permitted by Law, by providing access to each other's
relevant business records and other documents, and employees in accordance with
Section 5.1; IT BEING UNDERSTOOD THAT the costs and expenses of the Indemnified
Party relating thereto shall be Losses. The Indemnified Party and the
Indemnifying Party shall use reasonable best efforts to avoid production of
confidential or competitively sensitive information (consistent with applicable
Law), and to cause all communications among employees, counsel and others
representing any party to a Third Party Claim to be made so as to preserve any
applicable attorney-client or work-product privileges.

     Section 7.6 CALCULATION OF DAMAGES. The parties hereto acknowledge that
Losses and Environmental Damages shall not include consequential, special,
incidental, indirect, punitive or exemplary damages, including lost profits,
unless, and then only to the extent, such damages (a) arise out of or result
from the willful or intentional breach of this Agreement by the Indemnifying
Party or any common law fraud by the Indemnifying Party or (b) are actually paid
by the Indemnified Party to a third party in respect of a Third Party Claim.

     Section 7.7 ADJUSTMENTS TO LOSSES.

     (a) TAXES. In calculating the amount of any Loss or Environmental Damage,
there shall be deducted an amount equal to any net Tax benefit actually realized
as a result of such Loss by the party or its Affiliates claiming such Loss or
Environmental Damage, and there shall be added an amount equal to any Tax
imposed on the receipt of any indemnity payment with respect thereto. The net
Tax benefit determined under this Section 7.7(a) shall be limited to the Tax
benefits actually realized in the year the Loss is incurred by the Indemnified
Party and in the two (2) subsequent years, and the amount of the net Tax benefit
shall be determined by using a Tax rate of 37%.

     (b) INSURANCE PROCEEDS. In calculating the amount of any Loss or
Environmental Damage, there shall be deducted any insurance proceeds actually
received by the Indemnified Party from an unaffiliated insurance carrier
offsetting the amount of such Loss or Environmental Damage, net of any expenses
(including increases in current and future insurance premiums) incurred by the
Indemnified Party in obtaining such insurance proceeds; PROVIDED that Buyer
shall not be required to seek any insurance proceeds in connection with any Loss
or Environmental Damage. If an Indemnified Party recovers an amount from an
insurance carrier in respect of a Loss or Environmental Damage that is the
subject of indemnification hereunder after all or a portion of such Loss or
Environmental Damage has been paid by an Indemnifying Party pursuant to this
Article VII, the Indemnified Party shall promptly remit to the Indemnifying
Party the excess (if any) of (i) the amount paid by the Indemnifying Party in
respect of such Loss or Environmental Damage, plus the amount received from the
insurance carrier in respect thereof (net of any expenses incurred by the
Indemnified Party in obtaining such amount), less (ii) the full amount of such
Loss or Environmental Damage.



                                     -116-
<PAGE>

     (c) REIMBURSEMENT. In calculating the amount of any Loss or Environmental
Damage, there shall be deducted any reimbursement actually received by the
Indemnified Party from any third party offsetting the amount of such Loss or
Environmental Damage, net of any expenses incurred by the Indemnified Party in
obtaining such reimbursement; PROVIDED that Buyer shall not be required to seek
any reimbursement from any third party in connection with any Loss or
Environmental Damage. If an Indemnified Party recovers an amount from a third
party in respect of a Loss or Environmental Damage that is the subject of
indemnification hereunder after all or a portion of such Loss or Environmental
Damage has been paid by an Indemnifying Party pursuant to this Article VII, the
Indemnified Party shall promptly remit to the Indemnifying Party the excess (if
any) of (i) the amount paid by the Indemnifying Party in respect of such Loss or
Environmental Damage, plus the amount received from the third party in respect
thereof (net of any expenses incurred by the Indemnified Party in obtaining such
amount), less (ii) the full amount of such Loss or Environmental Damage.

     Section 7.8 PAYMENTS. The Indemnifying Party shall pay all amounts payable
pursuant to this Article VII, by wire transfer of immediately available funds,
promptly following receipt from an Indemnified Party of a bill, together with
all accompanying reasonably detailed back-up documentation, for a Loss or
Environmental Damage that is the subject of indemnification hereunder, unless
the Indemnifying Party in good faith disputes the Loss or Environmental Damage,
in which event it shall so promptly notify the Indemnified Party. In any event,
the Indemnifying Party shall pay to the Indemnified Party, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, the amount of any Loss or Environmental Damage for
which it is liable hereunder no later than three days following any final
determination of such Loss or Environmental Damage and the Indemnifying Party's
liability therefor. A "final determination" shall exist when (a) the parties to
the dispute have reached an agreement in writing or (b) an arbitration or like
panel constituted in accordance with Section 9.8 shall have rendered a final
non-appealable determination with respect to disputes the parties have agreed to
submit thereto. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article VII, if
it is finally determined that an Indemnified Party is not entitled to
indemnification in connection with any claim made pursuant to this Article VII,
such Indemnified Party shall reimburse the Indemnifying Party promptly for any
amounts previously paid to such Indemnified Party by the Indemnifying Party in
connection with such claim pursuant to this Article VII.

     Section 7.9 CHARACTERIZATION OF INDEMNIFICATION PAYMENTS. All payments made
by an Indemnifying Party to an Indemnified Party in respect of any claim
pursuant to Section 7.2 or 7.4 hereof shall be treated as adjustments to the
Purchase Price for Tax purposes.

     Section 8.1 TERMINATION. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior
to the Closing:

Section 16.2

     (a) by written agreement of Buyer and Seller;

     (b) by either Buyer or Seller, by giving written notice of such termination
to the other party, if the Closing shall not have occurred on or prior to the
date which is six (6) months after the date hereof so long as the terminating
party is not in material breach of its obligations under this Agreement;
PROVIDED that neither party may terminate this Agreement prior to the date which
is nine (9) months after the date hereof if any Government Antitrust Entity in
the United States, the EU or any other jurisdiction in which Other Antitrust
Approvals are required has not completed its review of the transactions
contemplated hereby by such date;

     (c) by Buyer, by giving five (5) days written notice of such termination to
Seller, so long as Buyer is not in material breach of its obligations under this
Agreement, if there shall have occurred any breach of a representation or
warranty of Seller which shall have resulted in the condition set forth in
Section 6.2(a) becoming incapable of satisfaction;

     (d) by Seller, by giving five (5) days written notice of such termination
to Buyer, so long as Seller is not in material breach of its obligations under
this Agreement, if there shall have occurred any breach of a representation or
warranty of Buyer which shall have resulted in the condition set forth in
Section 6.3(a) becoming incapable of satisfaction;


                                     -118-
<PAGE>

     (e) by either Buyer or Seller, by giving written notice of such termination
to the other party, if Buyer and/or Seller shall have received an Order from any
Government Antitrust Entity in the United States or the EU, which Order shall be
or have become final and non-appealable, preventing or prohibiting the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby;

     (f) by Seller or Buyer, by giving written notice of such termination to the
other party, if Buyer shall have given Seller notice in accordance with Section
5.15 that Buyer has determined (i) that it will not, as of the Closing, be able
to obtain the financing contemplated by the Financing Commitments and (ii) that
Buyer will not obtain alternative financing necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby as of the Closing, rendering the condition in
Section 6.2(h) incapable of satisfaction; and

     (g) by Seller at any time if Buyer shall have entered into a definitive
written agreement with respect to, or otherwise consummated, a Change of Control
Transaction.

     Section 8.2 EFFECT OF TERMINATION. In the event of the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with Section 8.1, this Agreement shall thereafter become
void and have no effect, and no party hereto shall have any liability to the
other party hereto or their respective Affiliates, or their respective
directors, officers or employees, except for the obligations of the parties
hereto contained in this Section 8.2 and in Sections 5.2, 8.3, 9.1, 9.5, 9.6 and
9.8 (and any related definitional provisions set forth in Article I), and except
that nothing in this Section 8.2 shall relieve any party from liability for any
willful or intentional breach of this Agreement.

     Section 8.3 TERMINATION FEE. (a) Buyer shall pay Seller a termination fee
(the "TERMINATION FEE") in the amount of (euro)45,000,000 in the event that this
Agreement is terminated:

          (i) by Buyer or Seller pursuant to Section 8.1(f) unless, at the time
     of such termination, either (A) the condition contained in Section 6.2(g)
     shall not have been satisfied or (B) the notice given in accordance with
     Section 5.15 indicates that the reason for the failure to obtain financing
     is the occurrence of a Buyer Material Adverse Effect, without giving effect
     to clause (D) of the definition thereof, resulting from the occurrence of a
     Force Majeure Event;

          (ii) by Buyer or Seller pursuant to Section 8.1(b) if at the time of
     such termination the condition contained in Section 6.2(h) shall not have
     been satisfied and all other conditions in Section 6.1 and Section 6.2
     shall have been satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that by
     their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing) unless the reason for the
     failure of Section 6.2(h) to be satisfied is the occurrence of a Buyer
     Material Adverse Effect resulting, without giving effect to clause (D) of
     the definition thereof, from the occurrence of a Force Majeure Event;


                                     -119-
<PAGE>

          (iii) by Seller pursuant to Section 8.1(g).

     Buyer shall pay the Termination Fee within five Business Days of any
termination described in clauses (i) through (iv) above in immediately available
funds by wire transfer to an account designated by Seller.

     (b) If Buyer fails to pay the Termination Fee within the time period
specified in subsection (a), Buyer shall pay such Termination Fee together with
interest on the Termination Fee from the date payment was due under subsection
(a) to, but not including, the date of actual payment at LIBOR calculated on a
365-day basis. If, in order to obtain such payment, Seller commences an action
that results in judgment against Buyer (or its successor), Buyer (or its
successor) shall pay Seller the costs and expenses (including reasonable
attorneys' and expert witness fees) incurred in connection with such action,
together with interest on the amounts owed (including the Termination Fee) from
the date payment was due under subsection (a) to, but not including, the date of
actual payment at LIBOR calculated on a 365-day basis.

     Section 9.2 AMENDMENT; WAIVER. Any provision of this Agreement may be
amended or waived if, and only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and
signed, in the case of an amendment, by Buyer and Seller, or in the case of a
waiver, by the party against whom the waiver is to be effective. No failure or
delay by any party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall
operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof
preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other
right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies herein provided shall be
cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by law except as
otherwise specifically provided in Article VII hereof.

     Section 9.3 NO ASSIGNMENT OR BENEFIT TO THIRD PARTIES. This Agreement shall
be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors, legal representatives and permitted assigns. No party to
this Agreement may assign any of its rights or delegate any of its obligations
under this Agreement, by operation of Law or otherwise, without the prior
written consent of the other party hereto, except that notwithstanding anything

(a) one or more of Buyer's wholly owned subsidiaries or (b) to any other Person
in connection with such Person's purchase of all or any part of the Business
from Buyer or any of its Affiliates, including any such purchase in connection
with Buyer's satisfaction of its obligations under Section 5.5, provided that,
in each case, no such assignment shall relieve Buyer of any of its obligations
hereunder. Buyer and its Affiliates (including the Transferred Subsidiaries) may
assign or sublicense, in whole or in part, any license Seller or any of its
Affiliates (other than the Transferred Subsidiaries) grants to Buyer or any of
its Affiliates (including the Transferred Subsidiaries) pursuant to this
Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement to any Person in connection with such
Person's purchase of all or any part of the Business from Buyer or any of its
Affiliates, including any such purchase in connection with Buyer's satisfaction
of its obligations under Section 5.5, provided that no such assignment or
sublicense shall relieve Buyer of any of its obligations hereunder. Nothing in
this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to confer upon any Person other
than Buyer, Seller, the Indemnified Parties and their respective successors,
legal representatives and permitted assigns, any rights or remedies under or by
reason of this Agreement.

Exhibits hereto), the Stockholder's Agreement, the joint defense agreement,
dated as of July 28, 2004, between Buyer and Seller and their respective outside
counsel, and the Ancillary Agreements contain the entire agreement between the
parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and
supersede all prior agreements and understandings, oral or written, with respect
to such matters. In the event of any conflict between this Agreement and any
agreement, instrument or other document relating to the Pre-Signing
Restructuring Transactions or the Post-Signing Restructuring Transactions, this
Agreement shall prevail.

     Section 9.5 PUBLIC DISCLOSURE. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, except as may be required to comply with the requirements of
any applicable Law and the rules and regulations of any stock exchange upon
which the securities of one of the parties is listed, or in relation to any

administrative action, suit, demand, claim, hearing, proceeding or
investigation, from and after the date hereof, no press release or similar
public announcement or communication shall be made or caused to be made relating
to this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements or the Stockholder's Agreement
unless specifically approved in advance by both parties hereto. In the event
that Buyer has issued a press release or made a similar public announcement or
communication in reliance upon the exception in the preceding sentence, Seller
shall be permitted to make a similar press release or public announcement. Prior
to the Closing, Buyer may announce the execution of any agreement, contract,
arrangement or commitment, whether oral or written, with respect to the
disposition of any of the assets of the Transferred Subsidiaries and/or any
Transferred Assets pursuant to any Law or any policy, practice, procedure or
direction of any Government Entity and any information reasonably related
thereto subject to the consent of Seller (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld).

     Section 9.6 EXPENSES. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this
Agreement, whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated,
all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be borne by the party incurring such
costs and expenses.

     Section 9.7 BULK SALES. Seller and Buyer agree to waive compliance with
Article 6 of the Uniform Commercial Code as adopted in each of the jurisdictions
in which any of the Transferred Assets are located to the extent that such
Article is applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby.

     Section 9.8 GOVERNING LAW; ARBITRATION. (a) THE AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED
BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK WITHOUT
REGARD TO PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAW.

     (b) In the event of any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or in
connection with this Agreement or any of the Ancillary Agreements (each, a
"DISPUTE"), the parties shall use their reasonable efforts to resolve such
Dispute within a period of ninety (90) calendar days, commencing from either
party's receipt of a notice from the other party indicating the existence of a
Dispute (a "NOTICE"). In the event any such Dispute is not so resolved within
ninety (90) calendar days after receipt of a Notice, either Buyer or Seller may
refer such Dispute to be resolved by final and binding arbitration under the
Rules of Arbitration (the "RULES") of the International Chamber of Commerce (the
"ICC"). The Rules are deemed to be incorporated by reference into this clause.
The party desiring to commence an arbitration shall provide a written request
(an "ARBITRATION REQUEST") to the other party (the "RESPONDENT") and to the ICC
in accordance with the Rules. The number of arbitrators shall be three (3) (such
arbitrators, collectively, the "ARBITRAL TRIBUNAL"). Each of Seller and Buyer
shall nominate one arbitrator and send written notice of that nomination to the
other party within such time period. In the event that either party fails to
nominate its arbitrator or send written notice of that nomination to the other
party within such time period, the ICC shall instead nominate that arbitrator
within thirty (30) calendar days after receipt of a written notice from either
party indicating the other party's failure to comply with the foregoing
provision. Within thirty (30) calendar days after their confirmation, the first
two arbitrators shall nominate the third arbitrator, who shall serve as the
Chairperson of the Arbitral Tribunal. If the first two arbitrators fail to
nominate the third arbitrator within such time period, the third arbitrator
shall be nominated by the ICC and shall serve as the Chairperson of the Arbitral
Tribunal.

     (c) The seat, or legal place, of arbitration shall be London, England. The
language to be used in all arbitral proceedings shall be English. All
arbitrators shall be fluent in the English language and their award shall be
rendered in English. The English language shall be used in all documents,
briefs, evidence, and any other writings submitted to the Arbitral Tribunal.
Each party may make reasonable requests for relevant documents from the other
party prior to any evidentiary hearing in the arbitration. Any Dispute shall be
resolved in accordance with the substantive laws of the State of New York
without regard to principles of conflicts of law. The Arbitral Tribunal shall
have no authority to make any ruling, finding or award that does not conform to
the terms and conditions of the relevant agreement(s). Any such award shall be
made in Euro.

                                     -123-

     Section 9.9 COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, and all of which shall
constitute one and the same Agreement.

     Section 9.10 HEADINGS. The heading references herein and the table of
contents hereof are for convenience purposes only, and shall not be deemed to
limit or affect any of the provisions hereof.

     Section 9.11 SEVERABILITY. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed
severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof. If any
provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof to any Person or any
circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and equitable
provision shall be substituted therefor in order to carry out, so far as may be
valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid or unenforceable
provision and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the application of such
provision to other Persons or circumstances shall not be affected by such
invalidity or unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity or unenforceability
affect the validity or enforceability of such provision, or the application
thereof, in any other jurisdiction.

Section 9.12 RELEASE OF OBLIGATIONS. (a) At the Closing, Seller shall, on
behalf of itself and its Affiliates, execute and deliver to Buyer, for the
benefit of the Transferred Subsidiaries, a general release and discharge, in
form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Buyer, releasing and discharging
the Transferred Subsidiaries from any and all Liabilities to Seller or any of
its Affiliates (other than the Transferred Subsidiaries), except to the extent
such Liabilities are expressly contemplated to be retained by the Transferred
Subsidiaries pursuant to this Agreement, including Liabilities that arise in the
Ordinary Course that are expressly contemplated to be retained by the
Transferred Subsidiaries pursuant to this Agreement and including Liabilities
under the agreements described on Schedule 5.17, as such agreements have been
amended as of the date hereof, or any of the Ancillary Agreements or except to
the extent such Liabilities are contemplated to be retained by or have been
assumed by any of the Transferred Subsidiaries pursuant to any agreement,
instrument or other document relating to the Pre-Signing Restructuring
Transactions or the Post-Signing Restructuring Transactions if, and only if,
such retention or assumption is consistent with the terms of this Agreement.

     (b) Except for contracts set forth in Schedule 5.17, all Contracts between
Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than the Transferred Subsidiaries) on the
one hand, and any Transferred Subsidiary, on the other hand, shall be terminated
immediately before the Closing without any penalty or obligation.
