 1.2 Excluded Assets. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 1.1, but subject to Sections 1.6(i), 1.6(j), 1.6(k) and 1.6(l), Seller will not be required to sell or transfer to Purchaser, and the Specified Assets will not be deemed to include, any of the following or any right or interest in or to any of the following:

  (b) any cash, cash equivalents or accounts receivable;

  

 (c) the premises being leased to Seller at 3035 Center Green Drive in Boulder, Colorado, or any assets located at such premises; or 

  

 (d) any asset identified on Schedule 1\. 

  

  

 1.3 Purchase Price. As consideration for the sale of the Specified Assets to Purchaser: 

  

  

 (a) at the Closing, Purchaser will pay to Seller (without deduction or setoff of any nature), by wire transfer of immediately available funds, the sum of $130,000,000; 

  

 (b) at the Closing, Purchaser will issue and deliver to Seller (without deduction or setoff of any nature) the number of shares (rounded to the nearest whole share) of Purchaser Common Stock determined by dividing $40,000,000 by the Closing Five-Day Average Stock Price; _provided, however_ , that in no event shall the number of shares of Purchaser Common Stock to be issued to Seller at the Closing pursuant to this Section 1.3(b) be less than 760,180 shares or greater than 961,404 shares (the shares of Purchaser Common Stock to be issued to Seller at the Closing pursuant to this Section 1.3(b) being referred to as the "Initial Shares"); 

  

 (c) at the Closing, Purchaser will assume the Assumed Liabilities by delivering to Seller an Assumption Agreement substantially in the form of Exhibit B (the "Assumption Agreement"); 

  

 (d) on the first business day after the NX211 Phase III Commencement Date, Purchaser will (without deduction or setoff of any nature) do one of the following three things: (i) pay to Seller, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, the sum of $20,000,000, (ii) issue and deliver to Seller the number of shares (rounded to the nearest whole share) of Purchaser Common Stock determined by dividing $20,000,000 by the Phase III Twenty-Day Average Stock Price or (iii) pay, issue and deliver to Seller any combination of cash (paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds) and shares of Purchaser Common Stock (with each share of Purchaser Common Stock valued at the Phase III Twenty-Day Average Stock Price) with an aggregate combined value equal to $20,000,000 (any shares of Purchaser Common Stock to be issued to Seller pursuant to this Section 1.3(d) being referred to as "Subsequent Shares"); and 

  

 (e) on the first business day after the NX211 NDA Filing Date, Purchaser will pay to Seller (without deduction or setoff of any nature), by wire transfer of immediately available funds, the sum of $10,000,000. 

  

  

The number of shares of Purchaser Common Stock to be issued pursuant to
Section 1.3(b) and the number of shares of Purchaser Common Stock to be issued
pursuant to Section 1.3(d) will be adjusted appropriately to reflect any
stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization or other similar transaction
affecting the Purchaser Common Stock that is effected or has a record date on
or before the date of issuance of such shares. The Parties acknowledge that
Purchaser will not be assuming any liabilities of Seller other than the
Assumed Liabilities, and that Seller will remain responsible for all
liabilities of Seller other than the Assumed Liabilities.

  

 1.4 Sales and Transfer Taxes. Purchaser will bear and pay, and will reimburse Seller for, any sales taxes, use taxes, transfer taxes, documentary charges, recording fees, filing fees or similar taxes, charges, fees or expenses that may become payable in connection with the sale of the Specified Assets to Purchaser, the issuance and delivery of the Initial Shares and any Subsequent Shares to Seller, the assumption by Purchaser of the Assumed Liabilities or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

 1.5 Allocation of Purchase Price. 

  

  

 (a) The Parties will use their best efforts to agree upon an allocation of the consideration referred to in Section 1.3 among the Specified Assets and, to the extent appropriate, the Ancillary

and Section 1060 of the Internal Revenue Code and the Treasury Regulations
thereunder, and will include the agreed value of the Initial Shares and the

proposed allocation to Seller within 25 days after the Closing Date, and
Seller will deliver to Purchaser a notice setting forth any proposed changes
to such allocation within 15 days after the delivery of such proposed
allocation to Seller, together with a reasonably detailed explanation of the
reasons for such proposed changes. The Parties will negotiate in good faith to
resolve any disputed items, and if the Parties are unable to agree on the
Allocation within 15 days after delivery of such notice to Purchaser, then the
dispute will be arbitrated by a "Big Five" accounting firm mutually
acceptable to the Parties, whose determination will be conclusive and binding
upon the Parties for tax purposes.

  

 (b) The Allocation (including the agreed value of the Initial Shares and the methodology for valuing any Subsequent Shares) will be conclusive and binding upon the Parties for tax purposes, and neither Party will make any statement or declaration to any taxing authority that is inconsistent with the Allocation, except as provided below. Neither Party will take or permit any of its affiliates or representatives to take any position on any tax return, with any taxing authority or in any judicial tax proceeding that is inconsistent with the Allocation except as required by a final determination within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Internal Revenue Code or any equivalent provision of any applicable state or local law. Each Party will promptly provide the other Party with any additional information required to complete Form 8594 if the filing of such form is required. Each Party will timely notify the other Party, and will timely provide the other Party with assistance, in the event of an examination, audit or other proceeding regarding the Allocation.

such representations and warranties) will thereupon be extinguished;
_provided, however_ , that if, prior to such third anniversary, Purchaser
shall have duly delivered to Seller, in conformity with all of the applicable
procedures set forth in Section 9.1(f), a Claim Notice setting forth a claim
for indemnification based upon Seller\'s breach of any of such representations
or warranties, then the specific claim set forth in such Claim Notice will
survive (and will not be extinguished upon) such third anniversary.

    

 (b) Subject to the limitations set forth in this Section 9.1 and elsewhere in this Agreement, from and after the Closing Date, Seller will indemnify Purchaser against any Damages that Purchaser incurs as a result of any breach by Seller of any of the Specified Representations. Seller\'s obligation to indemnify Purchaser pursuant to this Section 9.1(b) will not relieve Seller of, or alter in any way, Seller\'s obligation to fully satisfy all of Seller\'s liabilities other than the Assumed Liabilities. 

   

 (c) Seller will not be required to indemnify Purchaser with respect to any breach by Seller of any of the Specified Representations, except to the extent that the cumulative amount of the Damages actually incurred by Purchaser as a result of all such breaches of the Specified Representations exceeds $3,000,000; and Seller will only be required to pay, and will only be liable for, the amount by which the cumulative amount of the Damages actually incurred by Purchaser as a result of all such breaches of the Specified Representations exceeds $3,000,000. 

  

 (d) The total amount of the payments that Seller can be required to make under or in connection with this Agreement (including all indemnification payments required to be made to Purchaser with respect to breaches of the Specified Representations and all amounts payable to any counsel retained in accordance with Section 9.1(g)) will be limited in the aggregate to a maximum of $42,500,000, and Seller\'s cumulative liability will in no event exceed such amount. 

  

 (e) Any indemnification payment required to be made by Seller under this Agreement may be made (at Seller\'s election) in cash or by delivery of shares of Purchaser Common Stock (or by delivery of a combination of cash and shares of Purchaser Common Stock). For purposes of this Section 9.1(e), each share of Purchaser Common Stock delivered to Purchaser will represent an indemnification payment in an amount equal to the Closing Five-Day Average Stock Price (subject to appropriate adjustment to reflect any stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization or other similar transaction affecting the Purchaser Common Stock that is effected or has a record date on or prior to the date of delivery of such Purchaser Common Stock to Purchaser). 

  

 (f) If Purchaser wishes to assert an indemnification claim against Seller, Purchaser will deliver to Seller, as soon as reasonably practicable, a written notice (a "Claim Notice") setting forth: 

    

 (i) the specific representation and warranty alleged to have been breached by Seller; 

   

 (ii) a reasonably detailed description of the facts and circumstances giving rise to the alleged breach of such representation and warranty; and 

  

 (iii) a reasonably detailed description of, and a good faith estimate of
the total amount of, the Damages actually incurred or expected to be incurred
by Purchaser as a result of such alleged breach.

   

      

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
Purchaser will not be permitted to deliver any Claim Notice to Seller (and
will not be entitled to assert any claim set forth in any Claim Notice)
unless Purchaser has reasonably determined that the breach alleged in such
Claim Notice has actually occurred.

  

 (g) If Purchaser receives notice or otherwise obtains knowledge of any Matter or any threatened Matter that may reasonably be expected to give rise to an indemnification claim against Seller, then Purchaser will deliver to Seller a written notice describing such Matter in reasonable detail as soon as reasonably practicable; _provided, however_ , that for the sole purpose of determining whether a Matter or threatened Matter may give rise to an indemnification claim against Seller within the meaning of this sentence, the limitation set forth in Section 9.1(c) will not be taken into account. Seller will have the right, at its election and at its sole expense, to assume the defense of any such Matter with its own counsel. If Seller elects to assume the defense of any such Matter, then: 

    

 (i) notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Seller will not be required to pay or otherwise indemnify Purchaser against any attorneys\' fees or other expenses incurred on behalf of Purchaser in connection with such Matter following Seller\'s election to assume the defense of such Matter; 

  

 (ii) Purchaser will make available to Seller all books, records and other documents and materials that are under the control of Purchaser or any of Purchaser\'s affiliates, advisors or representatives and that Seller reasonably considers necessary or desirable for the defense of such Matter; 

  

 (iii) Purchaser will execute such documents and take such other actions as
Seller may reasonably request for the purpose of facilitating the defense of,
or any settlement, compromise or adjustment relating to, such Matter;

  

 (iv) Purchaser will otherwise fully cooperate as reasonably requested by Seller in the defense of such Matter; 

  

 (v) Purchaser will not admit any liability with respect to such Matter; and 

  

 (vi) Seller will have the exclusive right to settle, adjust or compromise such Matter, on such terms as Seller may consider appropriate, with the consent of Purchaser (which will not be unreasonably withheld). 

    

If Seller elects not to assume the defense of such Matter, then Purchaser
will proceed diligently to defend such Matter with the assistance of counsel
reasonably satisfactory to Seller; _provided, however_ , that Purchaser will
not settle, adjust or compromise such Matter, or admit any liability with
respect to such Matter, without the prior written consent of Seller (which
will not be unreasonably withheld).

  

 (h) To the extent Seller makes or is required to make any indemnification payment to Purchaser, Seller will be entitled to exercise, and will be subrogated to, any rights and remedies (including rights of indemnity, rights of contribution and other rights of recovery) that Purchaser or any of Purchaser\'s affiliates may have against any other Person with respect to any Damages, circumstances or Matter to which such indemnification payment is directly or indirectly related. Purchaser will take such actions as Seller may reasonably request for the purpose of enabling Seller to perfect or exercise Seller\'s right of subrogation hereunder. 

  

 (i) The right of Purchaser to assert indemnification claims and receive indemnification payments pursuant to this Section 9.1 will be the sole and exclusive right and remedy exercisable by Purchaser with respect to any breach by Seller of any representation or warranty set forth in this Agreement or in any of the Ancillary Agreements; _provided, however,_ that this 

  

    

 Section 9.1(i) shall not prevent Purchaser from asserting a tort claim for
fraud against Seller in appropriate circumstances.

  

  

 9.2 Indemnification by Purchaser.
