may be adjusted pursuant to _Section 3.06 _(as so adjusted, the " _Cash

19 (b) The "Cash Consideration" shall be an amount equal to the Base Cash
Consideration _plus_ (i) the amount, which may be positive or negative, equal
to (A) the Closing Working Capital (Excluding Accounts Receivable) _minus_ (B)
the Estimated Closing Working Capital (Excluding Accounts Receivable), _plus_
(ii) the amount, which may be positive or negative, equal to (A) the Closing
Accounts Receivable _minus_ (B) the Estimated Accounts Receivable and _plus_
(iii) the amount, which may be positive or negative, equal to the Closing Net
Indebtedness.

(c) For purposes of determining the amount of the Estimated Cash

the " _Estimated Closing Net Indebtedness_ "), and (iv) a good
faith calculation of the Estimated Cash Consideration based on the foregoing
estimates and the formula set forth in _Section 3.02(d)_.

(d) As used in this Agreement, the " _Estimated Cash Consideration_ " shall be
an amount equal to the sum of (i) the Base Cash Consideration _plus_ (ii) the
amount, which may be positive or negative, equal to (A) the Estimated Closing
Working Capital (Excluding Accounts Receivable) _minus_ (B) the Target Working

(e) If at any time during the period between the date of this Agreement and
the completion of the Closing, there shall occur any change, or the record
date for any change, in the outstanding shares of capital stock of Arris or
Arris HoldCo as a result of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock
split or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock
dividend or stock distribution, the Stock Consideration shall be equitably
adjusted to reflect such change; _provided_ , that nothing in this _Section
3.02(e)_ shall be construed as permitting Arris or Arris HoldCo to take
any action otherwise prohibited by this Agreement.

SECTION 3.03. _The Closing_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, the Seller Contribution (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place at the
offices of Cleary Gottlieb Steen and Hamilton LLP, located at One Liberty Plaza,

Business Day following the first day on which there is satisfaction or waiver
of all of the conditions to the obligations of the parties set forth in

 



20   _Article IX_ (other than those conditions that are to be satisfied at
Closing, but subject to the waiver or fulfillment of those conditions), unless
another date or place is agreed in writing by Seller and Purchaser; provided
that the Closing shall not occur earlier than one full day following the
Merger Effective Time.

SECTION 3.04. _Deliveries for the Closing_.

(a) At the Closing, Seller shall deliver (or cause to be delivered):

(i) to Paying Agent, one or more certificates representing all the issued and
outstanding Shares, each such certificate to be duly and validly endorsed in
favor of Arris HoldCo or accompanied by a separate stock power duly and
validly executed by Seller and otherwise sufficient to vest in Arris HoldCo
legal and beneficial ownership of such Shares;

(ii) to Purchaser a counterpart of each of the Ancillary Agreements, executed
by each of Seller and any of its Subsidiaries that is a party thereto, to the
extent not previously delivered;

(iii) to Purchaser and Arris HoldCo a duly executed and acknowledged
certificate, in form and substance acceptable to Purchaser and in compliance
with the Code and Treasury Regulations, certifying such facts as to establish
that the transactions contemplated hereby are exempt from withholding pursuant
to Section 1445 of the Code;

(iv) to Purchaser, the certificates referred to in _Section 9.02(a)_ and
_Section 9.02(b)_; and

(v) to Purchaser, to the extent requested in writing by Purchaser no later
than fifteen Business Days prior to Closing, duly signed resignations,
effective as of the close of business on the Closing Date, of all directors
(or Persons performing similar functions) of the Company and each Company
Subsidiary.

(b) At the Closing, Arris HoldCo shall deliver:

(i) to Paying Agent, the Estimated Cash Consideration by wire transfer in
immediately available funds;

(ii) to Paying Agent, the Stock Consideration, in book entry form, free and
clear of all Liens other than those arising under applicable securities Laws;

(iii) to Seller, a counterpart of each of the Ancillary Agreements, executed
by each of Arris, Arris HoldCo and any of their Affiliates that are a party
thereto, to the extent not previously delivered; and

 

(iv) to Seller, the certificates referred to in _Section 9.01(a)_ and
_Section 9.01(b)_.

 



21 (c) At the Closing, and upon written confirmation from Seller and
Purchaser in accordance with the Paying Agent Agreement, Seller, Arris, and
Arris HoldCo shall cause Paying Agent to deliver:

(i) to Seller, the Estimated Cash Consideration received from Arris HoldCo
pursuant to _Section 3.04(b)(i)_ by wire transfer in immediately available
funds, to an account or accounts designated at least three (3) Business Days
prior to the Closing Date by Seller in a written notice to Purchaser and
Paying Agent;

(ii) to Seller, the Stock Consideration received from Purchaser pursuant to
_Section 3.04(b)(ii)_, in book entry form, free and clear of all Liens other
than those arising under applicable securities Laws; and

(iii) to Arris HoldCo, the certificate(s) received from Seller pursuant to 
_Section 3.04(a)(i)_ representing all the issued and outstanding Shares,
along with the separate stock powers received from Seller pursuant to _Section
3.04(a)(i)_.

 

SECTION 3.05. _Cash Consideration Adjustment_.

 

(a) Seller has prepared the attached _Section E of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule_ , which lists certain current assets and current liability accounts
and certain accounting principles, methodologies and policies used in the
determination of such accounts. The Estimated Cash Consideration shall be
adjusted after the Closing in accordance with this  _Section 3.05_ based
upon (i) the actual Closing Net Indebtedness, (ii) the actual Closing Working
Capital (Excluding Accounts Receivable) and (iii) the actual Closing Accounts
Receivable (each of _clause (i)_ and  _(iii) _as calculated in accordance
with _Section E of the Seller Disclosure Schedule_ ). For purposes hereof, the
statement of the Closing Net Indebtedness, the Closing Working Capital
(Excluding Accounts Receivable) and the Closing Accounts Receivable, together
with the calculation of the Cash Consideration that results from the
determination of such amounts, shall be referred to as the " _Closing
Statement_." For the avoidance of doubt, amounts included in
the determination of Closing Net Indebtedness shall be excluded from the
determination of the Closing Working Capital (Excluding Accounts Receivable)
and Closing Accounts Receivable. The Closing Statement shall be prepared on
the basis of, and using the same accounting principles, methodologies and
policies, as specified in _Section E and I of the Seller Disclosure Schedule_
and, to the extent not specified therein, as used in preparing the Financial
Statements.

 

(b) If the Cash Consideration (as defined in _Section 3.02_) as finally
determined in accordance with this  _Section 3.05_ is less than the
Estimated Cash Consideration, Seller shall contribute to Arris HoldCo the
amount of such shortfall, and if the Cash Consideration as finally determined
in accordance with this _Section 3.05_ is greater than the Estimated Cash
Consideration, Arris HoldCo shall refund to Seller the amount of such excess,
in each case by wire transfer of immediately available U.S. Dollar funds to an
account designated in advance by the party entitled to receive payment
pursuant to this _Section 3.05(b)_ within three (3) Business Days after the
final determination of the Cash Consideration, plus interest on the amount
paid accrued from the Closing Date to the date of such payment at the prime
rate as published by the Wall Street Journal, Eastern Edition, in effect on
the Closing Date through the date of payment.

 



22 (c) As promptly as practicable (and, in any event, within 120 days after
the Closing), Seller shall prepare and deliver to Purchaser the Closing
Statement prepared in accordance with this _Section 3.05_. To facilitate the
preparation of the Closing Statement and the resolution of any disputes
arising thereunder, Purchaser and Seller will provide the other party and its
accountants with reasonable access to the books, records and personnel of
Seller, Purchaser, the Company, the Company Subsidiaries, including any
relevant working papers, each only to the extent reasonably related to the
preparation of the Closing Statement and the Disagreement Notice throughout
the periods during which the Closing Statement is being prepared or evaluated
and any disputes that may arise under this  _Section 3.05_ are being
resolved. If Purchaser disagrees with the determination of the Closing
Statement, Purchaser shall notify Seller of such disagreement within 60 days
after delivery of the Closing Statement, which notice shall set forth any
such disagreement in reasonable detail (a " _Disagreement Notice_ "). If
Purchaser fails to deliver a Disagreement Notice by the end of such 60-day
period, Purchaser shall be deemed to have accepted the Closing
Statement delivered by Seller. Matters included in the calculations in the
Closing Statement to which Purchaser does not object in the Disagreement
Notice shall be deemed accepted by Purchaser and shall not be subject to
further dispute or review. Purchaser and Seller shall negotiate in good faith
to resolve any such disagreement, and any resolution agreed to in writing by
Purchaser and Seller shall be final and binding upon Purchaser and Seller.

 

(d) If Purchaser and Seller are unable to resolve any disagreement as
contemplated by _Section 3.05(c)_ within 30 days after delivery by Purchaser
of a Disagreement Notice, Purchaser and Seller shall jointly select a mutually
acceptable third party firm, the retention of which will not give rise to
present or potential future auditor independence problems for Seller,
Purchaser or any of their respective Affiliates or Subsidiaries, as determined
by the reasonable discretion of Seller and Purchaser, to resolve such
disagreement (the firm so selected shall be referred to herein as the "
_Accounting Arbitrator_ "). Purchaser and Seller shall instruct the Accounting
Arbitrator to consider only those items and amounts set forth in the Closing
Statement as to which Purchaser has disagreed pursuant to a
Disagreement Notice and Purchaser and Seller have not resolved their
disagreement. In resolving any such disagreement, the Accounting Arbitrator
may not assign a value to such item greater than the greatest value for such
item claimed by Seller in the Closing Statement or by Purchaser in the
Disagreement Notice or less than the lowest value for such item claimed by
Seller in the Closing Statement or by Purchaser in the Disagreement Notice.
Purchaser and Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
Accounting Arbitrator to deliver to Purchaser and Seller, as promptly as
practicable (and, in any event, within 90 days after the selection of the
Accounting Arbitrator), a written report setting forth the resolution of any
such disagreement determined in accordance with the terms of this Agreement
(such report to include a worksheet setting forth in reasonable detail all
material calculations used in arriving at such resolution). Such report shall
be final and binding upon Purchaser and Seller, and Purchaser and Seller
agree that a judgment enforcing the report of the Accounting Arbitrator may be
entered by a court having jurisdiction thereover. The fees, costs and expenses
of the Accounting Arbitrator arising in connection with this _Section 3.05
_shall be borne one-half by Purchaser and one-half by

 



23  Seller; _provided_ , _however_ , that either Purchaser or Seller may
instruct the Accounting Arbitrator to determine whether such party is
substantially correct in all aspects of the disagreement and, if the
Accounting Arbitrator so determines, such party shall pay none of the fees,
costs and expenses of the Accounting Arbitrator and the other party shall pay
all such fees, costs and expenses.

 

SECTION 3.06. _Stock Consideration Adjustment_.

 

(a) No later than January 12, 2013, Purchaser may deliver to Seller written
notice that Purchaser has received one or more binding commitments (each, an
" _Equity Commitment_ ") from one or more of the Persons identified on
_Schedule 3.06 of the Purchaser Disclosure Schedule_ (each such Person
delivering an Equity Commitment, an " _Equity Investor_ ") to purchase up to
12,756,910 shares of Arris HoldCo Common Stock in the aggregate at a price per
share equal to the Per Share Price, pursuant to which such Equity Investor(s)
shall be obligated to purchase such shares of Arris HoldCo Common Stock
subject only to customary representations and warranties relating to the
delivery of such shares (and other representations and warranties as may be
agreed by Purchaser and any Equity Investor provided that such
Equity Investors Equity Commitment contains no closing condition related to
such representations and warranties), the absence of any regulatory or other
legal prohibition to such purchase (including the absence of the imposition by
a Governmental Authority of adverse conditions as condition to permitting
such purchase to occur), a maximum Clawback Amount (as defined below), and the
occurrence of the Closing. Purchaser shall include with any such notice a copy
of each Equity Commitment. In addition, Purchaser shall cause each Equity
Commitment to provide that Purchaser shall terminate such Equity Commitment,
without any liability of any kind to Purchaser, upon the receipt of a notice
from Seller, to be delivered by Seller at any time before Closing in its sole
discretion, or upon election at any time before Closing by Purchaser, in
Purchasers sole discretion, if Seller or Purchaser conclude, in their
respective sole discretion, that not to do so would delay Closing. 

(b) The Base Stock Consideration shall be reduced by the amount of shares
committed to be purchased pursuant to the Equity Commitment(s) and the Base
Cash Consideration shall be increased by an amount equal to the product of the
number of shares committed to be purchased pursuant to the Equity
Commitment(s) and the Per Share Price.

 

(c) Purchaser will use its reasonable best efforts to consummate the Equity
Commitment(s). Without limiting the foregoing, Purchaser shall notify Seller
not later than two Business Days prior to Closing if any Equity Commitment
will not be funded as of the Closing, in which case the Stock Consideration
will be increased by the total number of shares in respect of which such
Equity Commitment will not be funded and the Cash Consideration will be
correspondingly reduced by an amount equal to the product of such total number
of shares and the Per Share Price.

 

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to the Closing Date,
Seller may elect by written notice to the Purchaser to increase the Stock
Consideration by any amount up to the Base Stock Consideration (the amount of
any such increase, the " _Clawback Amount_ ") if necessary in the good faith
judgment of Seller in order to preserve 

 



24  the tax treatment of the Exchanges as an "exchange" governed by the
provisions of Section 351 of the Code. In the event of such an election, (i)
the total number of shares to be purchased pursuant to the Equity Commitments
shall be reduced by the Clawback Amount and (ii) the Cash Consideration,
subject to any adjustments pursuant to clause (b) or (c) above, shall be
reduced by an amount equal to the product of the Clawback Amount and the Per
Share Price.

SECTION 3.07. _Other Adjustments_. If, during the period between the date
hereof and the Closing any change in the common stock of Purchaser shall
occur, as a result of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split
(including reverse stock split), merger, combination, exchange or readjustment
of stock, subdivision or other similar transaction, or any dividend of stock
thereon, (i) the Base Stock Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted to
eliminate the effect of such event and (ii) the number of shares of Arris
HoldCo Common Stock that may be purchased by the Equity Investors pursuant to
Section 3.06 shall be similarly adjusted. Without limiting the foregoing,
nothing in this Section 3.07 shall be deemed to permit Purchaser to take any
actions otherwise prohibited under this Agreement.

SECTION 3.08. _Accounting_. To the extent that, after the Closing, (a)
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates receives any payment that is properly for
the account of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries according to the terms of
this Agreement or Seller or any of its Subsidiaries makes a required payment
on behalf of the Company, Purchaser shall promptly (after the end of the
financial quarter in which such payment was received or required to be made,
as the case may be) pay such amount to Seller, or (b) Seller or any of its
Affiliates receives any payment that is properly for the account of Purchaser
or any of its Affiliates according to the terms of this Agreement or Purchaser
or any of its Affiliates makes a required payment on behalf of Seller, Seller
shall promptly (after the end of the financial quarter in which such payment
was received or required to be made, as the case may be) pay such amount to
Purchaser. All amounts due and payable under this _Section 3.06_ shall be due
and payable by the applicable party in immediately available funds, by wire
transfer to the account designated in advance by the other party and shall be
treated as an adjustment to the Cash Consideration for tax purposes in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

 

ARTICLE IV

 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SELLER

Except as set forth in the Seller Disclosure Schedule delivered by Seller to
Purchaser simultaneously with the execution hereof, or as disclosed in the
Financial Statements, Seller represents and warrants to Purchaser that all of

date of this Agreement (or, if made as of a specified date, as of such date).
For purposes of the representations and warranties of Seller contained
herein, disclosure in one section of the Seller Disclosure Schedule of any
facts or circumstances shall be deemed to be disclosure of such facts or
circumstances with respect to any other representations or warranties by

apparent on the face of the Seller Disclosure Schedule that such disclosure is
applicable to such representation or warranty. The inclusion of any
information in any section of the Seller Disclosure Schedule or other
document delivered by Seller pursuant to this Agreement shall not be deemed to
be an

 



25  admission or evidence of the materiality of such item, nor shall it
establish a standard of materiality for any purpose whatsoever. Unless
otherwise expressly specified herein, it is understood and agreed that the
representations and warranties of Seller contained herein (a) are not made in
respect of, and expressly do not extend to, the Retained Liabilities,
Specified Retained Litigation or the Excluded Assets and the
Liabilities related thereto either as of the date hereof or any other date,
and (b) shall be deemed to be made in respect of, and to extend to, the
Included Assets as if the Company and the Company Subsidiaries owned such

performing its obligations under this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents or from consummating the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby. Seller has made available to Purchaser complete and correct copies
of the organizational documents of the Company and each Company Subsidiary,
each as amended, supplemented or otherwise modified through and including the

requisite corporate power and authority to execute this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements to which it is, or is specified to be, a party, to fully
perform its obligations hereunder and thereunder and to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. The execution and delivery by
Seller of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements to which it is, or is
specified to be, a party and the consummation by Seller of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby have been duly authorized by all necessary
action on the part of Seller, and no other action on the part of Seller or
its shareholders is necessary to authorize this Agreement or such Ancillary
Agreements or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby. Seller has duly executed and delivered this Agreement and will have
duly executed and delivered each Ancillary Agreement to which it is, or is
specified to be, a party, and, assuming the due execution and delivery by
Purchaser, this Agreement constitutes Sellers, and each Ancillary Agreement
to which Seller is, or is specified to be, a party will, after execution and
delivery by Seller, constitute Sellers legal, valid and binding obligation,
enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, subject to
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other Laws
affecting creditors rights generally and general principles of equity,
regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at Law.

 

SECTION 4.03. _No Conflicts; Consents and Approvals_. Subject to (a) receipt

(each, a " _Consent_ "), and the making of the filings and notifications, in
each case listed in _Section 4.03 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule_, (b) the
requirements of the HSR Act and applicable non-U.S. Laws and Governmental
Authorities with respect to foreign investment and competition, and (c) the

26  by Seller or Purchaser of reports under the Exchange Act and as contemplated

Company Subsidiaries is bound; or

assets, properties or rights of the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries;

except, (x) in the case of (D) above, as would not reasonably be expected,
individually or in the aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect or to
prevent or materially impair or delay Seller from performing its obligations
under this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents or from consummating
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, and (y) in the case of each
of (B), (C) and (E) above, as would not be material to the Business.

SECTION 4.04. _Ownership and Possession of Shares_. Seller is the record and
beneficial owner of all of the issued and outstanding Shares and Seller will
deliver to Purchaser at the Closing record and beneficial ownership of the
Shares, in each case free and clear of all Liens, except for any Liens created
by the Transaction Documents and Liens arising under the Securities Act or
any applicable securities laws.

SECTION 4.05. _Capitalization_. The issued and outstanding capital stock of
the Company consists exclusively of the Shares. All of the Shares are duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable. There are no
options, rights or agreements to which any of Seller, the Company or any of
the Company Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of them is

fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees
who have a significant role in Purchasers internal controls over financial
reporting. To the Knowledge of Purchaser, Purchasers Chief Executive Officer

privilege, the work product doctrine or any other privileges to the extent
relating to (i) the Business at or before Closing, (ii) any business,

potentially be a party or a third party witness or have contribution
obligations.

efforts, including by entering into joint defense agreements at the
reasonable request of Seller, to preserve the applicability of the attorney-
client privilege, the work product doctrine and any other privileges to the
information, materials and documents that Purchaser or any of
its Subsidiaries has received or will receive from, or has provided to or
will provide to, Parent, Guarantor, Seller and their respective Subsidiaries.

that differs in a material respect from the texts agreed upon in advance of
the initial announcement and explanation of this Agreement and the

thereof, such agreement not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed and except that each party may make any such disclosure as required by

actually paid out to Seller or any of its Subsidiaries under occurrence-based
Seller Policies (other than actual or de facto self-insurance arrangements)
after the Closing shall be for the benefit of Purchaser to the extent such
claims and proceeds are in respect of the Business (other than the Excluded
Assets) arising from any event, act or omission prior to the Closing and
Seller shall cause such proceeds to be transferred to Purchaser promptly after
such proceeds are received by Seller after the Closing; _provided_ , _however_
, that such proceeds shall be for the benefit of, and shall be kept by,
Seller to the extent such proceeds are reimbursements for expenditures that
have been made prior to the Closing by Seller or that relate to Retained
Liabilities. If (i) Purchaser would be entitled to the proceeds of a claim
made after the Closing under an occurrence-based Seller Policy (other than
any actual or de facto self-insurance arrangement) relating to the period
prior to the Closing and (ii) Purchaser informs Seller in a timely manner of
such claim, then Seller shall report and pursue such claim in a manner that
is at least as favorable to the claimant as the manner in which Seller reports
and pursues claims by its then-existing Subsidiaries; _provided_ _that_ if the
insurer disputes such claim, then Seller shall only be required to contest
such position of the insurer if Purchaser pays, without the right to set off,
the costs and expenses of such contest (without regard to the outcome of such
dispute). With respect to insurance coverage written on a claims made basis,
(i) Seller and its Subsidiaries shall have no Liability to Purchaser and its
Affiliates or the Business under such insurance coverage in connection with
claims made after the Closing and (ii) to the extent the Closing
Working Capital takes into account rights to receive further payments under
such policies as an asset of the Business, Purchaser shall have the right to
receive such payment if and when made to Seller.

 

(d) Purchaser shall cooperate with Seller and its Subsidiaries to obtain the
return or release of all bonds, security and indemnifications given by Seller
and its Subsidiaries (other than the Company and the Company Subsidiaries)
without any further Liability on the part of Seller and its Subsidiaries
(other than the Company and the Company Subsidiaries) in connection with the
Business, and, if necessary, to effectuate such return or release, Purchaser
shall, to the extent required, post its own bonds, letters of credit,
indemnifications and other security in substitution therefor.

 

SECTION 6.06. _Certain Services and Benefits Provided by Affiliates;
Intercompany Matters; Further Assurances_.

 

(a) Purchaser acknowledges that the Business currently receives Overhead and
Shared Services from Parent and its Subsidiaries (other than the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries). Purchaser further acknowledges that, except as
otherwise expressly provided in the Transition Services Agreement or as set
forth in _Section 6.06(a) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule_, as it relates
to the Business, all such Overhead and Shared Services shall cease, and any
agreement by the Company or any Company Subsidiary with Parent or any
Subsidiary of Parent (other than the Company and the Company Subsidiaries) in
respect thereof shall terminate, as of the Closing Date.

 



59 (b) Except as set forth in _Section 6.06(a) of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule_, from and after the Closing, all rights and obligations
of any party under all agreements and arrangements between Parent and its
Subsidiaries (other than the Company and the Company Subsidiaries), on the one
hand, and the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, on the other hand, shall
terminate and be cancelled without any further Liability, including Liability
relating to any period prior to the Closing. From and after the Closing,
Seller shall cause Parent and its Subsidiaries, and Purchaser shall cause the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries, to agree to the provisions of this
_Section 6.06_.

(c) Without limiting the scope of _Section 6.06(a)_ or _Section 6.06(b)_,
prior to the Closing, Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
itself to be substituted in all respects for Parent and its Subsidiaries
(other than the Company and the Company Subsidiaries), and for Parent and its
Subsidiaries (other than the Company and the Company Subsidiaries) to be
released, effective as of the Closing (or, if such substitution and release
cannot be effected as of the Closing, as soon as reasonably possible after the
Closing and, in any event, no later than 30 days after Closing), in respect of
all Liabilities of Parent and its Subsidiaries (other than the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries) under each of the Indemnified Guarantees (as such
term is defined below). For any Indemnified Guarantees for which Purchaser is
not substituted in all respects for Parent and its Subsidiaries (other than
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries) or for which Parent and its
Subsidiaries (other than the Company and the Company Subsidiaries) are not
released effective as of the Closing, Purchaser shall continue to use its
reasonable best efforts and shall cause the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries to use their respective reasonable best efforts to effect such
substitution and release as soon as practicable after the Closing. Purchaser
further agrees that, to the extent Parent and its Subsidiaries are not fully
and irrevocably released and discharged, Purchaser shall, and shall cause the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries, jointly and severally, to indemnify and
hold harmless Parent and its Subsidiaries (other than the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries) their respective managers, officers, directors,
employees, representatives, agents, successors and assigns (the " _Parent
Indemnitees_ ") against any Liabilities that any Parent Indemnitee suffers,
incurs or is liable from and after the Closing by reason of or arising out of
or in consequence of: (A) any Parent Indemnitee maintaining, issuing, making
payment under, being required to pay or reimburse the issuer of, or being a
party to any Indemnified Guarantees; (ii) any claim or demand for payment
made on any Parent Indemnitee with respect to any of any Indemnified
Guarantee; or (iii) any Action, claim or proceeding by any Person who is or
claims to be entitled to the benefit of or claims to be entitled to payment,
reimbursement or indemnity with respect to any Indemnified Guarantee. For
purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Indemnified Guarantees_ " shall mean
the Liabilities of Parent and its Subsidiaries (other than the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries) under any guarantee, indemnity, surety bond, letter
of credit, bank guarantee, keepwell agreement, consumer financing
arrangements, credit support, or other similar commitment,
understanding, agreement or obligation relating to the Business.

(d) Each of Purchaser and Seller shall, and shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries (including, in the case of Purchaser from and after the Closing,
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries) to, execute and deliver such
documents and other papers and take such further actions as may reasonably
be required to carry out the provisions of this

 



60  Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and give effect to the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby; _provided_ that, notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in such documents or other papers, nothing in such documents or
other papers shall supersede or otherwise amend or modify the rights and
obligations provided for in this Agreement and, in the event of any conflict
or alleged conflict between such documents or other papers, on the one hand,
and this Agreement, on the other hand, the terms and conditions of this
Agreement (including _Articles XI_ and _XII_ ) shall prevail. Each of
Purchaser and Seller shall, upon the request of the other party, and at no
cost to the requesting party (other than reimbursement of out-of-pocket
expenses), make its employees available at reasonable times and cooperate in
all reasonable respects in the preparation for, and prosecution and defense
of, each Specified Retained Litigation and each other lawsuit, arbitration or
other Action (whether disclosed or not disclosed in the Seller Disclosure
Schedule) filed or claimed against Seller, the Company or any Company
Subsidiaries or any of their Affiliates or any of the respective agents,
directors, officers and employees, whether currently pending or asserted in
the future by any third party (i.e., not disputes under this Agreement),
concerning the operation or conduct of the Business prior to the Closing Date
(including in each case by making employees available at reasonable times to
provide information and discovery documentation, take depositions and
testify); _provided_ _that_ each of Purchaser and Seller shall take all
reasonable precautions so as not to jeopardize any privilege reasonably
available to any of Purchaser, Seller or any of their respective Affiliates.

SECTION 6.07. _Certain Intellectual Property Matters_.

 

(a) Purchaser agrees that, following the Closing Date, Purchaser shall not
knowingly use and shall cause each of its Affiliates to not knowingly use any
third-party software loaded on the Equipment included in the assets of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary as of the Closing Date if such software is
not licensed to Purchaser for such use, and Purchaser acknowledges and agrees
that, following the Closing Date, Purchaser and its Affiliates do not have the
right to use any such software. Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable
best efforts, as soon as is reasonably practical, to license or delete all
such software from any of the Equipment on which it is installed.

(b) Purchaser and the Company acknowledge that the Patents included in the
Company Intellectual Property are acquired subject to any pre-existing
licenses. Purchaser agrees to (i) be bound and cause its Affiliates (including
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries) and any subsequent assignee to be
bound by any obligations imposed by any Governmental Order entered prior to
Closing applicable to any Patents included in the Company Intellectual
Property, if any, that are "essential" (as defined by the rules of any
standard-setting bodies, industry groups or consortia or by such Governmental
Order) or are otherwise required to be licensed on fair, reasonable and non-
discriminatory or royalty-free terms pursuant to the promises, declarations
and commitments referenced in clause (ii)(x) below, provided that Seller
shall provide to Purchaser a copy of any such Governmental Order prior to the
Closing Date, (ii) be bound and cause its Affiliates (including the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries) and any subsequent assignee to be bound by the
Liabilities arising from the promises, declarations and commitments made by or
otherwise binding upon Seller or its Affiliates, including the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries, concerning any of the Patents included in the Company
Intellectual Property, (x) in

 



61  connection with the standard-setting bodies, industry groups or consortia
(or their members or implementers of their standards or specifications) that
are set forth in  _Section 6.07(b)(ii)(x) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule_
and (y) pursuant to the Contracts that are set forth in _Section
6.07(b)(ii)(y) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule_, and (iii) notify in writing
any subsequent purchaser of any of the Patents included in the Company
Intellectual Property of the existence of promises, declarations and
commitments made to the standard-setting bodies, industry groups or consortia
set forth in  _Section 6.07(b)(ii)(x)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule (to
the extent applicable to such Patents) and to require such subsequent
purchasers to notice terms substantially the same as those set forth in this 
_Section 6.07(b)(ii)_.

(c) If between the date hereof and the Closing Date it becomes apparent
that the TCC License Agreement between Guarantor and Tessera, Inc. ("
_Tessera_ "), effective as of January 1, 2011, and amended as of April 1, 2011
(the " _Tessera Agreement_ "), will survive the Closing Date, Purchaser
agrees to enter, at Sellers sole expense, prior to the Closing Date, into a
license agreement with Tessera for the Business, such license having identical
terms and conditions to the Tessera Agreement, and otherwise in
accordance with Section VII.D thereof. Guarantor agrees to cooperate in good
faith and use reasonable efforts to facilitate the conclusion of such license
agreement between Purchaser and Tessera as may be reasonably required.

 

(d) Between the date hereof and the Closing Date, Guarantor shall transfer a
portion of Guarantors interest in a certain joint venture (the " _JV_ ") to
the Company, such that the Company shall hold a 25.3% Interest in the JV and
Guarantor shall hold a 8% Interest in the JV, and both the Company and
Guarantor shall be Members of the JV (as "Member" and "Interest" are defined
in the Limited Liability Company Agreement for the JV, dated as of January 31,
2007 (the " _JV Agreement_ ")). Guarantor and the Company agree to execute
such instruments as necessary to effect the transfer of the portion of
Guarantors Interest in the JV as specified herein. The Company and Purchaser
agree that Company shall be bound by the terms of the JV Agreement and shall
be responsible for Guarantor and the Companys share of financial or other
contributions for the management and prosecution of the IP Portfolio (as
defined in the JV Agreement), and Guarantor shall not have any such
obligations, provided that Company shall be entitled to all rights to acquire
or assert patents included within the IP Portfolio (as defined in the JV
Agreement) and to all income attributable to Company and Guarantor based on
their Interests (other than out-of-pocket costs of Guarantor), and Guarantor
shall have no such rights.

SECTION 6.08. _Ancillary Agreements_.

 

(a) Prior to the Closing Date, Purchaser and Seller each shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to agree upon Schedule A to the Transition
Services Agreement.

(b) On the Closing Date, each of Purchaser and Seller shall (and, if
applicable, each shall cause its Subsidiaries or, in the case of Purchaser,
its Affiliates to) execute and deliver each of the Ancillary Agreements to
which it is a party if such Ancillary Agreement has not been previously
executed and delivered.

 



62 (c) As soon as practicable after the date hereof, Seller shall,
after consulting with Purchaser, appoint a national bank to serve as the
paying agent (" _Paying Agent_ ") pursuant to _Section 3.04_. Seller and
Purchaser shall each execute and deliver a customary paying agent agreement
(the " _Paying Agent Agreement_ ") with Paying Agent and bear 50% of all
amounts owing to Paying Agent in accordance with such agreement.

SECTION 6.09. _Maintenance of Books and Records_. After the Closing, each of
Purchaser and Seller shall preserve (and shall cause each of their respective
Affiliates and Subsidiaries to preserve), until at least the sixth
anniversary of the Closing Date, all pre-Closing records possessed or to be
possessed by such party relating to the Business. After the Closing Date and
up until at least the sixth anniversary of the Closing Date, upon any
reasonable request from a party hereto or its employees, agents or
representatives, the party holding such records shall (a) provide to the
requesting party or its employees, agents or representatives reasonable access
to such records during normal business hours and (b) permit the requesting
party or its employees, agents or representatives to make copies of such
records, in each case at no cost to the requesting party or its employees,
agents or representatives (other than for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses);
_provided_ , _however_ , that nothing herein shall require either party to
disclose any information to the other if such disclosure would jeopardize any
attorney-client or other legal privilege or contravene any applicable Law,
fiduciary duty or arrangement (it being understood that each party shall
cooperate in any reasonable efforts and requests for waivers that would enable
otherwise required disclosure to the other party to occur
without jeopardizing any such privilege or contravening such Law, duty or
agreement); _provided_ , _further_ , that Seller shall have no obligation to
Purchaser under this _Section 6.09_ to preserve any records related to Taxes
that Seller was not required to make available pursuant to _clause (a)_ of
_Section 6.02_ hereof. Such records may be sought under this _Section 6.09_
for any reasonable purpose, including to the extent reasonably required
in connection with the audit, accounting, tax, litigation, federal securities
disclosure or other similar needs of the party seeking such records.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any and all such records may be destroyed by a
party if such destroying party sends to the other party hereto written notice
of its intent to destroy such records, specifying in reasonable detail the
contents of the records to be destroyed; such records may then be destroyed
after the 60th day following such notice unless the other party hereto
notifies the destroying party that such other party desires to obtain
possession of such records, in which event the destroying party shall transfer
the records to such requesting party and such requesting party shall pay all
reasonable expenses of the destroying party in connection therewith.

SECTION 6.10. _Internal Restructuring_.

 

(a) Seller shall use its reasonable best efforts to complete, as promptly as
practicable and at Sellers sole cost and expense, the Internal Restructuring
in a manner that is substantially in accordance with _Section 6.10 of the
Seller Disclosure Schedule_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
the failure to complete all or any part of the Internal Restructuring prior
to the Closing Date shall not give rise to the failure of any condition to
Closing in _Section 9.02_ to have been satisfied.

 

(b) As promptly as practicable after the date hereof (and in any event not
later than thirty (30) days after the date hereof), Seller and Purchaser
shall establish a transition committee (the " _Transition Committee_ ")
jointly led by one (1) representative designated by

 



63  each of Seller and Purchaser. Seller and Purchaser will use their reasonable
best efforts to cause the Transition Committee to agree, not later than 45
days following the date hereof, upon a schedule of services that will be
provided by Seller or any of its Affiliates in preparation for, or in
connection with, the operational or physical separation of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries from Seller and its Affiliates.

 

(c) With respect to any of the Included Assets or corresponding Liabilities of
the Business that are to be transferred to the Company or a Company
Subsidiary pursuant to the Internal Restructuring and that have not been so
transferred on or prior to the Closing Date, (i) Purchaser and Seller shall
(and Purchaser shall cause the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to) use
their respective reasonable best efforts from and after the Closing to
complete the Internal Restructuring, and (ii) until such time as the Internal
Restructuring has been completed, any such Included Assets and
corresponding Liabilities, to the extent not fully transferred in accordance
with the Internal Restructuring shall be subject to the following
arrangements: (A) Purchaser and Seller shall (and Purchaser shall cause the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries to) use their respective reasonable best
efforts from and after the Closing (1) to cause such Included Assets to be
held for the use and benefit, insofar as reasonably possible, of Purchaser,
the Company or one or more of the Company Subsidiaries (as specified by
Purchaser), at Purchasers expense; and (2) to place Purchaser, the Company or
one or more of the Company Subsidiaries (as specified by Purchaser), insofar
as reasonably possible, in the same position as if such Included Assets had
been transferred as contemplated by the Internal Restructuring (including
granting Liens on the Included Assets as necessary in connection with the Debt
Financing) and so that all the benefits and Liabilities relating to such
Included Assets, including possession, use, risk of loss, potential for gain,
and dominion, control and command over such Included Assets and all
corresponding Liabilities, inure from and after the Closing Date to Purchaser,
the Company or one or more of the Company Subsidiaries (as specified by
Purchaser); (B) notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Purchaser
shall reimburse Seller for (or, upon request, advance to Seller) all out-of-
pocket expenses incurred by Seller or any of its Affiliates in connection
with the immediately preceding _clause (A)_ ; and (C) Purchaser shall
indemnify Parent, Guarantor, Seller and their respective Affiliates for any
Liabilities corresponding to such Included Assets (except to the extent
resulting from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Seller or any of
its Affiliates) that arise during or relate to the period between Closing and
such time as such Included Assets are fully transferred pursuant to
_clause (i)_ above, _provided_ that such indemnification obligation under
this _clause (C)_ shall be subject to set-off for any amounts owing by Seller
to Purchaser under _Article XI_ to the extent arising from such Liabilities. 

(d) With respect to any of the Excluded Assets or corresponding Liabilities
that are to be transferred by the Company or any Company Subsidiary to Seller
or an Affiliate of Seller pursuant to the Internal Restructuring and that have
not been so transferred on or prior to the Closing Date, (i) Purchaser and
Seller shall (and Purchaser shall cause the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries to) use their respective reasonable best efforts from and after
the Closing to complete the Internal Restructuring, and (ii) until such time
as the Internal Restructuring has been completed, any such Excluded Assets
and corresponding Liabilities, to the extent not fully transferred in
accordance with the Internal Restructuring shall be subject to the following
arrangements: (A) Purchaser and Seller shall (and Purchaser 

 



64  shall cause the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to) use their
respective reasonable best efforts from and after the Closing (1) to cause
such Excluded Assets to be held for the use and benefit, insofar as
reasonably possible, of Seller or one or more of its Affiliates (as specified
by Seller), at Sellers expense; and (2) to place Seller or one or more of its
Affiliates (as specified by Seller), insofar as reasonably possible, in the
same position as if such Excluded Assets had been transferred as contemplated
by the Internal Restructuring and so that all the benefits and Liabilities
relating to such Excluded Assets, including possession, use, risk of
loss, potential for gain, and dominion, control and command over such
Excluded Assets and all corresponding Liabilities, inure from and after the
Closing Date to Seller or one or more of its Affiliates (as specified by
Seller); (B) notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Seller shall
reimburse Purchaser for (or, upon request, advance to Purchaser) all out-of-
pocket expenses incurred by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates in connection
with the immediately preceding _clause (A)_ ; and (C) Seller shall indemnify
Purchaser and its Affiliates for any Liabilities corresponding to such
Excluded Assets (except to the extent resulting from the gross negligence or
willful misconduct of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates). 

SECTION 6.11. _Financing._

 

(a) Purchaser shall not permit any amendment or modification to be made to, or
any waiver of any provision or remedy under, or replace, the Debt Financing
Commitment if such amendment, modification, waiver or replacement (i) (A)
reduces the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing (including by changing the
amount of fees to be paid or original issue discount of the Debt Financing)
or (B) imposes new or additional conditions or otherwise expands, amends or
modifies any of the conditions to the receipt of the Debt Financing, in each
case in a manner that would reasonably be expected to (1) delay or prevent
the Closing, (2) delay or impair the availability of the Debt Financing at
Closing or impede the satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the Debt
Financing at Closing, or (3) otherwise adversely impact the ability of
Purchaser to enforce its rights against other parties to the Debt Financing
Commitment or the definitive agreements with respect thereto (collectively,
the " _Restricted Financing Commitment Amendments_ ") ( _provided_  that,
subject to the limitations set forth in this _Section 6.11_, Purchaser may
amend the Debt Financing Commitment to add lenders, lead arrangers,
bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities who had not executed the
Debt Financing Commitment as of the date hereof, but only if the addition of
such additional parties, individually or in the aggregate, would not result in
the occurrence of a Restricted Financing Commitment Amendment), or (ii)
results in the early termination of the Debt Financing Commitment, and shall
use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and
to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to
arrange and consummate the Debt Financing on the terms and conditions
described in the Debt Financing Commitment and to cause the conditions
described in _clause (y)_ of the final proviso to the definition of
"Marketing Period" set forth in _Section 1.01_ to be satisfied as promptly
as practicable, including using its reasonable best efforts to (A) maintain in
effect the Debt Financing Commitment (including by complying with so-called
"flex" provisions) until the funding of the Debt Financing at or prior to
Closing, (B) satisfy on a timely basis (or obtain a waiver of) all conditions
and covenants applicable to Purchaser to obtaining the Debt Financing at
Closing as set forth therein, (C) negotiate, execute and deliver definitive
agreements with respect to such Debt Financing on the terms and conditions
(including the "flex" provisions) contemplated by the Debt

 



65  Financing Commitment (and provide copies thereof to Seller), (D) fully pay
any and all commitment fees or other fees required by the Debt Financing
Commitment and (E) upon satisfaction of the conditions set forth in the Debt
Financing Commitment, consummate the Debt Financing at or prior to Closing. In
the event any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms
and conditions (including any "flex" provisions) contemplated in the Debt
Financing Commitment, Purchaser shall promptly notify Seller and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do,
or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange to
obtain alternative financing from alternative sources (x) with conditions to
the funding of the Debt Financing not materially less favorable to the
interests of Seller than those included in the Debt Financing Commitment and
(y) in an amount sufficient to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby, including the payment of the Estimated Cash Consideration, the amounts
to be paid pursuant to _Section 3.05_ (if any) and all related fees
and expenses promptly following the occurrence of such event, and in any
event prior to or on the Closing Date. Purchaser shall promptly deliver to
Seller true and complete copies of all agreements pursuant to which any such
alternative source shall have committed to provide Seller with any portion of
the Debt Financing. Purchaser shall keep Seller reasonably informed and in
reasonable detail with respect to all material developments concerning the
Debt Financing. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Purchaser
shall promptly (and, in any event, within one (1) Business Day) notify Seller
in writing (1) of any breach or default (or any event or circumstance that,
with or without notice, lapse of time or both could reasonably be expected to
give rise to any breach or default) by any party to the Debt Financing
Commitment or the definitive agreements with respect thereto, (2) of the
receipt by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates or their respective employees,
agents or representatives of any notice or other communication from any Person
with respect to any (A) actual or potential breach, default, termination or
repudiation by any party to the Debt Financing Commitment or any
definitive agreement related thereto or any provision of the Debt Financing
contemplated pursuant to the Debt Financing Commitment or any definitive
agreement related thereto (including any proposal by any lender named in the
Debt Financing Commitment or any definitive agreement related thereto to
withdraw, terminate or make a material change in the terms of (including the
amount of financing contemplated by) the Debt Financing Commitment) or (B)
material dispute or disagreement between or among any parties to the Debt
Financing Commitment or any definitive agreement related thereto and (3) if
for any reason Purchaser believes in good faith that there is a material
possibility that it will not be able to obtain all or any portion of the
financing contemplated in the Debt Financing Commitment on the terms, in the
manner or from the sources contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitment or
the definitive agreements related thereto. References in this Agreement to
"Debt Financing" shall include the financing contemplated by the Debt
Financing Commitment as permitted by this _Section 6.11_ to be amended,
modified or replaced (including, replacement with alternative financing and
alternative financing commitments pursuant to this _Section 6.11_) and
references to "Debt Financing Commitment" shall include such documents as
permitted by this _Section 6.11_ to be amended, modified or replaced
(including replacement with alternative financing commitments pursuant to
this _Section 6.11_), in each case from and after such amendment,
modification or replacement. Prior to the consummation of the Debt Financing,
Purchaser shall not, and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries, to accept
any offer for all or any substantial part of the capital stock of Purchaser or
the Business.

 



66 (b) Prior to Closing, Seller and its Subsidiaries shall use their
reasonable best efforts to provide to Purchaser, and shall use their
reasonable best efforts to cause their respective employees, advisors and
representatives to provide to Purchaser, all cooperation that is reasonably
requested by Purchaser in connection with the Debt Financing, including: (i)
participating in a reasonable number of meetings, presentations, road shows,
drafting sessions, due diligence sessions and sessions with prospective
Financing Sources, investors and ratings agencies, and reasonably cooperating
with the marketing efforts of Purchaser and its Financing Sources, in each
case in connection with the Debt Financing, (ii) furnishing Purchaser and its
Financing Sources with the Required Financial Information (it
being understood that the failure to provide audited financial statements as
of and for the year ended December 31, 2012 prior to March 30, 2013 shall not
be deemed a breach of this _Section 6.11(b)(ii)_), (iii) assisting with
the preparation of materials for rating agency presentations, bank
information memoranda, and similar documents required in connection with the
Debt Financing, (iv) assisting with the completion of the definitive financing
documents and in taking such steps as may be necessary to perfect the liens
and security interests to be granted as security for the Debt Financing in the
assets of the Business; _provided_ , that any such liens or security interests
do not attach or otherwise become effective prior to the occurrence of the
Closing, (v) executing and delivering, on behalf of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries, any necessary pledge and security documents and
otherwise reasonably facilitating the granting of a security interest (and
perfection thereof) in collateral, guarantees, mortgages, other definitive
financing documents or other certificates or documents as may reasonably be
requested by Purchaser; _provided_ that any obligations contained in all
such agreements and documents shall be subject to the occurrence of the
Closing and effective no earlier than the Closing, (vi) obtaining a
certificate of the Chief Financial Officer of the Business with respect to
solvency matters to the extent required by the Financing Sources, customary
authorization letters with respect to the bank information memoranda and (vii)
using reasonable best efforts to obtain legal opinions, surveys and title
insurance at the expense of and as reasonably requested by Purchaser on
behalf of the Financing Sources; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing herein
shall require such cooperation either to support any financing other than a
debt financing in the form of a secured credit facility or to the extent it
would interfere unreasonably with the Business or operations of Seller and its
Subsidiaries; and _provided_ , _further_ , that Seller, its Affiliates and its
and their respective officers, directors or employees shall not be required
to authorize, execute, deliver or perform under any agreement with respect to
the Debt Financing that is not contingent upon the Closing or that would be
effective prior to the Closing. Seller, on behalf of the Business, hereby
consents to the use of the Businesss logos in connection with the Debt
Financing contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitment; _provided_ , that
such logos are used solely in a manner that is not intended to, nor reasonably
likely to, harm or disparage the Business, Seller or its Affiliates. Seller
agrees that it shall consent to Purchasers publicly furnishing to the SEC, on
Item 7.01 of Form 8-K, Required Financial Information (that is listed in
clause (1) of the definition of "Required Financial Information") solely to
the extent necessary to permit syndication of the Term Loan B to lenders that
would not participate in such syndication if they were to receive material
non-public information. 

 



67 (c) If the Marketing Period ends before, but the Closing Date has
not occurred by, February 28, 2013, then Seller shall prepare and deliver, by
no later than February 28, 2013, the consolidated unaudited balance sheet and
consolidated unaudited statements of operations, cash flows and
shareholders equity of the Business as of and for the year ended December
31, 2012. If the Marketing Period ends before, but the Closing Date has not
occurred by, March 30, 2013, then Seller shall prepare and deliver, by no
later than March 30, 2013, the consolidated balance sheet and consolidated
statements of operations, cash flows and shareholders equity of the Business
as of and for the year ended December 31, 2012, accompanied by an unqualified
report thereon of the independent accountants of the Business.

(d) None of Seller, its Affiliates (other than the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries after the Closing) and its and their employees, agents or
representatives shall be required to take any action that would subject such
Person to actual or potential liability, to bear any cost or expense or to pay
any commitment or other similar fee or make any other payment or incur any
other liability or provide or agree to provide any indemnity in connection
with the Debt Financing or their performance of their respective obligations
under this _Section 6.11_ and any information utilized in connection
therewith. Purchaser shall, without set-off, indemnify and hold harmless
Seller, its Affiliates and its and their employees, agents and representatives
from and against any and all liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs,
expenses, interest, awards, judgments and penalties suffered or incurred by
them in connection with the arrangement of the Debt Financing and the
performance of their respective obligations under this _Section 6.11_ or any
information utilized in connection therewith except to the extent arising from
the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Seller or its Affiliates.
Purchaser shall, without set-off, promptly upon request of Seller, advance or
reimburse (as requested) Seller and its Affiliates for all out-of-pocket
costs (including those of its and their accountants, consultants, legal
counsel, agents and other representatives) to be incurred or that have been
incurred by Seller and its Affiliates in connection with their performance of
this _Section 6.11_ or otherwise to support or cooperate with the Debt
Financing.

(e) Prior to the Closing, Purchaser shall not (and shall not permit any of its
Affiliates to) take any action, or enter into any transaction, or any
agreement to effect any transaction that might reasonably be expected to (i)
delay or impair the availability of the Debt Financing at Closing or impede
the satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the Debt Financing at Closing,
or (ii) otherwise materially and adversely impact the ability of Purchaser to
enforce its rights against other parties to the Debt Financing Commitment or
the definitive agreements with respect thereto.

SECTION 6.12. _Reporting Obligations_. Seller will use its reasonable best
efforts (and deliver no later than 71 days after the date of the filing with

Form 8-K), to prepare the financial information required by Purchaser for
filings of Purchaser required under Item 9 of Form 8-K as a result of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby;  _provided_ , that for
the avoidance of doubt, Seller shall not be deemed to be in breach of this
undertaking as a result of a failure to deliver audited financial statements
of the Company as of and for the year ended December 31, 2012 prior to March
31, 2013. Seller shall bear up to $1,900,000, in the

representatives) to be incurred or that have been incurred by Seller and its
Affiliates in connection with the preparation of audited financial statements
as of and for the year ended December 31, 2012. Purchaser shall, without set-
off, promptly upon request of Seller, advance or reimburse (as requested)
Seller and its Affiliates for any out-of-pocket costs to be incurred or that
have been incurred by Seller and its Affiliates (a) in excess of such
$1,900,000 in connection with the preparation of the audited financial
statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2012 and (b) otherwise
in connection with this _Section 6.12_.

 

SECTION 6.13. _Shared Contracts_. Prior to or at the Closing, each Contract

any Company Subsidiary, on the other hand, is a party and pursuant to which
services or supplies are provided to both (A) Seller or one of its Affiliates
(other than the Company and the Company Subsidiaries) and (B) the Company or
any Company Subsidiary (each, a " _Shared Contract_ ") shall be assigned in
part, or appropriately amended, so that each party being provided supplies or
services thereunder shall be entitled to the rights and benefits, and shall
assume the related portion of any Liabilities, that relate to its businesses,
in each case in accordance with the allocation of benefits and burdens set
forth in _Section 6.13 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule_ (the " _Shared
Contract Allocation_ "); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that, in no event shall
any assignment or amendment be required with respect to any Shared Contract
which is not assignable or cannot be amended by its terms (it being
understood, however, that: (i) Seller and Purchaser shall use their
respective commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions and use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to do, or
cause to have been done, and assisted and cooperated with the other party in
doing, all things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable to have obtained
such assignment or amendment of any such Shared Contract, and (ii) following
the Closing, with respect to any Shared Contract which has not been so
assigned or amended, Seller and Purchaser shall, if and to the extent
consistent with contractual obligations and applicable legal and fiduciary
obligations under applicable Law, use their respective reasonable best efforts
to cooperate in a mutually agreeable arrangement under which Seller and its
Affiliates, on the one hand, and the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, on
the other hand, would, in compliance with applicable Law, obtain the benefits
and assume the obligations and bear the economic burdens set forth pursuant
to the Shared Contract Allocation.

ARTICLE VII

EMPLOYEE MATTERS

 

SECTION 7.01. _Offers of Employment_.

 (a) As of December 12, 2012, _Section 7.01(a)(1) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule_ contains a true, correct and complete list of all of the Employees along with their title, primary place of employment, years of service and salary (or wages, if applicable). No later than the third Business Day prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall update _Section 7.01(a)(1) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule_ to reflect new hires of Employees and terminations of employment of Employees that occurred between such date and the fifth Business Day prior to the Closing Date, as well as any Employee Transfers. Effective as of the Closing Date, Purchaser shall, or shall cause one of its applicable Affiliates (including the Company or a Company Subsidiary) to, offer employment to each Employee who (i) is actively employed on such date or is absent from employment due to vacation or temporary illness not reasonably expected to exceed five (5) days (the " _Current Employees_ ") or (ii)(x) is absent from work due to an authorized leave of absence (including but not limited to a leave of absence due to a short-term or long-term disability) and (y) has the right to return to employment following expiration of such absence under applicable Law, effective as of the expiration of the leave (the " _Leave Employees_ " and, together with the Current Employees, the " _Closing Date Employees_ "), except in each case for Employees who are employed by the Company or a Company Subsidiary as of immediately prior to the Closing or whose employment otherwise transfers automatically to Purchaser or its Affiliate upon the occurrence of the Closing by operation of Law. All such offers of employment to (A) Current Employees shall provide for employment with Purchaser or an applicable Affiliate of Purchaser to commence effective as of 12:00 A.M., local time, on the day immediately following the Closing Date and (B) Leave Employees shall provide for employment with Purchaser or an applicable Affiliate of Purchaser to commence at the expiration of such Leave Employees leave. All such offers of employment shall be made in accordance with the applicable provisions of this _Section 7.01_. Each Closing Date Employee who accepts an offer of employment from Purchaser or one of its Affiliates and commences employment with Purchaser or an Affiliate, together with each Employee employed by the Company or a Company Subsidiary as of immediately prior to the Closing and each Employee whose employment is transferred to Purchaser or an Affiliate of Purchaser upon the occurrence of the Closing by operation of Law, shall be referred to herein as a " _Transferred Employee_ "; _provided_ _that_ a Leave Employee shall not be treated as a Transferred Employee until the 

 



72  expiration of the Leave Employees leave and the Leave Employees
commencement of active work. A Current Employee who arrives at his then
applicable place of employment in the Business on the first Business Day
immediately following the Closing Date shall be deemed for all purposes of
this Agreement to have accepted the offer from Purchaser or one of its
Affiliates. Offers pursuant to this _Section 7.01(a) _may, if Seller
reasonably requests, make employment contingent upon the Transferred
Employees waiver of any and all claims or right to severance in connection
with the transfer of employment. The date a Transferred Employee commences
employment with Purchaser or an Affiliate shall be referred to herein as the
" _Transfer Date_."

 

 (b) With respect to each U.S. Transferred Employee, Purchaser or its Affiliates shall provide such U.S. Transferred Employee with employment in a position that is comparable to such U.S. Transferred Employees position immediately prior to the Closing Date and, for the one-year period immediately following the Closing Date, Purchaser or its Affiliate: (i) shall provide to each Transferred Employee (A) no less favorable base salary, bonus opportunity and wage rates, as applicable, as provided to such Transferred Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date and (B) employee benefits under plans, programs and arrangements which will provide benefits to such Transferred Employee that are no less favorable, in the aggregate, than the benefits provided by Seller and its Affiliates, in each case, as of immediately prior to the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contemplated by this Agreement shall be construed as requiring either Purchaser or any of its Affiliates to be obligated to continue the employment of any Transferred Employee for any period after the Closing Date. 

 

 (c) With respect to each U.S. Transferred Employee, for the one-year period immediately following the Closing Date, Purchaser or its Affiliates shall provide severance benefits to each U.S. Transferred Employee that are no less favorable than those severance benefits applicable to such U.S. Transferred Employee as of immediately prior to the Closing Date. For the avoidance of doubt, if during such one-year period a U.S. Transferred Employees employment should terminate as a result of his or her desire not to accept a relocation to an office that would result in a commute of more than 50 miles from his or her office as of immediately prior to the Closing Date, then Purchaser will be obligated to pay such Transferred Employee severance at least equal to the amount that such U.S. Transferred Employee would have received if Sellers severance plan (as in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date) was still in effect on the date of such U.S. Transferred Employees termination (taking into account any service that such U.S. Transferred Employee has with Purchaser or its Affiliates as of the date of such termination of employment). 

 

 (d) With respect to each U.S. Transferred Employee, effective from and after the Transfer Date, Purchaser or its Affiliates shall (i) recognize, for all purposes under all plans, programs and arrangements established or maintained by Purchaser or its Affiliates for the benefit of the U.S. Transferred Employees, service with Seller and its Affiliates prior to the Transfer Date to the extent such service was recognized under the corresponding Seller Benefit Plan covering such U.S. Transferred Employees, including for purposes of eligibility, vesting and benefit levels and accruals, other than benefit accruals under a defined benefit plan or program, (ii) waive any pre-existing condition exclusion, actively-at-work requirement or waiting period under all employee health and other welfare benefit plans 

 



73  established or maintained by Purchaser or its Affiliates for the benefit of
the U.S. Transferred Employees, except to the extent such pre-existing
condition, exclusion, requirement or waiting period would have applied to
such individual under the corresponding Seller Benefit Plan and (iii) provide
full credit for any co-payments, deductibles or similar payments made or
incurred prior to the Closing Date under all employee health and other
welfare benefit plans established or operated by Purchaser or its Affiliates
for the benefit of the U.S. Transferred Employees (other than flexible
spending accounts and similar plans which do not become Assumed Benefit Plans)
for the plan year in which the Closing occurs.

 (e) To the extent permissible under applicable Law, Seller and Purchaser intend that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement should not constitute a separation, termination or severance of employment of any Transferred Employee prior to or upon the occurrence of the Transfer Date, including for purposes of any Seller Benefit Plan that provides for separation, termination or severance benefits, such that no such separation, termination or severance benefits to any Transferred Employee will be triggered as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement where the Seller Benefit Plan will not provide such benefits due to the continued and uninterrupted employment of the Transferred Employee on terms and conditions consistent with this  _Article VII_ , and that such Transferred Employee will have continuous and uninterrupted employment immediately before and immediately after the Transfer Date, and Seller and Purchaser shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, comply with any requirements under applicable Law to ensure the same. 

 

 (f) Except as otherwise provided in _Section 7.03(a)_, Seller shall be, or shall cause its Affiliates to be, responsible, either directly or through insurance policies maintained by Seller or its Affiliates, for all (i) medical, vision, dental and prescription drug claims for expenses incurred by any Transferred Employee or his or her dependents, (ii) claims for short-term and long-term disability income benefits incurred by any Transferred Employee and (iii) claims for group life, travel and accident, and accidental death and dismemberment insurance benefits incurred by any Transferred Employee, in each case, prior to the Transfer Date. Purchaser shall be, or shall cause its Affiliates to be, responsible for all (A) medical, vision, dental and prescription drug claims for expenses incurred by any Transferred Employee or his or her dependents, (B) claims for short-term and long-term disability income benefits incurred by any Transferred Employee and (C) claims for group life, travel and accident, and accidental death and dismemberment insurance benefits incurred by any Transferred Employee, in each case, on or after the Transfer Date. Except in the event of any claim for workers compensation benefits, for purposes of this Agreement, the following claims and liabilities shall be deemed to be incurred as follows: (1) medical, vision, dental and/or prescription drug benefits (including hospital expenses), upon provision of the services, materials or supplies comprising any such benefits and (2) short and long-term disability, life, accidental death and dismemberment and business travel accident insurance benefits, upon the death, illness, injury or accident giving rise to such benefits. Seller and its Affiliates shall be responsible for all claims for workers compensation benefits that are incurred prior to the Transfer Date by any Transferred Employee who accepts Purchasers or one of its Affiliates offer of employment. Purchaser and its Affiliates shall be responsible for all claims for workers compensation benefits that are incurred on or after the Transfer Date by any Transferred Employee who accepts Purchasers or one of its Affiliates offer of 

 



74  employment and for all claims for workers compensation benefits for all
other Transferred Employees. A claim for workers compensation benefits shall
be deemed to be incurred when the event giving rise to the claim (the "
_Workers Compensation Event_ ") occurs. Each party and its Affiliates shall
bear all of the liabilities, obligations and costs relating to, and shall
indemnify and hold harmless the other party and its Affiliates from and
against any claims for workers compensation for which such party and its
Affiliates are liable pursuant to this _Section 7.01(f)_.

 (g) Notwithstanding any other provision of this _Section 7.01_ to the contrary, (i) with respect to Non-U.S. Transferred Employees, (A) Purchaser or its Affiliates shall provide such Non-U.S. Transferred Employee with employment in a comparable position as such Non-U.S. Transferred Employees position immediately prior to the Closing Date, (B) effective from and after the Transfer Date, Purchaser or its Affiliates shall provide to such employees each term and condition of employment (including seniority and other service credit) and each type and amount of compensation and benefits required by applicable Law in the applicable non-U.S. jurisdiction (whether as an absolute requirement or as a condition to avoiding any penalty, liability, obligation or expense) and (C) for the one-year period immediately following the Closing Date, Purchaser or its Affiliates shall provide to such employees other terms and conditions of employment (including seniority and other service credit) and types and amounts of compensation and benefits (excluding those items subject to clause (B), above) that are no less favorable, in the aggregate, to those provided by Seller and its Affiliates, in each case, immediately prior to the Transfer Date ( _provided_ _that_ base salaries, bonus opportunities and wage rates shall be no less favorable than provided immediately prior to the Closing Date) and (ii) with respect to Transferred Employees covered by Labor Contracts, effective from and after the Transfer Date, Purchaser or one of its Affiliates shall comply with applicable Law concerning such Labor Contracts in the context of this Agreement. 

 

 (h) If any Transferred Employee requires a work permit or employment pass or other legal or regulatory approval for his or her employment with Purchaser or its Affiliates, Purchaser shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, use commercially reasonable efforts to cause any such permit, pass or other approval to be obtained and in effect prior to the Transfer Date, and Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, take all reasonably necessary or appropriate action at Purchasers expense, as reasonably requested by Purchaser, to assist in obtaining any such permits, pass, or other approval prior to the Transfer Date. 

 

 (i) As of the Transfer Date and unless otherwise prohibited by applicable Law, Seller shall provide to Purchaser and its Affiliates all employment records applicable to each Transferred Employee; provided that Purchaser and its Affiliates shall provide Seller and its Affiliates with access to such records of a Transferred Employee to the extent reasonably requested by Seller and/or its Affiliates in connection with any Action involving or otherwise relating to such Transferred Employee. Purchaser and its Affiliates shall ensure that all such records are used only in connection with the employment of such Transferred Employee and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to keep such employment records confidential; _provided that_ Purchaser and its Affiliates shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller and its Affiliates from and against any statutory, common Law or other claims that arise from the use of such employment records other than for employment, compensation or termination-related purposes. 

 



75 (j) Unless applicable Law does not permit accrued and unused vacation hours to be carried over to Purchaser, Purchaser shall, or shall cause its relevant Affiliate (including the Company or any Company Subsidiary) to, grant each Transferred Employee paid time off in an amount equal to such accrued and unused vacation hours, as set forth for such Transferred Employee in _Section 7.01(j) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule_ (which shall be provided as soon as reasonably practicable, but no later than 45 Business Days following, the date hereof) and such amount shall be updated by Seller immediately prior to the Closing Date. If such Transferred Employee terminates employment with Purchaser or an Affiliate of Purchaser prior to using such paid time off, Purchaser shall pay such Transferred Employee an amount equal to compensation for any such remaining paid time off (with such paid time off granted pursuant to this _Section 7.01(j)_ deemed to be used first before any further paid time off accrued after the Transfer Date) upon such employment termination equal to the amount of such unused remaining paid time off that such Transferred Employee would have received if Sellers paid time off policy as of the Closing Date were in effect at the time of such employment termination. If accrued and unused vacation hours are not permitted by Law to be carried over to Purchaser as described in this _Section 7.01(k) _immediately prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall pay to each Transferred Employee the amount of compensation with respect to the accrued and unused vacation hours that is due and owing to such Transferred Employee as of immediately prior to the Closing Date, as set forth in  _Section 7.01(j) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule_ and as updated by Seller immediately prior to the Closing Date. 

 (k) As of the Closing Date, Purchaser shall permit each U.S. Transferred Employee who was eligible to participate in a defined contribution plan sponsored by Seller or one of its Subsidiaries that is intended to be "qualified" within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code (the " _Seller 401(k) Plan_ ") immediately prior to the Transfer Date to elect to transfer to a defined contribution plan sponsored by Arris or one of its Subsidiaries that is intended to be "qualified" within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code (the " _Purchaser 401(k) Plan_ "), each such U.S. Transferred Employees account balance when distributed from the Seller 401(k) Plan, including any outstanding participant loans from the Seller 401(k) Plan, to the Purchaser 401(k) Plan unless such transfer would reasonably be likely to cause the loss of the Purchaser 401(k) Plans qualified status (assuming Purchasers 401(k) Plan permits or is amended to permit the rollover of any such loan). 

SECTION 7.02. _Assumption of Assumed Benefit Plans_.

 

 (a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, effective as of the Closing, Purchaser shall, or shall cause one of its Affiliates to, assume all of the rights, title, interests, obligations and liabilities under each of the agreements set forth on _Section 4.13 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule_. 

 (b) Effective as of the Closing Date, Purchaser shall, or shall cause one of its Affiliates (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall for this purpose include the Company and the Company Subsidiaries following the Closing) to, assume sponsorship of, and shall 

 



76  succeed to all of the rights, title and interest (including the rights of
Seller or any of its Affiliates, as applicable, if any, as plan sponsor, plan
administrator or employer) under, each Assumed Benefit Plan. With respect to
each Assumed Benefit Plan, Seller shall, or shall cause one of its Affiliates
to, transfer to Purchaser or one of its Affiliates any assets that are set
aside in a trust or similar vehicle, funding media or other reserve (other
than a bookkeeping or other notional reserve), as well as any insurance
benefits that are maintained for the primary purpose of funding such Assumed
Benefit Plan, to the extent such assets or insurance benefits relate to
such Assumed Benefit Plan. Purchaser and Seller shall use their reasonable
commercial efforts to cooperate with each other, and shall cause their
officers, employees, agents, auditors and representatives to cooperate with
each other after the Closing Date in the execution of any documents, adoption
of any corporate resolutions or the taking of all actions that are necessary
and appropriate to effectuate such sponsorship and related transfers of
Assumed Benefit Plans.

 

SECTION 7.03. _Liability for Employees_.

 

 (a) Except as otherwise provided in Article XI of this Agreement, effective from and after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, be responsible for, and shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller and its Affiliates from and against, any and all Liabilities or obligations (i) arising under or with respect to any Purchaser Benefit Plan, (ii) with respect to any Transferred Employee to the extent attributable to events or circumstances occurring on or after the Transfer Date (except to the extent arising under or with respect to any Seller Benefit Plan other than an Assumed Benefit Plan), (iii) arising under or with respect to any Assumed Benefit Plan, or (iv) that transfer by operation of Law., 

 

 (b) Except as otherwise provided in Article XI of this Agreement, effective from and after the Closing Date, Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates (other than the Company or any Company Subsidiary) to, be responsible for, and shall indemnify and hold harmless Purchaser and its Affiliates (including the Company and any Company Subsidiary) from and against, any and all Liabilities or obligations (i) arising under or with respect to any Seller Benefit Plan (other than an Assumed Benefit Plan), (ii) with respect to any Transferred Employee to the extent attributable to events or circumstances occurring or existing prior to the Transfer Date (except to the extent arising under or with respect to any Assumed Benefit Plan), (iii) with respect to any individual employed by Seller or its Affiliates who does not become a Transferred Employee (except to the extent arising under or with respect to any Assumed Benefit Plan) and (iv) with respect to any other employee benefit plan within the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA of Sellers and its Affiliates other than an Assumed Benefit Plan. 

SECTION 7.04. _No Employee Rights_. Nothing in this _Article VII_ , express
or implied, shall confer upon any Employee, or legal representative or
beneficiary thereof, any rights or remedies, including any right to employment
or continued employment for any specified period, or compensation or benefits
of any nature or kind whatsoever under this Agreement. Nothing in this
_Article VII_ , express or implied, shall be construed to prevent Purchaser
from terminating or modifying to any extent or in any respect any Purchaser
Benefit Plan. Nothing in this _Article VII_ , express or implied, or any
other provision of this Agreement

 



77  shall amend, or be deemed to amend, any Benefit Plan (including any Seller
Benefit Plan), and nothing in this _Article VII_ , express or implied, or any
other provision of this Agreement is intended to, or does, constitute the
establishment of, or an amendment to, any Benefit Plan (including any Seller
Benefit Plan).

SECTION 8.01. _Transfer Taxes_. All Transfer Taxes imposed by any Governmental
Authority, regardless of the Person on whom such Taxes are imposed, resulting
from the Internal Restructuring shall be borne by Seller. All other Transfer
Taxes imposed by any Governmental Authority, regardless of the Person on whom
such Taxes are imposed, resulting from the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (excluding the Internal Restructuring) shall be borne equally by
Seller and Purchaser. Purchaser shall be responsible for the timely filing of
any Tax Return relating to Transfer Taxes, except to the extent that Seller
is responsible for the filing of any such Tax Return under applicable Law.

reasonably requested by Purchaser that does not cause Seller to incur any
material cost in order to minimize Transfer Taxes.

 

SECTION 8.02. _Tax Characterization of Adjustments_. Seller and Purchaser
agree to treat all payments made either to or for the benefit of the other
following the Closing (including any payments made under any indemnity

applicable Law.

Purchaser shall forward, and shall cause its Affiliates to forward, to Seller, the amount of the relevant Tax Asset within 10 days after such Tax Asset is received or after such Tax Asset is allowed or applied against another Tax Liability, as the case may be. 

 



79 (e) On the Closing Date, Purchaser shall cause the Company and each Company Subsidiary to conduct its business in the ordinary course in substantially the same manner as currently conducted and on the Closing Date shall not permit the Company or any Company Subsidiary to effect any extraordinary transactions (other than any such transactions expressly required by applicable Law or as contemplated by this Agreement) that could increase the liability of Seller for Taxes under this Agreement.

or data, in each case relating to Taxes of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries, and will preserve such books and records, Contracts, documents,
information or data until sixty (60) days after the expiration of any
applicable statute of limitations (including extensions), provided, however,
that neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates nor Purchaser nor any of its
Affiliates shall have any obligation pursuant to this _Section 8.04_ to

Purchaser (in the case of Seller and its Affiliates) or Seller (in the case of

or any Affiliate of Seller or Purchaser or any Affiliate of Purchaser
(including the Company and any Company Subsidiaries) needs access to such
books, records, Contracts, documents, information or data in the possession
of the other party, for purposes of preparing or commenting on Tax Returns in
accordance with this Agreement, for complying with or representing the
Companys or the Company Subsidiaries interests in any Tax Controversy
or other investigative demand by a Governmental Authority, or for any other
legitimate Tax-related reason not injurious to the other party (including, in
the case of Seller or its Affiliates, an obligation of Seller or its
Affiliates to a third party pursuant to the Spin-Off Tax Agreement), such
party shall provide copies of such books and records, Contracts, documents,
information or data to the other party, or, if so requested, shall provide
reasonable access to such books and records, Contracts, documents,
information or data during regular business hours at such partys place of
business, and will permit the other party to make extracts and copies thereof
as may be necessary or convenient.

 

SECTION 8.05. _Tax Sharing Agreements_. Seller shall cause all Tax allocation

there shall be no further liabilities or obligations imposed on any of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries under any such agreements.

SECTION 8.06. _Option Cashouts_. For all purposes of this Agreement, the
parties hereto agree to treat any payments or transfers of property from
Seller or any of Sellers Affiliates to any Employee in connection with this
Agreement with respect to any options,

 



80  warrants, calls or other rights with respect to the stock of Seller or any
of Sellers Affiliates as occurring on the Closing Date prior to the Seller
Contribution. Unless otherwise required by applicable Law, Seller or Sellers
Affiliates (other than the Company and the Company Subsidiaries) shall be
treated as the party responsible for any employment or payroll tax withholding
in respect of such payments or transfers, and any deduction, exemption, or
similar item with respect to such payments or transfers shall not be treated
as a reduction or offset to the taxable income of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary.

covenants, upon the eighteen month anniversary of the Closing, in each case
unless before such date a Purchaser Indemnified Person has provided Seller
with an applicable Claim Notice;

(ii) There shall be no obligation to indemnify under _Section 11.01(a)_
(other than _clauses (ii)_ (with respect to any covenant for indemnification
payment of cash or delivery of shares), _(iii) _and (iv) thereof or for
losses arising under the Seller Fundamental Representations) unless the
aggregate of all losses for which Seller, but for this clause (ii), would be
liable under _Section 11.01(a)_ (other than _clause (iii)_ thereof or for
losses arising under the Seller Fundamental Representations) exceeds on a
cumulative basis an amount equal to $23,500,000 (the " _Deductible_ "), and
then only to the extent of such excess;

 

(iii) There shall be no obligation to indemnify under _Section 11.01(a)_
(other than _clauses (ii)_ (with respect to any covenant for indemnification
payment of cash or delivery of shares), _(iii) _and (iv) thereof or for
losses arising under the Seller Fundamental Representations) for any claim or
series of related claims where the losses relating thereto are less than
$1,762,500 (it being understood that any such claim or series of related
claims for which the losses relating thereto are less than $1,762,500 shall
not be aggregated for purposes of the immediately preceding clause (ii));

(iv) There shall be no obligation to indemnify under  _Section 11.01(a)_
(other than _clauses (ii)_ (with respect to any covenant for indemnification
payment of cash or delivery of shares), _(iii) _and (iv) thereof or for
losses arising under the Seller Fundamental Representations) for any amount
that when aggregated with all other amounts payable as a result of
indemnification under _Section 11.01(a)_ (other than _clauses (ii)_ (with
respect to any covenant for indemnification payment of cash or delivery of
shares) and _(iii)_ thereof or for losses arising under the Seller
Fundamental Representations) would be in excess of $235,000,000 (the " _Cap_
");

 

(v) Other than in respect of the Settled Matter, there shall be no obligation
to indemnify under _Section 11.01(a) _or _Section 11.01(b) _to the extent
that any claim for indemnification relates to an amount of any reserve or
accrual reflected or included in the Financial Statements, taking into account
any reduction in such reserve or accrual reflected in the Closing Statement;

(vi) For purposes of _Section 11.01(a)_ and  _Section 11.01(b)_, all losses
shall be reduced by (A) the amount of any insurance proceeds actually received
by Purchaser or any Purchaser Indemnified Person with respect to such loss,
including proceeds received by Purchaser pursuant to _Section 6.05(c)_
(calculated net of any out-of-pocket costs incurred by such Purchaser
Indemnified Person in collecting such amount and net of the present value of
any increase in applicable insurance premiums incurred directly as a result
of the claim or claims that resulted in such recovery _)_ , (B) any indemnity,
contribution or other similar payment actually received by Purchaser or any
Purchaser Indemnified Person by 

 



89  any third party with respect to such loss (it being understood that
Purchaser shall, or shall cause the applicable Purchaser Indemnified Party to,
use its reasonable best efforts to collect any such indemnity, contribution
or other similar payment), and (C) if, in Purchasers good faith
determination, such losses give rise to any net reduction of income Taxes of
Purchaser or any Purchaser Indemnified Person, an amount equal to 37%
multiplied by the deductible portion of such loss, as determined by Purchaser;

(vii) The obligation to indemnify under _Section 11.01(a)(i)_ with respect
to any breach of the representations and warranties contained in _Section
4.15 (Environmental)_ (each, an " _Environmental Claim_ ") shall be limited to
the lowest cost, reasonable, alternative on the basis of the minimum
necessary to comply with applicable Environmental Laws as enforced in relation
to the relevant Environmental Claim. Taking no action shall constitute an
acceptable lowest cost alternative if, after investigation, taking no action
is determined to be consistent or otherwise allowed under applicable
Environmental Laws and such inaction is not prohibited by relevant
Governmental Authorities. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
the Purchaser Indemnified Persons shall not be entitled to claim or seek
indemnity with respect to any Environmental Claim under this Agreement to the
extent that such Environmental Claim arises out of, is triggered by or relates
to (1) any development, modification or change of use of any of the assets or
properties of the Business after the Closing to a use other than the continued
operation of the Business or the continuation of the activities necessary to
support the Business as it was conducted prior to the Closing; or (2) any
temporary or permanent cessation of any operations or any closure by Purchaser
Indemnified Persons of any of the facilities, structures, plants or equipment
after the Closing; and 

(viii) There shall be no obligation to indemnify under _Section 11.01(a)(i)_
with respect to any breach of the representations and warranties contained in
_Section 4.15 (Environmental)_ for any losses to the extent such losses are
triggered by any invasive activity by or on behalf of Purchaser or its
Affiliates unless such activity is both (A) in compliance with all applicable
lease agreements and (B) conducted for purposes of (1) legitimate business
activities separate from uncovering a breach of a representation or warranty
or (2) complying with, or preventing a violation of, a requirement of
applicable Environmental Law that would be violated if such invasive
investigation did not occur at such time.

 (d) From and after the Closing, Purchaser shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Seller and its Affiliates (collectively, the " _Seller Indemnified Persons_ ") from and against any and all losses actually suffered, incurred or sustained by any of them (without duplication for any indemnification that may be sought under more than one clause of this _Section 11.01(d)_) that result from, relate to or arise out of: 

(i) any breach of Purchasers representations and warranties contained in
this Agreement;

 



90 (ii) any breach of Purchasers covenants contained in this Agreement or any
Ancillary Agreement; or

(iii) the operation of the Business from and after the Closing (including, for
the avoidance of doubt, the Included Assets and their related Liabilities)
except to the extent a Purchaser Indemnified Person is entitled to
indemnification under _Section 11.01(a) _or _Section 11.01(b) _for such
matter.

 

 _provided_ _that_ all matters relating to Taxes shall be governed exclusively
by _Section 11.07_.

 

(e) Purchasers indemnification obligation under _Section 11.01(d_) shall be
subject to each of the following:

(i) With respect to indemnification under Section 11.01(d) (other than
_clauses (ii)_ and (with respect to any covenant for indemnification payment
of cash or delivery of shares) and _(iii)_ thereof), such obligation to
indemnify shall terminate (A) with respect to the representations and
warranties in  _Section 5.01 (Organization and Good Standing) (first
sentence only)_, _Section 5.02 (Authorization; Due Execution; Validity)_,
_Section 5.06 (Brokers or Finders)_ and _Section 5.10 (Capitalization;
Stock Consideration) _(the " _Purchaser Fundamental Representations_ "), upon
the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations and (B) with respect
to all other representations and warranties and covenants, upon the
eighteen month anniversary of the Closing, in each case unless before such
date a Seller Indemnified Person has provided Purchaser with an applicable
Claim Notice;

(ii) There shall be no obligation to indemnify under _Section 11.01(d)_
(other than _clauses (ii) _(with respect to any covenant for indemnification
payment of cash or delivery of shares) and _(iii)_ thereof or for losses
arising under the Purchaser Fundamental Representations) unless the aggregate
of all losses for which Purchaser, but for this clause (ii), would be liable
under _Section 11.01(d)_ (other than _clauses (ii)_ and _(iii)_ thereof or
for losses arising under the Purchaser Fundamental Representations) exceeds on
a cumulative basis an amount equal to the Deductible, and then only to the
extent of such excess; 

(iii) There shall be no obligation to indemnify under _Section 11.01(d)_
(other than _clauses (ii) _(with respect to any covenant for indemnification
payment of cash or delivery of shares) and _(iii)_ thereof or for losses
arising under the Purchaser Fundamental Representations) for any claim or
series of related claims where the losses relating thereto are less than
$1,762,500 (it being understood that any such claim or series of related
claims for which the losses relating thereto are less than $1,762,500 shall
not be aggregated for purposes of the immediately preceding clause (ii)); and

 



91 (iv) There shall be no obligation to indemnify under  _Section 11.01(d)_
(other than _clauses (ii) _(with respect to any covenant for indemnification
payment of cash or delivery of shares) and _(iii)_ thereof or for losses
arising under the Purchaser Fundamental Representations) for any amount that
when aggregated with all other amounts payable as a result of indemnification
under _Section 11.01(d)_ (other than _clauses (ii) _(with respect to any
covenant for indemnification payment of cash or delivery of shares) and
_(iii)_ thereof or for losses arising under the Purchaser Fundamental
Representations) would be in excess of the Cap.

 (f) Solely for purposes of determining the amount of losses resulting from, relating to or arising out of a breach of the representations and warranties of Seller and Purchaser under this Article XI (and not for determining whether a breach of such representations and warranties has occurred), the representations and warranties of Seller and Purchaser shall not be deemed qualified by any reference to materiality or Material Adverse Effect. 

SECTION 11.02. _Notice of Claim; Defense_.

 

 (a) If (i) any third party or Governmental Authority institutes, threatens or asserts any action that may give rise to losses for which a party (an " _Indemnifying Party_ ") may be liable for indemnification under this _Article XI_ (a " _Third-Party Claim_ ") or (ii) any Person entitled to indemnification under this Agreement (an " _Indemnified Party_ ") shall have a claim to be indemnified by an Indemnifying Party that does not involve a Third-Party Claim (a " _Direct Claim_ "), then, in case of  _clause (i)_ or _(ii)_ , the Indemnified Party shall promptly send to the Indemnifying Party a written notice specifying (to the extent known) the nature of such claim and the amount, or a good faith estimate of the amount, of all related losses (a " _Claim Notice_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that any failure to give such Claim Notice or to provide any such facts or amounts shall not affect the rights of the indemnified parties except to the extent that such failure actually prejudices the Indemnifying Party. 

 (b) In the event of a Third-Party Claim (excluding any Third-Party Claim arising under _Section 11.01(b)_), the Indemnifying Party may elect to retain counsel of its choice, reasonably acceptable to the relevant Indemnified Parties, to represent such Indemnified Parties in connection with such Action and shall pay the fees, charges and disbursements of such counsel. Should the Indemnifying Party so elect to assume the defense of such Third-Party Claim, the Indemnified Parties may participate, at their own expense and through legal counsel of their choice, in any such Action, _provided that_ (i) the Indemnifying Party may elect to control the defense of the Indemnified Parties in connection with such Action, and (ii) the Indemnified Parties and their counsel shall cooperate with the Indemnifying Partys counsel in connection with such Action. The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to settle, compromise or discharge such Third-Party Claim either (A) with the prior written consent of the applicable Indemnified Party (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) or (B) without any Indemnified Partys consent if such settlement, compromise or discharge (x) provides for no relief relating to the Indemnified Parties other than the payment of monetary damages and such monetary damages are paid in full by the Indemnifying Party, (y) involves no finding or admission of any breach or violation by any Indemnified Party and (z) includes an express release of the Indemnified Party from all liability arising from such Third-Party Claim or Action. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if (1) the Indemnifying Party elects not to retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the relevant Indemnified Parties and assume control of such defense within a reasonable 

 



92  period of time or (2) both the Indemnifying Party and any Indemnified Party
are parties to or subjects of such Action and conflicts of interests exist
between the Indemnifying Party and such Indemnified Party, then the
Indemnified Parties shall retain counsel reasonably acceptable to the
Indemnifying Party in connection with such Action and assume control of the
defense of the Indemnified Parties in connection with such Action, and
the fees, charges and disbursements of no more than one such counsel per
jurisdiction selected by the Indemnified Parties shall be reimbursed by the
Indemnifying Party. Whether the Indemnifying Party or the Indemnified Party
controls the defense of such Third-Party Claim, the parties hereto shall
reasonably cooperate in the defense thereof in accordance with _Section
11.02(d)_. Under no circumstances will the Indemnifying Party have any
liability in connection with any settlement of any Action that is entered
into without its prior written consent. This _Section 11.02(b)_ shall not
apply in the case of any Tax Controversy or Specified Retained Litigation.

 

 (c) Seller shall control the defense of the Specified Retained Litigation (and any related customer indemnification claims) in all respects, including any decision whether to appeal. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, Seller shall have the right to settle, compromise or discharge the Specified Retained Litigation (and any related customer indemnification claims) only (A) with the prior written consent of Purchaser, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed and shall be subject to Purchasers obligations under  _Section 11.01(b)_, _provided_ , that Purchasers withholding, conditioning or delaying of consent shall be deemed unreasonable if based on the settlement, compromise or discharge (i) not providing a license or other grant of rights under Intellectual Property (including by means of covenants not to sue) for any operations, businesses, products, product lines or services other than the Specified Products or (ii) including a non-exclusive license or other grant of rights under Patents included in Company Intellectual Property (including by means of covenants not to sue) so long as the Business receives the benefit of a license or other grant of rights under the Specified Retained Litigation Patents (including by means of covenants not to sue) asserted in the Specified Retained Litigation that is the subject of such settlement, compromise or discharge, or (B) without Purchasers consent if such settlement, compromise or discharge (x) provides for no relief relating to any Purchaser Indemnified Person other than the payment of monetary damages, including royalty payments, and (y) involves no finding or admission of any breach or violation by any Purchaser Indemnified Person. Purchaser shall fully cooperate with Seller in the defense of the Specified Retained Litigation (and any related customer indemnification claims), including, without limitation, as provided in _Section 6.06_ and  _Section 11.02(d)_. 

 (d) From and after the delivery of a Claim Notice, at the reasonable request of the Indemnifying Party, each Indemnified Party shall grant the Indemnifying Party and its employees, counsel, experts and representatives reasonable access, during normal business hours, to the books, records, personnel and properties of the Indemnified Party to the extent reasonably related to the Claim Notice at no cost to the Indemnifying Party (other than for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of the Indemnified Parties); _provided_   _that_ the Indemnifying Party shall take reasonable precautions so as not to jeopardize any privilege reasonably available to an Indemnified Party in respect of any of its records. 

 



93 (e) In the event of a Direct Claim, within thirty (30) calendar days of delivery of a Claim Notice to the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party will proceed in good faith to negotiate a resolution of such dispute, and if not resolved through negotiations within such 30-day period, such dispute shall be resolved by litigation in a court of competent jurisdiction pursuant to _Section 12.10_. 

SECTION 11.03. _No Duplication; Exclusive Remedy_.

 

 (a) Any liability for indemnification hereunder shall be determined without duplication of recovery (i) by reason of the state of facts giving rise to such liability constituting a breach of more than one representation, warranty, covenant or agreement (and for purposes of clarity there shall be no liability for a breach of any covenant that has the effect of maintaining the truth or correctness of any representation or warranty or of notifying a party about any untruth or incorrectness of any representation or warranty other than what may available for the breach of such underlying representation or warranty) or (ii) to the extent such liability was already taken into account under _Section 3.05_. 

 

 (b) From and after the Closing and except as expressly provided in  _Section 3.05 _and except for the remedy of specific performance, the exclusive remedy of Purchaser and the other Purchaser Indemnified Parties and Seller and the other Seller Indemnified Persons in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (except with regard to any remedies set forth in the Ancillary Agreements) (whether under this Agreement or arising under common law or any other Law) shall be as provided in this _Article XI_ , including any claim or right of contribution that is premised on the ownership or use of assets of the Company or any Company Subsidiary by Seller or any of its Subsidiaries before the Closing. 

 

SECTION 11.04. _Limitation on Set-Off_.

 

 (a) Purchaser shall not have any right to set off any unresolved indemnification claim pursuant to this _Article XI_ against, and there shall not otherwise be any right to set off or counterclaim in the event of the non-performance of any obligation to make, (a) any payment due pursuant to _Article III_ , (b) any payment due under the Transition Services Agreement or any other Ancillary Agreement, or (c) any payment due pursuant to _Section 6.10_, _Section 6.11(d)_ or _Section 6.12_. 

 

 (b) Seller shall not have any right to set off any unresolved indemnification claim pursuant to this _Article XI_ against, and there shall not otherwise be any right to set off or counterclaim in the event of the non-performance of any obligation to make, any payment due pursuant to _Article III_. 

SECTION 11.05. _Mitigation_.

 

 (a) Purchaser and Seller shall (and shall cause their respective Affiliates to) cooperate with each other with respect to resolving any claim or liability with respect to which one party is obligated to indemnify the other party under this _Article XI_ , including, in the case of the Indemnified Party, by making commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate such claim or liability, whether by seeking claims against a third party, an insurer or otherwise. 

 



94 (b) For the avoidance of doubt, no party shall be liable under this _Article XI_ for exemplary, special, indirect, consequential, remote, speculative, punitive or treble damages, lost profits or internal costs, except, in the case of a Third-Party Claim, to the extent actually recovered by such third party. 

SECTION 11.06. _Potential Contributors_. If an Indemnified Party receives any
payment from an Indemnifying Party in respect of losses and the Indemnified
Party could have recovered all or a part of such losses from a third party
based on the underlying claim or demand asserted against such Indemnifying
Party, then such Indemnified Party shall transfer such of its rights to
proceed against such third party as are necessary to permit such Indemnifying
Party to recover from such third party the amount of such payment.

 

SECTION 11.07. _Tax Indemnification_.

 (a) From and after the Closing Date, Seller shall indemnify the Purchaser Indemnified Persons against and hold them harmless from any losses arising from, relating to or otherwise in respect of, except as provided in _Section 11.07(b)_, (x) any Taxes (i) imposed on the Company or any Company Subsidiary for a Pre-Closing Tax Period, (ii) imposed on the Company or any Company Subsidiary as a result of its inclusion with any Person, prior to the Closing Date in a consolidated, combined, affiliated or unitary Tax group, or an integrated fiscal unit, by reason of a liability under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 or any comparable provisions of foreign, state or local Law, (iii) of any Person for the Pre-Closing Tax Period imposed on the Company or any Company Subsidiary arising under the principles of transferee or successor liability, relating to an event or transaction occurring on or before the Closing Date, and (iv) for the Pre-Closing Tax Period for which the Company or a Company Subsidiary is liable as a result of any tax sharing, tax indemnity or tax allocation agreement, and (v) imposed on the Company or a Company Subsidiary on the transactions comprising the Internal Restructuring; (y) any Transfer Taxes for which Seller is liable under _Section 8.01_, and (z) any Taxes for a Post-Closing Tax Period of the Company or any Company Subsidiary resulting from a failure of the sum of the total Cash Consideration, the value of the Stock Consideration and the assumed liabilities to exceed the aggregate of the Companys and each Company Subsidiarys Inside Tax Basis immediately prior to the Seller Contribution (in each case, except to the extent such Taxes are reflected in the calculation of the Closing Net Indebtedness or Closing Working Capital, or were previously paid by Seller to Purchaser pursuant to _Section 8.03_). 

 (b) From and after the Closing Date, Purchaser, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries shall, jointly and severally, indemnify the Seller Indemnified Persons and hold them harmless from any losses arising from, relating to or otherwise in respect of (i) any Taxes imposed on, the Company or any Company Subsidiary with respect to a Post-Closing Tax Period, (ii) any Taxes that may be imposed on the Business as a result of being a member of a consolidated, combined, unitary or similar group of corporations or other taxpayers at any time after the Closing (other than by reason of a failure to complete the Internal Restructuring prior to the Closing), or (iii) any Transfer Taxes for which Purchaser is liable under _Section 8.01_

 



95 (c) In the case of any taxable period that includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date (a " _Straddle Period_ "), the amount of Taxes allocable to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date shall be deemed to be (i) in the case of Taxes imposed on a periodic basis (such as real or personal property Taxes), the amount of such Taxes for the entire period (or, in the case of such Taxes determined on an arrears basis, the amount of such Taxes for the immediately preceding period) multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of calendar days in the Straddle Period ending on and including the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the entire relevant Straddle Period, and (ii) in the case of Taxes not described in (i) above (such as franchise Taxes or Taxes that are based on or related to income or receipts), the amount of any such Taxes shall be determined as if such taxable period ended as of the close of business on the Closing Date. 

 (d) To the extent that any indemnification provided for in this _Section 11.07_ may overlap or conflict with any indemnification contained in _Section 11.01(a)_, the provisions of this _Section 11.07_ shall govern. 

 

 (e) _Procedures Relating to Indemnification of Tax Claims_. 

(i) Promptly after a party (the " _Tax Indemnified Party_ ") becomes aware of
the existence of a Tax issue that may give rise to an indemnification claim
under _Section 11.07_ (a " _Tax Controversy_ ") by it against the other party
(the " _Tax Indemnifying Party_ "), the Tax Indemnified Party shall notify
the Tax Indemnifying Party of the Tax issue and thereafter shall promptly
forward to the Tax Indemnifying Party copies of the relevant portion of any
notice or other document received from any Taxing Authority and communications
with any Taxing Authority relating to such Tax Controversy; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that a failure to give such notice will not affect the Tax
Indemnified Partys rights to indemnification under this _Article XI_ , except
to the extent that the Tax Indemnifying Party is prejudiced thereby. In the
event that after the Closing Date, any Tax Indemnified Party pays any Tax that
is the responsibility of the Tax Indemnifying Party pursuant to _Sections
11.07(a)_ , _11.07(b)_ , or  _11.07(c)_ , such Tax Indemnifying Party shall
within five (5) Business Days reimburse the Tax Indemnified Party; _provided_
_that_ the Tax Indemnified Party has complied with the provisions of this
_Section 11.07(e)_ and has given documentation to the Tax Indemnifying Party
establishing the fact and the amount of payment.

 

(ii) Except as otherwise provided in this _Section 11.07(e)(ii)_, after the
Closing Date, Purchaser shall control the conduct, through counsel of its own
choosing, of any Tax Controversy with respect to the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries relating to a Post-Closing Tax Period. In the case of a
Tax Controversy after the Closing Date that relates to Taxes of the Company
or a Company Subsidiary for which Seller would be required to indemnify
Purchaser pursuant to _Section 11.07(a)_, Seller shall control the handling,
settling or 

 



96  contesting of any such Tax Controversy. Seller shall notify Purchaser of any
impending settlement, compromise and/or concession of any Tax Controversy (or
portion thereof) controlled by Seller pursuant to this _Article XI)_. In the
case of a Tax Controversy with respect to a Straddle Period and for which
Seller would be required to indemnify Purchaser pursuant to _Section
11.07(a)_, Purchaser and Seller shall jointly represent their interests in
such Tax Controversy, shall employ counsel of their mutual choice and shall
cooperate with the other and the others representatives in a prompt and
timely manner in connection with any such Tax Controversy. Purchaser and
Seller shall mutually agree on any settlement or other disposition of the Tax
Controversy with respect to a Straddle Period. In the event Purchaser and
Seller are unable to agree regarding any aspect of the conduct of any such
Tax Controversy, the decision shall be made by counsel employed (and agreed
by both parties) to pursue such Tax Controversy on the basis of counsels good
faith judgment regarding the course of action that would produce the overall
lowest present value of Tax and litigation cost to the parties. Any such Tax
Controversy expenses with respect to a Straddle Period shall be borne by
Purchaser and Seller in the same proportion as such related Taxes are borne by
Purchaser and Seller in accordance with _Section 11.07(c)._ The Tax
Indemnifying Party shall keep the Tax Indemnified Party reasonably informed as
to the progress of any Tax proceeding with respect to a Tax Controversy to the
extent such Tax proceeding relates to Taxes payable by or with respect to the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries and shall consider in good faith any
written comments or suggestions regarding such Tax proceeding from the Tax
Indemnified Party.

 

 (f) For purposes of this _Section 11.07_, all losses in respect of Taxes shall be reduced by (i) any indemnity, contribution or other similar payment payable to Purchaser or any Purchaser Indemnified Person by any third party with respect to such loss, and (ii) if, in Purchasers good faith determination, such losses give rise to any net reduction of income Taxes of Purchaser or any Purchaser Indemnified Person, an amount equal to 37% multiplied by the deductible portion of such loss, as determined by Purchaser. 

 

 (g) Sellers indemnity obligations under this  _Section 11.07_ shall survive until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitation, and such indemnity obligations shall not be subject to any of the limitations set forth in _Section 11.01(b)_.

reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement.

 

SECTION 12.05. _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this

SECTION 12.07. _Assignment_. Neither party may transfer any of its rights or
obligations hereunder, without the prior written consent of the other party;

for the performance of their respective obligations hereunder. Any transfer in
violation of this _Section 12.07_ shall be null and void. Purchaser may
assign its rights hereunder to Financing Sources for collateral purposes,

express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other Person or
entity any legal or equitable right, benefit or remedy of any nature
whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement, except that the Persons
specified in _Section 6.06(c)_, _Section 6.10(c)_, _Section 6.11(c)_ and

except by an instrument in writing signed by Purchaser, Seller and Guarantor.

SECTION 12.10. _Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction_.

 (a) This Agreement and any dispute arising out of or relating to or in connection with this Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of New York. 

 (b) To the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, each party hereto (i) agrees that any claim, action or proceeding by such party seeking any relief whatsoever arising out of, relating to or in connection with, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be brought only in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York or in any New York State court, in each case, located in the Borough of Manhattan and not in any other State or Federal court in the United States of America or any court in any other country, (ii) agrees to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts located in the Borough of Manhattan for purposes of all legal proceedings arising out of, or in connection with, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, (iii) waives and agrees not to assert any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such Action brought in such a court or any claim that any such Action brought in such a court has been brought in an inconvenient forum, (iv) agrees that mailing of process or other papers in connection with any such action or proceeding in the manner provided for notices in _Section 12.03_ or any other manner as may be permitted by Law shall be valid and sufficient service thereof and (v) agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by applicable Law. The preceding sentence shall not limit the jurisdiction of the Accounting Arbitrator set forth in _Section 3.05_, although claims may be asserted in such courts described in the preceding sentence for purposes of enforcing the jurisdiction and judgments of the Accounting Arbitrator. 

 

SECTION 12.11. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, and by the different parties in separate counterparts, each of
which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken
together shall constitute one and the same agreement. Delivery of an executed
counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by facsimile or other
electronic means (including portable document format) shall be as effective as
delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.

SECTION 12.12. _Waiver of Jury Trial_. Each party hereby waives, to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any right it may have to a trial
by jury in respect to any litigation, directly or indirectly, arising out of
or relating to this Agreement or any transaction contemplated by this
Agreement. Each party (a) certifies that no representative, agent or attorney
of any other party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other
party would not, in the event of litigation, seek to enforce the foregoing
waiver and (b) acknowledges that it and the other parties have been induced to
enter into this Agreement by, among other things, the mutual waivers and
certifications in this _Section 12.12_.

 



100  SECTION 12.13. _Enforcement_.

 

 (a) The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached and that any breach of this Agreement could not be adequately compensated in all cases by monetary damages alone. Except as otherwise set forth in this _Section 12.13_, Purchaser and Seller acknowledge and agree that, prior to the valid termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 10.01_, Purchaser and Seller shall be entitled, without posting a bond or similar indemnity, to an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any court as specified in  _Section 12.10_, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity; _provided_ , _however_ , that Seller shall not be entitled to obtain specific performance of Purchasers obligation to consummate the Closing pursuant to _Section 3.03 _unless each of the following conditions are satisfied: (i) all of the conditions set forth in _Section 9.02_ have been satisfied (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing), (ii) the Debt Financing has been funded or will be funded at the Closing, (iii) Purchaser has failed or indicated that it will fail to complete the Closing in accordance with _Section 3.03_ and (iv) Seller has confirmed to Purchaser in writing that if specific performance is granted and the Debt Financing is funded, and Purchaser otherwise complies with its obligations hereunder, then the Closing will occur. 

 

 (b) Nothing set forth in this _Section 12.13_ shall require Seller to institute any proceeding for (or limit Sellers right to institute any proceeding for) specific performance under this _Section 12.13_ prior or as a condition to exercising any termination right under _Section 10.01 _or receiving the Purchaser Termination Fee following such termination, nor shall the commencement of any legal proceeding pursuant to this _Section 12.13_ or anything set forth in this _Section 12.13_ restrict or limit Sellers right to terminate this Agreement in accordance with the terms of _Section 10.01_ or pursue any other remedies under this Agreement that may be available then or thereafter. 

 

 (c) To the extent any party brings any Action to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions of this Agreement (other than an action to specifically enforce any provision that expressly survives termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 10.02_ hereof) when expressly available to such party pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the Termination Date shall automatically be extended by (i) the amount of time during which such Action is pending, plus twenty (20) Business Days, or (ii) such other time period established by the court presiding over such Action (it being understood that this _Section 12.13(c)_ shall not be deemed to alter, amend, supplement or otherwise modify the terms of the Debt Financing Commitment (including the expiration or termination provisions thereof)). 

SECTION 12.14. _Performance Guaranty_. Guarantor hereby guarantees
the performance and discharge by Seller of, and compliance by Seller with,
all of the obligations, covenants, representations, warranties, and
undertakings of Seller under this Agreement and any other Transaction
Documents to which Seller is a party in accordance with the terms hereof and
thereof.

 



101  SECTION 12.15. _No Presumption_. The parties to this Agreement agree that
this Agreement was negotiated fairly between them at arms length and that
the final terms of this Agreement are the product of the parties
negotiations. Each party represents and warrants that it has sought and
received legal counsel of its own choosing with regard to the contents of
this Agreement and the rights and obligations affected hereby. The parties
agree that this Agreement shall be deemed to have been jointly and equally
drafted by them, and that the provisions of this Agreement therefore should
not be construed against a party or parties on the grounds that the party or
parties drafted or was more responsible for drafting the provisions.

ARTICLE II

 

SERVICES

 

SECTION 2.01. _Provision of Services_. (a) Seller agrees to use commercially
reasonable efforts to provide, or to cause one or more of its Affiliates to
provide, to the Business or to Purchaser or its Affiliates, as the case may
be, each line item of service (each such item, a " _Line Item of Service_ ")
specified on _Schedule A_ attached hereto and made a part hereof (all such
Line Items of Service being, collectively, the " _Transition Services_ " and
each, a " _Transition Service_ "), for the period of time following the
Closing Date specified on _Schedule A_  with respect to such Line Item of
Service (the " _Term_ "), to the extent that this Agreement has not been
previously terminated.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein (i) neither Seller nor any
of its Affiliates will be required to perform or cause to be performed any of
the Transition Services (x) for any purpose other than the operation of the
Business or (y) for the benefit of any third party or any other person other
than Purchaser or its Affiliates (it being understood that a third party
contractor employed by Purchaser or its Affiliates may receive such
Transition Services on Purchasers or its Affiliates behalf upon the written
consent of the Seller, such consent not to be

 



2  unreasonably withheld) and (ii) the Transition Services to be provided by
Seller or one or more of its Affiliates under this Agreement are furnished as
is, where is, and without warranty or condition of any kind, express or
implied, including any warranty or condition of noninfringement,
merchantability or fitness for any particular purpose, except as provided in
_Section 2.01(d)_.

 

(c) Purchaser and its Affiliates shall not allow access to or use of
Transition Services by any other third party without the prior written
consent of Seller. Purchaser and its Affiliates shall use their best efforts
to become, and to cause the Business to become, independent of Seller with
respect to each Line Item of Service as soon as commercially practicable, but
in no event later than the end of the Term.

(d) Seller shall cause the Transition Services, to the extent provided by
Seller or its Affiliates, to be provided in a manner generally consistent, in
all material respects, with the manner and level of care with which such
services were provided prior to the Closing by Seller and its Affiliates in
the ordinary course of business, to the extent commercially practicable.
Purchaser acknowledges that certain Line Item(s) of Service may be provided by
third-party providers with whom Seller or an Affiliate of Seller has
contracted for such Line Item(s) of Service (each, a " _Third Party Provider_
"). Seller makes no representation or warranty of any kind with respect to any
Line Item of Service provided by a Third Party Provider, but shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to enable Purchaser to assert any appropriate
claims against Third Party Providers in the event of non-performance by them.

(e) The parties acknowledge the transitional nature of the Transition
Services and that Seller or its Affiliates may make changes from time to time
in the manner of performing the Transition Services if Seller or its
Affiliates are making similar changes in performing similar services for
their own Affiliates so long as the Transition Services, as changed, fulfill
substantially the same purpose. If, as a result of such changes, Purchaser
determines that Purchaser or the Business no longer requires the affected
Line Item(s) of Service, Purchaser may terminate such affected Line Item(s)
of Service upon thirty (30) days prior written notice to Seller.

(f) The parties shall use reasonable good faith efforts to cooperate with each
other in all matters relating to the provision and receipt of the Transition
Services. Such cooperation shall include exchanging information and seeking
the consents, approvals or authorizations of any person as may be necessary
for the performance of the obligations pursuant to this Agreement, including
obtaining from Third Party Providers all consents necessary to grant any
sublicenses in connection with the performance of Transition Services
hereunder. Any fee or extra cost charged by Third Party Providers in
connection with any such requested consents shall be paid by the parties as
follows: Seller and its Affiliates shall be liable for 100% of the costs of
such consents up to an aggregate amount equal to $1,000,000; thereafter,
Purchaser shall be liable for 100% of any fee or other cost charged by Third
Party Providers in connection with such requested consents. In the event that
the consent of a Third Party Provider, if required, is requested by Seller and
is not obtained reasonably shortly after the Closing Date, Seller shall notify
Purchaser and shall cooperate with Purchaser in attempting to devise a
reasonable alternative in connection with the Line Item(s) of Service affected
by such failure to obtain consent. If the parties elect such an alternative
plan, Seller shall provide the Line Item(s) of 

 



3  Service in such alternative manner and Purchaser shall bear any expenses
incurred in the provision of such Line Item(s) of Service through such
alternative means. If the parties do not elect such an alternative plan,
either party may terminate such affected Line Item(s) of Service upon ten (10)
days prior written notice.

(g) Seller and Purchaser shall designate in writing to the other party one or
more relationship managers (the " _Relationship Managers_ ") to act as
principal contact persons with respect to all issues relating to the
provision of the Transition Services pursuant to this Agreement. Such
representatives shall hold review meetings by telephone or in person, as
mutually agreed upon, to discuss issues relating to the provision of
the Transition Services under this Agreement. The initial Relationship
Manager for Purchaser shall be [] [###-###-####]. The initial Relationship
Manager for Seller shall be [] [###-###-####]. Seller or Purchaser may
designate different Relationship Managers by providing written notice to the
other party.

(h) Purchaser acknowledges that the demand for Transition Services may exceed
Sellers available capacity to provide such Transition Services, making it
necessary for Seller to prioritize requests for Transition Services or take
other steps to manage efficiently the provision of such Transition Services
to Purchaser. In prioritizing requests, Seller shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates to, use commercially reasonable efforts to treat Purchaser in the
same manner as Seller previously treated the Business.

 

(i) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, each of the parties
acknowledges that (a) there may be legal, regulatory, and logistical
impediments that may prevent the provision of Transition Services under this
Agreement and (b) they each shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to
overcome such impediments so that the Transition Services may be
provided otherwise in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

(j) If Seller determines that it is necessary or appropriate to temporarily
suspend a Transition Service due to scheduled or emergency repairs,
maintenance and/or modification, Seller shall give Purchaser reasonable prior
notice of such shutdown (including information regarding the nature of the
shutdown and the projected length of such shutdown), unless it is not
reasonably practicable under the circumstances to give such prior notice. With
the goal of minimizing the impact on the Business of suspended and reduced
Transition Services during any period of scheduled repairs, maintenance and
modifications, the parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
cooperate to plan the delivery of Transition Services around such periods to
the extent commercially practical.

 

SECTION 2.02. _Price for Services; Billing_. (a) As compensation for the
Transition Services to be provided by Seller or its Affiliates hereunder,
Purchaser shall pay to Seller a fee for each Line Item of Service as specified
on _Schedule A_ (as modified for any Line Item(s) of Service to which the
parties agree to provide in an alternative manner pursuant to  _Section
2.01(f)_). For the avoidance of doubt, such fees shall be modified
automatically to reflect any price increase or change in terms or conditions
imposed by any Third Party Provider. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
aggregate cost to Purchaser of the Transition Services with respect to costs
other than third party costs shall not exceed the costs of such services as
reflected in the _Schedule B_ hereto, provided by Seller to Purchaser.

 



4 (b) Charges for the Transition Services shall be invoiced to Purchaser thirty
(30) days in arrears. Any payments pursuant to this Agreement shall be made
in U.S. Dollars within fifteen (15) calendar days after the date of receipt by
Purchaser of the invoice without set-off, defense or counterclaim. Fees shown
as monthly charges on  _Schedule A_ shall be prorated for any period of less
than a calendar month. Except in the case of amounts disputed in good faith by
Purchaser in compliance with _Section 2.02(d)_ , Seller reserves the right to
suspend performance under this Agreement upon failure of Purchaser to make
any payment due pursuant to this Agreement.

(c) Charges not paid within fifteen (15) days after the date when payable
shall bear interest at the rate of 0.05% (six (6) percent per annum) per month
for the period commencing on the due date and ending on the date that is
fifteen (15) days after such due date, and thereafter at the rate of 1% per
month until the date payment is received in full by Seller in respect of such
charges.

(d) If Purchaser disputes any invoice or other request for payment, then
Purchaser will notify the Seller in writing within seven (7) days of the
receipt of the invoice or request for payment and the dispute will be
resolved in accordance with _Section 5.11_. Where only part of an invoice is
disputed, Purchaser will pay the undisputed amount on the due date.

SECTION 2.03. _Confidential Information_. Purchaser acknowledges that the
procedures, operations, processes, computer programs, facilities and
information used by Seller or its Affiliates in performing the Transition
Services are proprietary to Seller (and/or its Affiliates and/or Third Party
Providers), have been established and maintained at great expense, are
protected as confidential information and trade secrets, are of great
value to Seller and provide Seller with a substantial competitive advantage
in its business. Seller acknowledges that the information provided to Seller
and its Affiliates in connection with their provision of Transition Services
is proprietary, has been established and maintained at great expense, is
protected as confidential information and trade secrets, is of great value to
Purchaser and provides Purchaser with substantial competitive value in its
business. Any information of either party to this Agreement provided to or
accessible by the other party in connection herewith, regardless of form,
including all data, processes, technical drawings, designs and concepts;
software programs, routines, formulae and concepts, production
plans, designs, layouts and schedules; marketing analyses, plans, customer
data and surveys; all matters relating to either partys finances and
personnel and any other information (" _Confidential Information_ ") shall be
received and held in strict confidence, used only for purposes related to
this Agreement or as provided in the Acquisition Agreement or the other
Ancillary Agreements and shall not otherwise be disclosed by the other party,
its agents, employees, contractors or subcontractors, without the prior
written consent of the disclosing party. "Confidential Information" as defined
herein does not include any information (i) lawfully received by the receiving
party from another source free of restriction and without breach of this
Agreement, (ii) that becomes generally available to the public without breach
of this Agreement, or (iii) already known to the receiving party at the time
of disclosure free from any confidentiality obligations. Each party shall be
fully responsible for breaches of its obligations under this _Section 2.03_
by its Affiliates, agents, employees, contractors or subcontractors. Nothing
contained in this _Section 2.03_ shall prohibit any party from disclosing,
or permitting the disclosure of, Confidential Information if such party is
compelled to disclose such Confidential Information by judicial or
administrative process or, 

 



5  in the opinion of such partys legal counsel, by other requirements of Law.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any demand or request for
disclosure of Confidential Information is made as described in the preceding
sentence, the party receiving such demand or request shall, unless prohibited
by Law, promptly notify the other party in writing of the existence of such
demand or request and shall provide such party with a reasonable opportunity
to seek an appropriate protective order or other remedy at such partys
expense. In the event that such appropriate protective order or other remedy
is not obtained or is not sought, the party receiving such demand or request
shall furnish, or cause to be furnished, only that portion of the Confidential
Information that is legally required to be disclosed. The provisions of this
_Section 2.03_ do not apply to any legal proceedings between the parties
to this Agreement.

SECTION 2.04. _Access_. Purchaser agrees that it shall, without charge, during
normal business hours and upon reasonable notice, provide Seller (or any
Affiliate of Seller or Third Party Provider) with such access to Purchasers
premises and/or personnel, and such assistance as may reasonably be required
for Seller to perform its obligations under this Agreement. If Purchaser has
access (either on-site or remotely) to any of Sellers computer systems in
relation to the Transition Services, Purchaser shall limit such access solely
to the use of such systems for purposes of the Transition Services and shall
not access or attempt to access any of Sellers computer systems, files,
software or services other than those required for the Transition Services, or
those that are publicly available. Purchaser shall limit such access to those
of its employees, agents or contractors with a bona fide need to have such
access in connection with the Transition Services, and shall follow all of
Sellers security rules and procedures for restricting access to its computer
systems. All user identification numbers and passwords disclosed to Purchaser
and any information obtained by Purchaser as a result of Purchasers access to
and use of Sellers computer systems shall be deemed to be, and treated as,
Sellers Confidential Information hereunder. Seller and Purchaser shall
cooperate in the investigation of any apparent unauthorized access to any
Seller computer system and/or information stores.

 

ARTICLE III

 

TERM AND TERMINATION

SECTION 3.01. _Termination_. (a) Unless otherwise terminated pursuant to
_Section 2.01(e)_, _Section 2.01(f)_ or _Section 3.01(b)_, this Agreement
shall terminate with respect to any Line Item of Service at the earlier of
(x) the close of business on the last day of the Term for such Line Item of
Service and (y) the 30th day after Purchaser delivers written notice of its
termination of such Line Item of Service.

 

(b) This Agreement, or the obligation to provide any individual Line Item(s)
of Service, may be terminated at any time by Seller, upon prior written
notice to Purchaser, if there is a material breach of this Agreement by
Purchaser or if Purchaser fails to pay charges for Transition Services as
provided in _Section 2.02_, except in the case of amounts disputed in
good faith by Purchaser in compliance with _Section 2.02(d)_, and such

attach against either party on account thereof. As soon as reasonably
practicable after the end of the period during which the Force Majeure Event
is continuing, the Seller shall provide prompt written notice to Purchaser,
and Seller or its Affiliates shall resume the provision of such Transition
Services as soon as reasonably practicable after the removal of such cause.

enforceability thereof, and Licensee shall not engage in or support any
action, claim or challenge that is inconsistent with the foregoing. Any use of

(a) Licensee shall use and display the Licensed Marks only in such form and
manner approved by Licensor pursuant to  _Section 4.1_.

all times comply with any reasonable written trademark usage guidelines or any
other reasonable related standards provided by Licensor to Licensee, as may
be updated by Licensor from time to time.

(c) Licensee shall not intentionally or recklessly act in a manner likely to
prejudice the validity, enforceability, fame or distinctiveness of any of the
Licensed Marks. Licensee shall not intentionally or recklessly harm the
goodwill associated with the Licensed Marks or take any action which it

compliance with this _Article III_ , Licensee shall provide samples of the
Licensed Products and any other further information reasonably requested by
Licensor for that purpose. If at any time Licensor is of the opinion that the
quality of the Licensed Products does not meet the specified

 



3  quality standards, Licensor shall provide a notice to Licensee including an
explanation of such deficiency and giving Licensee a reasonable period of time
to effect the necessary changes to bring such Licensed Products within the

approval. If Licensor fails to approve or disapprove a submission through
Licensors standard review procedures generally applicable to licensees
within forty-five (45) days after Licensors receipt of those materials
necessary for its review, Licensor shall be deemed to have disapproved of such
submission and Licensee shall have no right to use the Licensed Mark
in connection therewith.

Section 3.3 _Product Identification_. Licensee shall ensure that each Licensed
Product has an indelible, unique identifier in a manner that designates
Licensee as the manufacturer of such Licensed Product. For illustrative
purposes only, such an identifier could include a serial number.

 

ARTICLE IV  APPROVALS

Section 4.1 _Approval Process_.

(a) Licensee, at its expense, shall submit to Licensor all materials,
including packaging (including user guides and other in-box materials),
labeling, point of sale materials, public relations materials, trade show
materials and displays, sales materials and advertising and promotional
materials, bearing the Licensed Marks (" _Materials_ "), and if such items are
in a foreign language, translations of such items along with certification
that such translations are accurate, for Licensors advance written approval,
such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed, prior to use, sale
or distribution; _provided_ that any Materials in use by Licensee as of the
Effective Date shall be deemed approved by Licensor. If Licensor fails
to approve or disapprove a submission through Licensors standard review
procedures generally applicable to licensees within ten (10) days after
Licensors receipt of those materials necessary for its review, Licensor shall
be deemed to have disapproved of such submission and Licensee shall have no
right to use the Licensed Mark in connection therewith; _provided_ that if
Licensee then resubmits such submission and materials, then if Licensor fails
to approve or disapprove such submission through Licensors standard review
procedures generally applicable to licensees within five (5) days after
Licensors receipt of those materials necessary for its review, Licensor shall
be deemed to have approved of such submission.

(b) Notwithstanding the generality of the foregoing, the following rules shall
apply to the review and approval process:

(i) Licensor reserves the right to withdraw approval for an item if it departs
from the approved sample, or if any quality, liability or safety issues with
respect to an item are subsequently identified.

(ii) In the event of any modification or change in use or quality of any
Materials submitted for approval, or the use of the Licensed Marks on such
Materials or on the Licensed Products, whether during the approval process or
after final approval has been granted, Licensee shall re-submit such Materials
for approval.

 



4 (iii) Licensee shall disclose all sources for any artwork not supplied
by Licensor.

(iv) Licensee shall not use the Licensed Marks, artwork and/or designs or any
component thereof in any business sign, business card, stationery or form or
as part of the name of Licensees business or any division thereof, unless
Licensor has previously approved such use. If Licensor fails to approve or
disapprove a submission through Licensors standard review procedures
generally applicable to licensees within ten (10) days after Licensors
receipt of those materials necessary for its review, Licensor shall be deemed
to have disapproved of such submission and Licensee shall have no right to
use the Licensed Mark in connection therewith; _provided_ that if Licensee
then resubmits such submission and materials, then if Licensor fails to
approve or disapprove such submission through Licensors standard review
procedures generally applicable to licensees within five (5) days after
Licensors receipt of those materials necessary for its review, Licensor shall
be deemed to have approved of such submission.

 

(v) All press releases and/or public announcements by Licensee concerning the
subject matter of this Agreement shall be subject to prior written approval
by Licensor, both as to the content and timing of any such release or
announcement.

(c) Licensee shall not use or display the Licensed Marks in any way without
Licensors prior approval pursuant to this _Article IV_.

Section 4.2 _Right to Suspend Obligations Under Approval Process_. In addition
to its other remedies, Licensor reserves the right to suspend its obligations
under the approval process for the Licensed Products with respect to which
Licensor has given Licensee notice of a material breach of this Agreement
unless Licensee has taken, and diligently continues to take, reasonable and
meaningful steps to cure such material breach within a reasonable period of
time.

Section 4.3 _No Waiver_. Any approval granted by Licensor under this _Article
IV_  shall not constitute a waiver of any other term or condition of this
Agreement or of any obligation of Licensee established therein.

Section 4.4 _Inspection_. Upon reasonable advance written notice from time to
time, but no more than once per year (unless Licensor has a reasonable belief
of Licensees non-compliance with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement), Licensee shall allow Licensor or its designees to enter Licensees
premises and the premises where the Licensed Products are being manufactured
or packaged, upon prior notice and during regular business hours and with
reasonable efforts to avoid any disruption to Licensees operations, for the
purpose of inspecting the Licensed Products and Materials and verifying
compliance with this Agreement.

 

ARTICLE V  INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION

Section 5.1 _Notice of Infringement_. Licensee shall promptly notify Licensor
in writing of any alleged infringement of the Licensed Marks by others which
come to Licensees attention. Licensor shall have the sole right, but not the

any such infringement, and, at Licensors sole cost and expense, Licensee
shall reasonably cooperate in connection therewith.

 



5 Section 5.2 _Defense of Licensed Marks_. Licensor shall have the right, but
not the obligation, to exclusively control and defend any claim that
Licensees or its officers, directors, employees or agents use of the
Licensed Marks infringes or otherwise violates the rights of any third
party. Licensee shall promptly notify Licensor of any such claim which comes
to its attention. For the avoidance of doubt, Licensors decision to assume
the defense of any such claim shall not obligate Licensor to indemnify or hold
harmless any party against any such claim.

Section 5.3 _Equitable Relief_. Licensee acknowledges that the Licensed Marks
and the goodwill associated therewith possess special, unique, and
extraordinary characteristics, which make difficult the assessment of monetary
damages which Licensor would sustain by Licensees unauthorized use. Licensee
recognizes that Licensor would suffer irreparable injury by such unauthorized
use and agrees that injunctive and other equitable relief is appropriate in
the event of a breach of this Agreement by Licensee. Such remedy shall not be
exclusive of any other remedies available to Licensor, nor shall it be deemed
an election of remedies by Licensor.

terms of _Section 6.2_, Licensee may continue to use the MOTOROLA (wordmark)
for a period of two (2) years following such termination solely on its website
and in general business correspondence (not including marketing
and advertising materials) and as a factual matter to indicate Licensees
past affiliation with Licensor (for example, "formerly Motorolas Connected

ARTICLE VII  INDEMNIFICATION; DISCLAIMER

Section 7.1 _Indemnification by Licensee_.

(a) Licensee shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless Licensor, its
subsidiaries and their respective officers, directors, employees and agents
(the " _Owner Indemnified Parties_ ") with respect to any damages, interest,
reasonable attorneys fees, costs and expenses which arises out of any
lawsuit, action, legal proceeding, claim or demand arising from: (i) the
Licensed Products or any Materials, including the use, manufacture, sale or
condition thereof; or (ii) any breach or violation of any warranty,
representation, term or condition of this Agreement by Licensee.

(b) Compliance with _Section 7.2_ by Licensee shall not relieve Licensee
from its obligations under _Section 7.1_.

Section 7.2 _Insurance_. Upon execution of this Agreement, Licensee shall
have and maintain, at its sole cost and expense, general and product liability
insurance (ISO 1986 or later) from a recognized insurance company with an A.M.
Best Company rating of "A" acceptable to Licensor in connection with Licensed
Products made during the Term. This insurance coverage shall be primary and
non-contributory and shall provide a minimum comprehensive general liability
insurance for each occurrence, completed operations coverage, bodily injury,
property damage, personal injury, product liability, contractual liability and
advertising injury liability in the amount set forth on _Schedule D_.

 



7 (a) Such insurance coverage shall name Licensor as an additional insured party
against any and all claims, demands, causes of action or damages, including
reasonable attorneys fees.

(b) The stipulated limits of coverage above shall not be construed as a
limitation of any potential liability of Licensee to Licensor or third
parties, and failure to request evidence of this insurance shall in no way be
construed as a waiver of Licensees obligation to provide the insurance
coverage specified.

(c) Such insurance policy shall provide that it may not be canceled or amended
in a manner which restricts the existing coverage without at least thirty
(30) days prior written notice to Licensor. For the avoidance of doubt, the
foregoing does not relieve Licensee of its obligation to have and maintain
insurance under this  _Section 7.2_.

(d) Within thirty (30) days after this Agreement is fully executed (and
thereafter at least thirty (30) days prior to the expiration of insurance
coverage), Licensee shall furnish to Licensor a certificate of insurance
evidencing the foregoing coverage and specifically listing Licensor as an
additional insured party.

ARTICLE VIII  MISCELLANEOUS

Section 8.1 _Waiver_. Either Party may (a) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other Party or (b)
waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein.
Any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an
instrument in writing signed by the Party to be bound thereby. Any failure to
assert, or delay in the assertion of, rights under this Agreement shall not
constitute a waiver of those rights.

 

Section 8.2 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, the
Parties shall bear their respective direct and indirect costs and expenses
incurred in connection with the negotiation, preparation, execution and
performance of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

address of the Parties as set forth below, unless notification of a change of
address is given in writing, and shall be sent by both generally recognized
overnight courier service and confirmed facsimile transmission and shall be
deemed to have been given when received.

2.5(a)(ii)_, (i) any pre-existing or later acquired operations, businesses,

services made by the Divested Entity or, in accordance with _Section 2.3_,
by contractors of the Divested Entity, (iii) all license rights assigned

Change of Control or sale of all or substantially all of the assets of GIC

hereunder to the party acquiring such assets or control) or (ii) to assign
this Agreement and all of its rights and obligations hereunder in whole (but
not in part) to the party acquiring such assets or control (in which case all
right grants under this _ARTICLE II_ to Arris and its Subsidiaries (other

of Control or sale).

(f) Any attempted assignment in violation of this _Section 2.5_ shall be
void and of no effect.

or obligations hereunder, in whole or in part, to any Person without the prior

the right to assign rights and obligations hereunder in part pursuant to this
clause (ii) only two (2) times (namely, in connection with the sale of two
Mobility Divested Entities).

(b) Following a permitted assignment by Mobility or Google pursuant to
_Section 3.5_(a) or a Change of Control of Mobility or Google, any pre-
existing or later acquired operations, businesses, products, product lines or
services of the acquiring party shall not be licensed pursuant to this
Agreement under any Licensed GIC Intellectual Property.

 



7 (c) Following a permitted assignment pursuant to _Section 2.5(a)(ii)_, (i)

lines or services of the party acquiring the Mobility Divested Entity and its
Affiliates shall not be licensed pursuant to this Agreement under any Licensed

_Section 2.3_, by contractors of the Mobility Divested Entity, (iii) all
license rights assigned pursuant to _Section 2.5(a)(ii)_ will automatically

Entity are integrated with the acquiring partys other business or product
lines or the Mobility Divested Entity otherwise ceases to operate as an
independent entity or division, (iv) the assignee pursuant to _Section
2.5(a)(ii)_ shall have no right to further assign the rights and obligations
assigned to it under this Agreement in whole or in part and (v) Google,

under this _Section 3.5_, (i) Mobility shall provide written notice to Arris
identifying the assignee or acquirer of Control and, in the case of assignment
pursuant to _Section 3.5(a)(ii)_, the Mobility Divested Entity and its
products and services, (ii) such assignee or acquirer shall agree in writing

relieved of any of its accrued obligations hereunder.

(e) Any attempted assignment in violation of this _Section 3.5_ shall be void
and of no effect.

Section 7.5 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, together with the Acquisition
Agreement and the other Ancillary Agreements, constitutes the entire
agreement of the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and

Section 7.7 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury_. 

(a) This Agreement and any dispute arising out of or relating to or in
connection with this Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the Laws of the State of New York.

(b) Subject to _Section 7.8_, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
Law, each Party hereto (i) agrees that any claim, action or proceeding by such
Party seeking any relief whatsoever arising out of, relating to or in
connection with, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall
be brought only in the United States District Court for the Southern District
of New York or in any New York State court, in each case, located in the
Borough of Manhattan and not in any other State or Federal court in the United
States of America or any court in any other country, (ii) agrees to submit to
the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts located in the Borough of Manhattan
for purposes of all legal proceedings arising out of, or in connection with,
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, (iii) waives and
agrees not to assert any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the
laying of the venue of any such Action brought in such a court or any claim
that any such Action brought in such a court has been brought in an
inconvenient forum, (iv) agrees that mailing of process or other papers in
connection with any such action or proceeding in the manner provided in
Section 11.03 of the Acquisition Agreement or any other manner as may be
permitted by Law shall be valid and sufficient service thereof and (v) agrees
that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and
may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any
other manner provided by applicable Law.

(c) Each Party hereby waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
Law, any right it may have to a trial by jury in respect to any litigation,
directly or indirectly, arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any
transaction contemplated by this Agreement. Each Party (i) certifies that no
representative, agent or attorney of the other Party has represented,
expressly or otherwise, that such other Party would not, in the event of
litigation, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver and (ii) acknowledges that
the Parties have been induced to enter into this Agreement by, among other
things, the mutual waivers and certifications in this _Section 7.7_.

 

Section 7.8 _Resolution of Conflicts; Arbitration_.

(a) Prior to commencing any arbitration under this Agreement, the Party
desiring to commence the proceeding shall deliver notice to the other Party
setting forth the nature of the dispute, and request a meeting of senior
executives in order to settle the dispute in good faith (" _Pre-arbitration
Notice_ "). Within ten (10) days of delivery of the Pre-arbitration Notice,
both Parties shall designate at least one senior executive (Vice President or
higher) having authority to settle such disputes to meet and discuss the
dispute with the other Party. The executives shall promptly meet at a mutually
agreeable location and attempt to resolve the dispute in good faith
within thirty (30) days from the date of delivery of the Pre-arbitration
Notice. In the event the dispute is not settled within the thirty-day period,
either Party may file an arbitration request under _Section 7.8(b)_.

 



11 (b) Any claim or dispute arising out of or related to this Agreement, or the
interpretation, making, performance, breach or termination thereof, shall
(after compliance with _Section 7.8(a)_) be finally settled by binding and
confidential arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association
in the County of Santa Clara, California in accordance with the then current
Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association and
judgment upon the award rendered may be entered in any court having
jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator(s) shall have the authority to grant any
equitable and legal remedies that would be available in any judicial
proceeding instituted to resolve a dispute.

(c) Such arbitration shall be conducted by a single arbitrator chosen by
mutual agreement of the Parties. Alternatively, at the request of either Party
before the commencement of arbitration, the arbitration shall be conducted by
three independent arbitrators, none of whom shall have any competitive
interests with either of the Parties. Each Party shall each select one
arbitrator. The two arbitrators so selected shall select a third arbitrator.

(d) In any arbitration under this _Section 7.8_, each Party shall be limited
to calling a total of three witnesses both for purposes of deposition and the
arbitration hearing. Subject to the foregoing limitation on the number of
witnesses, the arbitrator or arbitrators, as the case may be, shall set a
limited time period and establish procedures designed to reduce the cost and
time for discovery while allowing the Parties an opportunity, adequate in the
sole judgment of the arbitrator or majority of the three arbitrators, as the
case may be, to discover relevant information from the opposing Party about
the subject matter of the dispute. The arbitrator, or a majority of the three
arbitrators, as the case may be, shall rule upon motions to compel or limit
discovery and shall have the authority to impose sanctions for
discovery abuses, including attorneys fees and costs, to the same extent as
a competent court of law or equity, should the arbitrators or a majority of
the three arbitrators, as the case may be, determine that discovery was sought
without substantial justification or that discovery was refused or objected
to without substantial justification.

(e) The decision of the arbitrator or a majority of the three arbitrators, as
the case may be, as to any claim or dispute shall be final, binding,
confidential, and conclusive upon the Parties to this Agreement. Such decision
shall be written and shall be supported by written findings of fact and
conclusions which shall set forth the award, judgment, decree or order awarded
by the arbitrator(s). Within thirty (30) days of a decision of the
arbitrator(s) requiring payment by one Party to another, such Party shall
make the payment to such other Party.

(f) By agreeing to arbitration, the Parties do not intend to deprive any court
of competent jurisdiction of its ability to issue any form of provisional
remedy, including but not limited to a preliminary injunction, or order any
interim or conservatory measure. A request for such provisional remedy or
interim or conservatory measure by a Party to a court shall not be deemed a
waiver of this agreement to arbitrate.

(g) The Parties agree that each Party shall pay its own costs and expenses
(including counsel fees) of any such arbitration, and each Party waives its
right to seek an order compelling the other Party to pay its portion of its
costs and expenses (including counsel fees) for any arbitration.

 



12 (h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the arbitration
provisions set forth herein, and any arbitration conducted thereunder, shall
be governed exclusively by the Federal Arbitration Act, Title 9 United States
Code, to the exclusion of any state or municipal law of arbitration.

 

(i) Except as may be required by applicable law or court order, the Parties
agree to maintain confidentiality as to all aspects of any arbitration,
including its existence and results, except that nothing herein shall prevent
any Party from disclosing information regarding such arbitration for purposes
of proceedings to enforce this clause or to enforce the award or for purposes
of seeking provisional remedies from a court of competent jurisdiction. The
Parties further agree to obtain the arbitrators agreement to preserve the
confidentiality of any arbitration.

 

Section 7.9 _Availability of Equitable Relief_. In the event of any breach or
threatened breach by either Party of its obligations under this Agreement,
the other Party shall be entitled to equitable relief (including specific
performance) without prejudice to any other rights or remedies that may
otherwise be available to such other Party.

 

Section 7.10 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement shall be binding
upon and inure solely to the benefit of each Party hereto and its successors
and permitted assigns and (to the extent set forth herein) its Subsidiaries
and their successors and permitted assigns, and nothing in this Agreement is
intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any legal or equitable
rights, benefits or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of
this Agreement.

Section 7.11 _No Presumption_. The Parties agree that this Agreement was
negotiated fairly between them at arms length and that the final terms of
this Agreement are the product of the Parties negotiations. Each Party
represents and warrants that it has sought and received legal counsel of its
own choosing with regard to the contents of this Agreement and the rights and
obligations affected hereby. The Parties agree that this Agreement shall be
deemed to have been jointly and equally drafted by them, and that the
provisions of this Agreement therefore should not be construed against a Party
on the grounds that the Party drafted or was more responsible for drafting the
provisions.

 

Section 7.12 _No Disclosure of Schedules_. The Schedules to this Agreement are
strictly confidential and shall not be disclosed to any Person or made
publicly available other than as required to be disclosed pursuant to an
applicable law, rule, regulation, self- regulation, government requirement,
court order, the rules of any stock exchange or regulatory
authority (provided, however, that the disclosing Party shall advise the
other Party of such required disclosure promptly upon learning thereof in
order to afford such other Party a reasonable opportunity to contest, limit
and/or assist the disclosing Party in avoiding or crafting such disclosure).

 



13 Section 7.13 _Headings_. The headings contained in this Agreement are
for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement.

Section 7.14  _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, and by the different Parties in separate counterparts, each of
which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken
together shall constitute one and the same agreement. Delivery of an executed
counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by facsimile or other
electronic means (including portable document format) shall be as effective as
delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.

2.1. _Shelf Registration_.

(a) _Filing_. Subject to _Section 2.1(c)_, Arris HoldCo shall file with the
SEC as soon as reasonably practicable following the Closing Date (as defined
in the Acquisition Agreement) a Shelf Registration Statement relating to the
offer and sale of the Registrable Securities by the Holders thereof from time
to time in accordance with the methods of distribution elected by such Holders
and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause such Shelf Registration
Statement to be declared effective under the Securities Act as soon as
reasonably practicable following the Closing Date.

(b) _Continued Effectiveness and Scope_. Arris HoldCo shall use its reasonable
best efforts to keep the Shelf Registration Statement continuously effective
for a period ending on the later of (i) (A) two (2) years after the effective
date of such Shelf Registration Statement and (B) the date on which none of
Seller and its Affiliates is an Affiliate of Arris HoldCo and (ii) the date on
which all the Registrable Securities subject thereto have been sold pursuant
to such Shelf Registration Statement. Any such Shelf Registration Statement
shall provide for the resale from time to time, and pursuant to any method of
combination of methods legally available to, and requested by, the Holder(s)
of the Registrable Securities.

(c) _Underwritten Offering_. If the Holders of not less than a majority of
any class of Registrable Securities (the "Majority Holders") proposed to be
included in any offering pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement or the
Seller or any of its Affiliates that is a Holder ("Seller Holder") so elects,
such offering shall be in the form of an Underwritten Offering and Arris
HoldCo, if necessary, shall amend or supplement the Shelf Registration
Statement for such purpose. Arris HoldCo and the Majority Holders or the
Seller Holder, as the case may be, shall have jointly select the managing
underwriter or underwriters for the offering.

(d)  _Priority of Registration Rights_. If the managing underwriter or
underwriters of any proposed Underwritten Offering pursuant to the Shelf
Registration Statement informs the Holders of Registrable Securities sought to
be included in such Underwritten Offering in writing that, it or they have
determined in good faith that, the total amount or kind of securities which
such Holders and any other Persons intend to include in such offering exceeds
the number which can be sold in such offering without being likely to have a
significant adverse effect on the market for the class of securities offered,
then the securities to be included in such registration shall be allocated as
follows:

 



     | (i) | _first_ , the number of Registrable Securities of such
class that, in the opinion of such underwriter or underwriters can be sold
without having such adverse effect shall be included therein, with such
number to be allocated (A) at the written election of Seller, to Seller and
its Affiliates, and otherwise (B) _pro rata_ among the Holders which have
requested participation in the Underwritten Offering (based, for each such
Holder, on the percentage derived by dividing (x) the number of Registrable
Securities of such class which such Holder has requested to include in such
Underwritten Offering by (y) the aggregate number of Registrable Securities
of such class which all such Holders have requested to include); 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | _second_ , any securities that Arris HoldCo has proposed
to sell shall be included therein; and 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (iii) | _third_ , and only if all of the securities requested to
be included pursuant to clauses (i) and (ii) above have been included, any
other securities eligible for inclusion in such registration shall be
included therein, with such number to be allocated _pro_ _rata_ among any
remaining securities. 
---|---|--- 
 



4 (e) _Effect on Demand and Piggyback Registration Obligation_. The provisions
of  _Section 2.2_ and _Section 2.3_ shall not apply at any time Arris
HoldCo is eligible to file and maintain the effectiveness of a Shelf
Registration Statement and is complying with its obligations under this 
_Section 2.1_ with respect to all Registrable Securities.

2.2. _Demand Registrations_.

 

(a) _Demand by Holders_. (i) At any time the Majority Holders or a Seller
Holder may make a written request to Arris HoldCo for registration of (A) all
of the Registrable Securities held by such Holders or (B) any part of the
Registrable Securities held by such requesting Holders; provided, however,
that Arris HoldCo shall not be required to effect a Demand Registration
unless the Holders of the Registrable Securities propose to sell Registrable
Securities with an aggregate offering price to the public of greater than
$50,000,000. Any such requested registration shall hereinafter be referred to
as a " _Demand Registration_." Each request for a Demand Registration shall
specify the aggregate amount of Registrable Securities to be registered and
the intended methods of disposition thereof.

 

(ii) Within ten (10) days following receipt of any request for a Demand
Registration, Arris HoldCo shall deliver written notice of such request to
all other Holders of Registrable Securities of the class or classes to be
registered. Thereafter, Arris HoldCo shall include in such Demand Registration
any additional Registrable Securities of each such class which the Holder
or Holders thereof have requested in writing be included in such Demand
Registration, provided that all requests therefor have been received by Arris
HoldCo within ten (10) days of Arris HoldCos having sent the applicable
notice to such Holder or Holders. All such requests shall specify the
aggregate amount and class of Registrable Securities to be registered and the
intended method of distribution of the same. Arris HoldCo shall not include in
any Demand Registration any securities which are not Registrable Securities
without the prior written consent of the Majority Holders or the Seller
Holder, as the case may be, requesting such Demand Registration, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. 

(iii) As promptly as practicable following receipt of a request for a Demand
Registration, Arris HoldCo shall file a Registration Statement relating to
such Demand Registration and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
such Registration Statement to be declared effective under the Securities Act.
Arris HoldCo may postpone for up to 60 consecutive days the filing or
effectiveness of a Registration Statement for a Demand Registration if the
Board of Directors of Arris HoldCo determines in its reasonable good faith
judgment that such Demand Registration would (x) materially interfere with
a significant acquisition, corporate reorganization or other similar
transaction involving Arris HoldCo or its subsidiaries; or (y) require
premature disclosure of material nonpublic information that Arris HoldCo has a
bona fide business purpose for preserving as confidential. Arris HoldCo may
delay a Demand Registration hereunder only twice in a period of twelve (12)
consecutive months.

 



5 (b) _Demand Withdrawal_. A Holder may withdraw its Registrable Securities from
a Demand Registration prior to the effectiveness of the Registration
Statement filed with respect to such Demand Registration. If the Majority
Holders or the Seller Holder, as the case may be, that requested the Demand
Registation does so, Arris HoldCo shall be entitled to cease all efforts to
secure registration, in which event the Holders who requested such
registration shall have paid or reimbursed Arris HoldCo for all of the
reasonable out-of-pocket fees and expenses incurred by Arris HoldCo
in connection with the withdrawn registration, unless the withdrawal is based
on the reasonable determination of the Holders who requested such registration
that there has been, since the date of such request, a material adverse change
in the business or prospects of Arris HoldCo.

(c) _Underwritten Offering_. If the Majority Holders or the Seller Holder, as
the case may be, that requested the Demand Registation so elect, such
offering shall be in the form of an Underwritten Offering. The Majority
Holders or the Seller Holder, as the case may be, that requested the Demand
Registation shall have the right to select the managing underwriter or
underwriters for the offering, which selection shall be subject to the consent
of Arris HoldCo, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

 

(d) _Priority of Registration Rights_. If the managing underwriter or
underwriters of any proposed Underwritten Offering pursuant to a Demand
Registration informs the Holders of Registrable Securities sought to be
included in such Underwritten Offering in writing that, it or they have
determined in good faith that, the total amount or kind of securities which
such Holders and any other Persons intend to include in such offering exceeds
the number which can be sold in such offering without being likely to have a
significant adverse effect on the market for the class of securities offered,
then the securities to be included in such registration shall be allocated as
follows:

(i) _first_ , the number of Registrable Securities of such class that, in the
opinion of such underwriter or underwriters can be sold without having such
adverse effect shall be included therein, with such number to be allocated (A)
at the written election of Seller, to Seller and its Affiliates, and
otherwise (B) _pro_ _rata_ among the Holders which have requested
participation in the Underwritten Offering (based, for each such Holder, on
the percentage derived by dividing (x) the number of Registrable Securities of
such class which such Holder has requested to include in such Underwritten
Offering by (y) the aggregate number of Registrable Securities of such class
which all such Holders have requested to include);

 

(ii) _second_ , any securities that Arris HoldCo has proposed to sell shall be
included therein; and

 

(iii) _third_ , and only if all of the securities requested to be included
pursuant to clauses (i) and (ii) above have been included, any other
securities eligible for inclusion in such registration shall be included
therein, with such number to be allocated _pro_ _rata_ among any remaining
securities.

 

(e) _Registration Statement Form_. Registrations under this _Section 2.2_
shall be on such appropriate registration form of the SEC (i) as shall be
selected by Arris HoldCo and as shall be reasonably acceptable to the Majority
Holders or the Seller Holder, as the case may be, that requested the Demand
Registration and (ii) as shall permit the disposition of the Registrable
Securities in accordance with the intended method or methods of disposition
specified in the

 



6  applicable Holders requests for such registration. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if, pursuant to a Demand Registration, (x) Arris HoldCo proposes to
effect this registration by filing a Registration Statement on Form S-3 (or
any successor or similar short-form registration statement), (y) such
registration is in connection with an Underwritten Offering and (z) the
managing underwriter or underwriters shall advise Arris HoldCo in writing
that, in its or their opinion, the use of another form of registration
statement (or the inclusion, rather than the incorporation by reference, of
information in the Prospectus related to a Registration Statement on Form S-3
(or other short-form registration statement)) is of material importance to
the success of such proposed offering, then such registration shall be
effected on such other form (or such information shall be so included in such
Prospectus).

 

2.3. _Facilitating Underwritten Offering_. In the case of a registration of a
class of Registrable Securities pursuant to  _Section 2.1_ or _Section 2.2_
involving an Underwritten Offering, Arris HoldCo agrees, if requested by the
managing underwriter or underwriters in such Underwritten Offering, not to
effect (or register for sale) any public sale or distribution of any
securities which are the same as or similar to those being registered, or
which are convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for such securities,
during the period beginning seven (7) days before, and ending ninety (90)
days (or such lesser period as may be permitted by such underwriter or
underwriters) after the date of the closing under the underwriting agreement
in connection therewith, to the extent Arris HoldCo is timely notified in
writing by the managing underwriter or underwriters. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Arris HoldCo may effect a public sale or distribution of securities
of the type described above and during the periods described above if the same
(A) is made pursuant to registrations on Forms S-4 or S-8 or any successor
form to such forms or (B) as part of any registration of securities for
offering and sale to employees or directors of Arris HoldCo pursuant to any
employee stock plan or other employee benefit plan arrangement.

2.4 _Piggyback Registrations_.

 

(a) _Participation_. (i) If Arris HoldCo at any time proposes to file a
Registration Statement with respect to any offering of its securities for its
own account or for the account of any Holders of its securities (other than
(A) a registration under _Section 2.1_ or _Section 2.2_ hereof, (B) a
registration on Form S-4 or S-8 or any successor form to such forms, or (C) a
registration of securities solely relating to an offering and sale to
employees or directors of Arris HoldCo pursuant to any employee stock plan or
other employee benefit plan arrangement, then, as soon as practicable (but in
no event less than ten (10) days prior to the proposed date of filing such
Registration Statement), Arris HoldCo shall give written notice of such
proposed filing to all Holders of Registrable Securities, and such
notice shall offer the Holders of such Registrable Securities the opportunity
to register such number of Registrable Securities as each such Holder may
request in writing (an " _Piggyback Registration_ "). Subject to  _Section
2.4(b)_, Arris HoldCo shall include in such Registration Statement all such
Registrable Securities which are requested to be included therein within ten
(10) days after the receipt by such Holder of any such notice. If at any time
after giving written notice of its intention to register any securities and
prior to the effective date of the Registration Statement filed in connection
with such registration, Arris HoldCo shall determine for any reason not to
register or to delay registration of such securities, Arris HoldCo may, at
its election, give written notice of such determination to each Holder of
Registrable Securities and, (x) in the case of a determination not to
register, shall be relieved of 

 



7  its obligation to register any Registrable Securities in connection with
such registration, and (y) in the case of a determination to delay
registering, shall be permitted to delay registering any Registrable
Securities for the same period as the delay in registering such other
securities.

(ii) If the offering pursuant to a Piggyback Registration is to be an
Underwritten Offering, then each Holder making a request for its Registrable
Securities to be included therein must, and Arris HoldCo shall make such
arrangements with the underwriters so that each such Holder may, participate
in such Underwritten Offering on the same terms as Arris HoldCo and other
Persons selling securities in such Underwritten Offering. If the offering
pursuant to such registration is to be on any other basis, then each Holder
making a request for a Piggyback Registration pursuant to this _Section
2.4(a)_ must participate in such offering on such basis.

(iii) Each Holder of Registrable Securities shall be permitted to withdraw all
or part of such Holders Registrable Securities from a Piggyback Registration
at any time. For the avoidance of doubt, if a Holder decides not to include
all of its Registrable Securities in any registration statement thereafter
filed by Arris HoldCo, such Holder shall nevertheless continue to have the
right to include any Registrable Securities in any subsequent registration
statement or registration statements as may be filed by Arris HoldCo with
respect to offerings of its securities, all upon the terms and conditions set
forth herein.

 

(b) _Priority of Piggyback Registration_. If the managing underwriter or
underwriters of any proposed Underwritten Offering of a class of securities
included in a Piggyback Registration (or in the case of a Piggyback
Registration not being underwritten, Arris HoldCo) informs the Holders of
Registrable Securities of any class sought to be included in such registration
in writing that, it or they have determined in good faith that, the total
amount or kind of securities which such Holders and any other Persons intend
to include in such offering exceeds the number which can be sold in such
offering without being likely to have a significant adverse effect on the
market for the class or classes of securities offered, then the securities of
each class to be included in such registration shall be allocated as follows:

 



     | (i) | _first_ , 100% of the securities that Arris HoldCo has
proposed to sell shall be included therein; 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (ii) | _second_ , the number of Registrable Securities of such
class that, in the opinion of such underwriter or underwriters (or in the case
of a Piggyback Registration not being underwritten, Arris HoldCo), can be
sold without having such adverse effect shall be included therein, with such
number to be allocated _pro rata_ first among the Holders that are Seller and
its Affiliates and have requested participation in the Piggyback Registration
and second among such other Holders that have requested participation in the
Piggyback Registration (based, for each such Holder, on the percentage derived
by dividing (x) the number of Registrable Securities of such class which such
Holder has requested to include in such Piggyback Registration by (y) the
aggregate number of Registrable Securities of such class which all such
Holders have requested to include); and  
---|---|--- 
 



8 Securities requested to be included pursuant to clauses (i) and (ii) above
have been included, any other securities eligible for inclusion in such
registration shall be included therein. 
---|---|--- 

2.5. _Registration Procedures_. (a) In connection with Arris HoldCos
registration obligations in this Agreement, Arris HoldCo will, subject to the
limitations set forth herein, use its reasonable best efforts to effect any
such registration so as to permit the sale of the applicable Registrable
Securities in accordance with the intended method or methods of distribution
thereof as expeditiously as reasonably practicable, and in connection
therewith Arris HoldCo will:

supplements thereto and in connection therewith, furnish to the underwriter

(ii) prepare and file with the SEC such amendments or supplements to
the applicable Registration Statement or Prospectus as may be (A) reasonably
requested by any participating Holder (to the extent such request relates to
information relating to such Holder), (B) necessary to keep such registration
effective for the period of time required by this Agreement or (C) reasonably
requested by the Holders of a majority of any class of the participating
Registrable Securities or by Seller or any of its Affiliates that are Holders;

 

(iii) notify the selling Holders of Registrable Securities and the managing
underwriter or underwriters, if any, and (if requested) confirm such advice
in writing, as soon as reasonably practicable after notice thereof is received
by Arris HoldCo (A) when the applicable Registration Statement or any
amendment thereto has been filed or becomes effective and when the applicable
Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto has been filed, (B) of any
written comments by the SEC or any request by the SEC or any other federal or
state governmental authority for amendments or supplements to
such Registration Statement or Prospectus or for additional information, (C)
of the issuance by the SEC of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of
such Registration Statement or any order preventing or suspending the use of
any preliminary or final Prospectus or the initiation or threat of any
proceedings for such purposes and (D) of the receipt by Arris HoldCo of any
notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification of the
Registrable Securities for offering or sale in any jurisdiction or the
initiation or threat of any proceeding for such purpose;

(iv) promptly notify each selling Holder of Registrable Securities and the
managing underwriter or underwriters, if any, when Arris HoldCo becomes aware
of the happening of any event as a result of which the applicable Registration
Statement or Prospectus (as then in effect) contains any untrue statement of
a material fact or omits to state a material fact necessary to make the
statements therein (in the case of the Prospectus and any preliminary
Prospectus, in light of the circumstances under which they were made) not
misleading or, if for any other reason it shall be necessary to amend or
supplement such Registration Statement or Prospectus in order to comply with
the Securities Act and, in either case as promptly as 

 



9  reasonably practicable thereafter, prepare and file with the SEC an
amendment or supplement to such Registration Statement or Prospectus which
will correct such statement or omission or effect such compliance; _provided_
, _however_ , that upon receipt of any notice from the Company pursuant to
this _Section 2.5(a)(iv)_, each Holder of Registrable Securities shall
immediately discontinue disposition of such Registrable Securities until such
Holder receives the supplemented or amended Registration Statement or
Prospectus contemplated by this _Section 2.5(a)(iv)_;

as the managing underwriter or underwriters, if any, or the Holders of a
majority of the Registrable Securities of the class being sold or Seller or
any of its Affiliates that are Holders agree should be included therein
relating to the plan of distribution with respect to such Registrable
Securities; and make all required filings of such Prospectus supplement or
post-effective amendment as soon as reasonably practicable after being
notified of the matters to be incorporated in such Prospectus supplement or
post-effective amendment;

(vii) furnish to each selling Holder of Registrable Securities and each
managing underwriter, if any, without charge, as many conformed copies as such
Holder or managing underwriter may reasonably request of the applicable

each managing underwriter, if any, without charge, as many copies of the
applicable Prospectus (including each preliminary Prospectus) as such Holder

HoldCo consents to the use of the Prospectus by each of the selling Holders
of Registrable Securities and the underwriter or underwriters, if any, in
connection with the offering and sale of the Registrable Securities covered by
the Prospectus) and such other documents as such selling Holder or managing
underwriter may reasonably request in order to facilitate the disposition of
the Registrable Securities by such Holder or underwriter;

(ix) on or prior to the date on which the applicable Registration Statement is
declared effective, use its reasonable best efforts to register and qualify
such Registrable Securities for offer and sale under the securities or "Blue
Sky" laws of each state and other jurisdiction of the United States, as any
such selling Holder or underwriter, if any, or their respective counsel
reasonably requests, and do any and all other acts or things reasonably
necessary or advisable to keep such registration or qualification in effect so
as to permit the commencement and continuance of sales and dealings in such
jurisdictions for as long as may be necessary to complete the distribution of
the Registrable Securities covered by the Registration Statement; _provided_
, _however_ , that Arris HoldCo will not be required to (a) qualify generally

process in any such jurisdiction where it is not then so subject;

(c) Each Holder of Registrable Securities agrees by acquisition of such
Registrable Securities that, upon receipt of any notice from Arris HoldCo of
the happening of any event of the kind described in _Section 2.5(a)(iv)_,
such Holder will discontinue disposition of its Registrable Securities
pursuant to such Registration Statement until such Holders receipt of the
copies of the supplemented or amended Prospectus contemplated by _Section
2.5(a)(iv)_, or until such Holder is advised in writing by Arris HoldCo that
the use of the Prospectus may be resumed, and has received copies of any
additional or supplemental filings that are incorporated by reference in the
Prospectus and, if so directed by Arris HoldCo, such Holder will deliver to
Arris HoldCo (at Arris HoldCos expense) all copies, other than
permanent file copies then in such Holders possession, of the Prospectus
covering such Registrable Securities which are current at the time of the
receipt of such notice. In the event that Arris HoldCo shall give any such
notice in respect of a Demand Registration, the period during which the
applicable Registration Statement is required to be maintained effective shall
be extended by the number of days during the period from and including the
date of the giving of such notice to and including 

 



12  the date when each seller of Registrable Securities covered by such
Registration Statement either receives the copies of the supplemented or
amended Prospectus contemplated by  _Section 2.5(a)(iv)_ or is advised in
writing by Arris HoldCo that the use of the Prospectus may be resumed.

2.6.  _Underwritten Offerings_.

(a) _Underwriting Agreements_. If requested by the underwriters for any
Underwritten Offering requested by Holders pursuant to _Section 2.1_ or
_Section 2.2_, Arris HoldCo and the Holders of Registrable Securities to be
included therein shall enter into an underwriting agreement with such
underwriters, such agreement to be reasonably satisfactory in substance and
form to Arris HoldCo, the Holders of a majority of each class of the
Registrable Securities to be included in such Underwritten Offering, Seller
and its Affiliates that are Holders, and the underwriters, and to contain
such terms and conditions as are generally prevailing in agreements of that
type, including, without limitation, indemnities no less favorable to the
recipient thereof than those provided in _Section 2.9_. The Holders of any
Registrable Securities to be included in any Underwritten Offering pursuant to
_Section 2.4_ shall, at Arris HoldCos request, enter into an underwriting
agreement that contains such terms and conditions as are generally prevailing
in agreements of that type, including, without limitation, indemnities no less
favorable to the recipient thereof than those provided in _Section 2.9_. All
of the representations and warranties by, and the other agreements on the
part of, Arris HoldCo to and for the benefit of such underwriters included in
each such underwriting agreement shall also be made to and for the benefit of
such Holders and any or all of the conditions precedent to the obligations of
such underwriters under such underwriting agreement be conditions precedent to
the obligations of such Holders. No Holder shall be required in any such
underwriting agreement to make any representations or warranties to or
agreements with Arris HoldCo or the underwriters other than representations,
warranties or agreements regarding such Holder, such Holders Registrable
Securities, such Holders intended method of distribution and any other
representations required by Law.

 

(b) _Price and Underwriting Discounts_. In the case of an Underwritten
Offering requested by Holders pursuant to  _Section 2.1_ or _Section 2.2_,
the price, underwriting discount and other financial terms for each class of
Registrable Securities of the related underwriting agreement shall be
determined by the Holders of a majority of such class of Registrable
Securities and Seller and its Affiliates that are Holders. In the case of any
Underwritten Offering pursuant to _Section 2.4_, such price, discount and
other terms shall be determined by Arris HoldCo, subject to the right of the
Holders to withdraw their request to participate in the registration pursuant
to _Section 2.4(a)(iii)_ after being advised of such price, discount and
other terms.

 

(c) _Participation in Underwritten Offerings_. No Person may participate in an
Underwritten Offering unless such Person (i) agrees to sell such Persons
securities on the basis provided in any underwriting arrangements approved by
the Persons entitled to approve such arrangements and (ii) completes and
executes all questionnaires, powers of attorney, indemnities, underwriting
agreements, lock-up agreements, and other documents required under the terms
of such underwriting arrangements.

 



13 (d) _Lock-Up Agreement_. Each Holder, that is having Registrable Securities
offered and sold in an Underwritten Offering pursuant to this Agreement,
agrees that in connection with such Underwritten Offering, upon the request of
the managing underwriter in such offering, such Holder will enter into a lock-
up agreement with the underwriters of such offering on customary terms
reasonably satisfactory to the managing underwriter.

2.7. _No Inconsistent Agreements_. Arris HoldCo is not currently a party to,
and during the term of this Agreement will not enter into, any agreement which
is inconsistent in any material respect with the rights granted to the Holders
of Registrable Securities by this Agreement.

2.8. _Registration Expenses_. (a) Arris HoldCo shall pay all of the expenses
set forth in this paragraph (a) in connection with a registration under this
Agreement of Registrable Securities. Such expenses are (i) all registration

this Agreement shall bear such Holders proportionate share (based on the
total number of Registrable Shares sold in such registration) of all discounts
and commissions payable to underwriters or brokers and all transfer taxes in
connection with a registration of Registrable Shares pursuant to
this Agreement.

 



14 2.9. _Indemnification_.

 

(a) _Indemnification by Arris HoldCo_. Arris HoldCo agrees to indemnify and
hold harmless, to the full extent permitted by Law, each Holder of
Registrable Securities and their respective officers, directors, advisors,
managers, agents and employees and each Person who controls (within the
meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act) such Persons, and their
respective officers, directors, advisors, managers, agents and employees,
from and against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities (or actions
or proceedings in respect thereof, whether or not such indemnified party is a
party thereto) and expenses (including reasonable costs of investigation and
legal expenses) (each, a " _Loss_ " and collectively " _Losses_ "), joint or
several, arising out of or based upon (i) any untrue or alleged untrue
statement of a material fact contained in any Registration Statement under
which such Registrable Securities were registered under the Securities Act
(including any final, preliminary or summary Prospectus contained therein or
any amendment thereof or supplement thereto or any documents incorporated by
reference therein), or (ii) any omission or alleged omission to state therein
a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein (in the case of a Prospectus or preliminary Prospectus, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made) not misleading;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Arris HoldCo shall not be liable to any
indemnified party in any such case to the extent that any such Loss arises
out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or
omission or alleged omission made in any such Registration Statement in
reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to Arris
HoldCo by such Holder expressly for use in the preparation thereof. This
indemnity shall be in addition to any liability Arris HoldCo may otherwise
have. Such indemnity shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any
investigation made by or on behalf of such Holder or any indemnified party
and shall survive the transfer of such securities by such Holder. Arris HoldCo
will also indemnify, if applicable and if requested, underwriters, selling
brokers, dealer managers and similar securities industry professionals
participating in any distribution pursuant hereto, their officers and
directors and each Person who controls such Persons (within the meaning of the
Securities Act and the Exchange Act) on substantially the same basis as
provided above with respect to the indemnification of the Indemnified
Persons.

(b) _Indemnification by the Holders_. Each selling Holder of Registrable
Securities agrees (severally and not jointly) to indemnify and hold harmless,
to the full extent permitted by law, Arris HoldCo, its directors and officers
and each Person who controls Arris HoldCo (within the meaning of
the Securities Act and the Exchange Act) from and against any Losses
resulting from any untrue statement of a material fact or any omission of a
material fact required to be stated in the Registration Statement under which
such Registrable Securities were registered under the Securities Act
(including any final, preliminary or summary Prospectus contained therein or
any amendment thereof or supplement thereto or any documents incorporated by
reference therein), or necessary to make the statements therein (in the case
of a Prospectus or preliminary Prospectus, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made) not misleading, to the extent, but only to the extent,
that such untrue statement or omission had been contained in any information
furnished in writing by such selling Holder to Arris HoldCo specifically for
inclusion in such Registration Statement. In no event shall the liability of
any selling Holder of Registrable Securities hereunder be greater in
amount than the dollar amount of the net proceeds received by such Holder,
after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions, but before expenses,
under the sale of the Registrable Securities giving rise to such
indemnification obligation.

  



15 (c) _Conduct of Indemnification Proceedings_. Any Person entitled to
indemnification hereunder will (i) give prompt written notice to the
indemnifying party of any claim with respect to which it seeks indemnification
( _provided_ , _however_ , that any delay or failure to so notify the
indemnifying party shall relieve the indemnifying party of its obligations
hereunder only to the extent, if at all, that it is actually and materially
prejudiced by reason of such delay or failure) and (ii) permit such
indemnifying party to assume the defense of such claim with counsel
reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that any Person entitled to indemnification hereunder shall have the right to
select and employ separate counsel and to participate in the defense of such
claim, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of
such Person unless (A) the indemnifying party has agreed in writing to pay
such fees or expenses, (B) the indemnifying party shall have failed to assume
the defense of such claim within a reasonable time after having received
notice of such claim from the Person entitled to indemnification hereunder and
to employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to such Person, (C) in the
reasonable judgment of any such Person, based upon advice of its counsel, a
conflict of interest may exist between such Person and the indemnifying party
with respect to such claims or (D) the indemnified party has reasonably
concluded (based on advice of counsel) that there may be legal defenses
available to it or other indemnified parties that are different from or in
addition to those available to the indemnifying party (in which case, if the
Person notifies the indemnifying party in writing that such Person elects to
employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party, the
indemnifying party shall not have the right to assume the defense of such
claim on behalf of such Person). If such defense is not assumed by the
indemnifying party, the indemnifying party will not be subject to any
liability for any settlement made without its consent, but such consent may
not be unreasonably withheld; _provided_ , _however_ , that an indemnifying
party shall not be required to consent to any settlement involving the
imposition of equitable remedies or involving the imposition of any material
obligations on such indemnifying party other than financial obligations for
which such indemnified party will be indemnified hereunder. If
the indemnifying party assumes the defense, the indemnifying party shall not
have the right to settle such action without the consent of the indemnified
party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that such consent shall not be required if the settlement does
not include any admission of wrongdoing by, and imposes no liability or
obligation on, the indemnified party. No indemnifying party shall consent to
entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement which does not include as
an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to each
indemnified party of an unconditional release from all liability in respect to
such claim or litigation. The indemnifying party or parties shall not, in
connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same
jurisdiction, be liable for the reasonable fees, disbursements and other
charges of more than one separate firm (together with one firm of local
counsel) at any one time from all such indemnified party or parties unless
(x) the employment of more than one counsel has been authorized in writing by
the indemnifying party or parties, (y) a conflict or potential conflict exists
or may exist (based on advice of counsel to an indemnified party) between
such indemnified party and the other indemnified parties or (z) an indemnified
party has reasonably concluded (based on advice of counsel) that there may be
legal defenses available to it that are different from or in addition to
those available to the other indemnified parties, in each of which cases the
indemnifying party shall be obligated to pay the reasonable fees and expenses
of such additional counsel (but in any event no more than one separate
counsel).

 



16 (d) _Contribution_. If the indemnification provided for in the paragraphs (a)
and (b) of this _Section 2.9_ is held by a court or government agency of
competent jurisdiction to be unavailable to any indemnified party or
insufficient to hold it harmless as contemplated by paragraphs (a) and (b) of
this  _Section 2.9_, then the indemnifying party shall contribute to the
amount paid or payable by the indemnified party as a result of such Loss in
such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the
indemnifying party on the one hand and the indemnified party on the other.
The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things,
whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the
omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information
supplied by the indemnifying party or the indemnified party and the parties
relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct
or prevent such untrue statement or omission. Notwithstanding anything in
this _Section 2.9(d)_ to the contrary, no indemnifying party (other than
Arris HoldCo) shall be required pursuant to this _Section 2.9(d)_ to
contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the net
proceeds, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions, but before
expenses, received by such indemnifying party from the sale of Registrable
Securities in the offering to which the Losses of the indemnified parties
relate exceeds the amount of any damages which such indemnifying party has
otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue statement or omission.
The parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if
contribution pursuant to this _Section 2.9(d)_ were determined by _pro rata_
allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of
the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding
paragraph. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the
meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to
contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent
misrepresentation. If indemnification is available under this _Section
2.9_, the indemnifying parties shall indemnify each indemnified party to the
full extent provided in _Section 2.9(a)_ and _Section 2.9(b)_ hereof without
regard to the relative fault of said indemnifying parties or indemnified
party. 

(e) The provisions of this _Section 2.09_ shall be in addition to any other
rights to indemnification or contribution that an indemnified party may have
pursuant to Law, equity, contract or otherwise.

2.10. _Rules 144 and 144A_. Arris HoldCo covenants that it will file the
reports required to be filed by it under the Securities Act and the Exchange
Act and the rules and regulations adopted by the SEC thereunder (or, if Arris
HoldCo is not required to file such reports, it will, upon the request of not
less than a majority of the Holders of Registrable Securities or of Seller or
any of its Affiliates that are Holders after the transfer date, make publicly
available other information so long as necessary to permit sales pursuant to
Rule 144 or 144A under the Securities Act, and it will take such further
action as not less than a majority of the Holders of Registrable Securities or
Seller or any of its Affiliates that are Holders may reasonably request, all
to the extent required from time to time to enable such Holders to sell
Registrable Securities without registration under the Securities Act within
the limitation of the exemptions provided by (i) Rule 144 or 144A or
Regulation S under the Securities Act, as such Rules may be amended from time
to time, or (ii) any similar rule or regulation hereafter adopted by the SEC.
Upon the request of any Holder of Registrable Securities, Arris HoldCo will
deliver to such Holder a written statement as to whether it has complied with
such requirements and, if not, the specifics thereof.

 



17 ARTICLE 3. MISCELLANEOUS

 

3.1. _Term_. This Agreement shall terminate upon the later of (i) the date as
of which all of the Registrable Securities have been sold pursuant to a
Registration Statement (but in no event prior to the applicable period
referred to in Section 4(3) of the Securities Act and Rule 174 thereunder) and
(ii) the date as of which the Holders no longer hold any Registrable
Securities. The provisions of _Section 2.9_ and _Section 2.10_ shall survive
any termination.

 

3.2. _Injunctive Relief_. It is hereby agreed and acknowledged that it will be
impossible to measure in money the damages that would be suffered if the
parties fail to comply with any of the obligations herein imposed on them and
that in the event of any such failure, an aggrieved Person will be irreparably
damaged and will not have an adequate remedy at Law. Any such Person shall,
therefore, be entitled (in addition to any other remedy to which it may be
entitled in Law or in equity) to injunctive relief, including, without
limitation, specific performance, to enforce such obligations, and if any
action should be brought in equity to enforce any of the provisions of this
Agreement, none of the parties hereto shall raise the defense that there is an
adequate remedy at Law.

3.3. _Notices_. All notices, requests, claims, demands and other
communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be given or made (and
shall be deemed to have been duly given or made upon receipt) by delivery in
person, by overnight courier service, by facsimile, or by registered or
certified mail (postage prepaid, return receipt requested) to the respective
Persons at the following addresses (or at such other address for a party
as shall be specified in a notice given in accordance with this _Section

Holder under this Agreement with respect to any Registrable Securities may be
transferred and assigned, _provided_ , _however_ , that no such assignment
shall be binding upon or obligate Arris HoldCo to any such assignee unless and
until Arris HoldCo shall have received, as a condition to the effectiveness
of such assignment, an executed counterpart of this Agreement whereby such
assignee has agreed to be treated as a Holder for all purposes of this
Agreement. Any transfer or assignment made other than as provided in the
first sentence of this _Section 3.4_ shall be null and void.

(b) This Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of
the parties hereto, and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

3.5. _Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction_.

(a) This Agreement and any dispute arising out of or relating to or in
connection with this Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the Laws of the State of New York.

(b) To the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, each party hereto (i)
agrees that any claim, action or proceeding by such party seeking any relief
whatsoever arising out of, relating to or in connection with, this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be brought only in the United
States District Court for the Southern District of New York or in any New York
State court, in each case, located in the Borough of Manhattan and not in any
other State or Federal court in the United States of America or any court in
any other country, (ii) agrees to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of such
courts located in the Borough of Manhattan for purposes of all legal
proceedings arising out of, or in connection with, this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, (iii) waives and agrees not to assert any
objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any
such Action brought in such a court and 

 



19  any claim that any such Action brought in such a court has been brought in
an inconvenient forum, (iv) agrees that mailing of process or other papers in
connection with any such action or proceeding in the manner provided in
_Section 3.3_ or any other manner as may be permitted by Law shall be valid
and sufficient service thereof and (v) agrees that a final judgment in any
such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by
applicable Law.

3.6.  _Headings_. The headings contained in this Agreement are for reference
purposes only and shall not in any way affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement.

 

3.7. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, together with the Acquisition
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, constitutes the entire agreement of
the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior
agreements and undertakings, both written and oral, between Seller and Arris
HoldCo with respect to the subject matter hereof.

 

3.8. _Construction of Agreements_. Notwithstanding any other provisions in
this Agreement to the contrary, in the event and to the extent that there
shall be a conflict between the provisions of this Agreement and the
Acquisition Agreement, the provisions of the Acquisition Agreement shall
control.

3.9. _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any applicable Law or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not fundamentally
changed. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties shall negotiate
in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of
the parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order
that the transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as originally
contemplated to the greatest extent possible.

3.10. _Amendment; Waiver_.

(a) This Agreement may not be amended or modified and waivers and consents to
departures from the provisions hereof may not be given, except by an
instrument or instruments in writing making specific reference to this
Agreement and signed by Arris HoldCo, the Holders of a majority of Registrable
Securities of each class then outstanding and, if Seller or any of its
Affiliates are Holders, by Seller or such Affiliate. Each Holder of any
Registrable Securities at the time or thereafter outstanding shall be bound by
any amendment, modification, waiver or consent authorized by this  _Section
3.10(a)_, whether or not such Registrable Securities shall have been marked
accordingly.

obligations or other acts of the other party, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in
the representations and warranties contained herein or in any document
delivered pursuant to this Agreement or (iii) waive compliance with any of
the agreements or conditions contained herein. Any failure to assert, or delay
in the assertion of, rights under this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver
of those rights.

 



20 3.11. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, and by the different parties in separate counterparts, each of
which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken
together shall constitute one and the same agreement. Delivery of an executed
counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by facsimile or other
electronic means (including portable document format) shall be as effective as
delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.

 

3.12. _Waiver of Jury Trial_. Each party hereby waives, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law, any right it may have to a trial by jury in
respect to any litigation, directly or indirectly, arising out of or relating
to this Agreement or any transaction contemplated by this Agreement. Each
party (a) certifies that no representative, agent or attorney of any other
party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other party would
not, in the event of litigation, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver and (b)
acknowledges that it and the other parties have been induced to enter into
this Agreement by, among other things, the mutual waivers and certifications
in this _Section 3.12_.

3.13. _No Presumption_. The parties to this Agreement agree that this
Agreement was negotiated fairly between them at arms length and that the
final terms of this Agreement are the product of the parties negotiations.
Each party represents and warrants that it has sought and received legal
counsel of its own choosing with regard to the contents of this Agreement and
the rights and obligations affected hereby. The parties agree that this
Agreement shall be deemed to have been jointly and equally drafted by them,
and that the provisions of this Agreement therefore should not be construed
against a party or parties on the grounds that the party or parties drafted or
was more responsible for drafting the provisions.

 



21 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Agreement to be duly
executed as of the date first written above.
