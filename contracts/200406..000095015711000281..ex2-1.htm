waiver (where permissible) of the conditions set forth in Article VIII (other

stock of Merger Sub shall be converted into and become one validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving

Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each Person who was, at
the Effective Time, a holder of record of Shares entitled to receive the
Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.04(a): (A) a letter of transmittal
(which shall be in customary form and shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Shares shall be deemed to pass,
only upon proper delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof together with the required indemnity) or transfer of the Book-Entry
Shares to the Exchange Agent) and (B) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates or transfer of the Book-Entry Shares pursuant to
such letter of transmittal.

  

  

(ii) Upon (A) surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate for
cancellation, together with such letter of transmittal properly completed and
validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, or (B) receipt
by the Exchange Agent of an "agent's message" in the case of Book-Entry Shares
and, in each case, such other documents as may be required pursuant to such

exchange therefor cash in the amount equal to the Cash Consideration that such
holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.04(a) and this Article
III, book-entry shares representing the Stock Consideration that such holder
has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.04(a) and this Article III,

entitled to receive pursuant to Section 3.01(e) and any dividends or other
distributions such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to Section 3.01(c);
and the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares so surrendered shall forthwith be
cancelled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares which is not
registered in the transfer records of the Company, cash in the amount equal to
the Cash Consideration that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to
Section 2.04(a) and this Article III, book-entry shares representing the Stock

or Book-Entry Shares representing such Shares are presented to the Exchange
Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such
transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock transfer Taxes have been
paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by Section 2.04(a) and this Section
3.01, each Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at all times after
the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender,
in each case, without interest, the Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of any
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock the holder of such Certificate or
Book-Entry Share is entitled to receive pursuant to Section 3.01(e) and any
dividends or other distributions such holder is entitled to receive pursuant
to Section 3.01(c).

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

14  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

 

(c) Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares of Parent Common Stock.
No dividends or other distributions declared or made with a record date after
the Effective Time with respect to the Parent Common Stock (and no cash
payment in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to
Section 3.03(e)) shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate
or Book-Entry Share until the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share
shall surrender such Certificate or Book-Entry Share in accordance with
Section 3.01(b). Subject to the effect of escheat, Tax or other applicable
Laws, following surrender of any such Certificate or Book-Entry Share in
accordance with Section 3.01(b), there shall be paid to the record holder of
shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest,
at the appropriate payment date (or, if previously paid, promptly), the amount
of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective
Time but prior to surrender payable with respect to such shares of Parent
Common Stock and the amount of any cash payable in lieu of fractional shares
of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 3.03(e).

  

  

(d) No Further Rights in Company Common Stock. All Merger Consideration issued
or paid upon surrender of Certificates or transfer of Book-Entry Shares in
accordance with the terms of this Article III (including any cash paid
pursuant to Section 3.01(c) or Section 3.01(e)) shall be deemed to have been
issued or paid, as the case may be, in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to the Shares formerly represented by such Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares.

  

  

(e) No Fractional Shares. No certificates or scrip representing fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock or book-entry credit of the same shall be issued
upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, and such
fractional share interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to
any other rights (including the right to receive dividends or other
distributions of Parent) of a stockholder of Parent. Each holder of a
fractional share interest (after taking into account all fractional share
interests held by such holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof, an amount in
cash (without interest, rounded down to the nearest whole cent and subject to
the amount of any withholding Taxes as contemplated in Section 3.01(i)) equal
to the product obtained by multiplying (i) such fractional share interest to
which such holder (after taking into account all fractional share interests
then held by such holder) would otherwise be entitled by (ii) the Average
Parent Stock Price. The parties hereto acknowledge that payment of the cash
consideration in lieu of issuing fractional shares is not separately
bargained-for consideration but merely represents a mechanical rounding off
for purposes of avoiding the expense and inconvenience to Parent that would
otherwise be caused by the issuance of fractional shares.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

15  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

(f) Adjustments to Exchange Ratio. The Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted to
reflect appropriately the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split,
stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities of a
Subsidiary of Parent or the Company or of securities convertible into Parent
Common Stock or Company Common Stock), extraordinary cash dividends,
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of
shares or other like change with respect to Parent Common Stock or Company
Common Stock with a record date occurring on or after the date hereof and
prior to the Effective Time.

  

  

(g) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including
proceeds of any investment thereof) that remains undistributed to the holders
of Shares on the date that is six months after the Effective Time shall be
delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any holders of Shares who have not
theretofore complied with this Article III shall thereafter look only to
Parent for the Merger Consideration to which they are entitled pursuant to
Section 2.04(a), any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock
to which they are entitled pursuant to Section 3.01(e) and any dividends or
other distributions with respect to the Parent Common Stock to which they are
entitled pursuant to Section 3.01(c).

  

  

(h) No Liability. None of the Exchange Agent, Parent or the Surviving
Corporation shall be liable to any holder of Shares for any Merger
Consideration from the Exchange Fund (or dividends or distributions with
respect to Parent Common Stock) or other cash delivered to a public official
pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Any portion of the
Exchange Fund remaining unclaimed by holders of Shares as of a date which is
immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or
become property of any Governmental Authority shall, to the extent permitted
by applicable Law, become the property of Parent free and clear of any claims
or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

  

  

(i) Withholding Rights. Each of the Surviving Corporation, the Exchange Agent,
Parent and Merger Sub shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amount as it is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code, the rules or regulations promulgated thereunder, any provision
of applicable state, local or foreign Tax Law or any other Law. To the extent
that amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made.

  

  

(j) Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent,
the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent may
direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with
respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration with
respect to the Shares formerly represented by such Certificate to which the
holder thereof is entitled pursuant to Section 2.04(a), any cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which the holder thereof is
entitled pursuant to Section 3.01(e) and any dividends or other distributions
to which the holder thereof is entitled pursuant to Section 3.01(c).

  

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

16  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

Section 3.02 Stock Transfer Books. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer
books of the Company shall be closed and there shall be no further
registration of transfers of Shares thereafter on the records of the Company.
On or after the Effective Time, any Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
presented to the Exchange Agent or Parent for any reason shall be cancelled
and exchanged for the Merger Consideration with respect to the Shares formerly
represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares to which the holders
thereof are entitled pursuant to Section 2.04(a), any cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which the holders of such
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are entitled pursuant to Section 3.01(e) and
any dividends or other distributions to which the holders thereof are entitled
pursuant to Section 3.01(c).

  

  

 

Section 3.03 Company Stock Options and Company Restricted Stock Awards. (a)
Company Stock Options. As of the Effective Time, each outstanding Company
Stock Option shall be cancelled, and each holder of a Company Stock Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be entitled to receive an amount
of cash, without interest, equal to the product of (i) the total number of
Shares subject to such Company Stock Option multiplied by (ii) the excess, if
any, of (A) the sum of (x) the Cash Consideration and (y) the product of the
Exchange Ratio (as determined in accordance with Section 2.04(a)) multiplied
by the Average Parent Stock Price (such sum, the "Total Option Value") over
(B) the exercise price per Share of such Company Stock Option (with the
aggregate amount of such payment to the holder to be rounded down to the
nearest cent), less applicable withholding taxes, if any, required to be
withheld with respect to such payment. No holder of a Company Stock Option
that has an exercise price per Share that is equal to or greater than the
Total Option Value shall be entitled to any payment with respect to such
cancelled Company Stock Option before or after the Effective Time.

  

  

(b) Company Restricted Stock Awards. As of the Effective Time, each
outstanding Company Restricted Stock Award the restrictions of which have not
lapsed immediately prior to the Effective Time shall become fully vested and
the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive, without any interest thereon,
the Merger Consideration in accordance with Articles II and III hereof, less
applicable withholding taxes, if any, required to be withheld with respect to
such payment.

  

  

Section 3.04 Appraisal Rights. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, any Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time and are held by a stockholder (each, a "Dissenting
Stockholder") who is entitled to exercise, and properly exercises, dissenter's
rights with respect to such shares pursuant to, and who complies in all
respects with, the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL (collectively, the
"Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into or exchangeable for or
represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration (except as provided in
this Section 3.04) and shall entitle such Dissenting Stockholder only to
payment of the fair value of such Dissenting Shares as may be determined to be
due to the holder of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with Section 262 of
the DGCL, unless and until such Dissenting Stockholder withdraws (in
accordance with Section 262(k) of the DGCL) or effectively loses (through
failure to perfect or otherwise) the right to appraisal. If any Dissenting
Stockholder shall have effectively withdrawn (in accordance with Section
262(k) of the DGCL) or lost (through failure to perfect or otherwise) the
right to appraisal, then as of the later of the Effective Time or the
occurrence of such event, the Dissenting Shares held by such Dissenting
Stockholder shall be cancelled and converted into and represent the right to
receive, without any interest thereon, the Merger Consideration in accordance
with Articles II and III hereof, less applicable withholding taxes, if any,
required to be withheld. From and after the Effective Time, Dissenting Shares
shall not be entitled to vote for any purpose or be entitled to the payment of
dividends or other distributions (except dividends or other distributions
payable to stockholders of record prior to the Effective Time). The Company
shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make
(or cause or permit to be made on its behalf) any payment with respect to, or
settle or offer to settle, or otherwise negotiate with, any Dissenting
Stockholder regarding its exercise of dissenter's rights prior to the
Effective Time. The Company shall give Parent notice of any such demands prior
to the Effective Time, and Parent shall have the right to participate in and
control all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any exercise by any
stockholder of dissenter's rights.

Section 3.05 Tax Treatment. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agree and
acknowledge that the Merger will be treated as a taxable purchase of the
Shares for the Merger Consideration (and not as a "reorganization" described
in Section 368(a) of the Code) for United States federal income tax purposes.

  

  

ARTICLE IV

  

  

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

  

  

As an inducement to Parent and Merger Sub to enter into this Agreement, except
as set forth in the Company Disclosure Schedule (it being agreed that
disclosure of any item in any section of the Company Disclosure Schedule shall
be deemed disclosure with respect to any other section of this Agreement to
which the relevance of such disclosure is reasonably apparent on its face),
the Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub that:

  

  

Section 4.01 Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries. (a) Each of the
Company and each of its Subsidiaries is an entity duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its
organization and has the requisite corporate or similar power and authority
and all necessary governmental authorizations and approvals to own, lease and
operate its properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now
being conducted, except (i) with respect to the Company's Subsidiaries, where
the failure to be so organized, existing or in good standing or to have such
power, authority and governmental authorizations and approvals would not have
a Company Material Adverse Effect and (ii) with respect to the Company, where
the failure to have such governmental authorizations and approvals would not
have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company and each of its
Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed as a foreign corporation to do
business, and is in good standing, in each jurisdiction where the character of
the properties or assets owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of its
business makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except where the
failure to be so qualified or licensed and in good standing would not have a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

18  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

(b) A true and complete list of the Material Subsidiaries of the Company,
identifying the jurisdiction of incorporation or organization of each such
Material Subsidiary and the percentage of the outstanding capital stock or
other equity or similar interests of each such Material Subsidiary owned by
the Company, and each of its other Subsidiaries is set forth in Section
4.01(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

  

  

Section 4.02 Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws. The Company has made
available to Parent, prior to the execution of this Agreement, a complete and
correct copy of the Company's certificate of incorporation and bylaws and the
equivalent organizational documents of each Material Subsidiary, in each case,
as amended to the date of this Agreement. Such certificates of incorporation,
bylaws and equivalent organizational documents are in full force and effect.
Neither the Company nor any of its Material Subsidiaries is in violation of
any of the provisions of its certificate of incorporation, bylaws or
equivalent organizational documents.

  

  

Section 4.03 Capitalization. (a) The authorized capital stock of the Company

this Section 4.03, there are no issued, reserved for issuance or outstanding
shares of capital stock, voting securities or other equity interests of the
Company. Except as set forth in this Section 4.03, there are no options,
calls, warrants, convertible debt, other convertible or exchangeable

any shares of capital stock, voting securities or other equity interests of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any "phantom" stock, "phantom"
stock rights, stock appreciation rights, stock-based units or any other
similar interests issued by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. All Shares
subject to issuance as aforesaid, upon issuance on the terms and conditions
specified in the instruments pursuant to which they are issuable, will be duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable. There are no
outstanding contractual obligations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any capital stock, voting
securities or other equity interests or securities convertible into or
exchangeable or exercisable for capital stock, voting securities or other
equity interests of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or to provide funds
to, or make any investment (in the form of a loan, capital contribution or
otherwise) in, any Subsidiary of the Company or any other Person. All Company
Stock Options and Company Restricted Stock Awards are evidenced by stock
option agreements, restricted stock agreements or other award agreements, in
each case, in the forms made available to Parent by the Company, and no stock
option agreement, restricted stock agreement or other award agreement contains
terms that are inconsistent with such forms. After the Closing, no holder of a
Company Stock Option or Company Restricted Stock Award (or former holder of a
Company Stock Option or Company Restricted Stock Award) or any current or
former participant in the Company Stock Plans or any other Plan shall have the
right thereunder to acquire any capital stock of Parent, the Company or the
Surviving Corporation or any other equity interest therein (including
"phantom" stock, "phantom" stock rights, stock appreciation rights, stock-

each Subsidiary of the Company is duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid
and non-assessable, and each such share or interest is owned by the Company or
another of its wholly owned Subsidiaries free and clear of all Encumbrances.

stock of, or other equity or similar interest in, any corporation,
partnership, joint venture, association or other entity.

  

  

(c) As of the date of this Agreement, no bonds, debentures, notes or other
Indebtedness of the Company having the right to vote (or convertible into or
exercisable for securities having the right to vote) on any matters on which
stockholders of the Company may vote are issued or outstanding. Neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any voting contract with
respect to the voting of any such securities.

or properties is bound or affected, except, with respect to clauses (ii) and

federal, state or supranational antitrust, competition, fair trade or similar
Laws and the filing and recordation of the Certificate of Merger as required

Subsidiaries (i) as of the date of this Agreement, has in effect all material
Company Permits and (ii) as of the Closing Date, will hold in effect all
Company Permits, except, in the case of this clause (ii), where the failure to
possess any of the Company Permits would not have a Company Material Adverse
Effect. As of the date of this Agreement, no suspension or cancellation of any
of the material Company Permits is pending or, to the knowledge of the
Company, threatened in writing. As of the Closing Date, no suspension or
cancellation of any of the Company Permits will be pending or, to the
knowledge of the Company, threatened in writing, except where the failure to

with, or in default, breach or violation of, any Law or Company Permit
applicable to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or by which any property

Subsidiaries, the Surviving Corporation or any other Person in the event that

business, and is in good standing, in each jurisdiction where the character of
the properties or assets owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of its
business makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except where the

business, Person or division thereof, if the entering into of a definitive

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

  

  

Section 7.01 Registration Statement; Proxy Statement. (a) As promptly as
practicable after the execution of this Agreement, Parent and the Company

Company Stockholders' Meeting and (ii) a registration statement on Form S-4
(together with all amendments thereto, the "Registration Statement"), and
Parent shall file with the SEC the Registration Statement, in which the Proxy
Statement shall be included as a prospectus, in connection with the
registration under the Securities Act of the shares of Parent Common Stock to
be issued to the stockholders of the Company pursuant to the Merger. Parent
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Registration Statement to
become effective as promptly as practicable and to keep the Registration
Statement effective as long as necessary to consummate the Transactions. Each
of Parent and the Company shall furnish all information concerning itself as
the other may reasonably request in connection with such actions and the
preparation of the Registration Statement and the Proxy Statement. As promptly
as practicable after the Registration Statement shall have become effective,
the Company shall mail the Proxy Statement to its stockholders.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

45  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

(b) No amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement or the Registration
Statement will be made by Parent or the Company without providing the other
party a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon. Parent will
advise the Company promptly after receiving oral or written notice of (i) the
time when the Registration Statement has become effective or any supplement or

any stop order, (iii) the suspension of the qualification for offering or sale
in any jurisdiction of the Parent Common Stock issuable in connection with the
Merger, or (iv) any oral or written request by the SEC for amendment of the

additional information. Parent shall promptly provide the Company with copies
of any written communication from the SEC and the Company shall cooperate with
Parent's preparation of appropriate responses thereto (and Parent will provide
the Company with copies of any such responses given to the SEC) and
modifications to the Registration Statement as shall be reasonably
appropriate.

  

  

(c) Parent represents and warrants to the Company that the information
supplied by Parent for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the
Registration Statement and the Proxy Statement shall not at (i) the time the
Registration Statement is declared effective, (ii) the time the Proxy
Statement (or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto) is first mailed to
the stockholders of the Company and (iii) the time of the Company
Stockholders' Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading. If, at any time prior to the Effective Time, any
information relating to Parent or Merger Sub, or their respective Affiliates
or Representatives, shall be discovered by Parent or the Company which should
be set forth in an amendment or a supplement to the Registration Statement or
the Proxy Statement so that either such document would not include any
misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading, the party which discovers such information shall
promptly inform the other party and an appropriate amendment or supplement
describing such information shall promptly be filed with the SEC and, to the
extent required by Law, disseminated to the stockholders of the Company. All
documents that Parent is responsible for filing with the SEC in connection
with the Transactions will comply as to form and substance in all material
respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act.

(d) The Company represents and warrants to Parent that the information
supplied by the Company for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the

Registration Statement is declared effective, (ii) the time the Proxy
Statement (or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto) is first mailed to
the stockholders of the Company and (iii) the time of the Company
Stockholders' Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order

respective Affiliates or Representatives, shall be discovered by the Company
or Parent which should be set forth in an amendment or a supplement to the
Registration Statement or the Proxy Statement so that either such document
would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party which
discovers such information shall promptly inform the other party and an
appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall promptly

stockholders of the Company.

  

  

Section 7.02 Company Stockholders' Meeting. Subject to Section 7.03(d), the
Company shall (a) take all lawful action to call, give notice of, convene and
hold the Company Stockholders' Meeting as promptly as practicable for the
purpose of obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval and (b) solicit from its
stockholders proxies in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and shall take
all other action necessary or advisable to secure the Company Stockholder
Approval. Subject to Section 7.03(d), the Company shall, through the Company
Board, recommend to its stockholders adoption of this Agreement and shall
include such recommendation in the Proxy Statement. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the Company's obligations pursuant to clause (a)
of the first sentence of this Section 7.02 shall not be affected by the
commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or communication to the
Company of any Competing Proposal or any Change in the Company Recommendation.

  

  

Section 7.03 No Solicitation of Transactions. (a) The Company agrees that
neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any of their respective
Representatives will, and that it will cause each of its Subsidiaries and each
of its and its Subsidiaries' Representatives not to, directly or indirectly,
(i) solicit, initiate or take any other action to facilitate or knowingly
encourage any Competing Proposal, (ii) enter into, maintain, continue or
participate in any discussions or negotiations with any Person or entity in
furtherance of, or furnish to any Person any information with respect to, any
Competing Proposal, (iii) agree to, approve, endorse, recommend or consummate
any Competing Proposal, (iv) enter into any Competing Transaction Agreement,
(v) take any action to approve a third party becoming an "interested
stockholder", or to approve any transaction, for purposes of Section 203 of
the DGCL or (vi) resolve, propose or agree, or authorize or permit any
Representative, to do any of the foregoing. Without limiting the foregoing, it
is agreed that any violation of the restrictions set forth in the preceding
sentence by any Representative of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall
be deemed to be a breach of this Section 7.03(a) by the Company. The Company
shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and its Subsidiaries'
Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated all existing
discussions or negotiations with any Persons conducted prior to the execution
of this Agreement by the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or its or any of
their respective Representatives with respect to any Competing Proposal and
request the prompt return or destruction of all confidential information
previously furnished.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

47  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

(b) The Company shall promptly advise Parent orally and in writing of any
Competing Proposal or any bona fide inquiry relating to or that could
reasonably be expected to lead to any Competing Proposal, the financial and
other material terms and conditions of any such Competing Proposal or bona
fide inquiry (including any changes thereto) and the identity of the Person
making any such Competing Proposal or bona fide inquiry. The Company shall (i)
keep Parent fully informed of the status and material details (including any
change to the terms thereof) of any such Competing Proposal or bona fide
inquiry and (ii) provide to Parent, as soon as reasonably practicable after
receipt or delivery thereof, with copies of all correspondence (other than
non-substantive written correspondence) and other written material (including
all draft and final versions (and any amendments thereto) of agreements
(including schedules and exhibits thereto) and any comments thereon) relating
to any such Competing Proposal or bona fide inquiry exchanged between the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (or their Representatives), on the one
hand, and the Person making such Competing Proposal or bona fide inquiry (or
its Representatives), on the other hand.

  

  

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, at any time
prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company may,
subject to compliance with Section 7.03(b), furnish information to, and enter
into discussions with, a Person who has made, after the date hereof, an
unsolicited, written, bona fide Competing Proposal so long as such Competing
Proposal did not result from a breach of this Section 7.03 and, prior to
furnishing such information and entering into such discussions, the Company
Board has (i) reasonably determined, in its good faith judgment (after having
received the advice of a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation
and outside legal counsel) that (A) such Competing Proposal constitutes, or is
reasonably likely to lead to, a Superior Proposal and (B) the failure to
furnish such information to, or enter into such discussions with, the Person
who made such Competing Proposal would be inconsistent with the Company
Board's fiduciary duties to the Company and its stockholders under applicable
Law, (ii) provided all such information to Parent (or provides such
information to Parent substantially concurrent with the time it is provided to
such Person), and (iii) obtained from such Person an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement.

  

  

(d) Except as set forth in this Section 7.03(d), neither the Company Board nor
any committee thereof shall (i) (A) withdraw, qualify, modify or amend, or
propose publicly to withdraw, qualify, modify or amend, the Company
Recommendation or (B) adopt or recommend, or propose publicly to adopt or
recommend, any Competing Proposal or (ii) make any public statement
inconsistent with the Company Recommendation (any of the actions described in
the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii), a "Change in the Company Recommendation").
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if at any time prior to the receipt of the
Company Stockholder Approval and subject to compliance with Section 7.03(b),
the Company Board determines in its good faith judgment (after having received
the advice of a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation and
outside legal counsel) that the failure of the Company Board to make a Change
in the Company Recommendation would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties
of the Company Board to the Company and its stockholders under applicable Law,
then the Company Board may make a Change in the Company Recommendation;
provided, however, that no Change in the Company Recommendation may be made
that relates to a Competing Proposal unless such Competing Proposal
constitutes a Superior Proposal; provided further that the Company shall not
be entitled to exercise its right to make a Change in the Company
Recommendation until after the fifth Business Day following Parent's receipt
of written notice from the Company advising Parent that the Company Board
intends to make a Change in the Company Recommendation (a "Notice of Adverse
Recommendation") and specifying the reasons therefor, including the terms and
conditions of any Superior Proposal (it being understood and agreed that any
amendment to the financial terms or any other material term of such Superior
Proposal shall require a new Notice of Adverse Recommendation and a new notice
period, which shall be a two Business Day period). The Company agrees that,
during the applicable five or two Business Day notice period prior to the
Company Board making a Change in the Company Recommendation, the Company and
its Representatives shall negotiate in good faith with Parent and its
Representatives regarding any revisions to the terms of this Agreement
proposed by Parent. In determining whether to make a Change in the Company
Recommendation, the Company Board shall take into account any changes to the
financial terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent in response to a Notice
of Adverse Recommendation or otherwise.

  

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

48  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

(e) Any disclosure that the Company Board is required to make under applicable
Law will not constitute a violation of this Section 7.03; provided, however,
that neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall make a Change
in the Company Recommendation in connection with such disclosure.

  

  

Section 7.04 Access to Information; Confidentiality. (a) Except as otherwise
prohibited by applicable Law, from the date of this Agreement until the
Effective Time, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, (i)
provide to Parent and Parent's Representatives reasonable access at reasonable
times upon reasonable prior notice to the officers, employees and other
personnel, agents, properties, offices and other facilities of the Company and
its Subsidiaries and to the books and records thereof (including for purposes
of conducting regulatory compliance reviews and audits to allow Parent to be
in compliance with its policies and procedures and any applicable Law or Order
at the Effective Time); and (ii) furnish promptly to Parent such information
concerning the business, properties, contracts, assets, liabilities, personnel
and other aspects of the Company and its Subsidiaries as Parent or its
Representatives may reasonably request (including for purposes of conducting
regulatory compliance reviews and audits to allow Parent to be in compliance
with its policies and procedures and any applicable Law or Order at the
Effective Time); provided, however, that the Company shall not be required to
provide access to or disclose any such information to the extent such access
or disclosure would result in the loss of attorney-client privilege of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (provided that the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall use their reasonable best efforts to allow for such access
or disclosure in a manner that does not result in a loss of attorney-client
privilege).

  

  

(b) Except as otherwise prohibited by applicable Law, from the date of this
Agreement until the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, provide to the Company and the Company's Representatives
access at reasonable times upon prior notice to Parent's personnel and records
(i) on a basis consistent with the Company's access to such personnel and
records prior to the date hereof in connection with the Company's due
diligence review of Parent and its Subsidiaries in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby and (ii) to the extent reasonably necessary
for the Company to determine whether the conditions set forth in Section 8.03
are satisfied.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

49  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

(c) All information obtained by the parties hereto pursuant to this Section
7.04 shall be kept confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality
Agreement and the Parent Confidentiality Agreement.

  

  

(d) No investigation pursuant to this Section 7.04 shall affect any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement in this Agreement of any party
hereto or any condition to the obligations of the parties hereto.

  

  

Section 7.05 Employee Benefits Matters. From and after the Effective Time,
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, and the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall, honor in accordance with
their terms, all contracts, agreements, arrangements, policies, plans and
commitments of the Company and its Subsidiaries as in effect immediately prior
to the Effective Time that are applicable to any current or former employees
or directors of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company. For the period
beginning on the Closing Date and continuing through the first anniversary of
the Closing Date, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation and
its Subsidiaries to (in which case the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries shall), provide the employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries
who continue to be employed by the Company or the Surviving Corporation after
the Closing Date (collectively, the "Affected Employees") with a base salary
or wage rate, bonus opportunity (other than with respect to any participant in
the Company's Global Executive Incentive Compensation Plan as of the Closing
Date) and a level of employee benefit plans and arrangements (excluding any
equity-based compensation, defined benefit pension or post-employment health
or post-employment welfare benefits) that are no less favorable in the
aggregate than those provided to such Affected Employees immediately prior to
the Closing Date, and with respect to participants in the Company's Global
Executive Incentive Compensation Plan as of the Closing Date, a bonus
opportunity that is no less favorable in the aggregate than that provided to
similarly situated employees of Parent. Affected Employees shall receive
credit (a) for purposes of vesting under Parent's defined benefit pension
plan, (b) for purposes of eligibility and calculation of benefits for vacation
and paid time off under Parent's vacation and paid time off programs, (c) for
purposes of eligibility under any health or welfare plan maintained by Parent
(other than any post-employment health or post-employment welfare plan), (d)
for purposes of eligibility and vesting under Parent's 401(k) plan and (e)
unless covered under another arrangement with or of the Company, for purposes
of eligibility, vesting and calculation of benefits under Parent's severance
plan (in the case of each of clauses (a), (b), (c), (d) and (e), solely to the
extent that Parent makes such plan or program available to employees of the
Surviving Corporation and not in any case where credit would result in
duplication of benefits), but not for purposes of benefit accrual under any of
the foregoing employee benefit plans of Parent and not for purposes of
eligibility, vesting or benefit accrual under any other employee benefit plan
of Parent. Parent shall enroll the Affected Employees in the severance plans
of Parent, or a Subsidiary of Parent, at the same level of benefits as
similarly situated employees of Parent, except to the extent, and for so long
as, an Affected Employee is covered by another arrangement. In addition,
Parent shall waive, or cause to be waived, any limitations on benefits
relating to any pre-existing conditions to the extent such conditions are
covered immediately prior to the Effective Time under the applicable Plans and
to the same extent such limitations are waived under any comparable plan of
Parent or its Subsidiaries and recognize, for purposes of annual deductible
and out-of-pocket limits under its medical and dental plans, deductible and
out-of-pocket expenses paid by employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries
in the calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs. This Section 7.05
shall be binding upon and shall inure solely to the benefit of each of the
parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this Section 7.05, express or
implied, is intended to confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies of
any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Section 7.05. Nothing
contained herein shall be construed as requiring, and the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall take no action that would have the effect of requiring,
Parent or the Surviving Corporation to continue any specific plans, programs,
policies, arrangements, agreements or understandings. Furthermore, no
provision of this Agreement shall be construed as prohibiting or limiting the
ability of Parent or the Surviving Corporation to amend, modify or terminate
any plans, programs, policies, arrangements, agreements or understandings of
Parent, the Company, its Subsidiaries or the Surviving Corporation and nothing
therein shall be construed as an amendment to any such plan, program, policy,
arrangement, agreement or understanding for any purpose.

Section 7.06 Directors' and Officers' Indemnification and Insurance. (a)
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to assume the obligations with
respect to all rights to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities,
including advancement of expenses, for acts or omissions occurring at or prior
to the Effective Time now existing in favor of the current or former directors
or officers of the Company as provided in the certificate of incorporation and
bylaws of the Company or any indemnification contract between such directors
or officers and the Company (in each case, as in effect on the date hereof),
without further action, as of the Effective Time, and such obligations shall
survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance
with their terms. For the avoidance of doubt, the applicable rights of
indemnification and exculpation contemplated by this Section 7.06 and pursuant
to the terms of the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Company as
in effect at or prior to the Effective Time shall not be impaired by any
modification of such terms in any amendment or restatement of such certificate
of incorporation or bylaws following the Effective Time (including in
connection with the filing of the Certificate of Merger).

  

  

(b) Parent shall obtain, at the Effective Time, a prepaid (or "tail")
directors' and officers' liability insurance policy in respect of acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time for six years from the
Effective Time, covering each Person currently covered by the Company's
directors' and officers' liability insurance policies (a complete and accurate
copy of which has been heretofore made available to Parent), on terms with
respect to such coverage and amounts no less favorable than those of such
policy in effect on the date hereof; provided, however, that in no event shall
the Surviving Corporation be required to expend pursuant to this Section
7.06(b) an amount in excess of 300% of the last annual premium paid by the
Company for such insurance; provided, further, that, if the amount necessary
to procure such insurance coverage exceeds such maximum amount, Parent shall
only be obligated to provide as much coverage as may be obtained for such
maximum amount.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

51  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

(c) In the event the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving
Corporation, as the case may be, or at Parent's option, Parent, shall assume
the obligations set forth in this Section 7.06.

  

  

Section 7.07 Notification of Certain Matters. (a) The Company shall give
prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company,
of (i) the occurrence, or non-occurrence, of any change, event, fact or
development which would reasonably be expected to cause any of their
respective representations or warranties contained in this Agreement to become
untrue or inaccurate such that the conditions set forth in Section 8.02(a) or
Section 8.03(a) would not be satisfied and (ii) any failure of the Company,
Parent or Merger Sub, as the case may be, to comply with or satisfy any
covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under
this Agreement such that the conditions set forth in Section 8.02(b) or
Section 8.03(b) would not be satisfied; provided, however, that the delivery
of any notice pursuant to this Section 7.07 shall not limit or otherwise
affect the remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such notice.

  

  

(b) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give
prompt notice to the Company, of (i) any notice or other communication from
any Governmental Authority in connection with the Transactions or from any
Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in
connection with the Transactions and (ii) any Action commenced or, to its
knowledge, threatened in writing, relating to or involving or otherwise
affecting it or any of its Subsidiaries which, if pending on the date of this
Agreement, would have been required to have been disclosed pursuant to Article
IV or Article V, as applicable, or which relates to the consummation of the
Transactions.

  

  

Section 7.08 Reasonable Best Efforts; Further Action. (a) Parent, Merger Sub
and the Company shall use their reasonable best efforts to take or cause to be
taken all appropriate action, and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary or reasonably advisable under applicable Laws to consummate and make
effective the Transactions, including using their reasonable best efforts to
obtain, or cause to be obtained, all waivers, permits, consents, approvals,
authorizations, qualifications and Orders of all Governmental Authorities and
officials and parties to contracts with the Company and the Subsidiaries that
may be or become necessary for the performance of obligations pursuant to this
Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions and all parties hereto will
cooperate fully with the other parties hereto in promptly seeking to obtain
all such waivers, permits, consents, approvals, authorizations, qualifications
and Orders. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement,
each party hereto agrees to make any appropriate filings, if necessary or
advisable (in the opinion of Parent), pursuant to the HSR Act, the EU Merger
Regulation or other applicable foreign, federal, state or supranational
antitrust, competition, fair trade or similar Laws with respect to the
Transactions as promptly as practicable and to supply as promptly as
practicable and advisable to the appropriate Governmental Authorities any
additional information and documentary material that may be requested pursuant
to the HSR Act, the EU Merger Regulation or other applicable foreign, federal,
state or supranational antitrust, competition, fair trade or similar Laws. All
antitrust filings to be made shall be made in substantial compliance with the
requirements of the HSR Act, the EU Merger Regulation and other applicable
foreign, federal, state or supranational antitrust, competition, fair trade or
similar Laws, as applicable.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

52  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

(b) The parties hereto shall cooperate and assist one another in connection
with all actions to be taken pursuant to Section 7.08(a), including the
preparation and making of the filings referred to therein and, if requested,
amending or furnishing additional information hereunder. The Company shall use
its reasonable best efforts to provide or cause to be provided promptly to
Parent all necessary information and assistance as any Governmental Authority
may from time to time require in connection with obtaining the relevant
waivers, permits, consents, approvals, authorizations, qualifications, Orders
or expiration of waiting periods in relation to these filings or in connection
with any other review or investigation of the Transactions by a Governmental
Authority. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to provide or
cause to be provided promptly all assistance and cooperation to allow Parent
to prepare and submit any filings or submissions under the HSR Act, the EU
Merger Regulation or other applicable foreign, federal, state or supranational
antitrust, competition, fair trade or similar Laws, including providing to
Parent any information that Parent may from time to time require for the
purpose of any filing, notification, application or request for further
information made in respect of any such filing. Parent shall have the
principal responsibility for devising and implementing the strategy for
obtaining any necessary antitrust or competition clearances and shall take the
lead in all meetings and communications with any Governmental Authority in
connection with obtaining any necessary antitrust or competition clearances;
provided, however, that, with respect to the jurisdictions referenced in
Section 8.01(d), Parent shall consult in advance with the Company and in good
faith take the Company's views into account regarding the overall strategic
direction of obtaining antitrust or competition clearance in those
jurisdictions and consult with the Company prior to taking any material
substantive position in any written submissions or, to the extent practicable,
discussions with Governmental Agencies in those jurisdictions. The Company
shall consult with Parent prior to taking any material substantive position
with respect to the filings under the HSR Act, the EU Merger Regulation or
other applicable foreign, federal, state or supranational antitrust,
competition, fair trade or similar Laws, in any written submission to, or, to
the extent practicable, in any discussions with, any Governmental Authority.
With respect to the jurisdictions referenced in Section 8.01(d), each party
shall permit the other party to review and discuss in advance, and shall
consider in good faith the views of the other party in connection with, any
analyses, presentations, memoranda, briefs, written arguments, opinions,
written proposals or other materials to be submitted to the Governmental
Authorities in those jurisdictions with respect to such filings. Each party
shall keep the other apprised of the material content and status of any
material communications with, and material communications from, any
Governmental Authority with respect to the Transactions, including promptly
notifying the other of any material communication it receives from any
Governmental Authority relating to any review or investigation of the
Transactions under the HSR Act, the EU Merger Regulation or other applicable
foreign, federal, state or supranational antitrust, competition, fair trade or
similar Laws. The parties to this Agreement shall, and shall cause their
respective Affiliates to use their reasonable best efforts to, provide each
other with copies of all material, substantive correspondence, filings or
communications between them or any of their respective Representatives, on the
one hand, and any Governmental Authority or members of its staff, on the other
hand, with respect to this Agreement and the Transactions; provided, however,
that materials may be redacted (i) to remove references concerning the
valuation of the Company and its Subsidiaries; (ii) as necessary to comply
with contractual arrangements or applicable Laws; and (iii) as necessary to
address reasonable attorney-client or other privilege or confidentiality
concerns.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

53  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

(c) Parent and the Company shall, and shall cause each of their respective
Subsidiaries to, use their reasonable best efforts to take any and all steps
necessary to avoid or eliminate each and every legal impediment under any
applicable state, federal, foreign or supranational antitrust, competition,
fair trade or similar Law that may be asserted by any antitrust or competition
Governmental Authority or any other party so as to enable the parties hereto
to close the Transactions as promptly as practicable, and in any event prior
to the Outside Date, including, subject to the last sentence of this Section
7.08(c), proposing, negotiating, committing to and effecting, by consent
decree, hold separate orders, or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or
disposition of their assets, properties or businesses, and the entrance into
such other arrangements, as are necessary or reasonably advisable in order to
avoid the entry of, and the commencement of litigation seeking the entry of,
or to effect the dissolution of, any injunction, temporary restraining order
or other order in any suit or proceeding, which would otherwise have the
effect of materially delaying or preventing the consummation of the
Transactions. In addition, subject to the last sentence of this Section
7.08(c), Parent and the Company shall, and shall cause each of their
respective Subsidiaries to, defend through litigation on the merits any claim
asserted in court or administrative or other tribunal by any Person (including
any Governmental Authority) in order to avoid entry of, or to have vacated or
terminated, any decree, order or judgment (whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent) that would prevent the Closing prior to the Outside Date; provided,
however, that such litigation in no way limits the obligations of the parties
to comply with their reasonable best efforts obligations under the terms of
this Section 7.08. Parent shall have the sole and exclusive right to direct
and control any litigation, negotiation or other action, with counsel of its
own choosing, and the Company agrees to cooperate with Parent with respect
thereto; provided, however, that, with respect to the jurisdictions referenced
in Section 8.01(d), Parent shall consult in advance with the Company and in
good faith take the Company's views into account regarding the overall
strategic direction of the defense of any such litigation and consult with the
Company prior to taking any material substantive positions, making dispositive
motions or other material substantive filings or entering into any
negotiations concerning such litigation. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any
other provision of this Agreement, (i) none of Parent and any of its
Subsidiaries and Affiliates shall be required to agree to any sale, transfer,
license, separate holding, divestiture or other disposition of, or to any
prohibition of or any limitation on the acquisition, ownership, operation,
effective control or exercise of full rights of ownership, or other
modification of rights in respect of, of (each, a "Divestiture"), any assets
or businesses of DePuy, Inc. or any of its Subsidiaries or of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries that, in the aggregate, are material relative to (A)
DePuy, Inc. and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (B) the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and (ii) the Company, only at the direction of
Parent (in connection with satisfying the foregoing obligations), shall agree
to any Divestiture of any of its assets or the assets of any of its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates so long as such Divestiture is conditioned on the
consummation of the Merger.

  

  

(d) With respect to the jurisdictions referenced in Section 8.01(d), Parent
shall, to the extent practicable and permitted by the relevant Governmental
Authority, give the Company (through its counsel) the opportunity to attend
and participate in all substantive meetings, telephone calls or discussions in
respect of any filings, investigation (including settlement of the
investigation), litigation or other inquiry; provided that, Parent or its
representatives may conduct such a meeting, telephone call or discussion
without the Company or its representatives present if Parent determines in
good faith, taking into account the relevant facts and circumstances at the
time (including the nature of the jurisdiction and the relevant Governmental
Authority in question), that the taking of such action would enhance the
likelihood of obtaining any necessary antitrust, competition, fair trade or
similar clearance by the Outside Date; and provided further that to the extent
practicable, Parent shall consult with the Company in advance and consider in
good faith the view of the Company in making any such determination.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

54  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

(e) Each party hereto shall and shall cause its respective Subsidiaries to
respond as promptly as reasonably practicable and advisable to any inquiries
or requests for information and documentary material received from any
Governmental Authority in connection with any antitrust or competition matters
related to this Agreement and the Transactions. The Company and its
Subsidiaries shall not, but Parent may if in its good faith judgment it
determines (after consulting in advance with the Company and in good faith
taking the Company's views into account) that the taking of such action would
enhance the likelihood of obtaining any necessary antitrust, competition, fair
trade or similar clearance by the Outside Date, extend any waiting period or
agree to refile under the HSR Act, the EU Merger Regulation or any other
applicable state, federal, foreign or supranational antitrust, competition,
fair trade or similar Laws.

  

  

(f) The Company and the Company Board shall use their reasonable best efforts
to (i) ensure that no state takeover Law or similar Law is or becomes
applicable to this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other Transactions and
(ii) if any state takeover Law or similar Law becomes applicable to this
Agreement, the Merger or any of the other Transactions, ensure that the Merger
and the other Transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on
the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect
of such Law on this Agreement, the Merger and the other Transactions.

to cause Merger Sub to perform its obligations under this Agreement and to
consummate the Merger on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in

their respective reasonable best efforts to cause to be delivered to each
other consents from their respective independent auditors, in form reasonably
satisfactory to the recipient and customary in scope and substance for
consents delivered by independent public accountants in connection with
registration statements on Form S-4 under the Securities Act.

  

  

Section 7.11 Listing of Shares of Parent Common Stock. Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the shares of Parent Common Stock to be
issued in the Merger to be approved for listing on the NYSE, subject to
official notice of issuance, and the Company shall cooperate with Parent to
the extent reasonably necessary with respect to such listing.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

55  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

Section 7.12 Public Announcements. The initial press release relating to the
Transactions shall be a joint press release, the text of which has been agreed
to by each of Parent and the Company. Thereafter, unless otherwise required by
applicable Law or the requirements of applicable stock exchanges, each of
Parent and the Company shall each use its reasonable best efforts to consult
with the other before issuing, and give each other the opportunity to review
and comment upon, any press release or otherwise making any public statements
with respect to this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other Transactions;
provided, however, that this Section 7.12 shall terminate upon a Change in the
Company Recommendation; provided, further, that each of Parent and the Company
may make public statements in response to specific questions by the press,
analysts, investors or those attending industry conferences or financial
analyst conference calls, so long as any such statements are not materially
inconsistent with previous press releases, public disclosures or public
statements made jointly or approved by Parent and the Company and do not
reveal material, nonpublic information regarding the other party.

  

  

Section 7.13 Certain Tax Matters. During the period from the date of this
Agreement to the Closing Date, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall: (a)
prepare and timely file all Tax Returns that are due on or before the Closing
Date in accordance with, to the extent applicable, past practice, (b) pay all
Taxes due and payable in respect of such Tax Returns, (c) accrue a reserve in
the applicable books and financial statements in accordance with past
practices for all Taxes payable for which no Tax Return is due prior to the
Closing Date and (d) promptly notify Parent of any suit, claim, action,
investigation, proceeding or audit (in each case with respect to Taxes) that
becomes pending against or with respect to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. The Company shall deliver to Parent on or prior to the Closing
Date a properly executed statement signed by the Company to the effect that
the Shares are not "United States real property interests" within the meaning
of Section 897 of the Code.

  

  

Section 7.14 Stockholder Litigation. The Company shall give Parent the
opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any stockholder
litigation against the Company or its directors relating to the Transactions,
and no such settlement shall be agreed to without Parent's prior written
consent.

  

  

Section 7.15 Other Actions. (a) The Company and its Subsidiaries shall comply
in all material respects with the terms and conditions of (i) the Settlement

provided, however, that the Company and its Subsidiaries may complete the

(x) the OIG grants an extension pursuant to the terms and conditions of such
Divestiture Agreement and (y) such extension does not, and would not
reasonably be expected to, result in or give rise to any adverse consequence
to Parent, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries (other than a
de minimis monetary fine, penalty or payment imposed on the Company in
connection with the granting of any such extension).

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

56  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

Section 7.16 Delisting of Shares. The Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause (a) the delisting of the Shares on the SIX and (b) the Shares
to cease trading on the Closing Date. The Company shall timely file for the
approval of the delisting with the SIX and, if necessary, shall timely request
for the shortening of the continued listing period under the SIX Rules.

(ii) if a Change in the Company Recommendation shall have occurred;

  

  

(iii) if the Company Board fails publicly to reaffirm the Company
Recommendation within ten Business Days of receipt of a written request by
Parent to provide such reaffirmation following a Competing Proposal that has
been publicly announced or that has become publicly known; or

  

  

(iv) if any Restraint arising under an antitrust, competition, fair trade or
similar Law or Order having the effects referred to in clauses (i) through (v)
of Section 8.02(d) shall be in effect and shall have become final and
nonappealable; provided, however, that Parent shall have complied in all
material respects with its obligations under Section 7.08; or

  

  

(d) by the Company, upon a breach by either of Parent or Merger Sub of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement set forth in this Agreement
such that the conditions set forth in Section 8.03(a) or Section 8.03(b) would
not be satisfied and such breach cannot be cured or has not been cured on or
before the Outside Date; provided, however, that the Company shall not have
the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.01(d) if the
Company is in material breach of its representations, warranties or covenants
as of the time of such purported termination.

  

  

Section 9.02 Effect of Termination. In the event of termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 9.01, written notice thereof shall be given to
the other parties hereto, specifying the provision or provisions hereof
pursuant to which such termination shall have been made, and this Agreement
shall forthwith become void, and there shall be no liability under this
Agreement on the part of any party hereto or their respective Subsidiaries or
Representatives, except (a) with respect to this Section 9.02, Section 4.20,
Section 5.11, Section 7.04(c), Section 9.03 and Article X, each of which shall
survive any termination of this Agreement and remain in full force and effect
and (b) nothing in this Section 9.02 or Section 9.03 shall relieve any party
from liability for fraud committed prior to such termination or for any
intentional breach prior to such termination of any of its representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement; provided,
however, that the Confidentiality Agreement and the Parent Confidentiality
Agreement shall survive any termination of this Agreement.

  

  

Section 9.03 Fees and Expenses. (a) The Company agrees that if:

  

  

(i) Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.01(c)(ii) or
Section 9.01(c)(iii); or

  

  

(ii) (A) Parent or the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section
9.01(b)(i) (but only if the Company Stockholders' Meeting has not been held
prior to the date of such termination) or Section 9.01(b)(iii), (B) prior to
the termination of this Agreement, a Competing Proposal shall have been
publicly announced or shall have become publicly known, and (C) on or prior to
the date that is 12 months after the date of such termination, the Company
enters into a Competing Transaction Agreement or the transactions contemplated
by a Competing Proposal are consummated; provided, however, that for purposes
of this Section 9.03(a)(ii), all references to 15% in the definition of
"Competing Proposal" shall be replaced with references to 35%.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

61  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

then, in any such event, the Company shall pay to Parent (x) on the second
Business Day following Parent's termination of this Agreement pursuant to
Section 9.01(c)(ii) or Section 9.01(c)(iii) or (y) on the date of the first to
occur of the events referred to in Section 9.03(a)(ii)(C), the Termination
Fee, which amount shall be payable in cash in immediately available funds.

  

  

(b) In the event that (i) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section
9.01(b)(i), Section 9.01(b)(ii) or Section 9.01(c)(iv) and (ii) at the time of
such termination all of the conditions set forth in Article VIII have been
satisfied or waived (or, with respect to the conditions that by their terms
must be satisfied at the Closing, would have been so satisfied if the Closing
would have occurred) except for any of the conditions set forth in Section
8.01(c), Section 8.01(d), Section 8.02(d) and Section 8.02(e), then Parent
shall pay to the Company a fee equal to $650.0 million (the "Reverse
Termination Fee"), by wire transfer on the first Business Day following the
date of termination of this Agreement.

  

  

(c) All Expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
Transactions shall be paid by the party incurring such Expenses, whether or
not the Merger or any other Transaction is consummated, except expenses
incurred in connection with the printing and mailing of the Registration
Statement and the Proxy Statement which shall be shared equally by Parent and
the Company.

  

  

(d) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the agreements contained in
Section 9.03(a) and 9.03(b) are an integral part of the Transactions, and
that, without these agreements, the parties hereto would not enter into this
Agreement; accordingly, (i) if the Company fails promptly to pay the amount
due pursuant to Section 9.03(a), and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent
commences a suit that results in a judgment against the Company for the
Termination Fee, the Company shall pay to Parent its costs and expenses
(including attorneys' fees and expenses) in connection with such suit or (ii)
if Parent fails promptly to pay the amount due pursuant to Section 9.03(b),
and, in order to obtain such payment, the Company commences a suit that
results in a judgment against Parent for the Reverse Termination Fee, Parent
shall pay to the Company its costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees and
expenses) in connection with such suit, in each case, together with interest
on the amount of the Termination Fee or Reverse Termination Fee, as
applicable, from the date such payment was required to be made until the date
of payment at the prime rate of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., in effect on the
date such payment was required to be made.

  

  

Section 9.04 Amendment. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto by
action taken by or on behalf of their respective boards of directors at any
time prior to the Effective Time; provided, however, that, after the Company
Stockholder Approval has been obtained, no amendment may be made that under
applicable Law or in accordance with the rules of any relevant stock exchange
requires further approval by the stockholders of the Company without such
approval having been obtained. This Agreement may not be amended except by an
instrument in writing signed by each of the parties hereto.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

62  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

Section 9.05 Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Time, any party hereto
may (a) extend the time for the performance of any obligation or other act of
any other party hereto, (b) to the extent permitted by applicable Law, waive
any breach of or inaccuracy in the representations and warranties of any other
party contained in this Agreement or in any document delivered pursuant hereto
and (c) subject to the proviso in the first sentence of Section 9.04 and to
the extent permitted by applicable Law, waive compliance with any agreement of
any other party or any condition to its own obligations contained in this
Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or delay by the Company
or Parent or Merger Sub in exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a
waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any
other or future exercise of any other right hereunder. Any such extension or
waiver shall be valid if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by the
party or parties to be bound thereby.

  

  

Section 9.06 Procedure for Termination or Amendment. A termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 9.01 or an amendment of this Agreement pursuant
to Section 9.04 shall, in order to be effective, require, in the case of
Parent or the Company, action by its board of directors or, with respect to
any amendment of this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.04, the duly authorized
committee of its board of directors to the extent permitted by applicable Law.

Section 10.03 Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by virtue of any rule of
Law or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement
shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or
legal substance of the Transactions is not affected in any manner materially
adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner
in order that the Transactions be consummated as originally contemplated to
the fullest extent possible.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

64  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

Section 10.04 Entire Agreement; Assignment. This Agreement (including the
exhibits and schedules hereto, including the Company Disclosure Schedule), the
Voting Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement and the Parent Confidentiality
Agreement constitute the entire agreement among the parties with respect to
the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersede all prior agreements and
undertakings, both written and oral, among the parties, or any of them, with
respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof. Neither this Agreement nor
any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any
of the parties, in whole or in part (whether pursuant to a merger, by
operation of Law or otherwise), without the prior written consent of the other
parties, except that Parent and Merger Sub may assign all or any of their
rights and obligations under this Agreement to any Affiliate of Parent,
provided that no such assignment shall relieve the assigning party of its
obligations under this Agreement if such assignee does not perform such
obligations.

  

  

Section 10.05 Parties in Interest. This Agreement shall be binding upon, inure
solely to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, only the parties hereto, and
nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer
upon any other Person any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever
under or by reason of this Agreement, other than Section 7.06 (which is
intended to be for the benefit of the Persons covered thereby and may be
enforced by such Persons).

  

  

Section 10.06 Specific Performance. The parties hereto agree that the parties
hereto would be irreparably damaged if any provision of this Agreement was not
performed in accordance with its specific terms or was otherwise breached.
Accordingly, the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the performance
of the terms of this Agreement, in addition to any other remedy at law or in
equity. The parties further agree that no party to this Agreement shall be
required to obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar instrument in
connection with or as a condition to obtaining any such legal or equitable
relief and each party waives any objection to the imposition of such relief or
any right it might have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any
such bond or similar instrument.

  

  

Section 10.07 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware. All actions
and proceedings arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be heard
and determined exclusively in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware.
The parties hereto hereby (a) submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware for the purpose of any Action
arising out of or relating to this Agreement brought by any party hereto, and
(b) irrevocably waive, and agree not to assert by way of motion, defense or
otherwise, in any such Action, any claim that it is not subject personally to
the jurisdiction of the above-named court, that its property is exempt or
immune from attachment or execution, that the Action is brought in an
inconvenient forum, that the venue of the Action is improper, or that this
Agreement or the Transactions may not be enforced in or by the above-named
courts.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

65  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

Section 10.08 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed and delivered
(including by facsimile transmission or .pdf) in counterparts, and by the
different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when executed
shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken together shall
constitute one and the same agreement.

  

  

Section 10.09 Waiver of Jury Trial. Each of the parties hereto hereby
irrevocably waives to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law any right
it may have to a trial by jury with respect to any litigation directly or
indirectly arising out of, under or in connection with this Agreement or the
Transactions. Each of the parties hereto (a) certifies that no Representative
of any other party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other
party would not, in the event of litigation, seek to enforce the foregoing
waiver and (b) acknowledges that it and the other parties hereto have been
induced to enter into this Agreement and the Transactions, as applicable, by,
among other things, the mutual waivers and certifications in this Section
10.09.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

66  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company have caused this
Agreement to be executed as of the date first written above by their
respective officers thereunto duly authorized.
