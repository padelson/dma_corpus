compliance with the standards set forth in this Section 2.4 for the
preparation of the Closing Statement (including that any items that should
have been

  

  

18

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

  

included or excluded from the calculation based on the standards were not
properly included or excluded), and (ii) computational errors. If Seller fails
to deliver an Objection Notice to Purchaser within such 10-Business Day
period, Seller shall be deemed to have concurred with the Closing Statement
and its calculation of the Closing Adjustment Amount shall become final and
binding on all parties.

  

  

(d) Dispute Resolution. If Seller timely delivers an Objection Notice to
Purchaser in accordance with Section 2.4(c), then the Closing Statement and
the Closing Adjustment Amount shall become final and binding upon the parties
on the earliest of (i) the date Purchaser and Seller resolve in writing any
differences that they have with respect to any matter specified in the
Objection Notice and (ii) the date any matters properly in dispute are finally
resolved in writing by the Independent Expert. If Seller timely delivers an
Objection Notice to Purchaser in accordance with Section 2.4(c), Purchaser and
Seller shall, together with their respective independent certified public
accountants, promptly consult with each other in good faith and exercise
reasonable efforts to attempt to resolve differences in their respective
analyses of the Closing Statement within ten (10) Business Days after Seller
delivers the Objection Notice. Any matter not specifically referenced in the
Objection Notice shall be conclusively deemed to have been agreed upon by the
parties. If Purchaser and Seller are unable to resolve their differences
within such 10-Business Day period, either Purchaser or Seller may refer the
matter to Deloitte and Touche LLP or its applicable Affiliate in Kazakhstan or
another reputable global accounting firm mutually agreed upon by the parties
(the "Independent Expert"), which shall be instructed to resolve such
differences pursuant to a written report delivered to the parties within
thirty (30) days after the matter is referred to it on the basis of the
standards set forth above in this Section 2.4. Purchaser and Seller shall
instruct the Independent Expert not to assign a value to any item in dispute
greater than the greatest value for such item assigned by Purchaser, on the
one hand, and Seller, on the other hand, or less than the smallest value for
such item assigned by Purchaser, on the one hand, and Seller, on the other
hand. The Independent Expert shall act as an expert and not as an arbitrator,
and shall resolve only matters in dispute. The determination of the
Independent Expert shall be final, binding and conclusive on the parties. In
the event that the Independent Expert declines to resolve any disputes
regarding the calculation of the Non-Ordinary Course Liabilities Amount, such
disputes may be resolved in accordance with Section 12.9.

  

  

(e) Fees and Expenses. If an Independent Expert is selected to review and
resolve the differences between Purchaser and Seller in accordance with
Section 2.4(d), each of Purchaser, on the one hand, and Seller, on the other
hand, shall bear that percentage of the fees and expenses of the Independent
Expert equal to the proportion (expressed as a percentage) of the dollar value
of the disputed amounts determined in favor of the other party by the
Independent Expert.

  

  

(f) Payment of Adjustment. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, the following adjustments and payments shall be made:

  

  

(i) If the amount of Closing Adjustment Amount as set forth on the Closing
Statement as concurred by Seller or as finally resolved in the manner set
forth above exceeds the Estimated Adjustment Amount, then Seller shall
promptly (but in no event later than five (5) Business Days after such final
resolution) pay Purchaser the amount of

  

  

19

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

  

such excess by wire transfer of immediately available funds in U.S. dollars to
an account designated by Purchaser; provided, however, that Purchaser may
elect to satisfy such amount out of the Escrow Account (to the extent
sufficient funds therein are available).

  

  

(ii) If the amount of Closing Adjustment Amount as set forth on the Closing
Statement as concurred by Seller or as finally resolved in the manner set
forth above is less than the Estimated Adjustment Amount, then Purchaser shall
promptly (but in no event later than five (5) Business Days after such final
resolution) pay Seller the amount of such deficiency by wire transfer of
immediately available funds in U.S. dollars to the account designated by
Seller for the payment of the Initial Interests Purchase Price on the Closing
Date.

  

  

(g) Final Interests Purchase Price. The Initial Interests Purchase Price, as
adjusted pursuant to this Section 2.4 is referred to as the "Final Interests
Purchase Price".

  

  

Section 2.5 Withholding. Purchaser and the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from the consideration attributable to the Interests and
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to Seller such amounts as
Purchaser or the Escrow Agent, as applicable, is required to deduct and
withhold under any applicable Tax Law, including any Kazakhstan capital gains
Tax, with respect to the making of such payment. To the extent that amounts
are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of whom such
deduction and withholding was made.

waive any potential breach of the Indenture arising as a result of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including,
without limitation, the sale of the Interests and the Seller Loans by Seller
to Purchaser hereunder. Except for the Seller Noteholders' Approval, the

director, manager, employee, or consultant of any Person that is a lessor,
lessee, customer or supplier of the Company or is otherwise engaged in the

Section 6.23 Insurance. Section 6.23 of the Company Disclosure Schedule
contains a correct and complete list of each material insurance policy owned
by, or maintained for the benefit of, the Company. The Company is not in
material default under any such insurance policy. All premiums due have been
paid on such insurance policies, and the Company has not

  

  

38

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

  

received any written notice of cancellation of any such insurance policy or
written notice with respect to any refusal of coverage thereunder. The Company
has no self-insurance or co-insurance program. All such policies provide
adequate coverage with reputable insurers for all normal risks incident to the
Company's assets, properties and business operations and are in character and
amount at least equivalent to that carried by Persons engaged in a business
subject to the same or similar risks, perils or hazards and in the same
industry. The Company currently has, and at all time has had, the benefit of
insurance coverage that was required by applicable Laws or the Petroleum
Contracts.

  

  

Section 6.24 Taxes.

  

  

(a) The Company has duly and timely filed or caused to be timely filed with
the appropriate Tax Authority all Tax Returns required to be filed by, or with
respect to, it. All such Tax Returns are correct and complete in all material
respects. All Taxes due and owing by the Company (whether or not shown as due
on any Tax Return) have been timely paid. The Company is not currently the
beneficiary of any extension of time within which to file any Tax Return, nor
has any such extension been requested. No claim has ever been made by a Tax
Authority in a jurisdiction where the Company does not file a Tax Return that
the Company is or may be subject to taxation by that. The Company has never
had any nexus with any jurisdiction where the Company does not file a Tax
Return which nexus could reasonably be expected to subject it to Tax in such
jurisdiction. The Company has prepared and kept complete, accurate and up-to-
date records in relation to Tax as required by any Tax Law or any other
applicable Law and to enable it to deliver correct and complete Tax Returns
(together with all attachments thereto as required by any Tax Law) and to
calculate any present or, so far as possible, future Tax Liability of the
Company or the entitlement of the Company to claim any relief from Tax
Liabilities.

  

  

(b) The unpaid Taxes of the Company did not, as of the date of the Balance
Sheet, exceed the reserve for Tax liability (excluding any reserve for
deferred Taxes established to reflect timing differences between book and Tax
income) set forth on the face of the Balance Sheet (rather than in any notes
thereto). Since the date of the Balance Sheet, the Company has not incurred
any liability for Taxes outside the ordinary course of business or otherwise
inconsistent with past custom and practice.

  

  

(c) No deficiencies for Taxes with respect to the Company have been claimed,
proposed or assessed by any Tax Authority. There are no pending or threatened
audits, assessments or other actions for or relating to any liability in
respect of Taxes of the Company. There are no matters under discussion with
any Tax Authority, or known to the Company, with respect to Taxes that are
likely to result in an additional liability for Taxes of the Company. No
issues relating to Taxes of the Company were raised by the relevant Tax
Authority in any completed audit or examination that would reasonably be
expected to result in a material amount of Taxes in a later taxable period.

  

  

39

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

  

(d) The Company (or any predecessor of the Company) has not waived any statute
of limitations in respect of Taxes or agreed to any extension of time with
respect to a Tax assessment or deficiency, nor has any request been made in
writing for any such extension or waiver. No power of attorney with respect to
any Taxes of the Company has been executed or filed with any Tax Authority.

  

  

(e) There are no Liens for Taxes upon any property or asset of the Company
(other than Permitted Liens).

  

  

(f) The Company has withheld and paid all Taxes required to have been withheld
and paid in connection with amounts paid or owing to any employee, independent
contractor, creditor, shareholders of the Company or other Person. The Company
has properly classified all individuals providing services to it as employees
or non-employees for all relevant purposes.

  

  

(g) The Company has delivered or made available to Purchaser complete and
accurate copies of all Tax Returns of the Company (and any predecessor of the
Company) for all taxable years from and after 2008, including, promptly upon
their availability, for the most recent taxable year, and complete and
accurate copies of all audit or examination reports and statements of
deficiencies assessed against or agreed to by the Company (or any predecessors
of the Company) from and after 2008.

  

  

(h) The Company is not, and has never been, a party to or bound by any Tax
indemnity agreement, Tax sharing agreement, Tax allocation agreement or
similar arrangement or Contract and, after the Closing Date, the Company shall
not be bound by any such agreement, arrangement or Contract or have any
liability thereunder.

  

  

(i) The Company has not engaged in a trade or business, had a permanent
establishment (within the meaning of an applicable Tax treaty), owned any
property in, or otherwise become subject to Tax jurisdiction in a country
other than the country of its formation. No entity classification election
pursuant to United States Treasury Regulations Section 301.7701-3 has ever
been filed with respect to the Company.

  

  

(j) The Company has no liability for any Taxes of any other Person. The
Company has never been a member of any consolidated, combined, affiliated,
aggregate or unitary group of persons for any Tax purpose.

  

  

(k) The Company will not be required to include any item of income in, or
exclude any item of deduction from, taxable income for any period (or any
portion thereof) ending after the Closing Date as a result of any installment
sale or other transaction on or prior to the Closing Date, any accounting
method change or agreement with any Taxing Authority, any prepaid amount
received on or prior to the Closing or for any other reason.

  

  

Section 6.25 Absence of Certain Developments. Since the Balance Sheet Date,
the Company has conducted its business in all material respects in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice and there has not
been any Material Adverse Effect. Since such date, neither Seller nor the

to be in full force and effect in accordance with its terms. Each of Seller
and Purchaser, on its behalf and on behalf of its Affiliate party to the
Confidentiality Agreement, hereby agrees and consents to the termination of
the Confidentiality Agreement effective as of the Closing.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided, each of Purchaser and

Use Law. Each of Purchaser and Seller shall supply as promptly as practicable
to the appropriate Governmental Authorities any additional information and
documentary material that may be requested pursuant to the Competition Act or
the Subsoil Use Law. Without limiting the foregoing, Seller and Purchaser (i)
shall reasonably cooperate and consult with each other in connection with the
making of all filings, notifications and any other material actions pursuant
to this Section 8.3, including, subject to applicable Law and the parties'
reasonable understanding of Competition Agency and Ministry of Oil and Gas
policy with regard thereto, by permitting counsel for the other party a
reasonable opportunity to review in advance, and consider in good faith the
views of the other party in connection with, any filings or submissions to any

Subsidiaries to a Governmental Authority or received from such a Governmental
Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,

(b) In the event any claim, action, suit, investigation or other proceeding by
any Governmental Authority or other Person is commenced which raises questions
about the validity or legality of the transactions contemplated hereby or
seeks damages in connection therewith, Purchaser and Seller agree to cooperate
reasonably and use reasonable best efforts to defend against such claim,
action, suit, investigation or other proceeding; provided that Purchaser shall
have the sole right to direct and control the defense of such claim, action,
suit, investigation or other proceeding with counsel of its own choosing, and
Seller may, at its own expense, participate therein with counsel of its own
choosing. Purchaser and Seller agree to use their reasonable best efforts to
take or agree to take all such other actions or non-actions as may be required
to obtain any and all necessary governmental, judicial or regulatory actions
or non-actions, Orders, Consents, clearances and extensions, including
pursuant to the Competition Act and Subsoil Use Law, and, if an injunction or

in any such action, suit or other proceeding, to use reasonable best efforts
to have such injunction or other Order or action lifted or removed, and to
cooperate reasonably in all efforts to eliminate or remove any other
impediment to the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Purchaser shall
not be required to consent to any divestitures or licenses of assets, supply

one or more businesses, product lines or assets.

  

  

(c) Each of Purchaser and Seller shall give prompt written notice to the other
of (i) the occurrence, or failure to occur, of any event which occurrence or
failure would cause any representation or warranty of Seller or Purchaser, as

material respect at any time from the date of this Agreement to the Closing or
that will result in the failure to satisfy any of the conditions specified in
Article 9 and such written notice shall specify the representation or warranty
that has become untrue or inaccurate, and (ii) any failure of Seller or
Purchaser, as the case may be, to comply with or satisfy any covenant,

Section 8.4 Public Announcements. No press release or other public
announcement concerning the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the
Transaction Documents shall be issued by Seller or Purchaser, without the
prior consent of the other, as the case may be (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or conditioned), except as such release or announcement
may be required by Law or the rules or regulations of the HKSE or any other
United States or foreign securities exchange, in which case the party required
to make the release or announcement shall allow the other party reasonable
time to comment on such release or announcement in advance of such issuance.

Section 8.6 Tax Matters.

  

  

(a) Tax Indemnification.

  

  

(i) Seller shall pay or cause to be paid, shall be liable for, and shall
indemnify, defend and hold each Indemnified Party harmless from and against
any Losses related to (A) Taxes imposed on or payable by the Company for, or
attributable to, any Pre-Closing Tax Period (or for any Straddle Period, to
the extent allocable (as determined pursuant to the last sentence of this
Section 8.6(a)(i)) to the portion of such period ending on the Closing Date),
except to the extent such Taxes (x) have been paid on or prior to the date of
the Balance Sheet or are reflected in the reserve for Tax liability (rather
than any reserve for deferred Taxes established to reflect timing differences
between book and Tax income) shown on the face of the Balance Sheet (rather
than any notes thereto), (y) are taken into account in the calculation of the
Adjustment Amount, or (z) arose after the date of the Balance Sheet in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice of the Company and
either (i) have been paid on or prior to the Closing or (ii) are reflected in
the reserve for Tax liability (rather than any reserve for deferred Taxes
established to reflect timing differences between book and Tax income) shown
on the face of the Closing Balance Sheet (rather than any notes thereto), (B)
Taxes, including capital gains Taxes, of Seller or any of its Affiliates
(other than the Company) for any Tax period, (C) the unpaid Taxes of any
Person (other than the Company) as a transferee or successor, by contract, or
otherwise, and (D) any and all Losses incurred by an Indemnified Party to the
extent arising out of or resulting from the breach of an agreement or covenant
made in Sections 8.1(b)(xviii) or 8.6 by Seller. For purposes of the preceding
sentence, in the case of any Taxes that are imposed on a periodic basis and
are

  

  

52

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

  

payable for a Straddle Period, the portion of such Tax that relates to the
portion of such Tax period ending on the Closing Date shall (i) in the case of
any Taxes other than Taxes based upon or related to income or receipts, be
deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire Tax period multiplied by a
fraction the numerator of which is the number of days in the Tax period ending
on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of days in the
entire Tax period, and (ii) in the case of any Tax based upon or related to
income or receipts, be deemed equal to the amount which would by payable if
the relevant Tax period ended on the Closing Date.

  

  

(ii) Payment in full of any amount due from Seller under this Section 8.6(a)
shall be made by Seller to the affected party in immediately available funds
at least two (2) Business Days before the date payment of the Taxes to which
such payment relates is due, or, if no Tax is payable, within fifteen (15)
days after written demand is made for such payment.

  

  

(b) Filing of Pre-Closing Tax Returns Before the Closing Date. The Company
shall prepare and timely file, or shall cause to be prepared and timely filed,
all Tax Returns in respect of the Company that are required to be filed
(taking into account any extension) on or before the Closing Date. Seller
shall pay all Taxes of the Company due on or before the Closing Date, except
to the extent such Taxes (i) have been paid on or prior to the date of the
Balance Sheet or are reflected in the reserve for Tax liability (rather than
any reserve for deferred Taxes established to reflect timing differences
between book and Tax income) shown on the face of the Balance Sheet (rather
than any notes thereto), (ii) are taken into account in the calculation of the
Adjustment Amount, or (iii) arose after the date of the Balance Sheet in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice of the Company and
either (A) have been paid on or prior to the Closing or (B) are reflected in
the reserve for Tax liability (rather than any reserve for deferred Taxes
established to reflect timing differences between book and Tax income) shown
on the face of the Closing Balance Sheet (rather than any notes thereto). Such
Tax Returns shall be prepared by treating items on such Tax Returns in a
manner consistent with the past practices of the Company with respect to such
items, except as required by applicable Law. At least ten (10) days prior to
filing any such Tax Return, Seller shall submit a copy of such Tax Returns to
Purchaser for Purchaser's review and approval, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld.

  

  

(c) Cooperation. Seller and Purchaser shall reasonably cooperate, and shall
cause their respective affiliates, officers, employees, agents, auditors and
representatives reasonably to cooperate, in preparing and filing all Tax
Returns, including maintaining and making available to each other all records
necessary in connection with Taxes and in resolving all disputes and audits
with respect to all taxable periods relating to Taxes.

  

  

(d) No Additional Tax Liability. Any payment made in respect of a claim under
this Section 8.6 shall include any amount necessary to ensure that, after any
Tax of the payment incurred by Purchaser or the Company, and including but not
limited to any deductions or withholding from the payment to be made by Seller
required by Law, Purchaser or the Company is left with the same amount it
would have had if the payment was not subject to Tax. If Purchaser or the
Company would, but for the availability of a Relief, incur a Tax liability
mentioned in this clause, it shall be deemed to have incurred and paid that
liability.

  

  

53

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

  

(e) In the event of any conflict or overlap between the provisions of this
Section 8.6 and Article 11, the provisions of this Section 8.6 shall govern.

  

  

(f) Any amounts payable under this Section 8.6 or Article 11 shall be treated
by the parties as an adjustment to the Final Interests Purchase Price, unless
otherwise required by Law.

  

  

Section 8.7 Employee Matters.

  

  

(a) Seller shall terminate the employment (and any applicable employment
agreement with Seller) of those employees of Seller designated by Purchaser
that Purchaser would like to retain for the Company, and Seller shall take all
necessary action to cause the employment of such employees to be transferred
to or reside solely with the Company, in each case effective not later than
the Closing (the "Transferred Employees"). Seller shall, and shall cause the
Company to, cooperate with and use reasonable best efforts to make reasonably
accessible to Purchaser any and all employees to whom Purchaser wishes to make
offers of employment and to assist Purchaser in its efforts to secure
satisfactory employment arrangements with those employees. Each Transferred
Employee and each other employee of the Company who continues employment with
Purchaser or its Affiliates (including the Company) after the Closing shall be
referred to herein as a "Continuing Employee".

  

  

(b) Except as otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement and other than
Benefit Plans maintained solely by the Company solely for the benefit of its
employees, Seller shall be solely responsible for all Benefit Plans and all
obligations and liabilities thereunder, and neither Purchaser nor any of its
Affiliates shall have or assume any obligations under or liabilities with
respect to, and it shall not receive any right or interest in the assets of,
any Benefit Plans. Prior to the Closing, Seller shall, and shall cause the
Company to, take all actions (including, without limitation, plan amendments)
necessary or appropriate to provide that, effective no later than immediately
prior to the Closing, Seller shall cause the Company to cease being a
"participating employer" and shall cease any sponsorship and participation in
each Benefit Plan and to cause all Continuing Employees to cease any active
participation in, and any benefit accrual under, all Benefit Plans, in each
case, other than Benefit Plans maintained solely by the Company solely for the
benefit of its employees. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
Seller shall be solely responsible for all severance, change of control and
similar obligations under any Benefit Plan or otherwise that becomes payable
as a result of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or the termination of employment of any employee of Seller or the
Company in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including the Transferred Employees).

  

  

(c) Following the date of this Agreement, Seller will reasonably cooperate in
all matters necessary to effect the transactions contemplated by this Section
8.7 and ensure a smooth transition of Continuing Employees to Purchaser,
including but not limited to (i) providing information regarding the
employment terms and conditions of the Company's employees that is reasonably
requested by Purchaser, (ii) providing data relating to workers compensation,
employee benefits and employee benefit plan coverage (except to the extent
prohibited by applicable Law), and (iii) providing such other information with
respect to employees, Benefit Plans and employment matters as is reasonably
requested by Purchaser.

  

  

54

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

(d) Notwithstanding anything else contained herein, this Agreement shall not
be interpreted as an amendment or modification of any employee benefit plan,
program, policy, agreement or arrangement, and nothing in this Agreement
shall, or shall be construed so as to: (i) prevent or restrict in any way the
right of Purchaser to terminate, reassign, promote or demote any employee or
other service provider of the Company (or to cause any of the foregoing
actions) at any time, or to change (or cause the change of) the title, powers,
duties, responsibilities, functions, locations, salaries, other compensation
or terms or conditions of employment of such employees or other service
providers; (ii) create any third-party rights in any current or former
employee or other service provider of the Company (or any beneficiaries or
dependents thereof); (iii) interfere with or limit Purchaser's right to amend
or terminate any plan, program, policy or arrangement of Purchaser or the
Company; or (iv) obligate Purchaser or its Subsidiaries to adopt or maintain
any compensatory or benefits arrangement at any time.

  

  

Section 8.8 Confidential Information. After the Closing Date, Seller shall
keep secret and retain in strictest confidence, and shall not use for the
benefit of itself or others, all confidential or proprietary information
relating to the Company or its business (the "Confidential Information"),
including, without limitation, "know-how," trade secrets, pricing policies,
marketing plans or strategies, business plans, designs and design projects,
inventions and research projects relating to the Company's business or its
assets and shall not disclose such Confidential Information to anyone other
than Purchaser except with Purchaser's express written consent.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the term "Confidential Information" shall not
include any of the following: (a) such information that becomes or is already
known to the public generally through no fault of Seller or its Affiliates,
(b) information that is required by Law to be disclosed; provided that prior
to disclosing any information pursuant to this clause (b) Seller shall, if
possible, give prior written notice thereof to Purchaser and provide Purchaser
with the reasonable opportunity to contest or seek a protective order with
respect to such disclosure and (c) such information as is necessary to prepare
Tax Returns or filings with any Governmental Authority for the period ending
on or including the Closing Date.

  

  

Section 8.9 Employee Non-Solicitation. For a period of one (1) year after the
Closing Date, neither Seller nor its Affiliates shall take any action,
directly or indirectly, to solicit for employment any person who is a
director, officer or senior manager of the Company; provided, however, that
the foregoing provisions shall not prevent the solicitation of any such
director, officer or senior manager who (a) responds to a general
advertisement offering employment, or (b) has received the prior written
consent of the Company or its Affiliates for such solicitation.

Section 8.10 Affiliate Agreements. Except as set forth on Section 8.10 of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, Seller shall terminate without penalty and will
cause its Affiliates to terminate without penalty each Contract between or

(a) As promptly as practicable after the execution of this Agreement, Seller
shall prepare the Seller Stockholder Proxy Statement. Seller shall cause the
Seller Stockholder Proxy Statement to be filed with the SEC as soon as

reasonable best efforts to have the Seller Stockholder Proxy Statement cleared

Other Seller Filings as and when required or requested by the SEC. Seller
shall, after consultation with Purchaser, use its reasonable best efforts to

discovered by Seller or the Company which should be set forth in an amendment
or a supplement to the Seller Stockholder Proxy Statement or any Other Seller

take all other reasonable action necessary to secure Seller Stockholders'
Approval, (C) cooperate and consult with Purchaser with respect to each of the

Section 8.16 and if the Seller Board determines in good faith (i) after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors
constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, a Superior Proposal,
and (ii) after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that failure to
take such action would reasonably be expected to constitute a breach of the

under applicable Law, Seller may (A) provide access to its properties,
contracts, personnel, books and records and furnish non-public information
with respect to Seller and the Company to the person making such Acquisition

Representatives), but only so long as Seller (x) has first received from such
person an executed confidentiality agreement containing provisions that are no

contained in any state takeover or similar Laws (any action described in the
foregoing clauses, a "Seller Adverse Recommendation Change"), and/or (v) enter
into or permit the Company to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement
(other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement); provided, however, that
if, prior to the receipt of Seller Stockholders' Approval, Seller receives a
bona fide written Acquisition Proposal after the date of this Agreement that
was not solicited in violation of this Section 8.16 and that the Seller Board
determines in good faith after consultation with its outside legal counsel and
financial advisors constitutes a Superior Proposal, then the Seller Board may
(A) effect a Seller Adverse Recommendation Change with respect to such
Superior Proposal, or (B) terminate this Agreement in order to immediately
enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior
Proposal if and only if (w) the Seller Board has determined in good faith
(after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors)
that the failure to take such action is inconsistent with the fiduciary duties
of the members of the Seller Board to Seller's stockholders under applicable
Law, (x) (1) Seller has given Purchaser five (5) Business Days' prior written
notice of its intention to take such action (the "Notice Period"), which
notice shall specify the basis for taking such action, including the identity
of the party making the Superior Proposal, the material terms thereof and
copies of all documentation relating thereto, and (2) the Seller Board and

changes or revisions to this Agreement proposed in writing by Purchaser during
the Notice Period, and shall not have determined that the Superior Proposal
would no longer constitute a Superior Proposal if such changes were to be
given effect, (y) Seller has complied with its obligations under this Section
8.16, and (z) in the case of a termination described in clause (B) above,
Seller shall have first both terminated this Agreement in accordance with the
provisions of Section 10.1(h) hereof and paid Purchaser the Termination Fee
and the Expenses in accordance with Section 10.2(b)(i). The parties agree and
acknowledge that, in the event of any material revision to the Acquisition
Proposal (including any change in the purchase price of such Acquisition
Proposal) that the Seller Board has determined constitutes a Superior
Proposal, Seller shall be required to deliver a new written notice to
Purchaser and to comply with the requirements of this Section 8.16(c) with
respect to such new written notice.

  

  

(d) From and after the date of this Agreement, Seller agrees that it will
promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours) notify Purchaser if

sought to be initiated or continued with, Seller or any of Seller's
Representatives indicating, in connection with such notice, the identity of
the Person making such offer or proposal, the material terms and conditions of
any proposals or offers (including, if applicable, copies of any written

Section 8.16 shall prohibit or restrict Seller or the Seller Board from (i)
taking and/or disclosing to the stockholders of Seller a position contemplated
by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act, or (ii) making
any disclosure to the stockholders of Seller if, in the good faith judgment of
the Seller Board, such disclosure would be reasonably necessary under
applicable Law (including Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the
Exchange Act); provided, however, that any such disclosure (other than a
"stop, look and listen" communication or similar communication of the type
contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act) shall be deemed to be a
Seller Adverse Recommendation Change unless the Seller Board expressly
publicly reaffirms the Seller Recommendation within two (2) Business Days
following any request by Purchaser.

  

  

(f) None of Seller, the Seller Board or any of their respective
Representatives will enter into any agreement with any person that would limit

of the Barter Agreement in form and substance satisfactory to Purchaser.

  

  

(r) Seller Noteholders' Approval. The Seller Noteholders' Approval shall have
been obtained.

  

  

Section 9.3 Conditions to the Obligations of Seller. The obligations of Seller
to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be subject
to the fulfillment at or prior to the Closing of each of the following
conditions, any and all of which may be waived in whole or in part by Seller
to the extent permitted by applicable Law:

  

  

(a) Representations and Warranties. The representations and warranties of
Purchaser contained in this Agreement shall be true and correct in all
material respects (except that the representations and warranties qualified by
materiality shall be true and correct in all respects) as of the date of this
Agreement and as of the Closing Date, as though made on and as of the Closing
Date (except to the extent expressly made as of an earlier date, in which case
of as such earlier date).

  

  

(b) Performance of Obligations. Purchaser shall have duly performed or
complied with, in all material respects, all of the covenants, obligations and
conditions to be performed or complied with by it under the terms of this
Agreement prior to or at the Closing.

  

  

(c) Receipt of Closing Deliverables. Seller shall have received the agreements
and the amount described in Section 3.2(a) (except for the Transition Services

the transactions contemplated by this Agreement).

  

  

Section 9.4 Frustration of Closing Conditions. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
neither of Purchaser or Seller may rely on the failure of any condition set
forth in this Article 9 to be satisfied if such failure was caused by such

all conditions to Closing in Article 9 (other than the conditions set forth in

are reasonably capable of being satisfied on or prior to the Extended End
Date; provided that the right to terminate this Agreement under this paragraph
shall not be available to any party whose failure to fulfill any obligation
under this Agreement has been the cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the
Closing to occur on or prior to the Extended End Date;

  

  

(c) by Purchaser if (i) Seller or the Company relinquishes any portion of the
Contract Areas in violation of Section 8.1(b)(xxii), (ii) there is a breach of

set forth in Section 9.2(a), (iii) any failure to perform any covenant or
agreement to be complied with or performed by Seller pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement which would result in the failure of the condition set forth in
Section 9.2(b) or (iv) the failure of any other condition set forth in Section
9.2 (excluding Section 9.2(s)) to be satisfied on or prior to the End Date or
Extended End Date, as applicable, or the occurrence of any event which results
or would result in the failure of any other condition set forth in Section 9.2
(excluding Section 9.2(s)) to be satisfied on or prior to the End Date or

and (iv), if such breach, inaccuracy or failure cannot be cured or has not
been cured within thirty (30) calendar days following the receipt by Seller of
written notice from Purchaser of such breach, inaccuracy or failure and such
breach, inaccuracy or failure has not been waived in writing by Purchaser;

  

  

(d) by Seller if (i) there is a breach of or inaccuracy in any representation
or warranty set forth in Article 7 which, if such breach or inaccuracy existed
on the date of this Agreement or the Closing Date, would result in the failure
of the condition set forth in Section 9.3(a), (ii) any failure to perform any
covenant or agreement to be complied with or performed by Purchaser pursuant
to the terms of this Agreement which would result in the failure of the
condition set forth in Section 9.3(b) or (iii) the failure of any other

70

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

  

forth in Section 9.3 to be satisfied on or prior to the End Date or Extended
End Date, as applicable, or the occurrence of any event which results or would
result in the failure of any other condition set forth in Section 9.3 to be
satisfied on or prior to the End Date or Extended End Date, as applicable, in

failure cannot be cured or has not been cured within thirty (30) calendar days
following the receipt by Purchaser of written notice from Seller of such
breach, inaccuracy or failure and such breach, inaccuracy or failure has not
been waived in writing by Purchaser;

  

  

(e) by either Purchaser or Seller, if any Governmental Authority shall have
issued an Order or taken any other action restraining, enjoining or otherwise
prohibiting the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and such Order or other action shall have become final and non-
appealable;

  

  

(f) by either Purchaser or Seller if the Seller Stockholders' Approval shall
not have been obtained at the Seller Stockholders' Meeting or any adjournment
or postponement thereof at which a vote on the transactions contemplated by

(g) by Purchaser if (i) a Seller Adverse Recommendation Change has occurred,
(ii) Seller shall have breached in any material respect any of its obligations
under Section 8.14, Section 8.15 or Section 8.16 (including, for the avoidance
of doubt, failing to include the Seller Recommendation in the Seller
Stockholder Proxy Statement mailed to Seller's stockholders), or (iii) the
Seller Board (or any committee thereof) authorizes or publicly proposes any of
the foregoing;

  

  

(h) by Seller in accordance with Section 8.16(c); provided that prior to or
concurrent with such termination, Seller pays the Termination Fee and the
Expenses to Purchaser in accordance with Section 10.2(b)(i), and any failure
to pay the Termination Fee and the Expenses shall render the purported
termination hereunder null and void;

  

  

(i) by either Purchaser or Seller if the Listco Stockholders' Approval shall
not have been obtained;

  

  

(j) by Purchaser if Seller shall have breached in any material respect any of

Section 10.2 Effect of Termination.

  

  

(a) Limitation on Liability. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
Section 10.1, all rights and obligations of the parties hereunder shall
terminate and no party shall have any Liability to the other party, except for
obligations of the parties hereto in Section 8.2(b), Section 8.4, Section
10.2, Article 12, and the Confidentiality Agreement, which

  

  

71

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

  

shall survive the termination of this Agreement in accordance with their
terms. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.1 shall not release any
party from any Liability for any willful breach by such party of the terms and
provisions of this Agreement (including the failure to pay any amounts due
pursuant to this Section 10.2).

  

  

(b) Termination Fee; Expenses.

  

  

(i) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Seller pursuant to
Section 10.1(h), then Seller shall pay Purchaser (or Purchaser's designee)
prior to or concurrent with such termination the Termination Fee and the
Expenses.

  

  

(ii) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Purchaser pursuant to
Section 10.1(g), then Seller shall pay Purchaser (or Purchaser's designee),
within two (2) Business Days after the date of such termination, the
Termination Fee.

  

  

(iii) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by either Purchaser or
Seller pursuant to (A) Section 10.1(b) under circumstances in which the
Regulatory Conditions set forth in Section 9.1(c) or (d)(ii) have not been
satisfied or (B) Section 10.1(e) as a result of the failure of the applicable
Governmental Authority to provide the Consent or waiver contemplated by the
Regulatory Conditions set forth in Section 9.1(c) or (d)(ii), respectively,
then Seller shall pay Purchaser (or Purchaser's designee), within two (2)
Business Days of the date of such termination, the Expenses.

  

  

(iv) In the event that (A) this Agreement is terminated by either Purchaser or
Seller pursuant to Section 10.1(b) or Section 10.1(f), and (B) an Acquisition
Proposal was publicly announced (including any disclosure of an intention to
make an Acquisition Proposal) or was otherwise communicated to the Seller
Board or directly to Seller's stockholders after the date of this Agreement
and prior to the date of the Seller Stockholders' Meeting or any adjournment
or postponement thereof and such Acquisition Proposal was not, in an
unequivocal manner, publicly retracted or withdrawn prior to the date of such
Seller Stockholders' Meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof, then
Seller shall pay Purchaser (or Purchaser's designee), within two (2) Business
Days of the date of such termination, the Expenses.

  

  

(v) In the event that (A) this Agreement is terminated by either Purchaser or
Seller pursuant to Section 10.1(b) or Section 10.1(f) or by Purchaser pursuant
to Section 10.1(c), (B) an Acquisition Proposal was publicly announced
(including any disclosure of an intention to make an Acquisition Proposal) or
was otherwise communicated to the Seller Board after the date of this
Agreement and prior to the date of the Seller Stockholders' Meeting or any
adjournment or postponement thereof and such Acquisition Proposal was not, in
an unequivocal manner, publicly retracted or withdrawn prior to the date of
such Seller Stockholders' Meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof,
and (C) within 12 months of such termination Seller enters into an Alternative
Acquisition Agreement or consummates any Acquisition Proposal, then Seller
shall pay Purchaser (or Purchaser's designee), immediately upon the earlier of
entering into such Alternative Acquisition Agreement or the consummation of
such Acquisition Proposal, the Termination Fee. For purposes of this Section
10.2(b)(v), each reference in the definition of Acquisition Proposal to "15%"
will be deemed to be references to "50%".

  

  

72

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

  

(vi) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Purchaser pursuant to
Section 10.1(j), then Seller shall pay Purchaser (or Purchaser's designee),
within two (2) Business Days after the date of such termination, the Expenses.

  

  

(c) All Payments. All payments under Section 10.2 shall be made by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by Purchaser
(or Purchaser's designee) on the date of termination of this Agreement or the
date of any other event triggering payment under Section 10.2 hereof. Seller
acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 10.2 are an
integral part of the transactions contemplated hereby, that damages resulting
from termination of this Agreement under circumstances where a Termination Fee
is payable are uncertain and incapable of accurate calculation and that the
amounts payable pursuant to this Section 10.2 are not a penalty but rather
constitute liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate
Purchaser in the circumstances in which such Termination Fee is payable for
the efforts expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this
Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, and that, without these
agreements, Purchaser would not enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, Seller
agrees that if it fails to promptly pay the Termination Fee and/or Expenses
and, in order to obtain such payments, Purchaser commences a suit which
results in a judgment against Seller for the Termination Fee, Seller shall pay
Purchaser's costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) in
connection with such suit.

  

  

(d) Purchaser Liability Cap. Except with respect to the payment obligations of
Purchaser in Article 2 hereof at the Closing (and only if the Closing actually
occurs), notwithstanding anything else herein to the contrary, the maximum
aggregate liability of Purchaser or any of its former, current or future
directors, officers, employees, agents, stockholders, Affiliates (including
Listco) or assignees or any former, current or future directors, officers,
employees, agents, stockholders, Affiliates or assignees of any of the
foregoing (the "Purchaser Group") for damages or otherwise shall be limited to
$10,000,000; provided, however, that, in the event the Purchase Closing has
occurred, then such amount shall be reduced, effective upon the Purchase
Closing, by the amount of the purchase price for the Purchase Notes as
calculated according to the second to last sentence of Section 8.22(a) (in
either case, the "Purchaser Liability Cap"). In no event will Seller or its
Affiliates seek or permit to be sought on behalf of Seller any damages or any
other recovery or judgment of any kind, including consequential, indirect or
punitive damages, from any member of the Purchaser Group other than Purchaser
or Listco in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby. Purchaser and Listco shall not be liable for consequential, indirect
or punitive damages hereunder. Seller acknowledges and agrees that it has no
right of recovery against, and no personal liability shall attach to, in each
case with respect to damages, any member of the Purchaser Group (other than
Purchaser and Listco to the extent provided in this Agreement), through
Purchaser or otherwise, whether by or through attempted piercing of the
corporate veil, by or through a claim by or on behalf of Purchaser

  

  

73

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

  

against any member of the Purchaser Group, by the enforcement of any
assessment or by any legal or equitable proceeding, by virtue of any
applicable Law or otherwise. Except for claims based on fraud or criminal
misconduct or enforcement of Seller's rights against Listco pursuant to
Section 8.21(a), notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the remedies
set forth this Section 10.2(d) shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of
Seller and its Affiliates against Purchaser and any other member of the
Purchaser Group in respect of any Liabilities or obligations arising under or
in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

  

  

ARTICLE 11

  

  

SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES; INDEMNIFICATION

  

  

Section 11.1 Survival of Terms. The representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements of Seller and Purchaser in this Agreement shall survive the Closing
and shall terminate on the date that is twelve (12) months following the
Closing Date; provided, however, that (a) in the event of fraud or criminal
misconduct by Seller in connection with a representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement made by it hereunder, such representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement shall continue in full force and effect without limitation and (b)
if a good faith written claim for indemnification with respect to a Loss prior
to the end of the applicable survival period, the applicable representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement shall survive with respect to such claim until
such claim is resolved. The right to indemnification or other remedy based on
the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein
will not be affected by any investigation conducted with respect to, or any
knowledge acquired (or capable of being acquired) at any time, whether before
or after the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the Closing Date,
with respect to the accuracy or inaccuracy of or compliance with, any such
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement.

  

  

Section 11.2 Indemnification by Seller.

  

  

(a) Effective as of the Closing Date, Seller agrees to indemnify and hold
Purchaser and its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Company) and
each of their respective officers, directors, employees and agents (each such
Person, an "Indemnified Party") harmless from and against:

  

  

(i) any and all Losses based upon or arising from any breach of any
representation or warranty made by Seller pursuant to Article 4 or Article 6;

  

  

(ii) any and all Losses based upon or arising from any failure by Seller to
perform any of its covenants or agreements contained herein;

  

  

(iii) any and all Losses based upon or arising from the matter described in
Section 11.2(a)(iii) of the Company Disclosure Schedule (the "Open Matter");

  

  

(iv) Intentionally omitted.

  

  

74

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

(v) any and all Losses arising from or related to (A) any invalidity of the
Existing Exploration Contract, or any revocation or early termination of the
Existing Exploration Contract or any portion thereof by the Ministry of Oil
and Gas or other Competent Authority, arising from or related to any non-
compliance with the Existing Exploration Contract or applicable Law prior to
the Closing Date; or (B) any non-compliance by the Company with any of the
terms of the Existing Exploration Contract prior to the Closing Date
(including, without limitation, any failure by the Company to fully perform
its current or historical obligations pursuant to the Annual Working Programs
or the Minimum Working Program thereunder) or applicable Law in relation to
the Company's performance of the Existing Exploration Contract;

  

  

(vi) any and all Losses arising from or related to the past transfer of the
Designated Payables;

  

  

(vii) any and all Losses arising from or related to any defect in the
Company's ownership of (i) gas utilization facilities on the Dolinnoe and
Aksaz oilfields, (ii) electricity lines on the Kariman, Dolinnoe, Emir and
Aksaz fields, (iii) gas pipelines from the Dolinnoe gas facility to the Aksaz
gas facility and from the Aksaz gas facility to the Aktau-karyer 5 gas
pipeline; or (iv) the Company's three oil pipeline lines (i.e., the two lines
from Kariman to the Dolinnoe oilfields and the line from the Dolinnoe to the
Aksaz oilfields);

  

  

(viii) any and all Losses arising from or related to (A) the presence,
handling or Release of any Hazardous Materials in, on, to, from or under any
real property or facility (including any offsite disposal facility) owned,
leased or used by the Company prior to the Closing Date, (B) any Liability of
the Company under any Environmental Law arising during the period from June 5,
2003 through the Closing Date or (C) any Liability of the Company under any
Environmental Law arising prior to June 5, 2003 which, to Seller's Knowledge,
existed on or prior to the Closing Date; and

  

  

(b) In the event that an Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification
under more than one clause of Section 11.2(a), it may obtain indemnification
under any of such clauses or combination of such clauses.

  

  

Section 11.3 Additional Provisions Regarding Indemnification Obligations.
Notwithstanding Section 11.2, the rights to indemnification pursuant to the
provisions of Section 11.2 are subject to the following limitations:

  

  

(a) Except as set forth in Section 11.1 and Section 11.3(f), Seller shall not
be liable for Losses incurred by any Indemnified Party pursuant to Section
11.2 after the first anniversary of the Closing Date.

  

  

(b) The maximum aggregate Liability of Seller to the Indemnified Parties taken
together for Losses for any claims for indemnification pursuant to Section
11.2(a), shall be limited to an amount equal to $39,000,000 (the "Cap
Amount").

  

  

75

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

(c) Seller shall not be liable for Losses for any claims for indemnification
pursuant to Section 11.2(a)(i) (other than as a result of a breach of a
Specified Representation) unless the total of all Losses for claims for
indemnification against Seller pursuant to Section 11.2(a)(i) exceeds $750,000
in the aggregate (the "Threshold"), and then Seller shall be liable for the
aggregate amount of such losses regardless of the Threshold. Liability of
Seller for Losses based upon or arising from a breach of a Specified
Representation shall not be subject to the Threshold.

  

  

(d) Seller shall not be liable to an Indemnified Party hereunder for any
punitive or exemplary damages, except where such damages are recovered by a
third party from an Indemnified Party in connection with Losses indemnified
hereunder.

  

  

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the limitations set forth in this Section
11.3 shall not apply with respect to Losses arising out of fraud or criminal
misconduct.

  

  

(f) Seller shall not be liable for Losses for any claims for indemnification
pursuant to Section 11.2(a)(iii) after the earliest of (i) ninety (90) days
after the date the Open Matter is finally resolved and not subject to judicial
process or appeal in any respect; (ii) the effective date of a final binding
agreement entered into with respect to the Open Matter in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to Purchaser; and (iii) the expiration of any applicable
statute of limitations with respect to the Open Matter (as applicable, the
"Termination Date"); provided, however, that Seller shall remain liable for
any such Losses incurred by any Indemnified Party prior to the Termination
Date.

  

  

(g) Purchaser shall have the right to manage any cleanup, remediation or
compliance efforts related to any environmental matters subject to
indemnification pursuant to Section 11.2(a)(viii) and shall be indemnified by
Seller pursuant to Section 11.2(a)(viii) for all costs and expenses reasonably
incurred in connection therewith.

  

  

Section 11.4 Indemnification Procedures; Third Party Claims.

  

  

(a) An Indemnified Party shall give Seller prompt written notice of any matter
which an Indemnified Party has determined has given or could give rise to a
right of indemnification under this Agreement (other than a Third Party
Claim), within fifteen (15) Business Days of such determination (an "Indemnity
Notice"); provided, however, that the failure to give an Indemnity Notice
shall not waive an Indemnified Party's right to indemnification, unless Seller
can show that it was materially prejudiced by the Indemnified Party's failure
to give notice.

  

  

(b) If any claim, action, suit, proceeding or demand is brought by a Person
who is not a party to this Agreement or an Affiliate thereof (a "Third Party
Claim") against an Indemnified Party, and if such Indemnified Party intends to
seek indemnification with respect thereto pursuant to this Article 11, such
Indemnified Party shall promptly, but in any event within fifteen (15)
Business Days after the Indemnified Party learns of the existence of the Third
Party Claim, notify Seller in writing of the Third Party Claim; provided,
however,

  

  

76

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

  

that no delay on the part of the Indemnified Party in notifying Seller will
relieve Seller from any obligation hereunder unless Seller can show that it
was materially prejudiced by the Indemnified Party's failure to give notice.
The Indemnified Party will deliver to Seller, promptly after the Indemnified
Party's receipt thereof, copies of all notices and documents (including court
papers) relating to the Third Party Claim received by the Indemnified Party
from the Person that instituted the Third Party Claim.

  

  

(c) Seller will have the right to participate in or assume the defense of the
Third Party Claim (in either case at the expense of Seller) with counsel of
its choice reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party; provided,
however, that Seller may assume the defense of the Third Party Claim, subject
to Section 11.4(d), only so long as (i) Seller delivers written notice to the
Indemnified Party of its election to assume the defense of the Third Party
Claim within twenty (20) Business Days of receipt of written notice of such
Third Party Claim from the Indemnified Party; (ii) Seller acknowledges in
writing to the Indemnified Party that Seller is obligated to indemnify the
Indemnified Party in full for such Third Party Claim hereunder; (iii) the
Third Party Claim involves solely monetary damages (and does not seek an
injunction or other equitable relief or involve criminal allegations) and (iv)
if successful, the Third Party Claim would not restrict or adversely affect
the Indemnified Party or the conduct of its or its Affiliates' businesses or
operations in a material manner. Should Seller so elect to assume the defense
of a Third Party Claim, Seller shall not be liable to the Indemnified Party
for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Party
in connection with the defense thereof; provided that Seller shall pay for one
additional counsel (plus any required local counsel) for all Indemnified
Parties if there is a conflict of interest or substantially different defenses
that make it inappropriate to have common counsel for Seller and the
Indemnified Party. If Seller is conducting the defense of the Third Party
Claim in accordance with the provisions above, the Indemnified Party, at its
sole cost and expense, may retain separate counsel, and participate in the
defense of the Third Party Claim, it being understood that Seller will control
such defense, subject to Section 11.4(d). If Seller has not assumed the
defense of such Third Party Claim within twenty (20) Business Days of receipt
of written notice of such Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party will (upon
delivering written notice to such effect to Seller) have the right to
undertake, at Seller's sole cost and expense, the defense of such Third Party
Claim. Each party shall reasonably cooperate with the other party in such
defense and make available to the party undertaking the defense of the Third
Party Claim, on a mutually convenient basis, witnesses, pertinent records,
materials and information in such party's possession or under such party's
control relating to such Third Party Claim as may be reasonably requested by
the party undertaking the defense of the Third Party Claim.

  

  

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 11.4 to the contrary, neither
Seller nor the Indemnified Party shall, without the written consent of the
other party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or conditioned),
settle, compromise or discharge any Third Party Claim or admit any Liability
or permit a default or consent to entry of any judgment with respect to any
Third Party Claim; provided that, if Seller assumes the defense of any Third
Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall not be required to agree to any
settlement, compromise or discharge of such Third Party Claim which Seller may
recommend unless (i) by its terms it obligates Seller to pay the full amount
of Losses in connection with

  

  

77

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

such Third Party Claim and unconditionally release the Indemnified Party
completely from all Liability in connection with such Third Party Claim, (ii)
it does not restrict or adversely affect the Indemnified Party or the conduct
of its or its Affiliates' businesses or operations in a material manner, (iii)
it does not include an admission of wrongdoing or misconduct by the
Indemnified Party, and (iv) it does not impose any injunctive or other
equitable relief against the Indemnified Party.

  

  

Section 11.5 Exclusive Remedy. Subject to Section 12.10 and except for claims
based on fraud or criminal misconduct, notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, the remedies set forth in this Article
11 shall be the sole and exclusive remedy for Purchaser for any breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or other provision contained in this
Agreement by Seller. Except for claims based on fraud or criminal misconduct,
in the event Seller is required to make a payment to an Indemnified Party
pursuant to the terms of Section 11.2, such payment shall be satisfied first
by the Escrow Amount and in the event that such Escrow Amount is exhausted,
Seller shall not be responsible for any additional payments in excess of
$3,000,000.

parties and their respective Affiliates, representatives and agents in respect
of such subject matter. This Agreement shall not be assigned by any party
hereto without the prior written consent of the other parties hereto;

under this Agreement in whole or in part to any of its Affiliates without the
prior written consent of Seller (provided that Purchaser shall remain liable
hereunder following any such assignment); (b) Purchaser may assign its rights
and obligations under this Agreement in whole or in part in connection with
(i) a merger, consolidation or scheme or arrangement involving Purchaser or
any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) a sale of stock or assets of Purchaser or any of

ACCORDANCE WITH, AND THE RIGHTS OF THE PARTIES SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, THE LAWS
OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO ANY CHOICE OR CONFLICT OF

JURISDICTION) THAT WOULD CAUSE THE APPLICATION OF THE LAWS OF ANY JURISDICTION
OTHER THAN THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

and the article and section captions used herein are for convenience of
reference only and shall not affect the interpretation or construction hereof.
Whenever the context requires, the gender of all words used in this Agreement
includes the masculine, feminine, and neuter. All references to Articles and
Sections refer to articles and sections of this Agreement. Where any provision
in this Agreement refers to action to be taken by any Person, or which such
Person is prohibited from taking, such provision will be applicable whether
such action is taken directly or indirectly by such Person, including actions
taken by or on behalf of any Affiliate of such Person. Unless the context
otherwise requires: (a) a reference to a document includes all amendments,
modifications or supplements to, or replacements or novations of, that
document; (b) the use of the term "including" means "including, without
limitation"; (c) the word "or" shall be disjunctive but not exclusive; (d)
unless expressly provided otherwise, the measure of a period of one (1) month
or year for purposes of this Agreement shall be that date of the following
month or year corresponding to the starting date; provided that if no

(1) month following February 18 is March 18, and one (1) month following March
31 is May 1); (e) a reference to a statute, regulation, proclamation,
ordinance or by-law includes all statutes, regulations, proclamations,
ordinances or by-laws amending, consolidating or replacing it, whether passed
by the same or another Governmental Authority with legal power to do so, and a

reference to a word defined hereunder shall apply equally to both the singular

their mutual intent, and no rule of strict construction shall be applied
against any party hereto.

  

  

Section 12.5 Company Disclosure Schedule. Each Section of the Company
Disclosure Schedule shall specifically reference by Section and subsection any
representation or warranty that is being qualified (it being understood and
agreed that only the representations or warranties specifically referenced in
the Company Disclosure Schedule by the Sections or Subsections of Article 4
and Article 6 shall be qualified by the referenced disclosure, provided that
the disclosure of any item in the Company Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed
to have been disclosed with respect to other representations or warranties in
Article 4 and Article 6 if the relevance of such disclosure to such other
representations or warranties in Article 4 and Article 6 is readily apparent
on its face). Neither the specification of any dollar amount in the
representations or warranties contained in this Agreement nor the inclusion of
any specific item in the Company Disclosure Schedule hereto is intended to
imply that such amounts, or higher or lower amounts of the items so included
or other items, are or are not material or that such fact or matter would with
any other fact or matter, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material
Adverse Effect.

  

  

Section 12.6 Parties in Interest. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto and its successors and
permitted assigns and, except as provided in Article 11, nothing in this
Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other
Person any rights, benefits or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by
reason of this Agreement.

  

  

Section 12.7 Severability and Precedence. If any term or other provision of
this Agreement is invalid, illegal or unenforceable, all other provisions of
this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect so long as the economic
or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in
any manner materially adverse to any party hereto. The parties hereto
acknowledge and agree that the Act of Transfer is being entered into in order
to facilitate the transfer of the Interests and registration pursuant to
Kazakhstan Law. In the event of a conflict between the Act of Transfer and
this Agreement, the provisions of this Agreement as between the parties hereto
shall prevail.

Section 12.8 Counterparts; Facsimile Signatures. This Agreement may be
executed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an
original, but all of which shall constitute one and the same agreement.
Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by
facsimile or scanned pages shall be effective as delivery of a manually
executed counterpart to this Agreement.

  

  

Section 12.9 Arbitration.

  

  

(a) It is understood and agreed among the parties hereto that any and all
claims, grievances, demands, controversies, causes of action or disputes of
any nature whatsoever (including but not limited to tort and contract claims,
and claims upon any Law, statute, Order, or regulation) (collectively,
"Claims"), arising out of, in connection with, or in relation to (i) the
interpretation, performance or breach of this Agreement (including any Claims
relating to any party's right to indemnification pursuant to Article 11) or
(ii) the arbitrability of any Claims under this Agreement, shall be resolved
by final and binding arbitration before a retired judge from the
JAMS/Endispute panel. Such dispute resolution process shall be confidential
and the arbitration portion shall be conducted in accordance with the Federal
Rules of Evidence.

  

  

(b) The parties agree to submit all remaining Claims to final and binding
arbitration administered by the New York offices of JAMS/Endispute in
accordance with the then-existing JAMS/Endispute Arbitration Rules, except to
the extent such rules conflict with the procedures set forth in this Section
12.9, in which case these procedures shall govern. The parties shall select a
mutually acceptable neutral arbitrator from the panel of arbitrators serving
with any of JAMS/Endispute's offices, but in the event the parties cannot
agree on an arbitrator, the Administrator of JAMS/Endispute shall appoint an
arbitrator from such panel (the arbitrator so selected or appointed, the
"Arbitrator"). The parties expressly agree that the Arbitrator may provide all
appropriate remedies (at law and equity) or judgments that could be awarded by
a court of law in New York, and that, upon good cause shown, the Arbitrator
shall afford the parties adequate discovery, including deposition discovery.
Neither a party nor the Arbitrator shall disclose the existence, content, or
results of any arbitration hereunder without the prior written consent of all
parties. Except as provided herein, the Federal Arbitration Act shall govern
the interpretation, enforcement and all Claims pursuant to this Section 12.9.
The Arbitrator shall be bound by and shall strictly enforce the terms of this
Section 12.9 and may not limit, expand or otherwise modify its terms. The
Arbitrator shall make a good faith effort to apply the substantive Law (and
the Law of remedies, if applicable) of the State of New York, or federal Law,
or both, as applicable, without reference to its conflicts of laws provisions.
The Arbitrator is without jurisdiction to apply any different substantive Law.
The Arbitrator shall be bound to honor claims of privilege or work-product
doctrine recognized at Law, but the Arbitrator shall have the discretion to
determine whether any such claim of privilege or work product doctrine
applies. The Arbitrator

  

  

82

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

  

shall render an award and a written, reasoned opinion in support thereof. The
Arbitrator shall have power and authority to award any appropriate remedy (in
law or equity) or judgment that could be awarded by a court of law in New
York, which may include reasonable attorneys' fees to the prevailing party.
The award rendered by arbitration shall be final and binding upon the parties,
and judgment upon the award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction
thereof.

  

  

(c) Adherence to this dispute resolution process shall not limit the parties'
right to obtain any provisional remedy, including, without limitation,
injunctive or similar relief, from any court of competent jurisdiction as may
be necessary to protect their rights and interests. Notwithstanding the
foregoing sentence, this dispute resolution procedure is intended to be the
exclusive method of resolving any Claims arising out of or relating to this
Agreement.

  

  

(d) Subject to the Arbitrator's award, each party shall bear its own fees and
expenses with respect to this dispute resolution process and any Claim related
thereto and the parties shall share equally the fees and expenses of the
mediator, JAMS/Endispute and the Arbitrator.

  

  

Section 12.10 Remedies. Subject to Section 10.2(d), the parties hereto agree
that irreparable damage could occur if any provision of this Agreement were
not performed in accordance with the terms hereof and that the parties shall
be entitled, without posting a bond or similar indemnity, to seek an
injunction to prevent breaches of this Agreement or specific performance of
the terms and provisions hereof, in addition to any other remedy to which they
are entitled at law or in equity. All rights and remedies of any party hereto
are cumulative of each other, and the exercise of one or more rights or
remedies shall not prejudice or impair the concurrent or subsequent exercise
of other rights or remedies.

  

  

Section 12.11 Further Assurances. In connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, each party hereto shall execute and deliver
any additional documents and instruments and perform any additional acts that
may be necessary or appropriate to effectuate and perform the provisions of
this Agreement and such transactions.

  

  

Section 12.12 Failure or Indulgence not Waiver. No failure or delay on the
part of any party hereto in the exercise of any right hereunder shall impair
such right or be construed to be waiver of, or acquiescence in, any breach of
any representation, warranty or agreement herein, nor shall any single or
partial exercise of any such right preclude any other or further exercise
thereof or any other right. All rights and remedies existing under this
Agreement are cumulative to, and not exclusive of, any rights or remedies
otherwise available.

  

  

Section 12.13 Amendments. This Agreement may not be amended, supplemented or
otherwise modified except in a written instrument executed by the parties
hereto.

  

  

83

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

Section 12.14 Fees and Expenses. Except as otherwise expressly provided in
this Agreement, all fees, charges and expenses incurred in connection with
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the
party incurring such fees, charges or expenses.
