Contracts, up to, but not to exceed, in the aggregate, One Hundred Twenty
Thousand Dollars ($120,000); (c) all Liabilities of Seller arising from the ownership or operation of the

(e) all Liabilities that Purchaser has agreed to assume, pay or discharge

provided, however, in no event shall the Assumed Liabilities include any

2.4 Excluded Liabilities. Purchaser will not assume and will be deemed not to
have assumed, and Seller will remain liable with respect to, any Liabilities
of Seller attributable to, arising out of or related to: (a) the Excluded
Assets, (b) all claims for bodily injury or death or loss of property with
respect to the ownership or operation of the Purchased Assets, in each case to
the extent resulting from, arising from or attributable to periods prior to

One Hundred Twenty Thousand Dollars ($120,000) (collectively, clauses (a)
through (i), the "Excluded Liabilities").

2.5 Non-Assignment of Assets. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, this Agreement will not constitute an agreement to
assign or transfer, and will not effect the assignment or transfer of any
Purchased Asset if (a) an attempted assignment thereof, without the approval,
authorization or consent of, or granting or issuance of any license or permit
by, any Third Party thereto, would (i) constitute a breach thereof or in any
way adversely affect the rights of Purchaser thereunder, (ii) would result in
the payment by Purchaser of any material amount or assumption by Purchaser of
any material liability, (iii) would reasonably be likely to result in an
assignment of the Purchased Assets to Purchaser that is void or voidable, or
(iv) result in the express termination of any material rights in relation to
such Purchased Asset, and (b) the Bankruptcy Court has not entered an Order
providing that any consent described in this Section 2.5 is not required for
purposes of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (or any such
consent is otherwise not required under applicable Law) and Purchaser shall
have no further obligations or liability thereunder after Closing with respect
to noncompliance with any consent provision as part of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (each such approval,
authorization, consent, license or permit described in clauses (a) and (b), a
"Necessary Consent"). Seller and Purchaser will use their commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain the Necessary Consents with respect to any such
Purchased Asset or any claim or right or any benefit arising thereunder for
the assignment thereof to Purchaser as Purchaser may reasonably request;
provided, however, that neither Seller nor Purchaser will be obligated to pay
any consideration therefor to any Third Party from whom consent or approval is
requested or to initiate any litigation or Legal Proceedings to obtain any
such consent or approval. If such Necessary Consent is not obtained on or
prior to Closing, then Purchaser may elect to exclude the Purchased Asset
subject to such Necessary Consent and (i) the Unadjusted Cash Amount shall be
reduced by the Allocated Value of such Purchased Assets, (ii) such Purchased
Assets shall be deemed to be deleted from Schedule 2.1(a)(i), Schedule
2.1(a)(ii), Schedule 2.1(a)(iii), Schedule 2.1(a)(x), Schedule 2.1(a)(xii) or
Schedule 2.1(a)(xiii), as applicable, attached hereto and added to Schedule
2.5 and (iii) such Purchased Assets shall constitute an Excluded Asset for all
purposes hereunder. If any such Necessary Consent requirement with respect to
which an adjustment to the Unadjusted Cash Amount is made under this Section
2.5 is subsequently satisfied prior to the final determination of the Final
Settlement Statement, (A) Seller shall, promptly after such Necessary Consent
requirement is satisfied, convey the applicable Purchased Asset to Purchaser,
(B) the parties shall deliver all instruments and documents that would have
been required under the terms hereof to be delivered at Closing with respect
to such Purchased Asset at Closing, (C) Purchaser shall, simultaneously with
the conveyance of the applicable Purchased Asset, pay the amount of any
previous deduction from the Unadjusted Cash Amount (subject to all other
applicable adjustments with respect to such Purchased Asset hereunder) to
Seller, and (D) such Purchased Asset shall no longer be deemed to be (1)
deleted from Schedule 2.1(a)(i), Schedule 2.1(a)(ii), Schedule 2.1(a)(iii),
Schedule 2.1(a)(x), Schedule 2.1(a)(xii) or Schedule 2.1(a)(xiii), as
applicable, (2) added to Schedule 2.5 attached hereto, and (3) an Excluded
Asset for any purposes hereunder. For clarity, if the Geokinetics USA Inc.
license agreement set forth on Schedule 2.1(a)(xii) is made an Excluded Asset
pursuant to the terms of this Section 2.5, then there shall be no adjustment
to the Unadjusted Cash Amount.

2.6 Further Conveyances and Assumptions. From time to time following the
Closing, Seller and Purchaser will, and will cause their respective Affiliates
to, execute, acknowledge and deliver all such further conveyances, notices,
assumptions, assignments, releases and other instruments, and will take such
further actions, as may be reasonably necessary or appropriate to assure fully
to Purchaser and its respective successors or assigns, all of the Purchased
Assets and properties, rights, titles, interests, estates, remedies, powers
and privileges intended to be conveyed to Purchaser under this Agreement and
to assure fully to Seller and its Affiliates and their successors and assigns,
the assumption of the Assumed Liabilities intended to be assumed by Purchaser
under this Agreement, and to otherwise make effective the transactions
contemplated hereby. Moreover, to the extent that an Affiliate of Seller,
other than Coal Gas Recovery II LLC, owns Oil and Gas leases or subleases or
Oil and Gas rights held in fee within the Project Area (other than leases and
rights in fee related to coal bed methane gas, coal mine methane gas and gob
gas) which are not otherwise conveyed or assigned pursuant to this Agreement,
Seller will cause such Affiliate to convey such interests to Purchaser by
appropriate instrument. III. CONSIDERATION; ADJUSTMENT

3.1 Consideration. The aggregate consideration for the Purchased Assets (the
"Purchase Price") will be:

(a) an amount in cash equal to Three Hundred Thirty Nine Million Five Hundred
Thousand Dollars ($339,500,000.00) (the "Unadjusted Cash Amount," as may be
adjusted pursuant to the terms of Section 2.1 of Appendix A, such adjusted
amount, the "Adjusted Cash Amount"); and

(b) the assumption of the Assumed Liabilities.

3.2 Purchase Price Deposit. Pursuant to the Bidding Procedures Order, on or

Purchaser shall deposit in a segregated bank account designated by Seller and

$10,000,000 (such amount, together with all accrued investment income thereon,
the "Deposit Amount"), which will be disbursed as follows:

(a) if the Closing occurs, the Deposit Amount and all accrued investment
income thereon shall be disbursed in accordance with Section 3.3 below;

(b) if this Agreement is terminated by Seller pursuant to Section 4.4(d) or
Section 4.4(f) and all conditions to Closing of Purchaser have been satisfied
(other than where such conditions to Closing of Purchaser are not satisfied
solely as a result of Purchaser's breach of this Agreement), the Deposit
Amount, together with all accrued investment income thereon, will be disbursed
to Seller; and

(c) if this Agreement is terminated for any reason (other than by Seller
pursuant to Section 4.4(d) or Section 4.4(f) and for which Seller is entitled
to the Deposit Amount under Section 3.2(b)), the Deposit Amount, together with
all accrued investment income thereon, will be returned to Purchaser.

3.3 Payment of Closing Payment. On the Closing Date, (a) Purchaser will pay an
amount equal to the Adjusted Cash Amount (less the Deposit Amount) to Seller
in immediately available funds to an account designated by Seller (such
amount, the "Closing Payment"), and (b) the entirety of the Deposit Amount
shall be disbursed to Seller, together with all accrued interest income
thereon.

3.4 Apportionments. (a) To the extent the following expenses (and credits
therefor to the extent paid prior to the Closing Date) relate to a Purchased
Asset in respect of a period that begins prior to the Effective Time and ends
after the Effective Time, such expenses (and credits) will be apportioned
between Seller, on the one hand, and Purchaser, on the other hand, as of the
Effective Time: (i) rent and other periodic contractual charges (including royalties and other
amounts designated as additional rent under a Contract) for the month in which
the Closing Date occurs;

(ii) annual utility assessments, water meter charges, and sewer rents, if any,
on the basis of the year for which assessed; and

(iii) charges and fees payable for telephone services, water, heat, steam,
electric power, gas and other utilities, at the price charged by the
suppliers, including any taxes thereon and based upon applicable meter
readings, where available, made on or immediately prior to or immediately
after the Closing Date.

(b) If, after apportioning the foregoing expenses, a party has borne more than
its allocable share of such expenses, the other parties will promptly make the
appropriate compensating payment(s) to such party.

IV. CLOSING AND TERMINATION

4.1 Closing Date. Subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in
Sections 10.1, 10.2 and 10.3 hereof (or the waiver thereof by the party

Purchased Assets and the assumption of the Assumed Liabilities provided for in
Article II hereof (the "Closing") will take place at the office of Jackson

V. BANKRUPTCY COURT APPROVAL

Bankruptcy Court and the consideration by Seller of higher or better competing
bids with respect to any asset sale, stock sale, merger or reorganization
pursuant to Bankruptcy Code section 363 or under any chapter 11 plan of
reorganization the effect of which would be the direct or indirect transfer of
all or substantially all of the Purchased Assets or equity interests in a
single transaction or a series of related transactions to one or more parties
other than Purchaser or its Affiliates, or any similar transaction that does
not involve a sale of the Purchased Assets to Purchaser (each a "Competing
Transaction"). Following completion of the auction contemplated by the Bidding
Procedures Order, Seller is not permitted to cause its respective
representatives and Affiliates to initiate contact with, solicit or encourage
submission of any inquiries, proposals or offers by, any Person (in addition
to Purchaser and its Affiliates, agents and representatives) in connection
with any sale or other disposition of the Purchased Assets. In addition,
unless otherwise directed by the Bankruptcy Court, Seller shall not after
completion of the auction contemplated in the Bidding Procedures Order respond
to any inquiries or offers to purchase all or any part of the Purchased Assets
or perform any other acts related thereto, including supplying information
relating to the Business and the assets of Seller to prospective buyers.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 5.2, the restrictions
in the preceding two sentences shall not apply following the auction
contemplated in the Bidding Procedures Order to the Person, if any, submitting
a bid for a Competing Transaction at the auction contemplated in the Bidding
Procedures Order if such Person prevails at the auction.

5.3 Bankruptcy Court Approval.

(a) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Seller and the
Seller's ability to consummate the transactions set forth in this Agreement
are subject, among other things, to the entry of the Sale Order.

(b) In the event an appeal is taken or a stay pending appeal is requested from
the Sale Order, Seller shall promptly notify Purchaser of such appeal or stay
request and shall provide to Purchaser promptly a copy of the related notice
of appeal or order of stay. Seller shall also provide Purchaser with written
notice of any motion or application filed in connection with any appeal from
either of such orders.

(c) From and after the date of execution of this Agreement and prior to the
Closing or the termination of this Agreement in accordance with Section 4.4,
Seller shall not take any action which is intended to (or is reasonably likely
to), or fail to take any action the intent (or the reasonably likely result)
of which failure to act is to, result in the reversal, voiding, modification
or staying of the Sale Order or this Agreement.

5.4 Bankruptcy Filings. From and after the date of execution of this Agreement
and until the Closing Date, Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to deliver to Purchaser copies of all pleadings, motions, notices, statements,
schedules, applications, reports and other papers that relate, in whole or in
part, to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, or to
Purchaser or their respective agents or representatives, that are to be filed
by Seller in the Bankruptcy Case in advance of their filing, in each case, if
reasonably practicable under the circumstances before the filing of such
papers. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Seller's inadvertent failure to comply with this Section 5.4, nor Seller's
failure to comply with this Section 5.4 due to emergency circumstances, shall
constitute a breach under this Agreement.

VI. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SELLER

Seller hereby represents and warrants to Purchaser that:

the requisite company power and authority to own, lease and operate its
properties and to carry on its business as now conducted. Seller is duly
qualified or licensed to do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature
of its business or the ownership or leasing of its properties makes such

Effect.

6.2 Authorization of Agreement. Subject to entry and ongoing effectiveness of
the Sale Order and such other authorization as is required by the Bankruptcy
Court, Seller has the requisite company power and authority to execute and
deliver this Agreement and each other agreement, document or instrument

agreement, document or instrument contemplated hereby or thereby to which it
is a party constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of Seller
enforceable against Seller in accordance with its respective terms, subject to
general principles of equity, including principles of commercial
reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing (regardless of whether enforcement
is sought in a proceeding at Law or in equity).

6.3 Conflicts; Consents of Third Parties. (a) Except as set forth on Schedule
6.3(a), the execution and delivery by Seller of this Agreement and each other
agreement, document or instrument contemplated hereby or thereby to which it
is a party, the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby and compliance by Seller with any of the provisions hereof do not

notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise to a right of
termination or cancellation under any provision of (i) the certificate of
incorporation and by-laws or comparable organizational documents of Seller;
(ii) subject to entry of the Sale Order, any Contract or Permit to which
Seller is a party or by which any of the properties or assets of Seller are
bound; (iii) subject to entry of the Sale Order, any Order of any Governmental
Body applicable to Seller or any of the properties or assets of Seller as of
the date hereof; or (iv) subject to entry of the Sale Order and subject to

(iii) and (iv), such conflicts, violations, defaults, terminations or cancellations that
would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Seller Material Adverse Effect.

(b) Except as set forth on Schedule 6.3(b) and except to the extent not
required if the Sale Order is entered, no consent, waiver, approval, Order,
Permit or authorization of, or declaration or filing with, or notification to,

(ii) the entry of the Sale Order.

the parties to, and date of, each Lease. To Seller's Knowledge, Seller has
good and marketable fee title to all Oil and Gas Fee Properties, free and
clear of all Encumbrances of any nature whatsoever except for (i) Encumbrances
set forth on Schedule 6.4 that in each case would not individually or in the
aggregate be reasonably likely to result in a Title Reduction and (ii) the
Permitted Exceptions. Seller has made available to Purchaser true and complete
copies of each Lease, and any and all amendments, modifications, supplements,
exhibits, restatements, guarantees and other agreements (whether written or
oral), in each case related thereto, in its possession and control. To
Seller's Knowledge, Seller has good and marketable leasehold interests in the
real property conveyed by the Leases. To Seller's Knowledge, each Lease is in
full force and effect, and is valid, binding and enforceable in accordance
with its terms. Seller has not received any written notice of (i) any default

by fire or other casualty.

respects and (ii) Seller and its Affiliates have timely paid all Taxes
attributable to the Purchased Assets (including applicable unclaimed property
and escheatment obligations) due and payable by it, as shown on its Tax
Returns or otherwise payable.

(b) Except to the extent a lien constitutes a Permitted Exception, there are
no liens on any of the Purchased Assets attributable to Taxes.

(c) No audit, litigation or other proceeding with respect to Asset Taxes has
been commenced or is presently pending, and neither Seller nor its Affiliates
have received any written notice of any pending claim against it (which
remains outstanding) from any applicable Tax Authority for assessment of Asset
Taxes and, to Seller's Knowledge, no such claim has been threatened.

(d) The assets that constitute the Tangible Personal Property are capital
assets of Seller that have been used in the ordinary course of Seller's
business of producing, gathering, treating, transporting and selling
Hydrocarbons, and Seller is not ordinarily engaged in the business of selling
tangible personal property such as these capital assets.

(e) Seller is not a foreign person within the meaning of section 1445(f)(3) of
the Code.

(f) No portion of the Purchased Assets owned by Seller or its Affiliates (i)

a tax partnership; or (iii) otherwise constitutes "partnership property" (as
that term is used throughout Subchapter K of Chapter 1 of Subtitle A of the
Code) of a tax partnership. For purposes of this Section 6.6(f), a "tax
partnership" is any entity, organization or group deemed to be a partnership
within the meaning of section 761 of the Code or any similar federal statute,
rule or regulation, and that is not excluded from the application of the
partnership provisions of Subchapter K of Chapter 1 of Subtitle A of the Code

such similar federal statutes, rules and regulations, to be excluded from the
application of all such partnership provisions.

available to Purchaser a list (the "Employee List") setting forth such
Employee's (i) name; (ii) employer; (iii) department/function; (iv) title or
job/position; (v) job designation (i.e., salaried or hourly); (vi) location of

there are no labor or collective bargaining agreements that pertain to the
Employees of Seller. No labor organization or group of employees of Seller
that includes any Employee has made a pending demand for recognition, and there are no representation proceedings or
petitions seeking a representation currently pending or, to Seller's
Knowledge, threatened to be brought or filed with the National Labor Relations
Board or other labor relations tribunal. There is no organizing activity
involving Seller pending, or to Seller's Knowledge, threatened by any labor
organization or group of employees of Seller. There are no strikes, work

6.8 Validity of PLR Contracts. Schedule 2.1(a)(xii) sets forth any and all
material PLR Contracts that are binding on the Purchased Assets. Each of the
PLR Contracts is in full force and effect and a valid and binding obligation
of Seller and, to the Knowledge of Seller, the other parties thereto in
accordance with its terms and conditions, except as such validity and
enforceability may be limited by: (a) bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar
laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally; and (b)
equitable principles of general applicability (whether considered in a
proceeding at law or in equity). To Seller's Knowledge, as of the date of this
Agreement, other than with respect to the Bankruptcy Case, no event has
occurred that, with the passage of time or the giving of notice, or both,
would constitute a default under or a violation of any such PLR Contract or
would cause the acceleration of any obligation of Seller or its Affiliates or,
to the Knowledge of Seller, any other party thereto or the creation of an
Encumbrance upon any Purchased Asset. Prior to the date hereof, Seller has
made available to Purchaser complete and accurate copies of all PLR Contracts
and Leases, and any and all amendments thereto. Except for the PLR Contracts,
neither Seller nor its Affiliates are obligated under any PLR Contract for the
sale, processing, transportation, gathering or marketing of Hydrocarbons from
the Purchased Assets and neither Seller nor its Affiliates have received any
prepayments or buydowns such that Purchaser will be obligated after the
Effective Time to make deliveries of Hydrocarbons without receiving full
payment therefor.

preferential rights to purchase, rights of first opportunity or other rights
of any Person to acquire, or to be granted any interest in any of the
Purchased Assets.

6.10 Litigation. Except as set forth on Schedule 6.10, as of the date hereof
there are no material Legal Proceedings pending before any Governmental Body
or, to the Knowledge of Seller, threatened against Seller or its Affiliates
(a) with respect to the ownership or operation of the Purchased Assets or (b)
the execution, delivery and consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereunder.

6.11 Compliance with Laws. Except with respect to Environmental Laws (which
are addressed exclusively in Section 6.12), to the Knowledge of Seller, Seller
and its Affiliates (a) are in material compliance with all Laws applicable to
the operation of the Purchased Assets; and (b) have all material Permits,
licenses, consents, authorizations, permit applications and other approvals of
Governmental Bodies as are required for the operation of the Purchased Assets
as presently operated. 6.12 Environmental Matters; Environmental Permits. (a) Seller's and its
Affiliates' ownership and operation of the Purchased Assets is in material
compliance with all applicable Environmental Laws and such compliance includes
Seller's or its Affiliates' obtaining, maintaining and renewing all
Environmental Permits required for the operation of the Purchased Assets, (b)

notice from any Person alleging (i) a violation or potential violation of
Environmental Laws or (ii) Liability for a Remedial Action or other
Environmental Liabilities, and (c) there is no investigation, action or
proceeding pending, or, to the Knowledge of Seller, threatened that could
reasonably be expected to result in Seller or its Affiliates incurring any
material liability pursuant to any applicable Environmental Law in connection
with the Business or the Purchased Assets. All Environmental Permits,
licenses, consents, authorizations, permit applications and other approvals of
Governmental Bodies and all bonds or other collateral posted by Seller and its
Affiliates in connection therewith are set forth on Schedule 2.1(a)(xiii).
This Section 6.12 represents the sole and exclusive representation and
warranty of Seller regarding environmental matters.

will be paid by Seller, no Person engaged by Seller or its Affiliates is
entitled to any fee or commission or similar payment from Purchaser in respect
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

6.14 Equipment; Sufficiency of the Assets. Except as would not have a
Purchaser Material Adverse Effect, all of the Tangible Personal Property is in
a state of reasonable repair (ordinary wear and tear excepted) so as to be
suitable for the purposes of which such equipment was constructed, obtained or
is currently being used in all material respects.

6.15 Non-Consent Operations. No operations are being conducted or have been
conducted on the Oil and Gas Assets with respect to which Seller or its
Affiliates have elected to be a non-consenting party under the applicable
operating agreement and with respect to which all of Seller's or its
Affiliates' rights have not yet reverted to it.

6.16 Payment of Royalties. All royalties, overriding royalties, reversionary
interests, net profit interests, production payments, carried interests, non-
participating royalty interests, reversionary interests and other royalty
burdens and other interests payable out of production of Hydrocarbons from or

(other than royalties held in suspense and in good faith by Seller), which are
payable by Seller, have been properly and correctly paid, and, to Seller's
Knowledge, if payable by Third Parties, have been properly and correctly paid.

6.17 No Other Representations or Warranties; Schedules. EXCEPT FOR THE
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES CONTAINED IN THIS ARTICLE VI (AS MODIFIED OR

INSTRUMENTS, AGREEMENTS AND CERTIFICATES DELIVERED HEREUNDER BY OR ON BEHALF
OF SELLER HEREUNDER, INCLUDING THE DEEDS AND THE ASSIGNMENT AND BILL OF SALE,

RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY, PROJECTION, FORECAST,

PROVIDED TO PURCHASER BY ANY DIRECTOR, OFFICER, EMPLOYEE, AGENT, CONSULTANT OR

reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect. Purchaser is not subject to any Order of
any Governmental Body except to the extent the same would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Purchaser Material
Adverse Effect.

7.5 Financial Advisors. No Person engaged by Purchaser is entitled to any fee
or commission or similar payment from Sellers in respect of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

7.6 Financial Capability. Purchaser will have at Closing available cash and
credit capacity sufficient to pay the Adjusted Cash Amount, to post all bonds
or other collateral (including cash, certificates of deposit and/or letters of
credit) as may be required from time to time by any Governmental Body to
facilitate the transfer of Permits, and any other expenses incurred by
Purchaser in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
For the avoidance of doubt, Purchaser's obligations to complete the
transactions contemplated hereby are not dependent upon or conditioned on
receipt of financing.

7.7 Limited Representations and Warranties. Notwithstanding anything contained
in this Agreement to the contrary, Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that
Seller is not making any representations or warranties whatsoever, express or
implied, beyond those expressly given by Seller in Article VI hereof (as
modified or supplemented by the Schedules hereto) and the other instruments,
agreements and certificates delivered hereunder by or on behalf of Seller,
including the Deeds and Assignments, and Purchaser acknowledges and agrees
that, except for the representations and warranties contained therein, the
Purchased Assets are being transferred on a "where is," and, as to condition,
"as is," basis.

7.8 Independent Evaluation. Purchaser is sophisticated in the evaluation,
purchase, ownership and operation of Oil and Gas properties and related
facilities. In making its decision to enter into this Agreement and to
consummate the transactions contemplated herein, except to the extent of
Seller's express covenants set forth herein, the representations and
warranties in Article VI hereof and the representations, warranties and
covenants set forth in the other instruments, agreements and certificates
delivered hereunder by or on behalf of Seller, including the Deeds and
Assignments, Purchaser has relied or shall rely solely on its own independent
investigation and evaluation of the Purchased Assets and the advice of its own
legal, tax, economic, environmental, engineering, geological and geophysical
advisors and the express provisions of this Agreement and not on any other
comments, statements, projections or other materials made or given by any
representatives or consultants or advisors engaged by Seller.

VIII. COVENANTS

8.1 Bankruptcy Court Filings. Seller will pursue diligently the entry of the
Sale Order under the procedures established under the Bidding Procedures Order
unless Seller's Board of Directors (or applicable committee thereof) concludes
in good faith, after consultation with Seller's outside advisors, that doing
so would be inconsistent with the exercise of its fiduciary duties in the
Bankruptcy Case. Purchaser agrees that it will promptly take such actions as
are reasonably requested by Seller to assist in obtaining entry of the Sale
Order and a finding of adequate assurance of future performance by Purchaser
of the Contracts, including by furnishing affidavits or other documents or information for filing with the
Bankruptcy Court for the purposes, among others, of providing necessary
assurances of performance by Purchaser under this Agreement and demonstrating
that Purchaser is a "good faith" purchaser under section 363(m) of the
Bankruptcy Code and taking such other actions that may be required by the
Bidding Procedures Order. If the entry of the Sale Order is appealed, Seller
and Purchaser will use their respective reasonable efforts to defend such
appeal(s) unless, in Seller's case, Seller's Board of Directors (or applicable
committee thereof) concludes in good faith, after consultation with Seller's
outside advisors, that doing so would be inconsistent with the exercise of its
fiduciary duties in the Bankruptcy Case.

8.2 Access to Information. Prior to the Closing Date, Purchaser will be
entitled, through its officers, employees, consultants and representatives
(including, without limitation, its legal advisors and accountants), to make
such investigation and examination of the Purchased Assets and the Assumed
Liabilities (including, but not limited to, the right to perform an
environmental site assessment) as it reasonably requests and to make extracts
and copies of documents included therein. In the event this transaction does
not close, Purchaser shall provide to Seller a copy of any report(s) received
in connection with an environmental site assessment. Any such investigation
and examination will be conducted upon reasonable advance notice and under
reasonable circumstances and will be subject to restrictions under applicable
Law. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no such investigation or
examination will be permitted to the extent that it would require Seller to
disclose information that is competitively sensitive or subject to attorney-
client privilege.

8.3 Operation or Maintenance of the Purchased Assets and the Business Pending
the Closing.

(a) Except (i) as set forth on Schedule 8.3(a), (ii) as required by applicable
Law, (iii) as otherwise expressly contemplated by this Agreement, or (iv) with
the prior written consent of Purchaser (which will not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed) or the approval of the Bankruptcy Court,
during the period from the date of this Agreement to and through the Closing
Date, Seller will and will cause its Affiliates to:

(i) operate or maintain the Purchased Assets and Business only in the Ordinary
Course of Business;

(ii) use its commercially reasonable efforts to (A) preserve the present
business operations, organization and goodwill of the Business and (B)
preserve the present relationships with customers of the Business; provided,
however, that Seller may act outside of the Ordinary Course of Business as
necessary to comply with the Bankruptcy Code and orders of the Bankruptcy
Court;

(iii) pay or cause to be paid all bonuses and rentals, royalties, overriding
royalties, shut-in royalties, and minimum royalties and development and
operating expenses, and other payments incurred with respect to the Oil and
Gas Assets operated by Seller or its Affiliates except (A) royalties held in
suspense as a result of title issues and that do not give any third party a
right to cancel an interest in any Oil and Gas Assets operated by Seller, and
(B) expenses or royalties being contested in good faith, if Seller or its
Affiliates notifies Purchaser and obtain Purchaser's approval prior to
withholding such payment; and

(iv) maintain and keep the Leases in full force and effect.

(b) Except (i) as set forth on Schedule 8.3(b), (ii) as required by applicable
Law, (iii) as otherwise contemplated by this Agreement or (iv) with the prior
written consent of Purchaser (which will not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed) or the approval of the Bankruptcy Court, during the
period from the date of this Agreement to and through the Closing Date, Seller
will not and will cause its Affiliates not to:

(i) subject any of the Purchased Assets to any Encumbrance, except for
existing Encumbrances and Permitted Exceptions;

(ii) other than in the Ordinary Course of Business, assign, license, sell,
transfer, convey, farmout, release, terminate, amend, supplement, abandon,
lease, sublease, transfer or otherwise dispose of any of the Purchased Assets
(except for the purpose of disposing of obsolete assets);

(iii) waive or release any material right of Seller or its Affiliates that
constitutes a Purchased Asset;

(iv) enter into any Contract or amend, modify, extend, supplement or waive any
rights under any Purchased Asset;

(v) enter into any Hydrocarbon sales, supply, exchange, processing or
transportation contract with respect to the Purchased Assets which is not
terminable without penalty or detriment on notice of sixty (60) days or less;

(vi) commence, propose, or agree to participate in any single operation with
respect to the Oil and Gas Assets with an anticipated cost in excess of Fifty
Thousand Dollars ($50,000), except for emergency operations or operations
required by any Governmental Body; or

(vii) agree to do anything prohibited by this Section 8.3.

8.4 Consents. Seller will use its commercially reasonable efforts, and
Purchaser will cooperate with Seller, to obtain at the earliest practicable
date all consents and approvals contemplated by this Agreement, including,
without limitation, the consents and approvals referred to in Section 6.3(b)
hereof; provided, however, that Seller will not be obligated to pay any
consideration therefor to any Third Party from whom consent or approval is
requested or to initiate any litigation or Legal Proceedings to obtain any
such consent or approval.

8.5 Further Assurances. Subject to the other provisions of this Agreement,
Purchaser and Seller will use their commercially reasonable efforts to (a)
take all actions necessary or appropriate to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and (b) cause the fulfillment at the earliest practicable date of all of the
conditions to their respective obligations to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

8.6 Preservation of Records. Seller and Purchaser agree that each of them will
preserve and keep the records held by it or its Affiliates relating to the
Business for a period of six (6) months from the Closing Date (except as
provided below) and will make such records and personnel available to the
other as may be reasonably required by such party in connection with, among
other things, any insurance claims by, Legal Proceedings or tax audits against
or governmental investigations of Seller or Purchaser or any of their
Affiliates or to enable Seller or Purchaser to comply with their respective
obligations under this Agreement and each other agreement, document or
instrument contemplated hereby and to permit Seller to comply with its
obligations as debtor in the Bankruptcy Case. In the event Seller or Purchaser
wishes to destroy such records before or after that time, such party will
first give sixty (60) days prior written notice to the other and such other
party will have the right at its option and expense, upon prior written notice
given to such party within such sixty (60) day period, to take possession of
the records within ninety (90) days after the date of such notice.

8.7 Publicity. The initial press release concerning this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby will be in substantially the form agreed to
by the parties. None of the parties hereto will issue any press release
concerning this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (and Seller
will cause its Affiliates not to issue any press release) without obtaining
the prior written approval of the other party hereto, which approval will not
be unreasonably withheld or delayed, unless, in the sole judgment of Purchaser
or Seller, disclosure is otherwise required by applicable Law, the rules of
any applicable securities exchange or by the Bankruptcy Court with respect to
filings to be made with the Bankruptcy Court in connection with this
Agreement, provided, however, that the party intending to make such release
shall provide the other party with reasonable advance notice prior to the
public issuance of such release and shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts consistent with such applicable Law or Bankruptcy Court requirement to
consult with the other party with respect to the text thereof. The parties and
Alpha Natural Resources, LLC agree that the confidentiality provisions of this
Agreement shall supersede and replace the confidentiality restrictions in that
certain Confidentiality Agreement dated February 29, 2016 between Purchaser
and Alpha Natural Resources, LLC.

8.8 Supplementation and Amendment of Schedules. For the purpose of avoiding
any misunderstanding, Seller may, at its option, supplement the existing
Schedules in order to reflect any additional matters, except that Seller will
not revise Schedule 2.1(a)(xii) to add any material contracts without the
consent in writing of the Purchaser, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, and Seller will not make any change to Schedule 2.3. Such inclusion,
or any references to dollar amounts, will not be deemed to be an
acknowledgement or representation that such items are material, to establish
any standard of materiality or to define further the meaning of such terms for
purposes of this Agreement. Information provided in one Schedule will suffice,
without repetition or cross reference, as a disclosure of such information in
any other Schedule to which its relevance is reasonably apparent on its face.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 8.8, for all purposes
of determining whether the conditions set forth in Section 10.1 have been satisfied, the Schedules shall
be deemed to include only that information contained therein on the date this
Agreement is executed and shall be deemed to exclude all information contained
in any addition, supplement or amendment thereto.

8.9 Release of Encumbrances. Concurrent with the Closing and except for
Permitted Exceptions, the Seller shall cause the Purchased Assets to be
released from any Encumbrances (if any) encumbering any of the Purchased
Assets pursuant to the Sale Order.

IX. EMPLOYEE AND EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

9.1 Employees. Any time prior to or after the Closing Date, Purchaser may make
an offer of employment commencing as of the Closing Date to any of the
employees listed on Schedule 9.1 (each a "Business Employee") on terms and
conditions determined by Purchaser.

9.2 Employee Matters. Nothing in this Article IX or any other provision of
this Agreement shall (i) confer upon any Employee or any other Person any
right to continue in the employ or service of Purchaser, Seller, or any of
their respective Affiliates, or shall interfere with or restrict in any way
the rights of Purchaser, Seller, or any of their respective Affiliates, which
rights are hereby expressly reserved, to discharge or terminate the services
of any Employee or any other Person at any time for any reason whatsoever,
with or without cause, except to the extent expressly provided otherwise in a
written agreement between Purchaser, Seller, or any of their respective
Affiliates and the applicable Person; (ii) be construed to establish, amend,
or modify any benefit or compensation plan, program, agreement, contract,
policy or arrangement, or (iii) limit the ability of Purchaser, Seller or any
of their respective Affiliates to amend, modify or terminate in accordance
with its terms any benefit or compensation plan, program, agreement, contract,
policy or arrangement at any time adopted, assumed, established, sponsored or
maintained by any of them. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to
the contrary, nothing in this Article IX shall create any Third Party rights
in any Person, including any current or former director, officer, employee or
other service provider of Seller or its Affiliates or any participant in any
Employee Benefit Plan or other compensation or employee benefit plan, program,
policy, agreement or other arrangement (or any beneficiaries or dependents
thereof).

XI. TAXES

other hand, will be responsible for fifty percent (50%) of any sales, use,
documentary, stamp and transfer or similar Taxes arising from or relating to
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and which
are not eliminated through the application of section 1146(a) of the
Bankruptcy Code (collectively, "Transfer Taxes"), regardless of the party on
whom liability is imposed under the provisions of the Laws relating to such
Transfer Taxes. Seller and Purchaser will consult and cooperate in timely
preparing and making all filings, Tax Returns, reports and forms as may be
required to comply with the provisions of the Laws relating to such Transfer

Asset Tax based on the number of days in the applicable period that occur
before the date on which the Effective Time occurs, on the one hand, and the
number of days in such period that occur on or after the date on which the
Effective Time occurs. (c) To the extent the actual amount of an Asset Tax is not determinable at the
time an adjustment to the Unadjusted Cash Amount is to be made with respect to
such Asset Tax pursuant to Section 2 of Appendix A, as applicable, (a) the
parties shall utilize the most recent information available in estimating the
amount of such Asset Tax for purposes of such adjustment, and (b) upon the

XII. MISCELLANEOUS

12.1 No Survival of Representations and Warranties. The parties hereto agree
that the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement will not
survive the Closing hereunder, and none of the parties will have any liability
to each other after the Closing for any breach thereof. The parties hereto
agree that the covenants contained in this Agreement to be performed prior to,
at or after the Closing will survive the Closing hereunder, and each party
hereto will be liable to the other after the Closing for any breach thereof.
Seller will have no future liability under any post-Closing covenant herein or
in any other agreement or instrument entered into in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby in the event that Seller sells all or
substantially all of its assets or effects a plan of liquidation.

12.2 Expenses. Except as set forth in Article XI, each of Seller and Purchaser
will bear its own respective expenses incurred in connection with the
negotiation and execution of this Agreement and each other agreement, document
and instrument contemplated by this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby.

12.3 Injunctive Relief. Damages at Law may be an inadequate remedy for the
breach of any of the covenants, promises and agreements contained in this
Agreement, and, accordingly, any party hereto will be entitled to injunctive
relief with respect to any such breach, including specific performance of such
covenants, promises or agreements or an order enjoining a party from any
threatened, or from the continuation of any actual, breach of the covenants,
promises or agreements contained in this Agreement. The rights set forth in
this Section 12.3 will be in addition to any other rights which a party hereto
may have at law or in equity pursuant to this Agreement.

12.4 Submission to Jurisdiction; Consent to Service of Process. (a) Without
limiting any party's right to appeal any order of the Bankruptcy Court, (i)
the Bankruptcy Court will retain exclusive jurisdiction to enforce the terms
of this Agreement and the Sale Order and to decide any claims or disputes that
may arise or result from, or be connected with, this Agreement, any breach or
default hereunder or the transactions contemplated hereby, and (ii) any and all proceedings related to the foregoing will be filed and maintained only
in the Bankruptcy Court, and the parties hereby consent to and submit to the
jurisdiction and venue of the Bankruptcy Court and will receive notices at
such locations as indicated in Section 12.8 hereof; provided, however, that if
the Bankruptcy Cases have been closed pursuant to section 350 of the
Bankruptcy Code, and have not been reopened after request of the parties, the
parties agree to unconditionally and irrevocably submit to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Western District of
Pennsylvania or the state courts for the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and any
appellate court from any thereof, for the resolution of any such claim or
dispute. The parties hereby irrevocably waive, to the fullest extent permitted
by applicable Law, any objection that they may now or hereafter have to the
laying of venue of any such dispute brought in such court or any defense of
inconvenient forum for the maintenance of such dispute. Each of the parties
hereto agrees that a judgment in any such dispute may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law.

(b) Each of the parties hereto hereby consents to process being served by any
party to this Agreement in any suit, action or proceeding by delivery of a
copy thereof in accordance with the provisions of Section 12.8.

12.5 Waiver of Right to Trial by Jury. Each party to this Agreement waives any
right to trial by jury in any action, matter or proceeding regarding this
Agreement or any provision hereof.

12.6 Entire Agreement; Amendments and Waivers. This Agreement (including the
Schedules and Exhibits hereto), the Escrow Agreement and the other documents
and instruments delivered by the parties hereunder represents the entire
understanding and agreement between the parties hereto with respect to the
subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements between the parties
relating to such subject matter. This Agreement can be amended, supplemented
or changed, and any provision hereof can be waived, only by written instrument
making specific reference to this Agreement signed by the party against whom
enforcement of any such amendment, supplement, modification or waiver is
sought. No action taken pursuant to this Agreement, including, without
limitation, any investigation by or on behalf of any party, will be deemed to
constitute a waiver by the party taking such action of compliance with any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein. The waiver
by any party hereto of a breach of any provision of this Agreement will not
operate or be construed as a further or continuing waiver of such breach or as
a waiver of any other or subsequent breach. No failure on the part of any
party to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right, power or remedy
hereunder will operate as a waiver thereof, nor will any single or partial
exercise of such right, power or remedy by such party preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or remedy.
All remedies hereunder are cumulative and are not exclusive of any other
remedies provided by Law.

12.7 Governing Law. This Agreement will be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania applicable to
contracts made and performed in such State and, where applicable, federal law,
including the Bankruptcy Code. 12.8 Notices. All notices and other communications under this Agreement will
be in writing and will be deemed given (a) when delivered personally by hand,

12.9 Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any law or public policy,
all other terms or provisions of this Agreement will nevertheless remain in
full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the
transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto will
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner so that
the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated as originally
contemplated to the greatest extent possible.

12.10 Assignment. This Agreement will be binding upon and inure to the benefit
of the parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns. Nothing
in this Agreement will create or be deemed to create any Third Party
beneficiary rights in any Person or entity not a party to this Agreement. No
assignment of this Agreement or of any rights or obligations hereunder may be
made by either Seller or Purchaser (by operation of law or otherwise) without
the prior written consent of the other party hereto and any attempted
assignment without the required consents will be void, provided, however, that
(a) Purchaser may assign some or all of its rights and/or delegate some or all
of its obligations hereunder to one or more controlled subsidiaries formed by
it prior to the Closing and (b) after the Closing, Seller may assign some or
all of its rights or delegate some or all of its obligations hereunder to
successor entities pursuant to a plan of reorganization confirmed by the
Bankruptcy Court. No assignment of any obligations hereunder will relieve the
parties hereto of any such obligations. Upon any such permitted assignment,
the references in this Agreement to Seller or Purchaser will also apply to any
such assignee unless the context otherwise requires.

12.11 Non-Recourse. No past, present or future director, officer, employee,
incorporator, member, partner or equityholder of any party will have any
liability for any obligations or liabilities of such party under this
Agreement or any agreement entered into in connection herewith of or for any
claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby.

12.12 Representation of Seller and its Affiliates. The legal and financial
advisors of each of the parties are known to the other parties. Following the
Closing, such advisors may serve as advisers to any other party and their
respective Affiliates in connection with any matters related to this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby, including any litigation, claim or
obligation arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement notwithstanding any representation by any such
advisor of another party or any of its Affiliates; provided, however, that in
no event shall (a) Seller's counsel or other advisors represent Purchaser in
any matter adverse to Seller during the pendency of the Bankruptcy Case, or
(b) Purchaser's counsel or other advisors represent Seller in any matter
adverse to Purchaser related to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby. Purchaser (on behalf of itself and its controlled
Affiliates) also further agrees that, as to all communications among counsel
to Seller or its Affiliates and representatives of Seller or its Affiliates
that relate in any way to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the
