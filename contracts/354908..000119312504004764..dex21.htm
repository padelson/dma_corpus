incorporation of the Surviving Corporation.



(b) Immediately after the Effective Time, the bylaws of Surviving Corporation
shall be the bylaws of Merger Sub as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time, and such bylaws shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until

to the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation until
the earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective
successors are duly appointed.



 

-2- Section 1.7. _Merger Consideration; Effect on Capital Stock_



(a) _Merger Consideration_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company, each
outstanding share of Company Common Stock (other than shares, if any, which
are Dissenting Shares), shall, upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement, be canceled and extinguished and automatically
exchanged for that amount of cash equal to the quotient obtained by dividing
(x) the sum of (i) $190,000,000, plus (ii) the aggregate exercise price of all
outstanding Company Options and Company Warrants as of the Effective Time,
less (iii) the Aggregate Employee Bonus (as defined in Section 1.13) by (y)
the Fully Diluted Company Common Shares (the " _Cash Exchange Ratio_ ");
_provided_ , _however_ that if any Company Preferred Stock shall not have
been converted into shares of Company Common Stock prior to the Effective
Time, then the holders of any such shares of Company Preferred Stock shall
receive cash in the amount of the liquidation preference applicable to such
shares of Company Preferred Stock pursuant to the Company Articles, which cash
amount shall be deducted from the amount set forth in preceding clause
(a)(x)(i) and the number of such shares will be deducted from the number
of Fully Diluted Company Common Shares in preceding clause (a)(y).



The " _Fully Diluted Company Common Shares_ " shall mean the sum of (i) the
aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, including Company Common
Stock issued in connection with exercise of Company Options and Company
Warrants and (ii) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock
issuable pursuant to rights to purchase or otherwise acquire Company Common
Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, if any, including,
but not limited to, the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock (1)
that would be issued to the holders of Company Preferred Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time if such Company Preferred Stock were
converted into Company Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time,
(2) issuable under Company Options for Company Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, (3) issuable under Company Options
for Company Preferred Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time, assuming all such options are exercised and the Company Preferred Stock
issued thereunder were converted into Company Common Stock immediately prior
to the Effective Time, (4) issuable under Company Warrants for Company
Preferred Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, assuming
all such warrants are exercised (to the extent exersiable immediately prior to
the Effective Time) and the Company Preferred Stock issued thereunder were
converted into Company Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time
(assuming the maximum number of shares of Company Common Stock covered by such
warrants are then exercisable and issuable) and (5) issuable pursuant to any
and all other outstanding warrants, calls, subscriptions, conversion, exchange
or other similar rights, agreements or commitments to acquire any shares of
Company capital stock which are exercisable immediately prior to the
Effective Time, treated as if converted or exercised for Company Common Stock.



The aggregate amount of cash to be paid to each holder hereunder shall be
calculated by aggregating all shares of Company Common Stock held by such
holder, so that the aggregate amount of cash to be paid to such holder shall
be equal to the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock held by
such holder, multiplied by the Cash Exchange Ratio (the " _Cash Consideration_
," or the " _Merger Consideration_ "), rounded to the nearest whole cent,
with $0.005 and higher rounded upwards.



 

-3- For purposes of this Agreement, " _Company Capital Stock_ " means,
collectively, all shares of Company Common Stock; all shares of Series A
Preferred Stock, $.001 par value per share (the " _Series A Preferred Stock_
") and Series B Preferred Stock, $.001 par value per share (the " _Series B
Preferred Stock_ ") of the Company (the Series A Preferred Stock and Series B
Preferred Stock, are together referred to as " _Company Preferred Stock_ ");
and (x) all shares of Company Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock
issuable upon the exercise of warrants (to the extent exercisable immediately
prior to the Effective Time) for such shares (" _Company Warrants_ ") and (y)
all shares of Company Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock issuable upon
the exercise of outstanding options to purchase shares of Company Common
Stock granted under the Companys 1997 Plan, 2001 Plan and 2002 Stock Plan or
any other stock option plan, program or agreement maintained by the Company or
to which the Company is a party (the " _Company Options_ ").



(b) _Acceleration of Vesting and Assumption of Company Options_. As described
in Section 5.10, the Company Options that are outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall become fully exercisable prior to the Effective Time,
be assumed by Parent subject to the terms of such Company Option and become
exercisable for shares of common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of Parent
(the " _Parent Common Stock_ ") in accordance with the terms thereof.



(c) _Treatment of Company Warrants_. Each Company Warrant that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, upon the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in this Agreement, be automatically exchanged for
that amount of cash equal to the result obtained by subtracting (x) the
aggregate exercise price for all shares of Company Capital Stock subject to
such Company Warrant from (y) the product of (A) the Cash Exchange Ratio
multiplied by (B) the number of shares of Company Common Stock issuable upon
conversion of the Company Preferred Stock that would otherwise be issuable
upon exercise of such Company Warrant (the " _Warrant Consideration_ ").



(d) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each share of common stock of Merger Sub
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be converted into and exchanged for one validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation. Each stock
certificate of Merger Sub evidencing ownership of any such shares shall
evidence ownership of such shares of capital stock of the Surviving
Corporation.



(e)  _Adjustments to Cash Exchange Ratio_. The Cash Exchange Ratio shall be
adjusted to reflect fully the effect of any stock split, reverse split, stock
dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible
into Company Capital Stock), reorganization, recapitalization or other like
change with respect to Company Capital Stock occurring after the date hereof
and prior to the Effective Time so as to provide holders of Company Common
Stock and Parent the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement
prior to such stock split, reverse split, stock dividend, reorganization,
recapitalization or like change.



(f) _Dissenters  Rights_. " _Dissenting Shares_ " shall mean any shares of
Company Capital Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and
held by a holder who has not  



 

-4-  voted in favor of the Merger or consented thereto in writing, and who has
demanded appraisal for such shares of Company Capital Stock in accordance
with Section 1300 of California Law or other applicable laws, if any such
laws provide for appraisal rights for such shares in the Merger.



(1) Subject to (2) below, notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to
the contrary, Dissenting Shares shall not be converted into or represent
a right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Section 1.7, but
the holder thereof shall be entitled to only such rights as are granted by
California Law.



(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 1.7(e)(1), if any holder of
shares of Company Capital Stock who demands appraisal of such holders shares
of Company Capital Stock under applicable law effectively withdraws or loses
(through failure to perfect or otherwise) his or her right to appraisal, then
as of the Effective Time or the occurrence of such event, whichever later
occurs, such holders shares of Company Capital Stock shall automatically be
converted into and represent only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration as provided in this Section 1.7, without interest,
upon surrender of the certificate or certificates representing such shares of
Company Capital Stock (each such certificate, a " _Company Certificate_ ")
pursuant to Section 1.8.



(3) The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any written demands for
appraisal or payment of the fair value of any shares of Company Capital
Stock, withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments served on the
Company pursuant to applicable California Law and received by the Company and
the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to dissenters rights under California Law. The Company shall not,
except with the prior written of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with
respect to any dissenters rights with respect to Company Capital Stock or
offer to settle or settle any such demands.



(g) _Cancellation of Company Capital Stock Owned by Parent_. At the Effective
Time, all shares of Company Capital Stock that are owned by the Company as
treasury stock, and each share of Company Capital Stock owned by Parent or any
direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent or of the Company
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled.



Section 1.8. _Surrender of Certificates_



(a) _Exchange Agent_. Mellon Investor Services LLC shall act as exchange agent
(the " _Exchange Agent_ ") in connection with the Merger.



(b) _Parent to Provide Cash_. Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall
deliver to the Exchange Agent for exchange and payment in accordance with
this Article I (and subject to the escrow provisions of Section 1.8(c) and
Article VIII), through such reasonable procedures as Parent may adopt, the
cash issuable pursuant to Section 1.7(a) as Cash Consideration.



(c) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall cause to be mailed to each holder of record of a Company
Certificate whose shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall be in such form and
have such other provisions as are reasonably acceptable to the Company and
Parent) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Company Certificates in  



 

-5-  exchange for the Cash Consideration. Upon surrender of a Company Certificate
for cancellation to the Exchange Agent or to such other agent or agents as
may be appointed by Parent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly
completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto,
the holder of such Company Certificate shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor the amount of cash which such holder has a right to receive
as Cash Consideration (less the applicable proportion of the Escrow Cash
attributable to such holder), and the Company Certificate so surrendered shall
forthwith be canceled. Until so surrendered, each outstanding Company
Certificate that, prior to the Effective Time, represented shares of Company
Capital Stock will be deemed from and after the Effective Time, for all

state or foreign statutes, rules, regulations, orders or decrees that are
designed to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or
effect of monopolization or restraint of trade (collectively, " _Antitrust
Laws_ "). In connection therewith, if any administrative or judicial action
or proceeding is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging any
transaction contemplated by this Agreement as violative of any Antitrust Law,
each of Parent and the Company shall cooperate and use all commercially
reasonable efforts vigorously to contest and resist any such action or
proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed, or overturned any decree,
judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent (each an " _Order_ "), that is in effect and that prohibits,
prevents, or restricts consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or
any such other transactions, unless by mutual agreement Parent and the Company
decide that litigation is not in their respective best interests.
Notwithstanding the provisions of the immediately preceding sentence, it is
expressly understood and agreed that neither Parent nor the Company shall have
any obligation to litigate or contest any administrative or judicial action
or proceeding or any Order beyond the date of a ruling preliminarily enjoining
the Merger issued by a court of competent jurisdiction.



(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, (i) Parent
shall not be required to divest any of its businesses, product lines or
assets, or to take or agree to take any other action or agree to any
limitation that could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect
on Parent and (ii) the Company shall not be required to divest any of its
businesses, product lines or assets, or to take or agree to take any other
action or agree to any limitation that could reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company



Section 5.7. _Consents; Cooperation_



Each of Parent and the Company shall promptly apply for or otherwise
seek, and use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, all consents and
approvals required to be obtained by it for the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary  



 

-30-  Agreements. The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
all necessary consents, waivers and approvals under any of its material
contracts for the assignment thereof or otherwise.



Section 5.8.  _Legal Requirements_



Each of Parent and the Company will, and Parent will cause its subsidiaries
to, take all reasonable actions necessary to comply in all material respects
promptly with all legal requirements which may be imposed on them with respect
to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
will take all reasonable actions necessary to obtain (and will cooperate with
the other parties hereto in obtaining) any consent, approval, order or
authorization of, or any registration, declaration or filing with, any
Governmental Entity or other person, required to be obtained or made by them
in connection with the taking of any action contemplated by this Agreement.



Section 5.9. _Form S-8_



Parent agrees to file a registration statement on Form S-8 for the shares of
Parent Common Stock issuable with respect to the Company Options to be
assumed hereunder no later than ten (10) business days after the Effective
Time and shall not withdraw such Registration Statement.



Section 5.10. _Company Options_



Pursuant to Section 1.7(b) hereof, prior to the Effective Time, the
outstanding Company Options shall become fully vested and exercisable. At
the Effective Time, each outstanding Company Option that is fully vested and
exercisable, shall by virtue of the Merger be assumed by Parent. Each Company
Option so assumed by Parent under this Agreement will continue to have, and be
subject to, the same terms and conditions of such options immediately prior
to the Effective Time (including, without limitation, any repurchase rights or
vesting provisions), except that (i) each Company Option will be exercisable
(or will become exercisable in accordance with its terms) for that number of
whole shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product (rounded down to the
nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock) of the number of shares
of Company Common Stock that were issuable upon exercise of such Company
Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Option
Exchange Ratio, and (ii) the per share exercise price for the shares of Parent
Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such assumed Company Option will be
equal to the quotient (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) determined by
dividing the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock at which such
Company Option was exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time by the
Option Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole cent. Immediately
after the Effective Time, Parent will issue to each holder of an outstanding
Company Option a notice describing the assumption of such Company Option by
Parent. It is intended that Company Options assumed by Parent shall qualify
following the Effective Time as incentive stock options as defined in Section
422 of the Code to the extent such Company Stock Options qualified as
incentive stock options immediately prior to the Effective Time (as
determined by Parent) and the provisions of this section shall be applied
consistent with such intent. Parent will reserve sufficient shares of Parent
Common Stock for issuance under Section 1.7(b) hereof. For these purposes, "
_Option Exchange Ratio_ " means the quotient obtained by dividing (A) the Cash



 

-31- Exchange Ratio by (B) the Parent Stock Price. For these purposes, " _Parent
Stock Price_ " means the average closing price of Parent Common Stock on the
Nasdaq National Market over the ten (10) trading days up to and including the
second trading day preceding the Closing. In the event that Parent at any time
between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time declares or pays
any dividend on Parent Common Stock payable in Parent Common Stock or in any
right to acquire Parent Common Stock, or effects a subdivision of the
outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock into a greater number of shares of
Parent Common Stock (by stock dividends, combinations, splits,
recapitalizations and the like), or in the event the outstanding shares of
Parent Common Stock shall be combined or consolidated, by reclassification or
otherwise, into a lesser number of shares of Parent Common Stock, which
dividend, subdivision or other action would become effective during the ten
(10) trading days during which the Parent Stock Price is calculated, then the
Parent Stock Price shall be appropriately adjusted.



Section 5.11. _Reasonable Efforts and Further Assurances_



Prior to the Closing, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Agreement, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agree to use commercially
reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or
cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable (subject to any
applicable laws) to consummate and make effective the Merger as promptly as
practicable including, but not limited to (i) the preparation and filing of
all forms, registrations and notices required to be filed to consummate
the Merger and the taking of such actions as are necessary to obtain any
requisite approvals, consents, orders, exemptions or waivers by any third
party or Governmental Entity, and (ii) the satisfaction of the other parties
conditions to Closing. 



Section 5.12. _Indemnification of Directors and Officers_



(a) For a period of six years from the Closing Date, Parent shall, and shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, fulfill and honor in all respects all
rights to indemnification existing in favor of the current directors and
officers of the Company, as provided in the Companys Articles of
Incorporation and Bylaws and as otherwise existing on the date of this
Agreement in favor of such directors and officers.



(b) Parent agrees to pay all expenses, including attorneys fees, which may be
incurred by any director or officer of the Company in enforcing the indemnity
and other obligations provided for in this Section 5.12.



(c) This Section 5.10 shall survive the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, is intended to benefit and may be enforced by the
directors and officers of the Company, and shall be binding on all successors
and assigns of Parent and the Company.



Section 5.13. _FIRPTA Certificate_



The Company shall, prior to the Closing Date, provide Parent with a properly
executed FIRPTA Certificate, substantially in the form of _Exhibit C-1_
attached hereto, which states that shares of capital stock of the Company do
not constitute "United States real property interests" under Section 897(c)
of the Code, for purposes of satisfying Parents obligations under Treasury



 

-32- Regulation Section 1.1445-2(c)(3). In addition, simultaneously with delivery
of such Notification Letter, the Company shall have provided to Parent, as
agent for the Company, a form of notice to the IRS in accordance with the
requirements of Treasury Regulation Section 1.897-2(h)(2) and substantially in
the form of _Exhibit C-2_ attached hereto along with written authorization
for Parent to deliver such notice form to the IRS on behalf of the Company
upon the Closing of the Merger.



Section 5.14. _Employment Matters_



To the extent permitted under applicable law and Parents existing employee
welfare benefit plans, programs and policies and Section 401(a) plans, as of
and following the Closing Date, Parent shall permit employees of the Company
and each of its subsidiaries who continue employment with Parent or any of its
subsidiaries following the Closing Date (" _Continuing Employees_ "), and,
as applicable, their eligible dependents, to participate in the employee
welfare benefit plans, programs or policies (including without limitation any
vacation, sick, personal time off plans or programs) of Parent and any plan of
Parent intended to qualify within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code
on terms no less favorable than those provided to similarly situated employees
of Parent; provided, further that (i) each such Continuing Employee shall
receive credit for purposes of eligibility to participate and vesting under
such for years of service with the Company (or any of its subsidiaries) prior
to the Closing Date, and (ii) Parent shall cause any and all pre-existing
condition limitations, eligibility waiting periods and evidence of
insurability requirements under any group health plans of Parent in which such
employees and their eligible dependents shall participate to be waived and
shall provide credit for any co-payments and deductibles prior to the
Closing Date for purposes of satisfying any applicable deductible, out-of-
pocket or similar requirements under any such plans that may apply after the
Closing Date.



Unless Parent consents otherwise in writing, the Company shall take all action
necessary to terminate, or cause to terminate, before the Effective Time, any
Company Benefit Plan that is a 401(k) plan or other defined contribution
retirement plan or employee stock purchase plan.



Section 5.15. _Advice of Changes_



The Company will promptly advise Parent in writing of any events occurring
subsequent to the date of this Agreement which would render any
representation or warranty of the Company contained in this Agreement, if
made on or as of the date of such event or the Closing Date, untrue or
inaccurate in any material respect. Parent and Merger Sub will promptly advise
the Company in writing of any events occurring subsequent to the date of this
Agreement which would render any representation or warranty of Parent or

Escrow Agreement. The Escrow Fund shall consist of ten percent (10%) of the
aggregate Cash Consideration to be issued in the Merger pursuant to Section
1.7(a) and shall be available to compensate Parent pursuant to the
indemnification obligations of the Company for Damages.



 

-38- Section 8.2. _Indemnification_



(a) Subject to the limitations set forth in this Article VIII, the
shareholders of the Company will indemnify severally and not jointly and hold
harmless Parent and its officers, directors, agents and employees, and each
person, if any, who controls or may control Parent within the meaning of the
Securities Act (hereinafter referred to individually as an " _Indemnified
Person_ " and collectively as " _Indemnified Persons_ ") from and against any
and all losses, costs, damages, obligations, liabilities, fines, penalties,
judgments, and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable legal and
other professional fees, costs and expenses incurred in investigating,
preparing, defending against or prosecuting any claim, demand, suit, action,
cause of action, arbitration, investigation or proceeding) (collectively, "
_Damages_ ") arising out of any misrepresentation or breach of, or default in
connection with, any of the representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements given or made by the Company in this Agreement or any exhibit or
schedule to this Agreement. The Escrow Fund allocated shall be the security
for this indemnity obligation subject to the limitations in this Agreement.



(b) Other than rights to equitable relief provided under the Confidentiality
Agreement to the extent available, any remedy of specific performance or any
other equitable remedy to which any party may be entitled under Section 9.10
or otherwise, and except in the case of intentional fraud, the right to obtain
indemnification from, and only from, the Escrow Fund, pursuant to the
indemnification provisions of this Section 8.2 and the Escrow Agreement shall
be Parents exclusive remedy for any Damages described in Section 8.2(a);
_provided_ , _however_ , that there shall be no indemnification by
the shareholders of the Company for Damages if the Merger does not become
effective.



(c) Parent may not receive any Escrow Cash from the Escrow Fund unless and
until one or more Officers Certificates identifying Damages the aggregate
amount of which exceeds $500,000 (the " _Indemnity Threshold_ ") have been
delivered to the Escrow Agent as provided in Section 8.4 and such amount is
determined pursuant to this Article VIII to be payable, in which case, Parent
shall receive Escrow Cash equal to the full amount of Damages (and not just
for the amount of Damages in excess of $500,000).



(d) If and to the extent that Parent is able to file a valid insurance claim
with respect to any claim for indemnification under this Agreement, Parent
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to file such insurance claim before
pursuing its rights against the shareholders of the Company. However, the
parties agree that this shall in no way limit the right of Parent to fully
pursue its indemnification and any other rights against the shareholders of
the Company arising pursuant to this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreements.
The parties agree that any indemnification provided by this Agreement is not
to be deemed insurance (whether primary, excess, or otherwise) for purposes of
seeking reimbursement from the applicable insurance coverage.



(e) The parties agree that there shall not be any multiple recovery for any
Damage.



 

-39- Section 8.3. _Escrow Period_



The escrow period (the " _Escrow Period_ ") shall terminate at 11:59 p.m.
Pacific Time on the one (1) year anniversary of the Closing Date.



Section 8.4. _Claims upon Escrow Fund_



(a) Upon receipt by the Escrow Agent on or before the last day of the Escrow
Period of a certificate signed by any officer of Parent (an " _Officer s
Certificate_"):



(i) stating that Damages exist in an aggregate amount greater than the
Indemnity Threshold for claims against the Escrow Fund; and



(ii) specifying in reasonable detail the individual items included in
the amount of Damages in such claim, the date each such item was paid,
properly accrued or arose and the nature of the breach of warranty or claim to
which such item is related, the Escrow Agent shall set aside such Escrow Cash
or other assets held in the Escrow Fund, as applicable, having a value equal
to such Damages.



(b) Upon the earliest of: (i) receipt of written authorization from the
Shareholders Agent or from the Shareholders Agent jointly with Parent to
make such delivery, (ii) receipt of written notice of a final decision
in arbitration of the claim, or (iii) in the event the claim set forth in the
Officers Certificate is uncontested by the Shareholders Agent as of the
close of business on the next business day following the forty-fifth (45th)
day following receipt by the Escrow Agent of the Officers Certificate; on
the next business day the Escrow Agent shall deliver Escrow Cash or other
assets from the Escrow Fund to Parent.



Section 8.5. _Objections to Claims_



At the time of delivery of any Officers Certificate to the Escrow Agent, a
duplicate copy of such Officers Certificate shall be delivered to the
Shareholders Agent and for a period of forty-five (45) days after such
delivery to the Escrow Agent of such Officers Certificate, the Escrow Agent
shall make no delivery from the Escrow Fund pursuant to Section 8.4 unless
the Escrow Agent shall have received written authorization from the
Shareholders Agent to make such delivery. After the expiration of such forty-
five (45) day period, the Escrow Agent shall make delivery from the
Escrow Fund then in the Escrow Fund in accordance with Section 8.4, provided
that no such payment or delivery may be made if the Shareholders Agent shall
object in a written statement to the claim made in the Officers Certificate,
and such statement shall have been delivered to the Escrow Agent and to
Parent prior to the expiration of such forty-five (45) day period.



Section 8.6. _Resolution of Conflicts; Arbitration_



 

(a) In case the Shareholders Agent shall so object in writing to any claim or
claims by Parent made in any Officers Certificate, Parent shall have forty-
five (45) days after receipt by the Escrow Agent of an objection by the
Shareholders Agent to respond in a written statement to the objection of the
Shareholders Agent. If after such forty-five (45) day period there remains a
dispute as to any claims, the Shareholders Agent and Parent shall attempt in
good faith for sixty (60) days to  



 

-40-  agree upon the rights of the respective parties with respect to each of such
claims. If the Shareholders Agent and Parent should so agree, a
memorandum setting forth such agreement shall be prepared and signed by both
parties and shall be furnished to the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent shall be
entitled to rely on any such memorandum and shall distribute from the Escrow
Fund in accordance with the terms thereof.



(b) If no such agreement can be reached after good faith negotiation, either
Parent or the Shareholders Agent may, by written notice to the other, demand
arbitration of the matter unless the amount of the damage or loss is at issue
in pending litigation with a third party, in which event arbitration shall
not be commenced until such amount is ascertained or both parties agree to
arbitration; and in either such event the matter shall be settled by
arbitration conducted by three arbitrators. Within twenty (20) days after such
written notice is sent, Parent and the Shareholders Agent shall each select
one arbitrator, and the two arbitrators so selected shall select a third
arbitrator. If within such twenty (20) day period, after being served written
notice and given ten (10) days to cure, the Shareholder Agent does not select
one arbitrator and give written notice to Parent of the arbitrator selected,
the arbitrator that would otherwise have been selected by the Shareholders
Agent shall be selected by the American Arbitration Association. The decision
of the arbitrators as to the validity and amount of any claim in such
Officers Certificate shall be binding and conclusive upon the parties to this
Agreement, and notwithstanding anything in this Section 8.6, the Escrow Agent
shall be entitled to act in accordance with such decision and make or withhold
payments out of the Escrow Fund in accordance therewith.



(c) Judgment upon any award rendered by the arbitrators may be entered in any
court having jurisdiction. Any such arbitration shall be held in Santa
Barbara County, California under the commercial rules then in effect of the
American Arbitration Association. Parent, on the one hand, and the Company
shareholders, on the other hand, shall each bear its/their own expenses
(including, attorneys fees and expenses) incurred in connection with any such
arbitration. The Company shareholders expenses and reasonable attorneys fees
will be paid by the Shareholders Agent from the Escrow Fund, as provided in
Section 8.7(c). In the event the arbitrator or arbitrators find in favor of
Parent as to the claim in dispute, all fees, costs, and the reasonable
expenses of legal counsel incurred by Parent will be charged against the
Escrow Fund in addition to the amount of the disputed claim. The fees and
expenses of each arbitrator and the administrative fee of the American
Arbitration Association shall be allocated by the arbitrator or arbitrators,
as the case may be (or, if not so allocated, shall be borne equally by
Parent, on the one hand, and the Company shareholders, out of the Escrow Fund
on the other hand).



Section 8.7. _Shareholders  Agent_



(a) William Parrish shall be constituted and appointed as the Shareholders
Agent for and on behalf of the shareholders of the Company to give
and receive notices and communications, to authorize delivery to Parent of
Escrow Cash from the Escrow Fund in satisfaction of claims by Parent, to
object to such deliveries, to agree to, negotiate, enter into settlements and
compromises of, and demand arbitration and comply with orders of courts and
awards of arbitrators with respect to such claims, and to take all actions
necessary or appropriate in the reasonable judgment of the Shareholders Agent
for the accomplishment of the foregoing. Such agency may be changed by the
holders of a majority in interest of the Escrow Fund from time to time upon
not less than ten (10)  



 

-41-  days prior written notice to all of the Company shareholders and to Parent.
No bond shall be required of the Shareholders Agent. Notices
or communications to or from the Shareholders Agent shall constitute notice
to or from each of the Company shareholders.



(b) The Shareholders Agent shall not be liable for any act done or omitted
hereunder as Shareholders Agent while acting in good faith and in the
exercise of reasonable judgment, and any act done or omitted pursuant to the
advice of counsel shall be conclusive evidence of such good faith and
reasonableness. The Company shareholders shall severally and not jointly
indemnify the Shareholders Agent and hold him harmless against any loss,
liability or expense incurred without gross negligence, willful misconduct or
bad faith on the part of the Shareholders Agent and arising out of or in
connection with the acceptance or administration of his duties hereunder.



(c) The Shareholders Agent will serve without compensation but will be
reimbursed from the Escrow Fund upon occurrence for all out of pocket expenses
reasonably incurred, including expenses for lawyers, accountants and other
experts employed on behalf of the Shareholders interests in the Escrow Fund.
In no event will the Shareholders Agent be entitled to incur expenses
reimbursable by the Escrow Fund in excess of $200,000 without the approval of
Company shareholders holding a majority of the shares of the Escrow Fund.



Section 8.8. _Actions of the Shareholders  Agent_



A decision, act, consent or instruction of the Shareholders Agent shall
constitute a decision of all of the Company shareholders and shall be final,
binding and conclusive upon each and every Company shareholder, and the Escrow
Agent and Parent may rely upon any decision, act, consent or instruction of
the Shareholders Agent as being the decision, act, consent or instruction of
each and every Company shareholder. The Escrow Agent and Parent are hereby
relieved from any liability to any person for any acts done by them in
accordance with such decision, act, consent or instruction of the
Shareholders Agent.



Section 8.9. _Third-Party Claims_



In the event that Parent becomes aware of a third-party claim which Parent
believes may result in a demand against the Escrow Fund, Parent shall
promptly notify the Shareholders Agent of such claim, and the Shareholders
Agent and the Company shareholders shall be entitled, at their expense, to
participate in any defense of such claim. Parent shall have the right in its
sole discretion to settle any such claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that
Parent may not effect the settlement of any such claim without the consent of
the Shareholders Agent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.



Section 8.10. _Reliance_.



No disclosure by any party (the " _Disclosing Party_ ") to this Agreement nor
any investigation made by or on behalf of another party with respect to the
Disclosing Party shall be deemed to affect the other partys reliance on the
respective representations and warranties contained in this
Agreement (including the Company Disclosure Schedule) and shall not effect a
waiver of that partys rights to indemnity as herein provided for the breach
of any of said representations and warranties.
