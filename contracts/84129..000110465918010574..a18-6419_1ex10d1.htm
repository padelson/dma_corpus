_Company_ "), Albertsons Companies, Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _Parent_
"), and Cerberus Capital Management, L.P. (" _Investor_ ").

Section 1. _Standstill_.

 



 

1.1 In consideration of the covenants of Parent set forth in Section 7.20(a),
(b), (c) and (d) of the Merger Agreement, except to the extent expressly
permitted by the Merger Agreement, Investor agrees that during the Standstill
Period (as defined below), neither it nor any of its controlled Affiliates
shall, directly or indirectly:

 



 

(a) purchase or cause to be purchased or otherwise acquire or agree to acquire
beneficial ownership (including, but not limited to, any voting right or
beneficial ownership as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act) of any
shares of Parent Common Stock or other securities issued by Parent, or any
option, forward contract, swap or any other securities convertible into or
exchangeable for Parent Common Stock or any rights or options to acquire any
such ownership; _provided_ that, notwithstanding the foregoing, Investor and
its controlled Affiliates may acquire beneficial ownership (as defined in Rule
13d-3 under the Exchange Act) of Parent Common Stock provided that such
beneficial ownership does not result in ownership of 30% or more of the issued
and outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock in the aggregate following such
transaction (assuming any stock buy back transaction announced but not yet
consummated by the Company has been consummated as of the time of such
acquisition);

 



 

(b) make any public statement or public disclosure regarding any intent,
purpose, plan or proposal with respect by Investor or any of its controlled
Affiliates to (i) the composition of the Parent Board, Parents management

control, business combination, tender or exchange offer, purchase, sale or

transaction (each transaction in this clause (ii), an " _Extraordinary
Transaction_ "), or make any private statement or private disclosure regarding
any such intent, purpose, plan or proposal that would require Parent to make
any public disclosure relating to any such intent, purpose, plan or proposal;

 



 

(c) engage in any "solicitation" of "proxies" to vote (as such terms are used
in Regulation 14 of the Exchange Act) or consents to vote (whether or not any
such solicitation

 



      
 

 



 

relates to the election or removal of directors), or initiate, propose,
encourage or otherwise solicit stockholders of Parent for the approval of any
stockholder proposals with respect to Parent;

 



 

(d) enter into any arrangements, understanding or agreements (whether written
or oral) with, or advise, finance, assist or knowingly encourage, any other
person in connection with any of the foregoing, or make any investment in or
enter into any arrangement with any other person that engages, or offers or
proposes to engage, in any of the foregoing; or

 



 

(e) take any action challenging the validity or enforceability of this Section
1 or this Agreement, or request Parent or the Board of Directors of Parent
(the " _Parent Board_ "), as applicable, to amend or waive any provision of
this Section 1.

 



 

1.2 For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Standstill Period_ " shall
mean the period commencing at the Effective Time and terminating upon the
earliest to occur of (a) thirty (30) days following the date that Investor
does not have any of its designees on the Parent Board (it being understood
that this clause shall be immediately triggered by the delivery by all
Investor designees on the Parent Board of notices of immediately effective
resignations from the Parent Board, (b) the date on which Investor no longer
has the right to appoint (and has not appointed) at least one director to the
Parent Board and (c) the date on which Parent materially breaches or takes any
action challenging the validity or enforceability of _Section 7.20(a)_, _(b)_
, _(c)_ or _(d)_ of the Merger Agreement.

 



 

1.3 The terms of this Agreement shall not limit, restrict or impair Investors
or its Affiliates ability to directly or indirectly (a) propose, commit on,
participate in and/or make a loan or other debt financing to Parent or any of
its subsidiaries, (b) propose, commit on, participate in and/or provide debt
financing to a prospective buyer regarding Parent or any of its subsidiaries
or assets in a negotiated transaction with Parent, finance a third partys
effort to make a loan or other debt financing to Parent or any of its
subsidiaries in a negotiated transaction with Parent or any of its
subsidiaries, (c) participate in any process approved, conducted or initiated
by Parent pursuant to which any of the businesses or assets of Parent or any
of its subsidiaries are proposed to be sold or otherwise disposed of, in each
case in accordance with the parameters of such process, (d) submit a proposal
to the Parent Board of Directors relating to the acquisition of all or
substantially all of Parent and its subsidiaries if Parent has entered into a
definitive agreement with respect to the sale of all or substantially all of
Parent and its subsidiaries or (e) purchase debt of Parent or its subsidiaries
in secondary market transactions; provided that in the case of clauses (a),
(b), and (e), references to debt shall be limited to no more than 30% of any
debt financing or offering. The term "debt" as used in this paragraph shall
include, without limitation, institutional debt (bank or otherwise),
commercial paper, notes, debentures, bonds, other evidences of indebtedness,
and debt securities, but shall not include any debt convertible or
exchangeable for equity.

 



 

1.4 For the avoidance of doubt, and notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, nothing in this Section 1 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall be
deemed to in any way restrict, limit or prevent (a) the Investor or its
Affiliates from communicating, on a confidential basis, with its attorneys,
accountants or financial advisors; (b) the Investor or its Affiliates from (i)
bringing litigation to enforce the provisions of this Agreement or the Merger
Agreement or (ii) making counterclaims with respect to any proceeding
initiated by, or on behalf of, Parent

 



      
 

 



 

against Investor with respect to this Agreement or the Merger Agreement; (c)
Investor or its Affiliates from selling or tendering any shares of the Company
or Parent, or (d) prevent any designee of Investor on the Parent Board for
taking any action consistent with such designees fiduciary duties under
applicable law in connection with such role.

 



 

1.5 From and after the date of this Agreement and until the Effective Time,
neither Investor nor any of its controlled Affiliates shall directly or
indirectly, purchase or cause to be purchased or otherwise acquire or agree to
acquire beneficial ownership (including, but not limited to, any voting right
or beneficial ownership as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act) of
any shares of Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock or other securities
or debt issued by Parent or Company, or any option, forward contract, swap or
any other securities convertible into or exchangeable for Parent Common Stock
or Company Common Stock or any rights or options to acquire any such
ownership; provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing, Investor and its
controlled Affiliates may acquire beneficial ownership (as defined in Rule
13d-3 under the Exchange Act) of Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock
provided that such beneficial ownership does not result in ownership of 30% or
more of the issued and outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock at Effective
Time (assuming for the purpose of such calculation that the Effective Time
occurred immediately after such acquisition).

 



 

1.6 As used in this Agreement, the terms " _Affiliate_ " shall have the
respective meanings set forth in Rule 12b-2 promulgated by the SEC under the
Exchange Act and shall include all persons or entities that at any time during
the term of this Agreement become Affiliates of any person or entity referred
to in this Agreement. Reference to "controlled affiliates" of Cerberus
include, without limitation, Cerberus Iceberg LLC.

2.1 Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit any party hereto from (i) making
any statement or disclosure required under the federal securities laws or
other applicable laws or the rules of the New York Stock Exchange; provided,
however, that such party shall to the extent feasible and permitted provide
written notice to the other parties hereto reasonably in advance making any
such statement or disclosure required by the federal securities laws or other
applicable laws or the rules of the New York Stock Exchange that would
otherwise be prohibited by the provisions of this Section 2, and reasonably
consider any comments of such other parties; (ii) communicating, on a
confidential basis, with attorneys, accountants, or financial advisors or as

regulatory authority or stock exchange that has, or may have, jurisdiction
over the Investor, the Company or Parent, as the case may be (subject to
providing reasonable advance notice to the other parties hereto where
possible, and reasonably considering any comments of such other parties).

agreements or conditions contained herein. Any such extension or waiver shall
be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by the party or

of being enforced by any rule of Law or public policy, all other conditions
and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and

faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the
parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner to the end that
the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated as originally
contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

 



       
 

 



 

Section 8. _Entire Agreement; Assignment_. This Agreement and the Merger
Agreement constitute the entire agreement among the parties with respect to
the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior and contemporaneous
agreements and undertakings, both written and oral, among the parties, or any
of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof. This Agreement
shall not be assigned by operation of law or otherwise without the prior
written consent of each of the other parties, and any assignment without such
consent shall be null and void.

 



 

Section 9. _Parties in Interest_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure solely to the benefit of each party, and nothing in this Agreement,
express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any
rights, benefits or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of
this Agreement.

 



 

Section 10. _Governing Law_. This Agreement, and any Proceeding in any way
arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the negotiation, execution or
performance of this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby or the
legal relationship of the parties hereto (whether at law or in equity, and
whether in contract or in tort or otherwise), shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the internal laws of the State of Delaware
(without giving effect to choice of law principles thereof).

 



 

Section 11. _Headings_. The descriptive headings contained in this Agreement
and the table of contents hereof are included for convenience of reference
only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this
Agreement.

(including by facsimile transmission, email in "portable documentation format"
(".pdf") form, or other electronic transmission) in one or more counterparts,
and by the different parties in separate counterparts, each of which when
executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken together
shall constitute one and the same agreement.

 



 

Section 13. _Specific Performance_. The parties agree that irreparable damage
for which monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate
remedy, would occur in the event that the parties do not perform the
provisions of this Agreement in accordance with its specified terms or
otherwise breach such provisions. The parties acknowledge and agree that the
parties shall be entitled to an injunction, specific performance and other
equitable relief to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement
and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.
Each of the parties agrees that prior to the valid termination of this
Agreement in accordance with _Section 3_, it will not oppose the granting of
an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief as provided
herein on the basis that (a) either party has an adequate remedy at law or (b)
an award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason
at law or equity. Any party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall not be required to provide,
furnish or post any bond or other security in connection with any such order
or injunction, and each party hereby irrevocably waives any right it may have
to require the provision, furnishing or posting of any such bond or other
security.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 14. _Jurisdiction_. Each of the parties irrevocably (a) consents to
submit itself to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of Chancery
and any state appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (unless
the Delaware Court of Chancery shall decline to accept jurisdiction over a
particular matter, in which case, in any Delaware state or federal court
within the State of Delaware), in connection with any matter based upon or
arising out of this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or the actions of the parties in the negotiation, administration,
performance and enforcement hereof and thereof, (b) agrees that it will not
attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other
request for leave from any such court, (c) agrees that it will not bring any
action relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement in any court other than the courts of the State of Delaware, as
described above, and (d) consents to service being made through the notice
procedures set forth in _Section 6_. Each of the parties hereby agrees that
service of any process, summons, notice or document by U.S. registered mail to
the respective addresses set forth in _Section 6_ shall be effective service
of process for any suit or proceeding in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby. Each party hereby irrevocably waives, and
agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a defense, counterclaim or
otherwise, in any Proceeding with respect to this Agreement, any claim that it
is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the above-named courts for
any reason other than the failure to serve process in accordance with this
_Section 14_, that it or its property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction
of any such court or from any legal process commenced in such courts (whether
through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of
execution of judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise), and to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable Law, that the Proceeding in any such court is
brought in an inconvenient forum, that the venue of such Proceeding is
improper, or that this Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not be
enforced in or by such courts and further irrevocably waives, to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable Law, the benefit of any defense that would
hinder, fetter or delay the levy, execution or collection of any amount to
which the party is entitled pursuant to the final judgment of any court having
jurisdiction. Each party agrees that a final judgment in any such Proceeding
shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the
judgment or in any other manner provided by Law, a certified copy of which
shall be conclusive evidence of the fact and amount of such judgment.

 



 

Section 15. _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY
AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM
(WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING
OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY
OR THE ACTIONS OF ANY PARTY IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE
AND ENFORCEMENT HEREOF.

 



 

Section 16. _Interpretation_. When reference is made in this Agreement to a
Section, such reference shall be to a Section of this Agreement unless
otherwise indicated. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including"
are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words
"without limitation." The words "hereof," "herein," "hereby," "hereunder" and
"hereinafter" and words of similar import, when used in this Agreement, shall
refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this
Agreement, unless the context otherwise requires. Unless the context otherwise

party drafting or causing any instrument to be drafted. Any agreement,
instrument, statute, rule or regulation defined or referred to herein means
such agreement, instrument, statute, rule or regulation as from time to time
amended, modified or supplemented, including (in the case of agreements or
instruments) by waiver of consent and (in the case of statutes, rules or
regulations) by succession or comparable successor statutes and references to
