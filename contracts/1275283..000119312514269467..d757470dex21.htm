NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements herein and intending to be legally

ARTICLE I

 

THE MERGER

Section 1.01.  _The Merger_. On the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement and in accordance with the DGCL, at the Effective
Time, Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Company. As a result of the
Merger, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub will cease, and the
Company will be the surviving corporation in the Merger (the " _Surviving
Corporation_ ").

 

Section 1.02. _Closing_. Subject to the provisions of ARTICLE VII, the closing
(the " _Closing_ ") of the Merger (a) will take place at the offices of Jones
Day in New York, New York as soon as practicable (but in no event later than
the third Business Day) after all of the conditions set forth in ARTICLE VII
(other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the
Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by
applicable Law) waiver of such conditions) shall have been satisfied or waived
by the Party entitled to the benefit of the same ( _provided_ , _however_ ,
that if and to the extent necessary to consummate the Financing, or any
Replacement Financing, the Closing will occur on any Business Day (as may be
specified by Parent on no less than three Business Days prior written notice
to the Company) during the ten Business Day period beginning on the date on
which all of the conditions set forth in ARTICLE VII (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by applicable Law)
waiver of such conditions) shall have been satisfied or waived by the Party
entitled to the benefit of the same), or (b) will occur at such other place,
time and date as will be agreed in writing between the Company and Parent
(the date upon which the Closing occurs, the " _Closing Date_ ").

 



2 Section 1.03. _Effective Time_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement,
at the Closing, the Company will file a certificate of merger (the "
_Certificate of Merger_ ") with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware, in such form as required by, and executed in accordance with, the
relevant provisions of the DGCL. The Merger will become effective upon the
filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State
of Delaware or at such later date and time as the Company and Parent may agree
upon and as is set forth in such Certificate of Merger (such time, the "
_Effective Time_ ").

Section 1.04. _Effect_. At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger will
be as provided in this Agreement, the Certificate of Merger and the applicable
provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing and
subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all of the property, rights,
privileges, immunities, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub
will vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties
of the Company and Merger Sub will become the debts, liabilities and duties of
the Surviving Corporation. 

Section 1.05. _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws_.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, the Company Charter will, by virtue of or in
connection with the Merger, be amended and restated in its entirety to read
as set forth in _Exhibit A_ hereto and, as so amended, will be the certificate
of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter further amended
as provided therein or by applicable Law.

 

(b) At the Effective Time, and without any further action on the part of the
Company and Merger Sub, the Company Bylaws will be amended and restated in
their entirety to read as the bylaws of Merger Sub as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time until thereafter amended as provided therein or by
applicable Law.

 

Section 1.06. _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation and Company
Subsidiaries_. The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective
Time will be the directors of the Surviving Corporation until the earlier of
their resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly
elected and qualified, as the case may be. Unless Parent, in its sole
discretion, determines otherwise, the individuals identified on Section 1.06
of the Parent Disclosure Letter will be the officers of the Surviving
Corporation until the earlier of their resignation or removal or until their
respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified, as the
case may be. To the extent requested by Parent prior to the Effective Time,
the Company will use its reasonable best efforts to cause the applicable
officers and directors of each Company Subsidiary (or those Company
Subsidiaries so specified by Parent) to tender their resignations as officers
or directors of the applicable Company

 



3  Subsidiaries, effective as of the Effective Time, and to deliver to Parent
written evidence of such resignations (to be effective as of the Effective
Time) prior to the Effective Time. The Company will cooperate with Parent in
connection with the foregoing, including by providing to Parent information
and access pursuant to and subject to Section 6.02 reasonably requested by
Parent.

 

ARTICLE II

EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

Section 2.01. _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger
Sub or the holders of any shares of Company Common Stock or Merger Sub Common
Stock:

 

(a) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock_. Each share of
common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the " _Company
Common Stock_ ") that is held by the Company as treasury stock and each share
of Company Common Stock that is owned by a Company Subsidiary, Parent or
Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time will no longer
be outstanding and will automatically be canceled and will cease to exist,
and no consideration will be delivered in exchange therefor.

(b)  _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Subject to Section 2.02, each
share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than shares to be canceled in accordance with Section
2.01(a) and shares of Company Common Stock owned by stockholders ("
_Dissenting Stockholders_ ") who have properly made and not withdrawn a demand
for appraisal rights pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL, but including
unrestricted shares of Company Common Stock described in Section 2.04(c) and
Section 2.04(d)) will be converted into the right to receive (i) 0.2909 of a
fully paid and nonassessable share of Parent Common Stock (the " _Stock
Consideration_ ")  _plus_ (ii) $50.50 in cash (the " _Cash Consideration_ "
and, together with the Stock Consideration, the " _Merger Consideration_ ").
All such shares of Company Common Stock, when so converted, will no longer
be outstanding and will automatically be canceled and will cease to exist,
and each holder of a certificate (or evidence of shares in book-entry form)
that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such shares of
Company Common Stock (each, a " _Certificate_ ") will cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock
to be issued or paid in consideration therefor and any dividends or other
distributions to which holders become entitled upon compliance with Section
2.02, without interest. As and to the extent provided in Section 2.02(j), the
right of any holder of Company Common Stock to receive the Merger
Consideration will be subject to and reduced by the amount of any withholding
required under applicable Tax Law.

(c) _Conversion of Merger Sub Common Stock_. Each share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub (the " _Merger Sub Common Stock_ ")
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be
converted into 

 



4  one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per
share, of the Surviving Corporation. From and after the Effective Time, all
certificates representing shares of Merger Sub Common Stock will be deemed
for all purposes to represent the number of shares of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation into which they were converted in accordance with the
immediately preceding sentence.

 

Section 2.02. _Exchange of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent will appoint a bank
or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as exchange
agent (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for the payment of the Merger Consideration.
At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent will deposit, or cause to be
deposited, with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the holders of shares
of Company Common Stock, (i) an aggregate number of shares of Parent Common
Stock to be issued in uncertificated form or book-entry form and (ii) an
aggregate amount of cash, in each case, comprising the amounts required to
be delivered pursuant to Section 2.01(b) in respect of shares of Company
Common Stock. Parent agrees to make available directly or indirectly to the
Exchange Agent from time to time as needed, any cash in lieu of fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor
pursuant to Section 2.02(f) and any dividends or other distributions which a
holder of Company Common Stock has the right to receive pursuant to Section
2.02(d). All such shares of Parent Common Stock and cash deposited with the
Exchange Agent are hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ ".

(b) _Letter of Transmittal_. As promptly as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, Parent will cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of
record of Company Common Stock as of immediately prior to the Effective Time a
form of letter of transmittal (the " _Letter of Transmittal_ ") (which will
specify that delivery will be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates will pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates (or, in the
case of lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, in accordance with Section
2.02(k)) to the Exchange Agent and will be in such form and have such other
provisions (including customary provisions with respect to delivery of an
"agents message" with respect to shares held in book-entry form)), together
with instructions thereto.

(c) _Merger Consideration Received in Connection with Exchange_. Upon (i) in
the case of shares of Company Common Stock represented by a Certificate, the
surrender of such Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, or (ii)
in the case of shares of Company Common Stock held in book-entry form, the
receipt of an "agents message" by the Exchange Agent, in each case together
with the Letter of Transmittal, duly, completely and validly executed in
accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may
reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such shares of
Company Common Stock will be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the
Merger Consideration _plus_ any cash in lieu of fractional shares which
the holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.02(f) and in
respect of any dividends or other distributions which the holder has the right
to receive pursuant to Section 2.02(d). Until surrendered as contemplated by
this Section 2.02(c), each share

 



5  of Company Common Stock, and any Certificate with respect thereto, will be
deemed at any time from and after the Effective Time to represent only the
right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration which the
holders of shares of Company Common Stock were entitled to receive in respect
of such shares pursuant to Section 2.01 (and cash in lieu of fractional shares
pursuant to Section 2.02(f) and in respect of any dividends or other
distributions pursuant to Section 2.02(d)). No interest will be paid or will
accrue on the cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate (or shares of
Company Common Stock held in book-entry form).

 

(d) _Treatment of Unexchanged Shares_. No dividends or other distributions
declared or made with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock with a record
date after the Effective Time will be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
Certificate (or shares of Company Common Stock held in book-entry form) with
respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon surrender
thereof, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares will be paid to any
such holder pursuant to Section 2.02(f), until the surrender of such
Certificate (or shares of Company Common Stock held in book-entry form) in
accordance with this ARTICLE II. Subject to applicable Law, following
surrender of any such Certificate (or shares of Company Common Stock held in
book-entry form), there will be paid to the holder of the certificate
representing whole shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange therefor,
without interest, (i) at the time of such surrender, the amount of any cash
payable pursuant to Section 2.01, the amount of cash payable in lieu of a
fractional share of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled
pursuant to Section 2.02(f) and the amount of dividends or other distributions
with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to
such whole shares of Parent Common Stock and (ii) at the appropriate payment
date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after
the Effective Time but prior to such surrender and a payment date subsequent
to such surrender payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common
Stock. 

(e) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. The shares of
Parent Common Stock issued and cash paid in accordance with the terms of this
ARTICLE II upon conversion of any shares of Company Common Stock (including
any cash paid pursuant to Section 2.02(f)) will be deemed to have been issued
and paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of
Company Common Stock. From and after the Effective Time, there will be no
further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any
Certificates formerly representing shares of Company Common Stock (or shares
of Company Common Stock held in book-entry form) are presented to Parent or
the Exchange Agent for any reason, they will be canceled and exchanged as
provided in this ARTICLE II.

(f) _No Fractional Shares_. No certificates or scrip representing fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock will be issued upon the conversion of Company
Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.01. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement, each holder of shares of Company Common Stock converted
pursuant to the Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a
fraction of

 



6  a share of Parent Common Stock (after taking into account all shares of
Company Common Stock exchanged by such holder) will receive, in lieu thereof,
cash (without interest) in an amount equal to such fractional amount
multiplied by the volume weighted average of the per share price of Parent
Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange (the " _NYSE_ ") (as reported by
Bloomberg L.P. or, if not reported therein, in another authoritative source
mutually selected by Parent and the Company) for the five consecutive trading
days ending on the third Business Day (including the Closing Date) prior to
the date of the Effective Time (the " _Parent Share Cash Value_ ").

(g) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including any interest received with respect thereto) that remains
undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock after the one year
anniversary of the Closing Date will be delivered to Parent and any holder of
Company Common Stock who has not theretofore complied with this ARTICLE II
will thereafter look only to Parent for payment of its claim for Merger
Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares and any dividends and
distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to this ARTICLE II,
in each case without any interest thereon and subject to applicable Law.

(h) _No Liability_. None of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or the Exchange
Agent will be liable to any Person in respect of any portion of the Exchange
Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which
remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates immediately prior to
such time on which the Exchange Fund would otherwise escheat to, or become the
property of, any Governmental Entity will, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, become the property of Parent, free and clear of all claims
or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

(i) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The cash portion of the Exchange Fund will
be invested by the Exchange Agent as directed by Parent in (i) short term
direct obligations of the United States of America with maturities of no more
than 30 days, (ii) short term obligations for which the full faith and credit
of the United States of America is pledged to provide for payment of all
principal and interest or (iii) commercial paper obligations receiving the
highest rating from either Moodys Investor Services, Inc. or Standard and
Poors. No gain or loss thereon will affect the amounts payable to the holders
of shares of Company Common Stock following completion of the Merger pursuant
to this Agreement. If for any reason (including any losses arising from the
investment of the Exchange Fund) the cash in the Exchange Fund is insufficient
to fully satisfy all of the payment obligations to be made in cash by the
Exchange Agent hereunder, Parent will promptly deposit cash into the Exchange
Fund in an amount equal to the deficiency in the amount of cash required to
fully satisfy such cash payment obligations. Any and all interest and other
income earned on the Exchange Fund will promptly be paid to Parent or an
Affiliate of Parent as directed by Parent.

(j) _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent and the Exchange Agent (without
duplication) will be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable to any holder of Company Common Stock pursuant to this
Agreement any amounts required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the

 



7  making of such payment under applicable Tax Law. Amounts so withheld and
paid over to the appropriate taxing authority will be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of shares of Company
Common Stock in respect of which such deduction or withholding was made.

(k) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent,
the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable and customary amount
as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against
it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue, in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the
Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares and any dividends
and distributions on the Certificate deliverable in respect thereof pursuant
to this Agreement.

 

Section 2.03. _Dissenters  Rights_. No Dissenting Stockholder will be
entitled to receive shares of Parent Common Stock or cash or any dividends or
other distributions pursuant to the provisions of this ARTICLE II unless and
until the holder thereof shall have failed to perfect or shall have
effectively withdrawn or lost such holders right to appraisal under the
DGCL, and any Dissenting Stockholder will be entitled to receive only the
payment provided in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to
shares owned by such Dissenting Stockholder. If any Person who otherwise would
be deemed a Dissenting Stockholder shall have failed to properly perfect or
shall have effectively withdrawn or lost the right to appraisal with respect
to any shares, such shares will thereupon be treated as though such shares had
been converted into the Merger Consideration. The Company will give Parent
(a) prompt written notice of any written demands for appraisal, withdrawals or
attempted withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments served
pursuant to applicable Law received by the Company relating to stockholders
rights of appraisal, and (b) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal. The Company will not,
except with the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment
with respect to any demands for appraisal, offer to settle or settle any such
demands or approve any withdrawal of any such demands.

 

Section 2.04. _Company Stock Plans_.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, each outstanding option to purchase shares of
Company Common Stock (a " _Company Stock Option_ ") under the Company Stock
Plans, whether vested or unvested, will be adjusted and converted into the
right of the holder to receive from the Surviving Corporation an amount in
cash equal to the product of (i) the total number of shares of Company Common
Stock subject to such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective
Time and (ii) the excess, if any, of the Equity Award Consideration over the
exercise price per share of Company Common Stock set forth in the
award certificate evidencing such Company Stock Option, less any required
withholding Taxes (the " _Option Cash Payment_ "), and as of the Effective
Time each Company Stock Option will be cancelled and each holder of a Company
Stock Option will cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the
right to receive the

 



8  Option Cash Payment. The " _Equity Award Consideration_ " means the sum of
(i) the Cash Consideration and (ii) an amount equal to the product of (A) the
Stock Consideration and (B) the Parent Share Cash Value. The Option Cash
Payment will be made promptly (and in any event within 10 Business Days)
following the Effective Time.

 

(b) At the Effective Time, each outstanding right to receive shares of Company
Common Stock or cash pursuant to the exercise of any stock appreciation right
(a " _Company SAR_ ") under the Company Stock Plans, whether vested or
unvested, will be adjusted and converted into the right of the holder to
receive from the Surviving Corporation an amount in cash equal to the product
of (i) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such
Company SAR immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the excess, if
any, of the Equity Award Consideration over the exercise price per share
of Company Common Stock set forth in the award certificate evidencing such
Company SAR, less any required withholding Taxes (the " _SAR Cash Payment_ "),
and as of the Effective Time each Company SAR will be cancelled and each
holder of a Company SAR will cease to have any rights with respect thereto,
except the right to receive the SAR Cash Payment. The SAR Cash Payment will be
made promptly (and in any event within 10 Business Days) following the
Effective Time.

 

(c) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each outstanding time-based
restricted stock unit and performance-based restricted stock unit (each, a "
_Company RSU_ ") under the Company Stock Plans will be converted at the
percentage rate, if applicable, specified in the award certificate evidencing
such Company RSU into unrestricted shares of Company Common Stock, subject to
any required withholding Taxes, and such unrestricted shares of Company Common
Stock will be treated as described in Section 2.01(b) of this Agreement.

 

(d) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each unvested share of restricted
Company Common Stock issued under the Company Stock Plans (" _Company
Restricted Stock_ ") will become vested and no longer subject to restrictions,
subject to any required withholding Taxes, and such vested and unrestricted
shares of Company Common Stock will be treated as described in Section
2.01(b) of this Agreement.

(e) At the Effective Time, each right of any kind, contingent or accrued, to
acquire or receive shares of Company Common Stock or benefits measured by the
value of shares of Company Common Stock, and each award of any kind consisting
of shares of Company Common Stock that may be held, awarded, outstanding,
payable or reserved for issuance under the Company Stock Plans, other than
the Company Stock Options, the Company SARs, the Company RSUs and the Company
Restricted Stock (the " _Company Awards_ "), if any, will be adjusted and
converted into the right of the holder to receive from the Surviving
Corporation an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the total number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Award immediately prior
to the Effective Time and (ii) the Equity Award Consideration, less any
required withholding Taxes (the " _Company Award Payment_ "), and as of the
Effective Time each holder of a Company Award will cease to have any rights
with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Company Award Payment;
_provided_ that to the extent application of this paragraph would result in
accelerated or additional

 



9  Taxes to be imposed on the holder of any Company Award or the Company or
other adverse tax treatment, then the Company and Parent will cooperate in
good faith and use commercially reasonable efforts to restructure the Company
Award Payment with respect to such Company Award in a manner that would avoid
accelerated or additional Taxes or other adverse tax treatment. The Company
Award Payment will be made promptly (and in any event within 10 Business
Days) following the Effective Time.

(f) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board (or, if appropriate, any
committee administering the Company Stock Plans) will adopt such resolutions
or take such other actions as may be required to effect the treatment of
equity-based awards described in clauses (a) through (e) of this Section 2.04.
At the direction of Parent, payment of any cash amounts to be paid pursuant
to this Section 2.04 may be made through the Companys (or the Surviving
Corporations) payroll.

 

Section 2.05. _Company Employee Stock Purchase Plan_. With respect to the
Companys Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the " _ESPP_ "), (a) no new offering
period will commence after the date of this Agreement and, to the extent not
already provided for under the terms of the ESPP as of the date of this
Agreement, no employees will be permitted to begin participating in the ESPP,
and no participants will be permitted to increase elective deferrals in
respect of the current offering period under the ESPP, in each case after the
date of this Agreement, (b) any offering period under the ESPP that is in
effect immediately prior to the date of this Agreement will terminate at the
closing of the offering period between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time, and amounts credited to the accounts of participants will be
used to purchase shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms
of the ESPP and (c) such shares of Company Common Stock will be treated as
other outstanding shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with Section
2.01(b) of this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, each fractional share
of Company Common Stock held by any participant under the ESPP (if any) will
be cancelled and extinguished at the Effective Time, and be converted into the
right to receive a commensurate fractional portion of the Merger
Consideration in cash (such amount to be determined in the same manner that
the Equity Award Consideration is calculated), without interest, payable to
the holder of each such fractional share of Company Common Stock.

Section 2.06. _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. In the event that, between
the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the Company changes the
number of shares of Company Common Stock or securities convertible or
exchangeable into or exercisable for any such shares of Company Common Stock,
or Parent changes the number of shares of Parent Common Stock, in each case
issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a result of a
reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split), stock
dividend or distribution, recapitalization, subdivision, or other similar
transaction, the Merger Consideration will be equitably adjusted to eliminate
the effects of such event on the Merger Consideration; _provided_ , _however_
, that nothing in this Section 2.06 will be construed as permitting the
Company to take any action or enter into any transaction otherwise prohibited
by this Agreement.

 



10 ARTICLE III

 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT AND MERGER SUB

 

Except (a) as set forth in the corresponding sections or subsections of the
disclosure letter delivered to the Company by Parent at the time of entering
into this Agreement (the " _Parent Disclosure Letter_ "), (b) as set forth in
any other section or subsection of the Parent Disclosure Letter to the extent
it is reasonably apparent from the wording of such disclosure that such
disclosure applies to such representation or warranty or (c) as set forth in
the Parent SEC Documents filed since January 1, 2014 but prior to the date of
this Agreement (excluding all disclosures in any " _Risk Factors_ " section
and any disclosures included in any such Parent SEC Documents that are
cautionary, predictive or forward looking in nature), Parent and Merger Sub
hereby represent and warrant to the Company that:

 

Section 3.01. _Organization, Standing and Power_. Parent is duly incorporated
and validly existing under the laws of the State of North Carolina. Each of
Parents Subsidiaries (the " _Parent Subsidiaries_ ") is duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction in
which it is organized (in the case of good standing, to the extent such
jurisdiction recognizes such concept), except where the failure to be so
organized, existing or in good standing, individually or in the aggregate, has
not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material
Adverse Effect. Each of Parent and each Parent Subsidiary has all requisite
power and authority and possesses all governmental franchises, licenses,
permits, authorizations, variances, exemptions, orders, registrations,
certificates, vacancies, clearances and approvals (collectively, " _Permits_
") necessary to enable it to own, operate, lease or otherwise hold its
properties, rights and assets and to conduct its businesses as presently
conducted (the " _Parent Permits_ "), except where the failure to have such
power or authority or to possess Parent Permits, individually or in the
aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect. Each of Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries is duly
qualified or licensed to do business in each jurisdiction where the nature of
its business or the ownership or leasing of its properties, rights and assets
make such qualification necessary, other than in such jurisdictions where the
failure to be so qualified or licensed, individually or in the aggregate, has
not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect. Parent has delivered or made available to the Company, prior to
execution of this Agreement, true and complete copies of (a) the amended and
restated articles of incorporation of Parent, as amended, in effect as of the
date of this Agreement (the " _Parent Articles_ ") and the amended and
restated bylaws of Parent in effect as of the date of this Agreement (the "
_Parent Bylaws_ ") and (b) the organizational documents of Merger Sub.

 

Section 3.02. _Merger Sub; Parent Subsidiaries_.

 

(a) Parent is the sole shareholder of Merger Sub. Since its date of
incorporation, Merger Sub has not carried on any business or conducted
any operations other than the execution of this Agreement, the performance of
its obligations hereunder and matters ancillary thereto.

 



11 (b) All the outstanding shares of capital stock or voting securities of, or
other equity interests in, each of the Parent Subsidiaries have been validly
issued and fully paid, are nonassessable and are owned by Parent, by another
Parent Subsidiary or by Parent and another Parent Subsidiary, free and clear
of all material pledges, liens, claims, charges, mortgages, deeds of trust,
rights of first offer or first refusal, options, encumbrances and security
interests of any kind or nature whatsoever (collectively, with covenants,
conditions, restrictions, easements, encroachments, title retention
agreements or other third party rights or title defect of any kind or nature
whatsoever, " _Liens_ "), and free of any other restriction (including any
restriction on the right to vote, sell or otherwise dispose of such capital
stock, voting securities or other equity interests), except for restrictions
imposed by applicable securities laws. Section 3.02(b) of the Parent
Disclosure Letter sets forth, as of the date of this Agreement, a true and
complete list of the Parent Subsidiaries.

(c) Except for the capital stock and voting securities of, and other equity
interests in, the Parent Subsidiaries, neither Parent nor any Parent
Subsidiary owns, directly or indirectly, any capital stock or voting
securities of, or other equity interests in, or any interest convertible into
or exchangeable or exercisable for, any capital stock or voting securities
of, or other equity interests in, any firm, corporation, partnership, company,
limited liability company, trust, joint venture, association or other entity
other than ordinary course investments in publicly traded
securities constituting one percent or less of a class of outstanding
securities of any entity.

Section 3.03. _Capital Structure_.

 

(a) The authorized capital stock of Parent consists of 1,600,000,000 shares of
Parent Common Stock and 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value
$0.01 per share (the " _Parent Preferred Stock_ " and, together with the

on July 7, 2014, (i) 531,283,513 shares of Parent Common Stock were issued

set forth in the performance share agreement evidencing such
Parent Performance Shares) and (B) 344,593 shares of Parent Common Stock
issuable upon settlement of deferred stock units of Parent (the " _Parent
DSUs_ "), and (iv) 34,116,111 shares of Parent Common Stock were reserved
and available for issuance for awards not yet granted under Parent Stock
Plans. Except as set forth in this Section 3.03(a) (and other than (i) shares

and (ii) shares of Parent Capital Stock that may be issued pursuant to the
Rights Agreement), at the close of business on July 7, 2014, no shares of

were issued, reserved for issuance or outstanding. From the close of business
on July 7, 2014 to the date of this Agreement, there have been no issuances by
Parent of shares of capital stock or voting securities of, or other equity

fully paid and nonassessable and not subject to, or issued in violation of,
any purchase option, call option, right of first refusal, preemptive right,
subscription right or any similar right under any provision of the North
Carolina Business Corporations Act (the " _NCBCA_ "), the Parent Articles, the
Parent Bylaws or any Contract to which Parent is a party or otherwise bound
(other than rights granted pursuant to the Rights Agreement). The shares of
Parent Common Stock constituting the Stock Consideration will be, when issued,
duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and not subject
to, or issued in violation of, any purchase option, call option, right of
first refusal, preemptive right, subscription right or any similar right under
any provision of the NCBCA, the Parent Articles, the Parent Bylaws or any
Contract to which Parent is a party or otherwise bound (other than rights
granted pursuant to the Rights Agreement). Except as set forth in this
Agreement and pursuant to the terms of the Subscription Agreement (and other
than obligations under the Rights Agreement and rights issued in accordance
with the Rights Agreement), there are no issued, reserved for issuance or
outstanding, and there are no outstanding obligations of Parent or any Parent
Subsidiary to issue, deliver or sell, or cause to be issued, delivered or
sold, (i) any capital stock of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary or any
securities of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary convertible into or exchangeable
or exercisable for shares of capital stock or voting securities of, or other
equity interests in, Parent or any Parent Subsidiary, (ii) any warrants,
calls, options or other rights to acquire from Parent or any Parent
Subsidiary, or any other obligation of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary to
issue, deliver or sell, or cause to be issued, delivered or sold, any capital
stock or voting securities of, or other equity interests in, Parent or any
Parent Subsidiary, or (iii) any rights issued by or other obligations of
Parent or any Parent Subsidiary that are linked in any way to the price of
any class of Parent Capital Stock or any shares of capital stock of any Parent
Subsidiary, the value of Parent, any Parent Subsidiary or any part of Parent
or any Parent Subsidiary or any dividends or other distributions declared or
paid on any shares of capital stock of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary. Other
than (A) the withholding of shares of Parent Common Stock to satisfy tax
obligations with respect to awards granted pursuant to the Parent Stock
Plans, (B) the acquisition by Parent of awards granted pursuant to the Parent
Stock Plans in connection with the forfeiture of such awards and (C)
obligations under the Rights Agreement and Governance Agreement, there are not
any outstanding obligations of Parent or any of the Parent Subsidiaries to
repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any shares of capital stock or voting
securities or other equity interests of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary or any
securities, interests, warrants, calls, options or other rights referred to
in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) of the immediately preceding sentence. There are
no bonds, debentures, notes or other Indebtedness of Parent having the right
to vote (or convertible into, or exchangeable for, securities having the
right to vote) on any matters on which shareholders of Parent may vote
(collectively, " _Parent Voting Debt_ "). Except for the Subscription
Agreement, neither Parent nor any of the Parent Subsidiaries is a party to

 



13  any voting agreement with respect to the voting of any capital stock or
voting securities of, or other equity interests in, Parent. Except for the
Governance Agreement, neither Parent nor any of the Parent Subsidiaries is a
party to any agreement pursuant to which any Person is entitled to elect,
designate or nominate any director of Parent or any of the Parent
Subsidiaries.

 

(c) As of the date of this Agreement, neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary
owns any shares of Company Common Stock.

 

Section 3.04. _Authority; Execution and Delivery; Enforceability_.

 

(a) Parent has all requisite corporate power and authority to execute and
deliver this Agreement and each of the other Transaction Agreements to which
it is a party, to perform its obligations hereunder and thereunder and to
consummate the Merger and the other Transactions, subject, with respect to the
Share Issuance, to the receipt of the Parent Shareholder Approval. Merger Sub
has all requisite corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this
Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder and to consummate the Merger
and the other Transactions, subject to the approval of this Agreement by
Parent as the sole shareholder of Merger Sub. The Parent Board has
unanimously adopted resolutions (i) determining that the terms of the

interests of Parent and its shareholders, (ii) approving this Agreement, the
Merger and the other Transactions and (iii) recommending that Parents
shareholders approve the Share Issuance (the " _Parent Recommendation_ ") and

_Parent Shareholders Meeting_ "). As of the date of this Agreement, such

be disclosed by Parent in the reports that it files or submits under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and that all such
information required to be disclosed is accumulated and communicated to the
management of Parent to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure
and to enable the chief executive officer and chief financial officer of
Parent to make the certifications required under the Exchange Act with
respect to such reports.

fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading. The Joint Proxy Statement will comply as to form in all
material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder, except that no representation is made by Parent or
Merger Sub with respect to statements made or incorporated by reference
therein based on information supplied by the Company for inclusion

40 Section 4.17. _Intellectual Property_.

 

(a) Section 4.17(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth, as of the

pending Patent applications, registered Marks, pending applications for

Intellectual Property (the foregoing being, collectively, the " _Company
Registered Intellectual Property_ ") and, for each item of Company Registered

Property is subsisting and unexpired, and to the Knowledge of the Company,

knowingly misrepresented or failed to disclose any material facts or
circumstances for which it has a duty to disclose in any application for any
material Company Registered Intellectual Property that would constitute fraud
or a material misrepresentation with respect to such application or
that would otherwise adversely affect the validity or enforceability of any
such Company Registered Intellectual Property in any material respect. All
Company Registered Intellectual Property and, except for matters which,
individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, all other Company Owned
Intellectual Property is wholly and exclusively owned by the Company or one of
its Subsidiaries, and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
sold, transferred, assigned, promised in sale or otherwise disposed of any
rights or interests therein or thereto.

written notice alleging them to be in breach or default of any Material
Contracts (i) to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party, and

right to use any third Persons Intellectual Property. Except for matters
which, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably
be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, the conduct of the
business of the Company and its Subsidiaries as currently conducted and as
previously conducted in the last six years does not infringe, violate, or
constitute misappropriation of, any Intellectual Property of any third Person.

 

(c) No Action is pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened, that
alleges that the Company or any Company Subsidiary is infringing,
misappropriating or otherwise violating any Persons Intellectual Property
rights. To the Knowledge of the Company, no third Person is infringing,
violating, or misappropriating any Company Owned Intellectual Property in
any material respect.

and would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect, each of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries has established
privacy compliance policies and is in substantial compliance with, and since
January 1, 2013 has been in substantial compliance with, its respective

Contract, arrangement or understanding, whether written or oral, with any
union, trade union, works council or other employee representative body or any
material number or category of its employees which would prevent or restrict
or impede the consummation of the Transactions or prevent the implementation
of any layoff, redundancy, severance or similar program within its or their
respective workforces (or any part of them).

 

(b) Except for the labor organizations identified in the Company CBAs, no
labor organization or group of employees represents or, to the Knowledge of
the Company, purports to represent, any employees of the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries with respect to their service to the Company or any of
the Company Subsidiaries. Since January 1, 2013, no labor organization
or group of employees of the Company or any Company Subsidiary has made a
demand for recognition or certification, or, to the Knowledge of the Company,
otherwise sought to represent or organize any non-union employees of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary, and there are no representation or
certification proceedings or petitions seeking a representation proceeding
presently pending or threatened to be brought or filed, with the National

other labor union Contract applicable to any employees of the Company or any
of the Company Subsidiaries, except for any breaches or failures to comply

be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. There are no material

Section 5.02. _No Solicitation by the Company; Company Recommendation_.

 

(a) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, from the date of this
Agreement until the Effective Time or, if earlier, the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with its terms, the Company will not, nor will it
authorize or permit any of its Subsidiaries or any of its or their respective
directors, officers or employees or any of their respective investment
bankers, accountants, attorneys or other advisors, agents or representatives
(collectively, " _Representatives_ ") to, directly or indirectly (i) solicit
or initiate, or knowingly encourage, induce, facilitate or cooperate with, any
Company Takeover Proposal or any inquiry or proposal that would reasonably be
expected to lead to a Company Takeover Proposal, or (ii) participate in any
substantive discussions or negotiations with any Person regarding, or furnish
to any Person any non-public information relating to the Company or the
Company Subsidiaries with respect to any Company Takeover Proposal or any
inquiry or proposal that would reasonably be expected to lead to a Company
Takeover Proposal. The Company will, and will cause the Company Subsidiaries
and direct its and their respective Representatives to, immediately cease and
cause to be terminated all existing discussions or negotiations with any
Person conducted prior to the execution of this Agreement with respect to any

 



51  Company Takeover Proposal or any inquiry or proposal that would reasonably
be expected to lead to a Company Takeover Proposal, request the prompt return
or destruction of all confidential information previously furnished to any
such Person or its Representatives and immediately terminate all physical and
electronic data room access previously granted to any such Person or its
Representatives. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to
obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, in response to a written Company
Takeover Proposal that the Company Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with its outside counsel and financial advisor) is _bona fide_
and constitutes or is reasonably expected to result in or lead to a Superior
Proposal, and which Company Takeover Proposal did not result from a breach of
this Section 5.02(a), the Company, and the Company Subsidiaries and its and
their respective Representatives at the request of the Company may, subject
to compliance with Section 5.02(c) in all material respects, (x) provide
access to its and the Company Subsidiaries properties, books and records and
furnish information with respect to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
to the Person making such Company Takeover Proposal (and its Representatives)
( _provided_ the Company provides to Parent any material non-public
information concerning the Company that is provided to such Person (and its
Representatives) to the extent such information has not previously been
provided to Parent prior to or substantially concurrent with the time it is
provided to such Person) pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement
with such Person ( _provided_ that the Company promptly provides to Parent a
copy of such Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement), and (y) participate in
discussions regarding the terms of such Company Takeover Proposal and
the negotiation of such terms with, and only with, the Person or Persons
making such Company Takeover Proposal (and such Persons or Persons
Representatives and financing sources).

 

(b) Except as set forth in this Section 5.02, neither the Company Board nor
any committee thereof will (i) (A) withhold or withdraw (or modify in any
manner adverse to Parent), or propose publicly to withhold or withdraw (or
modify in any manner adverse to Parent), the Company Recommendation or (B)
approve, recommend or declare advisable, or propose publicly to
approve, recommend or declare advisable, any Company Takeover Proposal (any
action in this clause (i) being referred to as a " _Company Adverse
Recommendation Change_ ") or (ii) adopt, or propose publicly to adopt, or
allow the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries to execute or enter
into, any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in
principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint
venture agreement, alliance agreement, partnership agreement or other similar
Contract or arrangement providing for any Company Takeover Proposal (other
than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement pursuant to Section 5.02(a)).
Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything else to the contrary in this
Agreement, at any time prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval,
the Company Board may (I) make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or
terminate this Agreement in accordance with Section 8.01(g), in each
case following receipt of a Company Takeover Proposal after the execution of
this Agreement that did not result from a breach of Section 5.02(a) and that
the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its
outside counsel and financial advisor, would, if consummated, constitute a
Superior Proposal after giving effect to all of the adjustments to the terms
of this Agreement that have been

 



52  offered in writing by Parent in accordance with this Section 5.02(b) or (II)
make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change in response to a Company
Intervening Event, in each case referred to in the foregoing clauses (I) and
(II), only if the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation
with its outside counsel and financial advisor) that the failure to do so
would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Company will not be entitled to exercise its
rights to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or terminate this
Agreement in accordance with Section 8.01(g) unless (x) the Company delivers
to Parent a written notice (a " _Company Notice_ ") advising Parent that the
Company Board intends to take such action and specifying the reasons therefor,
including, in the case of a Company Intervening Event, summarizing
such Company Intervening Event and, in the case of a Superior Proposal, (A)
the identity of the party making such Superior Proposal, (B) the material
terms and conditions of the Superior Proposal that is the basis of the
proposed action by the Company Board and (C) a copy of the most current
version of any proposed definitive agreement(s) with respect to such Superior
Proposal and (y) at or after 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the fourth
Business Day following the day on which the Company delivered the Company
Notice (it being understood that for purposes of calculating such four
Business Days, the first Business Day will be the first Business Day after the
date of such delivery), the Company reaffirms in good faith (after
consultation with its outside counsel and financial advisor) that (A) such
Company Takeover Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Proposal or such
Company Intervening Event remains in effect, as the case may be, and (B)
the failure to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change as a result
thereof would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law
(it being understood and agreed that any change in the financial terms or any
other material amendment to the terms and conditions of such Superior
Proposal will require a new Company Notice and a new two Business Day period
(it being understood that any such two Business Day period will be calculated
in the same manner as the initial four Business Day period)). In determining
whether to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or terminate this
Agreement in accordance with Section 8.01(g), the Company Board will take into
account any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed in writing by
Parent by 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the last Business Day of the
applicable four Business Day period or two Business Day period, as applicable,
in response to a Company Notice, and if requested by Parent, the Company will,
and will cause its Representatives to, engage in good faith negotiations with
Parent and its Representatives to make such adjustments in the terms and
conditions of this Agreement so that such Company Takeover Proposal would
cease to constitute a Superior Proposal. The Company will keep Parent
reasonably informed of developments with respect to any Company Intervening
Event.

(c) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in paragraphs (a)
and (b) of this Section 5.02, the Company will promptly, and in any event
within 24 hours of the Company obtaining Knowledge of the receipt thereof,
advise Parent in writing of any Company Takeover Proposal or any inquiry or
proposal that would reasonably be expected to lead to a Company Takeover
Proposal, the material terms and conditions of any such Company Takeover
Proposal (including any changes thereto) and the identity of the Person
making any such Company Takeover Proposal.

 



53  The Company will (i) keep Parent reasonably informed in all material
respects and on a reasonably current basis of the status and developments
(including any material change to the terms thereof) of any Company Takeover
Proposal and (ii) provide to Parent within 24 hours after receipt or delivery
thereof all drafts of agreements relating to any Company Takeover Proposal and
any written proposals containing any material terms of a Company Takeover
Proposal or a counterproposal to a Company Takeover Proposal (which copies
may, at the Companys election, be redacted to exclude, if applicable, fee and
market flex provisions as may be contained in any financing-
related commitment letters), in each case exchanged between any of the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or any of their Representatives, on
the one hand, and the Person making any such Company Takeover Proposal or any
of its Affiliates or any of their Representatives, on the other hand.

(d) Nothing contained in this Section 5.02 will prohibit the Company from (i)
complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act
(including making any "stop-look-and-listen" communication to the Companys
stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f)) or (ii) making any disclosure to
the Companys stockholders if the Company Board determines in good faith,
after consultation with its outside counsel, that the failure to make such
disclosure would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties or applicable Law;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that (x) in no event will the Company or the
Company Board or any committee thereof take, or agree or resolve to take, any
action prohibited by Section 5.02(b) and (y) any public disclosure made by or
on behalf of the Company that refers to a Company Takeover Proposal will be
deemed to be a Company Adverse Recommendation Change (including for purposes
of Section 8.01(e)) unless the Company Board expressly reaffirms the Company
Recommendation in such disclosure. 

(e) For purposes of this Agreement:

 

" _Company Takeover Proposal_ " means any inquiry, proposal or offer (whether
or not in writing) from any Person or group of Persons (other than Parent or
Merger Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries) with respect to any (i)
merger, consolidation, share exchange, other business combination or similar
transaction involving the Company or any Company Subsidiary, pursuant to
which such Person or group of Persons (or Affiliates thereof) would acquire
15% or more of the consolidated revenues, net income or assets of the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (ii) sale,
lease, contribution or other disposition, directly or indirectly (including
by way of merger, consolidation, share exchange, other business combination,
partnership, joint venture, sale of capital stock of or other equity interests
in a Company Subsidiary or otherwise) to such Person or group of Persons (or
Affiliates thereof) of any business or assets of the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries representing 15% or more of the consolidated revenues, net income
or assets of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
(iii) issuance, sale or other disposition, directly or indirectly, to such
Person or group of Persons (or Affiliates thereof) of securities (or options,
rights or warrants to purchase, or securities convertible into or
exchangeable for, such securities) representing 15% or more of the total

 



54  outstanding voting power of the Company, (iv) transaction in which such
Person or group of Persons (or Affiliates thereof) will acquire, directly or
indirectly, beneficial ownership, or the right to acquire beneficial
ownership, of 15% or more of the Company Common Stock or (v) combination of
the foregoing (in each case, other than the Transactions); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that any proposal or offer relating to any purchase of assets of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary contemplated by the Parties in
connection with the Merger or the other Transactions will not be deemed a
Company Takeover Proposal.

 

" _Superior Proposal_ " means any _bona fide_ written offer from a third party
(other than Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries)
that, if consummated, would result in such Person (or, in the case of a direct
merger between such Person and the Company, the stockholders of such Person)
acquiring, directly or indirectly, more than 50% of the voting power of the
Company Common Stock or all or substantially all the assets of the Company and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and which offer, in the good faith
judgment of the Company Board (after consultation with its outside counsel
and financial advisor), if consummated would result in a transaction that is
more favorable from a financial point of view to the stockholders of the
Company than the Merger, taking into account all such factors and matters
(including all of the terms and conditions of, and the likelihood of
completion of, such proposal and of this Agreement (including any changes to
the terms of this Agreement proposed in writing by Parent in response to such
Superior Proposal pursuant to, and in accordance with, Section 5.02(b))) that
the Company Board considers relevant.

Section 5.03. _Parent Recommendation_. Except as set forth in this Section
5.03, neither the Parent Board nor any committee thereof will withhold or
withdraw (or modify in any manner adverse to the Company), or propose publicly
to withhold or withdraw (or modify in any manner adverse to the Company), the
Parent Recommendation (any such action being referred to as a " _Parent
Adverse Recommendation Change_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything
else to the contrary in this Agreement, at any time prior to obtaining the
Parent Shareholder Approval, the Parent Board may make a Parent Adverse
Recommendation Change in response to a Parent Intervening Event if the Parent
Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside counsel
and financial advisor) that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with
its fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

ARTICLE VI

 

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

 

Section 6.01. _Preparation of the Form S-4 and the Joint Proxy Statement;
Company Stockholders Meeting and Parent Shareholders Meeting_.

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this
Agreement, Parent and the Company will jointly prepare and cause to be filed
with the SEC a joint proxy statement to be sent to the shareholders of Parent
and the stockholders of the Company relating to the Parent Shareholders
Meeting and the

 



55  Company Stockholders Meeting, respectively (together with any amendments or
supplements thereto, the " _Joint Proxy Statement_ ") and Parent will prepare
and cause to be filed with the SEC the Form S-4, in which the Joint Proxy
Statement will be included as a prospectus, and Parent and the Company will
use their respective reasonable best efforts to have the Form S-4 declared
effective under the Securities Act as promptly as reasonably practicable
after such filing and to maintain the effectiveness of the Form S-4 as long as
is necessary to consummate the Merger and the transactions contemplated
hereby. Each of the Company and Parent will furnish all information
concerning such Person and its Affiliates to the other, and provide such other
assistance, as may be reasonably requested in connection with the preparation,
filing and distribution of the Form S-4 and Joint Proxy Statement, and the
Form S-4 and Joint Proxy Statement will include all information reasonably
requested by such other party to be included therein. Each of the Company and
Parent will promptly notify the other upon the receipt of any comments
from the SEC or any request from the SEC for amendments or supplements to the
Form S-4 or Joint Proxy Statement and will provide the other with copies of
all correspondence between it and its Representatives, on the one hand, and
the SEC, on the other hand. Each of the Company and Parent will use its
reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as reasonably practicable to
any comments from the SEC with respect to the Form S-4 or Joint Proxy
Statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to filing the Form S-4 (or
any amendment or supplement thereto) or mailing the Joint Proxy Statement (or

with respect thereto, each of the Company and Parent (i) will provide the
other an opportunity to review and comment on such document or response
(including the proposed final version of such document or response), (ii) will
include in such document or response all comments reasonably proposed by
the other and (iii) will not file or mail such document or respond to the SEC
prior to receiving the approval of the other, which approval will not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; _provided_ , _however_ , that
with respect to documents filed by a Party which are incorporated by
reference in the Form S-4 or Joint Proxy Statement, this right of approval
will apply only with respect to material information (if any) relating to (1)
any Transaction Agreement or the Transactions that has not previously been
disclosed in a similar manner in the SEC filings of such Party or (2) to
another Party or its business, financial condition or results of operations;
_provided_ , _further_ , (x) that Parent, in connection with a Parent Adverse
Recommendation Change, may amend or supplement the Joint Proxy Statement
(including by incorporation by reference) pursuant to a Qualifying Amendment
to effect such Parent Adverse Recommendation Change and (y) that the Company,
in connection with a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, may amend or
supplement the Joint Proxy Statement (including by incorporation by reference)
pursuant to a Qualifying Amendment to effect such Company
Adverse Recommendation Change. Each of the Company and Parent will advise the
other, promptly after receipt of notice thereof, of the time of effectiveness
of the Form S-4, the issuance of any stop order relating thereto or the
suspension of the qualification of the Merger Consideration for offering or
sale in any jurisdiction, and each of the Company and Parent will use its
reasonable best efforts to have any such stop order or suspension lifted,
reversed or otherwise terminated. Each of the Company and Parent will also
take any other action (other than

 



56  qualifying to do business in any jurisdiction in which it is not now so
qualified) required to be taken under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act,
any applicable state securities or "blue sky" laws and the rules and
regulations thereunder in connection with the Transactions.

(b) If prior to the Effective Time, any event occurs with respect to Parent
or any Parent Subsidiary, or any change occurs with respect to other
information supplied by Parent for inclusion in the Joint Proxy Statement or
the Form S-4, which is required to be described in an amendment of, or a
supplement to, the Joint Proxy Statement or the Form S-4, Parent will promptly
notify the Company of such event, and the Company and Parent will cooperate in
the prompt filing with the SEC of any necessary amendment or supplement to the
Joint Proxy Statement or the Form S-4 and, as required by applicable Law, in
disseminating the information contained in such amendment or supplement to
Parents shareholders and the Companys stockholders. Nothing in this Section
6.01(b) will limit the obligations of any party under Section 6.01(a).

(c) If prior to the Effective Time, any event occurs with respect to the
Company or any Company Subsidiary, or any change occurs with respect to other
information supplied by the Company for inclusion in the Joint Proxy Statement
or the Form S-4, which is required to be described in an amendment of, or a
supplement to, the Joint Proxy Statement or the Form S-4, the Company will
promptly notify Parent of such event, and the Company and Parent will
cooperate in the prompt filing with the SEC of any necessary amendment or
supplement to the Joint Proxy Statement or the Form S-4 and, as required by
applicable Law, in disseminating the information contained in such amendment
or supplement to Parents shareholders and the Companys stockholders. Nothing
in this Section 6.01(c) will limit the obligations of any party under Section
6.01(a).

(d) Parent will, as soon as reasonably practicable following the date the Form
S-4 is declared effective by the SEC, duly call, give notice of, convene and

subject to Section 5.03, solicit proxies in favor of the Share Issuance.
Parent will include the Parent Recommendation in the Joint Proxy Statement,

representing a sufficient number of shares of Parent Common Stock to obtain
the Parent Shareholder Approval, whether or not a quorum is present, Parent
will have the right to make one or more successive postponements or
adjournments of the Parent Shareholders Meeting, _provided_ that the
Parent Shareholders Meeting is not postponed or adjourned to a date that is
more than 30 days after the date for which the Parent Shareholders Meeting was
originally scheduled (excluding any adjournments or postponements required
by 

 



57  applicable Law). Parent agrees that, unless this Agreement has been
terminated in accordance with Section 8.01, its obligations pursuant to this
Section 6.01 will not be affected by the making of any Parent Adverse

Intervening Event. Parent will use its reasonable best efforts to enforce
BATs and its Affiliates voting and other obligations under the Subscription
Agreement.

(e) The Company will, as soon as reasonably practicable following the date the
Form S-4 is declared effective by the SEC, duly call, give notice of, convene
and hold the Company Stockholders Meeting for the sole purpose of seeking the
Company Stockholder Approval. The Company will use its reasonable best efforts
to (i) cause the Joint Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Companys
stockholders and to hold the Company Stockholders Meeting as soon as
reasonably practicable after the Form S-4 is declared effective under the
Securities Act and (ii) subject to Section 5.02(b), solicit proxies in favor
of the adoption of this Agreement. The Company will include the Company
Recommendation in the Joint Proxy Statement, except to the extent that the
Company Board shall have made a Company Adverse Recommendation Change as

this Section 6.01(e), if on a date for which the Company Stockholders Meeting
is scheduled, the Company has not received proxies representing a sufficient
number of shares of Company Common Stock to obtain the Company Stockholder
Approval, whether or not a quorum is present, the Company will have the right
to make one or more successive postponements or adjournments of the Company
Stockholders Meeting, _provided_  that the Company Stockholders Meeting is
not postponed or adjourned to a date that is more than 30 days after the date
for which the Company Stockholders Meeting was originally scheduled (excluding
any adjournments or postponements required by applicable Law). The Company
agrees that, unless this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with
Section 8.01, its obligations pursuant to this Section 6.01 will not be
affected by the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or
communication to the Company of any Company Takeover Proposal, by the making
of any Company Adverse Recommendation Change by the Company Board or the
occurrence of a Company Intervening Event.

 

(f) The parties will use their reasonable best efforts to hold the Company
Stockholders Meeting and the Parent Shareholders Meeting on the same day at
the same time.

(g) Immediately following execution and delivery of this Agreement by the
Parties, Parent, as sole shareholder of Merger Sub, will adopt this Agreement

Company nor any of its Subsidiaries will (A) be required to cooperate with
the foregoing to the extent that it would cause any condition to the Closing
set forth in ARTICLE VII to not be satisfied or otherwise cause any breach of
this Agreement or would conflict with or violate the Companys or any of its
Subsidiaries organizational documents or any Law or result in the
contravention of, or result in a violation or breach of, or default under, any
Contract to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by

none of the Company, the Companys Subsidiaries or their respective general
partners, managing members, directors, managers, officers or employees shall
be required to execute, deliver or enter into, or perform any agreement,
document or instrument, including any definitive financing agreement to be
entered into in connection with the Financing that is not contingent upon the
Closing or that would be effective prior to the Effective Time. Parent (x)
will promptly, upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company for all
reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys

therewith, except with respect to any information provided by the Company, or
any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives.

 

(c) Subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information, from
the date of this Agreement until the earlier to occur of the Effective Time
and the

 



60  termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, Parent will, and
will cause its Subsidiaries and the Representatives of Parent and its

during normal working hours upon reasonable advance notice to the officers,
employees, agents, assets, properties, offices, plants and other facilities,
books and records of Parent and each of its Subsidiaries and will timely

unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the business of Parent or the
Company or their respective Subsidiaries or damage or destroy any property or
assets of Parent, the Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 6.02 to the contrary,
Parent or the Company, as the case may be, may withhold any document or
information the disclosure of which (i) would, in the reasonable judgment of
the disclosing party, cause a violation of Law or any agreement to which such
Party or its Subsidiaries is a party (provided that such Party will use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain the required consent of such third party to
such access or disclosure) or (ii) would be reasonably likely to risk a loss
of legal privilege (provided that such Party will use its reasonable best
efforts to allow for such access or disclosure (or as much of it as possible)
in a manner that does not result in a loss of legal privilege). If any
material is withheld by a Party pursuant to the immediately preceding
sentence, that Party will, to the extent possible without violating Law or any
agreement or risking a loss of legal privilege, inform the other Parties as
to the general nature of what is being withheld. All information obtained by
Parent or the Company or their respective Representatives pursuant to this
Section 6.02 will be held confidential in accordance with the Letter
Agreement, dated March 5, 2014 (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), among
Parent, the Company and BAT; _provided_ that nothing herein or in the
Confidentiality Agreement will prevent Parent or its Financing Sources from
using all information obtained pursuant to Section 6.02(b) as necessary and
appropriate to consummate the Financing (including disclosure to potential
Financing Sources and to rating agencies and prospective lenders and
investors).

 

(e) The Company hereby consents to the use of all of its and its Subsidiaries
logos in connection with the Financing; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that such
logos are used solely in a manner that is not intended to or reasonably likely
to harm or disparage the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or the
reputation or goodwill of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries.

Section 6.03. _Required Actions_.

 

(a) Each of the Parties will use their respective reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do, or cause to be done, and
assist and cooperate with the other Parties and the other parties to the other
Transaction Agreements in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to
cause the conditions to closing of the Transactions to be satisfied as
promptly as practicable (and in any

 



61  event no later than the End Date) and to consummate and make effective, as
promptly as reasonably practicable, the Transactions, including (i) preparing
and filing with any Governmental Entity or other third party all
documentation to effect all necessary filings, notifications, notices,
petitions, statements, registrations, submissions of information, applications
and other documents (including any required filings under Antitrust Laws) and
(ii) obtaining promptly (and in any event no later than the End Date) and
maintaining all Consents from any Governmental Entity necessary to consummate
the Transactions. None of the Parties will, nor will it permit any of
its Subsidiaries to, take or agree to take any action that would reasonably
be expected to (x) impose any material delay in the obtaining of, or
materially increase the risk of not obtaining, any required Consent from any
Governmental Entity with respect to the Transactions, (y) materially increase
the risk of any Governmental Entity entering a Legal Restraint prohibiting or
materially delaying the consummation of the Transactions or (z) materially
increase the risk of not being able to remove any such Legal Restraint on
appeal or otherwise. Nothing set forth in this Section 6.03 limits, modifies,
waives, amends or otherwise adversely affects any Partys rights under Section
5.02 or Section 5.03 or ARTICLE VIII.

(b) In connection with and without limiting Section 6.03(a), the Company and
the Company Board and Parent and the Parent Board will use their respective
reasonable best efforts to (i) take all action reasonably appropriate to
ensure that no state takeover statute or similar statute or regulation is or
becomes applicable to the Transaction Agreements or the Transactions and (ii)
if any state takeover statute or similar statute or regulation becomes
applicable to the Transaction Agreements or the Transactions, take all action
reasonably appropriate to ensure that the Transactions may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by the applicable
Transaction Agreements.

(c) In connection with and without limiting Section 6.03(a), Parent and the
Company will cooperate in good faith to seek to obtain all Consents required
by the terms of any material Contracts with third parties or material Permits
in connection with the Transactions.

 

(d) In connection with and without limiting Section 6.03(a), the Company and
Parent will (and, to the extent relating to the Transactions contemplated by
the Asset Purchase Agreement and the Transfer Agreement, each of Parent and
the Company will use its reasonable best efforts to cause Lignum-2 to)
promptly enter into discussions with the Governmental Entities from whom
Consents or nonactions are required to be obtained in connection with the
consummation of the Merger and the other Transactions in order to obtain all
such required Consents or nonactions from such Governmental Entities, in each
case with respect to the consummation of the Merger and the other
Transactions, so as to enable the closing to occur as promptly as reasonably
practicable, and in any event no later than the End Date. The Parties
understand and agree that, to the extent necessary in order to accomplish the
foregoing and subject to the limitations set forth in Section 6.03(h),
Parents obligations under Section 6.03(a) include (and none of the
obligations set forth in this sentence will be limited or qualified
by "reasonable best efforts") negotiating, committing to and effecting, by
consent decree, hold separate order, condition or approval or otherwise, (i)
the sale,

 



62  divestiture or disposition of, any businesses, assets, equity interests,
product lines, properties, services of Parent, the Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries, (ii) the prohibition or limitation on (A) the
ownership or operation of, or any requirements or undertakings with respect to
the conduct by, the Company, Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries
of, any portion of the business, product lines, properties, services or
assets of the Company or its Subsidiaries, (B) the ability of Parent to
acquire or hold, or exercise full right of ownership of, any shares of the
capital stock of the Company or its Subsidiaries, including the right
to vote, or (C) Parent effectively controlling the business or operations of
the Company or its Subsidiaries and (iii) if necessary, the replacement of the
Asset Purchase Agreement, the Transfer Agreement and the transactions
contemplated thereby, including with respect to the identity of the parties
thereto and any of the terms or conditions; _provided_ , _however_ , that
neither Parent nor the Company will be required pursuant to this Section
6.03(d) to commit to or effect any action, prohibition, limitation,
requirement or undertaking that (x) in the case of the foregoing clauses (i),
(ii) and (iii), is not conditioned (as either a condition precedent or
subsequent) upon the consummation of the Merger, (y) in the case of the
foregoing clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) would revise the terms of the Asset
Purchase Agreement, Transfer Agreement and transactions contemplated thereby
with Imperial, or (z) in the case of the foregoing clauses (i), (ii) and
(iii) would or would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Substantial Detriment; _provided_ , _further_ , that for purposes
of this Agreement (1) none of the Asset Purchase Agreement or the Transfer
Agreement, in each case as in effect on the date of this Agreement (or after
giving effect to any amendment thereof not required by Section 6.03 but that
is otherwise consented to by Parent) or the transactions contemplated thereby
will be deemed to result in a Substantial Detriment, (2) in the case of any
replacement of the Asset Purchase Agreement, the Transfer Agreement or the
transactions contemplated thereby pursuant to clause (iii), only the extent
to which the terms and conditions of such replacement of the Asset Purchase
Agreement, the Transfer Agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby are
less favorable to Parent than the terms and conditions of the Asset Purchase
Agreement, the Transfer Agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby
(without giving effect to such replacement) will be taken into account for
purposes of determining if such replacement would or would reasonably be
expected to have a Substantial Detriment and (3) Parent shall not be
obligated to sell, divest or dispose any brands or product lines other than
Winston, Salem, KOOL, Doral, Maverick and blu.

 

(e) To assist Parent in complying with its obligations set forth in this
Section 6.03, if requested by Parent, the Company will, and will cause its
Subsidiaries to, execute any amendment or modification to the Asset Purchase
Agreement or the Transfer Agreement or enter into one or more agreements as
requested by Parent to be entered into by any of them prior to the Closing
with respect to any transaction to divest, hold separate or otherwise take
any action that would limit the Companys or its Subsidiaries freedom of
action, ownership or control with respect to, or their ability to retain or
hold, directly or indirectly, any of the businesses, assets, equity
interests, product lines, properties or services of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or any equity interest in any joint venture held by the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries (each, an " _Other Divestiture Action_ ");
_provided_ , _however_ , that (i) the consummation of the

 



63  transactions provided for in any such agreement for an Other Divestiture
Action (an " _Other Divestiture Agreement_ "), and any liability to be
incurred by the Company, will be conditioned (as either a condition precedent
or subsequent) upon the Closing or satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by
applicable Law) waiver of all of the conditions to Closing in a case where the
Closing will occur immediately following consummation of such Other
Divestiture Action (and where Parent has irrevocably committed to effect the
Closing immediately following consummation of such Other Divestiture Action)
and (ii) Parent will use (and will cause its Subsidiaries to use) its
reasonable best efforts to obtain all necessary Consents from third parties in
connection with any such Other Divestiture Action or Other Divestiture
Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Company, Parent or any
of their respective Subsidiaries will be obligated to amend or waive the
provisions of any Contract, or be obligated to pay any consent or similar fees
or payments, unless such action is conditioned upon the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. None of the actions taken or
proposed to be taken pursuant to this Section 6.03(e) will be deemed to result
in a breach of the representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement
or will be considered for purposes of determining whether a Company Material
Adverse Effect or a Parent Material Adverse Effect has occurred.

(f) If the actions taken by Parent and the Company pursuant to Section
6.03(d) and Section 6.03(e) do not result in the conditions set forth in
Section 7.01(c) and Section 7.01(d) being satisfied, then, during the term of
this Agreement, Parent and the Company will (i) initiate or participate in
any proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, in order to vigorously
oppose or defend against any action by any Governmental Entity to prevent or
enjoin the consummation of the Transactions and (ii) use their reasonable
best efforts to take such action as necessary to overturn any regulatory
action by any Governmental Entity to block consummation of the Transactions,
including by vigorously defending any Action brought by any Governmental
Entity in order to avoid the entry of, or to have vacated, overturned or
terminated, including by appeals if necessary, any Legal Restraint resulting
from any Action that would cause any condition set forth in Section 7.01(c) or
Section 7.01(d) not to be satisfied.

(g) In connection with and without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
each of Parent and the Company will:

(i) make or cause to be made as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any
event no later than ten Business Days following the date of this Agreement),
in consultation and cooperation with the other, BAT and, with respect to the
transactions contemplated by the Asset Purchase Agreement and the Transfer
Agreement, Lignum-2 and Imperial, all filings required under the HSR Act
relating to the Transactions;

(ii) use its reasonable best efforts to furnish to the other all assistance,
cooperation and information required for any such registration, declaration,
notice or filing and in order to achieve the effects set forth in Section
6.03;

 



64 (iii) give the other reasonable prior notice of any such
registration, declaration, submission, notice or filing and, to the extent
reasonably practicable, of any communication with any Governmental Entity
regarding the Transactions (including with respect to any of the actions
referred to in Section 6.03(d), Section 6.03(e) and in this Section 6.03(g)),
and permit the other to review and discuss in advance, and consider in good
faith the views of, and secure the participation of, the other in connection
with any such registration, declaration, submission, notice, filing or
communication;

(iv) promptly inform the other of (and supply to the other) any communication
received by such Party from, or given by such Party to, any Governmental
Entity;

(v) respond as promptly as reasonably practicable to any inquiries or
requests received from any Governmental Entity or any other authority
enforcing applicable antitrust, competition, trade regulation or similar Laws
(such Laws, "Antitrust Laws") for additional information or
documentary material in connection with antitrust, competition, trade
regulation or similar matters (including a "second request" under the HSR
Act), and not extend any waiting period under the HSR Act or enter into any
agreement with such Governmental Entities or other authorities not to
consummate any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except with
the prior written consent of the other Parties, which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed; and

 

(vi) unless prohibited by applicable Law or by the applicable Governmental
Entity, (A) not participate in or attend any meeting, or engage in any
substantive conversation with any Governmental Entity in respect of the Merger
(including with respect to any of the actions referred to in Section 6.03(d),
Section 6.03(e) and in this Section 6.03(g)) without the other, (B) give the
other reasonable prior notice of any such meeting or conversation, (C) in the
event one party is prohibited by applicable Law or by the applicable
Governmental Entity from participating in or attending any such meeting
or engaging in any such conversation, keep such party reasonably apprised
with respect thereto, (D) cooperate in the filing of any substantive
memoranda, white papers, filings, correspondence or other written
communications explaining or defending the Transaction Agreements and the
Transactions, articulating any regulatory or competitive argument, or
responding to requests or objections made by any Governmental Entity and (E)
furnish the other party with copies of all correspondence, filings and
communications (and memoranda setting forth the substance thereof) between it
and its Affiliates and their respective Representatives on the one hand, and
any Governmental Entity or members of any Governmental Entitys staff, on
the other hand, with respect to this Agreement and the Merger, subject to
redaction of competitively sensitive information, valuation material or
information subject to attorney client privilege.

 

(h) Notwithstanding anything else contained herein, the provisions of Section
6.03(d) will not require the Company, Parent or any of their respective

 



65  Subsidiaries to offer, take, commit to or accept any action, restrictions or
limitations of or on the Company, Parent or their respective Subsidiaries, or
to permit such actions, restrictions or limitations without the prior written
consent of the other Party, if such actions, restrictions or limitations,
individually or in the aggregate, would or would reasonably be expected to
result in a Substantial Detriment.

 



66 Section 6.04. _Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance_.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will, and
Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to, (i) indemnify, defend and
hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, all past and
present directors and officers of the Company and any Company Subsidiary and
all fiduciaries under any Company Benefit Plan (each, together with
such persons heirs, executors or administrators, a " _Company Indemnified
Party_ ") against any costs, expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees
and expenses and disbursements), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages
or liabilities to the extent related to any claim, action, suit, proceeding
or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
arising out of or pertaining to the fact that the Company Indemnified Party is
or was a director or officer of the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries or a fiduciary under any Company Benefit Plan or is or was
serving at the request of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries as a
director or officer of any other corporation, limited liability company,
partnership, joint venture, trust or other business or non-profit enterprise
(including any Company Benefit Plan) at or prior to the Effective Time whether
asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time (including with
respect to acts or omissions occurring in connection with the Transaction
Agreements and the consummation of the Transactions). Subject to applicable
Law, the Surviving Corporation will, and Parent will cause the Surviving
Corporation to, pay the fees and expenses of a Company Indemnified Party
(including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses and disbursements) in
advance of the final disposition of any action, suit, proceeding or
investigation that is the subject of the right to indemnification under this
Section 6.04(a); _provided_ , _however_ , that such Company Indemnified Party
undertakes to reimburse the Surviving Corporation for all amounts so advanced
if a court of competent jurisdiction determines by a final, nonappealable
order that such Company Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification.

(b) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries will, and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to, honor (i) all rights to indemnification, advancement of
expenses and exculpation (as applicable) of each Company Indemnified Party
and each past and present employee of the Company and any Company Subsidiary
as provided in their respective certificates of incorporation or bylaws (or
comparable organizational documents) as in effect on the date of
this Agreement and (ii) all rights to indemnification and advancement of
expenses of each Company Indemnified Party and each past and present employee
of the Company and any Company Subsidiary as provided in any Contract with the
Company or one of its Subsidiaries. A true and complete copy of each such
Contract has been provided by the Company to Parent prior to the date of this
Agreement.

 

(c) For a period of six years from the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation will maintain, and Parent will cause to be maintained, in effect
the coverage provided by the policies of directors and officers liability
insurance and fiduciary liability insurance in effect as of the date of this
Agreement by the Company and its Subsidiaries from a carrier with the same
or better credit ratings to the Companys existing directors and officers
insurance and fiduciary liability insurance policy carrier

 



67  and with terms, conditions, retentions and levels of coverage not less
favorable to the insured Persons than the directors and officers liability
insurance and fiduciary liability insurance coverage currently maintained by
the Company with respect to claims arising from facts, events, acts or
omissions that occurred on or before the Effective Time, except that in no
event will Parent be required to pay an annual premium for such insurance in
excess of 250% of the aggregate annual premium payable by the Company for such
insurance policy for the year ended December 31, 2013 (the " _Maximum Amount_
"); _provided_ , _however_ , that if such insurance can only be obtained at
an annual premium in excess of the Maximum Amount, Parent will obtain the
policy of directors and officers insurance with the greatest coverage
available for an annual premium equal to the Maximum Amount. In lieu of the
foregoing, the Company may in its discretion purchase, and Parent may in its
discretion purchase if the Company declines to do so, a "tail" directors and
officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance policy
covering the six-year period from and after the Effective Time from a carrier
with the same or better credit ratings to the Companys existing directors
and officers insurance and fiduciary liability insurance policy carrier and
with terms, conditions, retentions and levels of coverage not less favorable
to the insured Persons than the directors and officers liability insurance
and fiduciary liability insurance coverage currently maintained by the
Company with respect to claims arising from facts, events, acts or omissions
that occurred on or before the Effective Time, _provided_ that without
Parents consent, the cost of such "tail" policy will not exceed the Maximum
Amount.

(d) In the event that Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
Parent or the Surviving Corporation will cause proper provision to be made so
that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the
case may be, assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.04.

(e) The provisions of this Section 6.04 will (i) survive consummation of the
Merger, (ii) are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable
by, each indemnified or insured party (including the Company Indemnified
Parties), his or her heirs and his or her representatives and (iii) are in
addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification
or contribution that any such Person may have by Law, contract or otherwise.

Section 6.05. _Fees and Expenses_. Except as provided in Section 6.02(b),
Section 8.02(b), Section 8.02(c) and Section 8.02(e), all fees and expenses
incurred in connection with the Transaction Agreements and the Transactions
will be paid by the party incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not
such transactions are consummated; _provided_ , _however_ , that (a) Parent
and the Company will share equally the filing fees payable to the SEC with
respect to, and all fees and expenses, other than attorneys fees, incurred
in connection with the printing and mailing of, the Form S-4 and Joint Proxy
Statement and any amendments or supplements thereto and (b) Parent and the
Company will share equally the filing fee incurred in connection with the
filing required under the HSR Act relating to the Merger.

 



68 Section 6.06. _Transaction Litigation_. Subject to applicable Law, the Company
will give Parent the opportunity, at Parents cost and expense, to
participate in the defense or settlement of any Action against the Company or
its directors or officers by a holder of securities of the Company relating to
the Transactions, and no such settlement will be agreed to without the prior
written consent of Parent (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed). Subject to applicable Law, Parent will give the
Company the opportunity, at the Companys cost and expense, to participate in
the defense or settlement of any Action against Parent or its directors or
officers by a holder of securities of Parent relating to the Transactions. For
purposes of this Section 6.06, " _participate_ " means that the non-
litigating party will be kept apprised of proposed strategy and other
significant decisions with respect to the Action by the litigating party (to
the extent the attorney-client privilege between the litigating party and its
counsel is not undermined or otherwise affected), and the non-litigating party
may offer comments or suggestions with respect to the Action but not be
afforded any decision-making power or other authority over the Action, except
for the settlement consent, if any, set forth above.

Section 6.07. _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company, Parent and Merger Sub each will take all such steps as may be
required to cause (a) any dispositions of Company Common Stock (including
derivative securities with respect to Company Common Stock) resulting from
the Transactions by each individual who will be subject to the reporting
requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company
immediately prior to the Effective Time to be exempt under Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act and (b) any acquisitions of Parent Common
Stock (including derivative securities with respect to Parent Common Stock)
resulting from the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, by each individual who may become or is reasonably expected to
become subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange
Act with respect to Parent to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the
Exchange Act.

 

Section 6.08. _Public Announcements_. Except with respect to any Company
Adverse Recommendation Change or Parent Adverse Recommendation Change made in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement, Parent and the Company will use
reasonable best efforts to develop a joint communications plan and to consult
with each other before issuing, and give each other the opportunity to review
and comment upon, any press release or other public statements with respect to
the Transactions, and not to issue any such press release or make any such
public statement prior to such consultation, except as such party
may reasonably conclude may be required by applicable Law, court process or
by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities
exchange or national securities quotation system (in such event, with prompt
notice to the other Party). The Company and Parent agree that the initial
press release to be issued with respect to the Transactions will be in the
form heretofore agreed to by the parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing
sentences of this Section 6.08, Parent and the Company may make any oral or
written public

 



69  announcements, releases or statements without complying with the foregoing
requirements if the substance of such announcements, releases or statements,
was publicly disclosed and previously subject to the foregoing requirements.

Section 6.09. _Stock Exchange Listing_. Parent will use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in the Share
Issuance to be approved for listing on the NYSE, subject to official notice of
issuance, prior to the Closing Date.

 

Section 6.10. _Financing Activities_.

 

(a) Parent will use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to arrange and obtain the proceeds of the Financing on the terms and
conditions described in the Commitment Letters (including the exercise of so-
called "market flex" provisions in the related fee letters) as promptly as
practicable (taking into account the expected timing of the Closing),
including using reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in effect the
Commitment Letters, (ii) negotiate definitive financing agreements with
respect to the Financing on terms and conditions (including the exercise of
so-called "market flex" provisions in the related fee letters) that are not
materially less favorable to Parent than the terms and conditions (including
the exercise of so-called "market flex" provisions in the related fee
letters) contemplated by the Commitment Letters and enter into, on or prior to
the Closing Date, definitive financing agreements with respect to the
Financing, (iii) satisfy on a timely basis (or obtain the waiver of) (taking
into account the expected timing of the Closing) all conditions applicable to
Parent at or prior to the Closing that are within its control (excluding any
condition where the failure to be so satisfied is the result of the Companys
failure to furnish the information reasonably requested by Parent in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement), and otherwise comply with the
obligations applicable to Parent in the Commitment Letters and
such definitive agreements within its control, (iv) consummate the Financing
or any Replacement Financing at or prior to Closing, and (v) enforce its
rights under the Commitment Letters. In the event that all conditions to
funding the Financing set forth in the Commitment Letters have been satisfied
or, upon funding will be satisfied, Parent will use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the Financing Sources and the other Persons providing or
committing to provide the Financing to comply with their obligations under
the Commitment Letters and the definitive financing agreements entered into in
connection with the Financing and to fund on or before the Closing Date the
Financing required to consummate the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including taking enforcement action, including
seeking specific performance (including through litigation if appropriate), to
cause such Financing Sources and the other Persons providing or committing
to provide the Financing to fund such Financing). Parent will keep the
Company informed of the status of its efforts to arrange the Financing and to
satisfy the conditions thereof, including (A) promptly notifying the Company
of (1) any material breach or material default by any party to the Commitment
Letters or any definitive financing agreement entered into in connection with
the Financing, if such breach or default would reasonably be expected to
affect the timely availability of, or the amount of, the Financing and (2)
the receipt by

 



70  any of Parent or any of its Representatives of any written notice or other
written communication from any Financing Source or any other Person with
respect to any material dispute or disagreement between or among any parties
to any Commitment Letter or any definitive financing agreement entered into in
connection with the Financing, if such dispute or disagreement would
reasonably be expected to affect the timely availability of, or amount of,
the Financing and (B) upon the Companys reasonable request, advising and
updating the Company, in a reasonable level of detail, with respect to status.
Without the prior written consent of the Company, Parent will not agree,
permit or otherwise consent, to any amendment of, supplement, modification
to, or waiver under, the Commitment Letters or the definitive agreements
relating to the Financing if such amendment, supplement, modification or
waiver (x) would reduce the aggregate cash amount of proceeds of the
Financing (including by changing the amount of fees to be paid or original
issue discount of the Financing (except as set forth in any so-called "market
flex" provisions existing on the date of this Agreement in the related fee
letters)) (it being understood that any reduction in the Bridge Facility in an
amount corresponding to the proceeds from any Replacement Financing in
accordance with terms of the Commitment Letters as in effect on the date
hereof does not constitute a modification, amendment, supplement or waiver of
the Commitment Letters), (y) would impose new or additional conditions or
otherwise expand any of the conditions to the receipt of the Financing from
those set forth in the Commitment Letters on the date of this Agreement or
(z) would otherwise reasonably be expected to (1) prevent or materially delay
the Closing Date or (2) make the funding of the Financing or satisfaction of
the conditions to obtaining the Financing less likely to occur (collectively,
the " _Restricted Commitment Letter Changes_ "), other than a waiver of any
closing conditions by lender(s) or their agents; _provided_ , _however_ ,
Parent may amend the Commitment Letters to add lenders, lead arrangers,
bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities that have not executed the
Commitment Letters as of the date of this Agreement, if the addition of such
additional parties, individually or in the aggregate, would not constitute a
Restricted Commitment Letter Change. In addition, Parent will not permit or
consent to any waiver of any remedy under the Commitment Letters or to any
early termination of the Commitment Letters. For purposes of this Agreement,
references to the "Commitment Letters" will include such document as permitted
or required by this Section 6.10 to be amended, modified, supplemented or
waived, in each case from and after the date of such amendment, supplement,
modification or waiver.

(b) If, notwithstanding the use of reasonable best efforts by Parent to
satisfy its obligations under this Section 6.10, any of the Financing or the
Commitment Letters (or any definitive financing agreement relating thereto)
expire or are terminated or otherwise become unavailable prior to the Closing,
in whole or in part, for any reason, Parent will (i) promptly notify the
Company of such expiration, termination or unavailability and (ii) use its
reasonable best efforts promptly to arrange for alternative financing (which
will be in an amount sufficient to pay, when added to the other resources of
Parent and other financing arrangements, the Required Amount) from other
sources on terms and conditions (including under so-called "market flex"
provisions under the related fee letters) not materially less favorable,
taken as a whole, to Parent than the terms and conditions of the Financing
contained in the Commitment

 



71  Letters (including under so-called "market flex" provisions under the
related fee letters) to replace the Financing contemplated by such expired or
terminated or unavailable commitments or agreements (" _Alternative
Financing_ "). True, complete and correct copies of each commitment letter and
other agreement relating to the Alternative Financing (the " _Alternative
Commitment Letters_ ") will be promptly provided to the Company. If
applicable, references in this Agreement to "Financing" will include
"Alternative Financing," any reference to "Commitment Letters" will include
the "Alternative Commitment Letters" and any reference to definitive
financing agreements related to the Financing will include the definitive
financing agreements related to the Alternative Financing.

 

(c) Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that the obtaining of the
Financing is not a condition to the Closing. For the avoidance of doubt, if
the Financing has not been obtained, Parent will continue to be obligated,
subject to the fulfillment or waiver of the conditions set forth in ARTICLE
VII, to complete the Merger and consummate the other transactions contemplated
hereby. 

Section 6.11. _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) For a period of one year following the Closing Date, Parent will, or will
cause the Surviving Corporation to, provide to employees of the Company and
its subsidiaries as of the Closing who are Retained Lorillard Employees (as
defined in the Asset Purchase Agreement) (the " _Company Employees_ ") with
(i) base compensation, salary and wages that are no less favorable than those
provided to each Company Employee as of immediately prior to the Closing, (ii)
cash incentive and other bonus opportunities that are no less favorable than
those provided to each Company Employee as of immediately prior to
the Closing, (iii) employee benefit plans, programs and arrangements
(excluding change in control, transaction bonus and retention arrangements)
that are substantially similar in the aggregate to those provided to similarly
situated employees of Parent or the Parent Subsidiaries and (iv) severance
benefits and protections that are at the levels set forth on Section 6.11(a)
of the Company Disclosure Letter, _provided_ , _however_ , that with respect
to any Company Employee who is a Specified Employee (as defined in Section
6.11(e)), such Specified Employees severance benefits and protections will be
as set forth in such Specified Employees severance agreement entered into
with the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of this
paragraph will not apply to any employees of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary who are covered by Company CBAs.

 

(b) Parent will, or will cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries
to honor, in accordance with their terms, all Company Benefit Plans subject,
in the case of each Company Benefit Plan, to the right of Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary of either to amend or terminate any
Company Benefit Plan in accordance with its terms.

 

(c) For purposes of vesting, eligibility to participate and level of benefits
under the employee benefit plans, programs, policies and arrangements
providing benefits to any Company Employee on and after the Closing Date
(including the Parent

 



72  Benefit Plans) (the " _New Plans_ "), each Company Employee will be credited
with his or her years of service with the Company and its Subsidiaries and
their respective predecessors prior to the Closing, to the same extent credit
for such service was provided under the Company Benefit Plans (the " _Old
Plans_ ") as of immediately prior to the Closing, to the extent such service
credit would not result in the duplication of benefits under any New Plan.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (i) each Company Employee
who ceases to be eligible to participate in an Old Plan will immediately be
eligible to participate, without any waiting period, in any corresponding New
Plan to the extent such New Plan is comparable and intended to replace the
benefits under any such Old Plan, (ii) for purposes of any New Plan providing
benefits to any Company Employee, Parent will cause all pre-existing
condition limitations, exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such
New Plan to be waived for such Company Employee and such Company Employees
covered dependents, and (iii) to the extent Parent receives from the Company
sufficient information, Parent will cause any eligible expenses incurred by a
Company Employee during the calendar year in which the Closing Date occurs
under an Old Plan to be taken into account for purposes of satisfying such
years deductible, co-payment or co-insurance and maximum out-of-pocket
limitations under any relevant New Plans in which such Company Employee
becomes eligible to participate during the calendar year in which the Closing
Date occurs.

 

(d) Parent and the Company, as applicable, shall cause

 

(i) all fiscal year 2014 bonus amounts under annual bonus, sales and other
cash incentive plans of the Company and its Subsidiaries (the " _FY2014
Bonuses_ ") to be calculated and paid in the ordinary course of business to
the eligible Company Employees; _provided_ , _however_ , that (I) if the
Closing Date occurs following the end of fiscal year 2014 but prior to the
date the FY2014 Bonuses are paid in the ordinary course, such bonus amounts
shall be calculated based on actual results and performance achieved in
respect of fiscal year 2014, or (II) if the Closing Date occurs prior to the
end of fiscal year 2014, such bonus amounts shall be calculated based on
actual performance achieved during the period from the commencement of fiscal
year 2014 through the Closing Date measured against pro-rated performance
goals (which shall be obtained by multiplying the applicable performance
goals by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of full months that
have elapsed in fiscal year 2014 through the Closing Date and the denominator
of which is 12), and in the case of either (I) or (II), such bonus amounts
shall be paid as soon as practicable, but not later than the second regularly
scheduled payroll date occurring on or following the Closing Date, and

 

(ii) all fiscal year 2015 bonus amounts under annual bonus, sales and other
cash incentive plans of the Company and its Subsidiaries that are established
in accordance with Section 5.01(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter (the "
_FY2015 Bonuses_ ") to be calculated and paid in the ordinary course of
business to the eligible Company Employees;  _provided_ , _however_ , that
(I) if the Closing Date occurs following the end of fiscal year 2015 but prior
to the date the

 



73  FY2015 Bonuses are paid in the ordinary course, such bonus amounts shall be
calculated based on actual results and performance achieved in respect of
fiscal year 2015, or (II) if the Closing Date occurs following the
commencement of fiscal year 2015, such bonus amounts shall be calculated at
the target level of performance, with such result prorated to reflect the
number of days elapsed from the commencement of fiscal year 2015 through
the Closing Date and, in the case of either (I) or (II), such bonus amounts
shall be paid as soon as practicable, but no later than the second regularly
scheduled payroll date occurring on or following the Closing Date.

 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that any bonus amounts are
payable pursuant to the terms of this Section 6.11(d), Parent shall not be
required to pay any such bonus amounts in respect of such whole or partial
applicable periods for which payment was or will concurrently be received by a
Company Employee, including under any severance arrangement, if payment under
this Section 6.11(d) would result in duplication of benefits to such Company
Employee.

(e) Parent acknowledges and agrees (i) that a "Change in Control" or "Change
of Control" (or other similar phrase) within the meaning of any severance
agreement, plan or arrangement entered into, sponsored or maintained by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, will occur at or prior to the Closing
Date, as applicable, as a result of the Merger contemplated by this Agreement,
(ii) that each of the individuals listed on Section 6.11(e) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule (each, a "Specified Employee"), and, irrespective of
whether such individual is or becomes a Transferred Employee (as defined in
the Asset Purchase Agreement), shall be deemed to be terminated without
"Cause" (or other similar phrase) within the meaning of the
applicable severance agreement as of the Closing Date, unless (x) such
Specified Employee is identified as a Retained Lorillard Employee (as defined
in the Asset Purchase Agreement), and (y) Parent reasonably believes that the
terms and conditions of such Retained Lorillard Employees continued
employment immediately following the Closing would not constitute "Good
Reason" (or similar phrase) within the meaning of such Retained Lorillard
Employees severance agreement in effect as of the Closing Date (determined
for purposes of this Section 6.11(e)(ii) without regard to the amount of the
increase in any such Retained Lorillard Employees one-way commute in respect
of such continued employment, it being understood that neither this
parenthetical nor any other provision of this Agreement is intended to modify
the severance agreement of any such Retained Lorillard Employee), but subject
in any event to compliance with Section 409A of the Code, and (iii) that
Parent shall not waive, cancel, terminate or release any Specified Employee
from such Specified Employees non-competition, non-solicitation and other
restrictive covenant obligations under the applicable severance, employment
or other similar agreement without the prior written consent of such Specified
Employee.

(f) Any Company Employee (other than a Specified Employee) who is not a
Retained Lorillard Employee and who does not receive or does not accept an
offer of employment from Imperial in accordance with Section 1(a) of Exhibit D
of the Asset Purchase Agreement will be terminated by the Company as of the
Closing Date and will be entitled to severance benefits (if any) in accordance
with the terms of the applicable Company Benefit Plan or any New Plan or other
arrangement adopted by the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries that provides
for the same level of benefits.

 



74 (g) Without limiting the generality of Section 9.07, no provision of this
Section 6.11 will (i) create any right in any Company Employee to continued
employment by the Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Company or any of
their respective Subsidiaries or limit the ability of the Parent, the
Surviving Corporation, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries to
terminate the employment of any Company Employee, (ii) confer upon any Company
Employee any rights or remedies under or by reason of this Agreement, (iii)
except as expressly required by their terms, require Parent, the Surviving
Corporation, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries to continue
any Old Plans or New Plans, as applicable, or prevent the amendment,
modification or termination thereof on or after the Closing Date
in accordance with their terms, or (iv) be treated as a restatement,
amendment or waiver of or to any particular Old Plan or New Plan or other
employee benefit plan.

 

(h) From and after the date of this Agreement, the Company will notify Parent
promptly of any notice or other communication received by the Company or any
Company Subsidiary from the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (" _PBGC_ ")
regarding any defined benefit pension plan of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary. In the event of any such notice or communication, the Company
will consult with Parent with respect to any communications with the PBGC or
its Representatives and will not enter into any Contract with the PBGC without
Parents prior consent.

 

(i) The Company will fulfill its legal obligations, if any, with respect to
the labor unions representing Company employees or employees of any of the
Company Subsidiaries over the effects of the Transactions prior to the Closing
Date.

Section 6.12. _Board Representation_. At Closing, the Parent Board will
appoint the individual designated on Section 6.12 of the Company Disclosure
Letter to the Parent Board. If for any reason such individual is no longer a
member of the Company Board as of the Closing or is otherwise unable to serve
on the Parent Board, the Company will designate another individual serving on
the Company Board as of the Closing who is reasonably acceptable to the Parent
Board to be appointed to the Parent Board.

 

Section 6.13. _Imperial Termination Fee_. If the Asset Purchase Agreement is
terminated and Parent receives the Imperial Termination Fee (as defined in
the Asset Purchase Agreement) in connection with such termination, then in the
event this Agreement is terminated, Parent will promptly (and, in any event,
within two Business Days after the later of (a) receipt of the Imperial
Termination Fee and (b) the date this Agreement is terminated) pay to the
Company an amount equal to 40% of the amount of such Imperial Termination Fee.

 



75 Section 6.14. _Matters Relating to Asset Purchase Agreement and Transfer
Agreement_. 

(a) The Company hereby makes the representations and warranties set forth in
Article IV of the Asset Purchase Agreement to Parent in the same manner and
with the same qualifications as such representations and warranties are made
by Parent under the Asset Purchase Agreement (except that the "knowledge of
RAI" qualification as described in the Asset Purchase Agreement shall be
deemed to instead refer to the "Knowledge of the Company"), and at the
Closing, if capable of doing so, the Company will deliver to Parent a "bring-
down" certificate to such effect signed on behalf of the Company by
an executive officer of the Company.

(b) The Company covenants and agrees that unless the Asset Purchase Agreement
is terminated in accordance with its terms, the Company and its Subsidiaries
will use their reasonable best efforts (i) to perform all covenants and
agreements that Parent is required to use its reasonable best efforts to cause
to be performed by the Company or its Affiliates in the Asset Purchase
Agreement and (ii) comply with all the covenants and agreements applicable to
the Company set forth in the Transfer Agreement. The Company will use its
reasonable best efforts to enforce (including through litigation) Lignum-2s
obligations under the Transfer Agreement.

(c) Parent will use its reasonable best efforts to (i) comply with the
covenants and agreements applicable to Parent set forth in the Asset Purchase
Agreement applicable to it with respect to the RAI Assets and the PR Business
(each as defined in the Asset Purchase Agreement) and (ii) seek, at the
request of the Company, to obtain any consents from Lignum-2 under Section
6.01 of the Asset Purchase Agreement as the Company may reasonably request.
Parent will use its reasonable best efforts to enforce (including through
litigation) Lignum-2s and Imperials obligations under the Asset Purchase
Agreement.

(d) Parent hereby agrees that prior to the termination of this Agreement,
Parent will not without the Companys prior written consent (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned): (i) amend, modify
or waive, grant any consent or extension in respect of, or agree to
any change to, any term or condition of the Asset Purchase Agreement (" _APA
Changes_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent may effect an APA Change,
following consultation with the Company with respect to such proposed
APA Change, that does not expressly relate to the Company and could not
otherwise reasonably be expected to adversely affect the Company or prevent or
materially impede, interfere with, hinder or delay the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by the Asset Purchase Agreement; (ii) assign any of
its rights or obligations under the Asset Purchase Agreement (other than to
any of its Affiliates); or (iii) execute any right Parent may have to
terminate the Asset Purchase Agreement, other than pursuant to Sections
10.01(b), 10.01(e), 10.01(g), 10.01 (h) or 10.01(i) of the Asset Purchase
Agreement.

(e) The Company hereby agrees that prior to the termination of this
Agreement, the Company will not: (i) amend, modify or waive, grant any consent
or

 



76  extension in respect of, or agree to any change to, any term or condition of
the Transfer Agreement; (ii) assign any of its rights or obligations under the
Transfer Agreement; or (iii) execute any right it may have to terminate the
Transfer Agreement.

(f) Each of Parent, in respect of the Asset Purchase Agreement, and the
Company, in respect of the Transfer Agreement, shall deliver to the other any
notice received or delivered pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement and the
Transfer Agreement, as the case may be.

 

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, neither a
breach by a Party or inaccuracy of any of the representations and warranties
set forth in Section 6.14(a) nor a failure to comply with any of the covenants
and agreements set forth in this Section 6.14 will constitute a failure of any
of the conditions set forth in Section 7.02 or Section 7.03, as applicable,
to be satisfied.

limitation on Parent effectively controlling the business or operations of

part of such party to perform any covenant or obligation in this Agreement
required to be performed by such party at or prior to the Effective Time;
_provided_ , _further_ , that unless Parent and the Company mutually agree in
writing to the contrary prior to the initial End Date, the initial End Date
will be automatically, without further action by or consent of such parties,
extended by six months if, on the initial End Date, the only conditions

Conditions_ "); _provided_ , _further_ , that in the event all conditions
precedent to the Merger have been satisfied but the End Date, by its terms,
would occur before the ten Business Day period contemplated by Section 1.02,

Parent with the ten Business Day period contemplated thereby; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that references to "End Date" mean the End Date as it may be

failure of a condition set forth Section 7.03(a) or Section 7.03(b) to
be satisfied and (ii) is incapable of being cured by the End Date; _provided_
, _however_ , that the Company will not have the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.01(c) if the Company is then in material
breach of any of its covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement;

(d) by Parent, if the Company breaches or fails to perform any of
its covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement, or if any of the
representations or warranties of the Company contained herein fails to be true
and correct, which breach or failure (i) would give rise to the failure of a
condition set forth in Section 7.02(a) or Section 7.02(b) to be satisfied and
(ii) is incapable of being cured by the End Date; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that Parent will not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to

The party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to clause (b), (c),
(d), (e), (f) or (g) of this Section 8.01 will give written notice of such
termination to the other parties in accordance with Section 9.02, specifying
the provision of this Agreement pursuant to which such termination is
effected.

Section 8.02. _Effects of Termination_.

 

(a) In the event of termination of this Agreement by either Parent or the
Company as provided in Section 8.01, this Agreement will forthwith become
void and have no effect, without any liability or obligation on the part of
the Company, Parent or Merger Sub, other than the last sentence of Section
6.02(b), the last sentence of Section 6.02(d), Section 6.05, Section 6.13,
this Section 8.02 and ARTICLE IX, which provisions will survive such
termination, but no such termination will relieve any party from any liability
for fraud or intentional breach of any covenant or agreement set forth in this
Agreement. As used in this Agreement, an " _intentional breach_ " means a
breach that results from an action or inaction of a Party that such Party
knows will or would reasonably be expected to result in a breach of this
Agreement.

 

(b) The Company will pay to Parent the Company Termination Fee if:

 

(i) Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(e); _provided_
that if either the Company or Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to

has not occurred at least five Business Days prior to the End Date) or Section
8.01(b)(iv) at any time at which Parent would have been permitted to
terminate this agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(e), this Agreement will be
deemed terminated pursuant to Section 8.01(e) for purposes of this Section
8.02(b)(i);

 

(ii) the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(g); or

 

(iii) (A) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.01(b)(i) (solely
in the event that the Company Stockholders Meeting has not occurred at least
five Business Days prior to the End Date and other than in circumstances in
which Parent is required to pay the Parent Termination Fee pursuant to Section
8.02(c)), Section 8.01(b)(iv) or Section 8.01(d), (B) after the date of this
Agreement but prior to the date of the Company Stockholders Meeting (in the
case of Section 8.01(b)(iv)) or prior to the date this Agreement is terminated
(in the case of Section 8.01(b)(i)) or prior to the breach giving rise to
such right of

 



82  termination (in the case of Section 8.01(d)), a third party has made a
Company Takeover Proposal that has become known to the public and such Company
Takeover Proposal has not been withdrawn prior to the date of the Company
Stockholders Meeting (in the case of Section 8.01(b)(iv)) or prior to the date
this Agreement is terminated (in the case of Section 8.01(b)(i)) or prior to
the breach giving rise to such right of termination (in the case of Section
8.01(d)), and (C) within 12 months of such termination, the Company enters
into a definitive Contract to consummate any Company Takeover Proposal which
is subsequently consummated or any Company Takeover Proposal is
consummated. For the purposes of Section 8.02(b)(iii)(C) only, the term
"Company Takeover Proposal" has the meaning assigned to such term in Section
5.02(e) except that all references to "15%" therein will be deemed to be
references to "50%".

(c) Parent will pay to the Company the Parent Termination Fee if the Company
terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(f); _provided_ that if
either the Company or Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section
8.01(b)(i) (solely in the event that the Parent Shareholders Meeting has not
occurred at least five Business Days prior to the End Date) or Section
8.01(b)(iii) at any time at which the Company would have been permitted to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(f), this Agreement will be
deemed terminated pursuant to Section 8.01(f) for purposes of this
Section 8.02(c).

(d) Any Company Termination Fee or Parent Termination Fee due under Section
8.02(b) or Section 8.02(c) will be paid by wire transfer of same-day funds
(i) in the case of Section 8.02(b)(i) or Section 8.02(c), as promptly as
reasonably practicable following the date of termination of this Agreement
(and, in any event, within two Business Days thereof), (ii) in the case of
Section 8.02(b)(ii), on the Business Day on which this Agreement is terminated
and (iii) in the case of Section 8.02(b)(iii), on the date of consummation of
the Company Takeover Proposal.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if this
Agreement is terminated (i) by Parent or the Company pursuant to Section
8.01(b)(i) if, on the date this Agreement is terminated, the only conditions
to Closing set forth in ARTICLE VII that have not been satisfied (other than
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at or immediately prior to
the Closing) are one or more of the Regulatory Conditions or (ii) by Parent
or the Company pursuant to Section 8.01(b)(ii) if the Legal Restraint
underlying such termination relates to Antitrust Laws, then, in each such
case, Parent will promptly, but in no event later than two Business Days
after receipt of an invoice therefor from the Company, pay and reimburse the
Company all of the reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including all
reasonable fees and expenses of counsel, accountants, investment bankers,
economists, experts and consultants) incurred by the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries in connection with the Transaction Agreements up to a maximum
amount of $25,000,000 in cash (the " _Company Expense Cap_ ") by wire
transfer of same-day funds; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company Expense
Cap will be reduced on a dollar-for-dollar basis by any portion of the
Imperial Termination Fee actually received by the Company from
Parent pursuant to Section 6.13.

 



83 (f) Parent and the Company acknowledge and agree that the agreements contained
in Section 8.02(b), Section 8.02(c) and Section 8.02(e) are an integral part
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these
agreements, Parent and the Company would not have entered into this Agreement.
Accordingly, if either party fails promptly to pay the amount due pursuant to
Section 8.02(b), Section 8.02(c) or Section 8.02(e), as applicable, and, in
order to obtain such payment, the other party commences an Action that results
in a Judgment in its favor for such payment, the Company or Parent, as
applicable, will pay to the other party such payment and its reasonable costs
and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) in connection
with such Action, together with interest on the amount of such payment from
the date such payment was required to be made until the date of payment at the
prime rate of Citibank, N.A. in effect on the date such payment was required
to be made. In no event will the Company be obligated to pay the
Company Termination Fee on more than one occasion, and in no event will
Parent be obligated to pay the Parent Termination Fee on more than one
occasion, in each case pursuant to this Section 8.02.

 

(g) The Company, its Subsidiaries and the Representatives of the Company and
its Subsidiaries will not have any rights or claims against any Financing
Source (or any its Affiliates or former, current or future general or limited
partners, shareholders, managements, members, directors, officers, employees,
agents and representatives) in connection with the Merger or the
other Transactions, including the Financing, whether at law or equity, in
contract, in tort or otherwise. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section
8.02(g) cannot be amended in a manner adverse to any Financing Source without
the prior written consent of such Financing Source.

Section 8.03. _Amendment_. Prior to the Effective Time, this Agreement may be
amended by the parties at any time before or after receipt of the Company
Stockholder Approval or the Parent Shareholder Approval; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (a) after receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, there
will be made no amendment that by applicable Law requires further approval by
the stockholders of the Company without the further approval of such
stockholders and (b) after receipt of the Parent Shareholder Approval, there
will be made no amendment that by applicable Law requires further approval by
the shareholders of Parent without the further approval of such shareholders.
This Agreement may not be amended in any manner, whether by course of conduct
or otherwise, except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of
the parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section 8.03 cannot be
amended in a manner adverse to any Financing Source without the prior written
consent of such Financing Source.

 

Section 8.04. _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time,
the parties may, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, (a) extend the
time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other
parties, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties
contained in this Agreement or 

 



84  in any document delivered pursuant to this Agreement, (c) waive compliance
with any covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement or (d) waive the

by the stockholders of the Company without the further approval of such
stockholders and (ii) after receipt of the Parent Shareholder Approval, there
will be made no waiver that by applicable Law requires further approval by the
shareholders of Parent without the further approval of such shareholders. No
extension or waiver by Parent will require the approval of the shareholders of
Parent unless such approval is required by Law or by the other Transaction
Agreements and no extension or waiver by the Company will require the
approval of the stockholders of the Company unless such approval is required
by Law. Any agreement on the part of a Party to any such extension or waiver
will be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf
of such Party. The failure of any Party to assert any of its rights under
this Agreement or otherwise will not constitute a waiver of such rights.

an Article or a Section of this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The
table of contents, index of defined terms and headings contained in this
Agreement are for reference purposes only and will not affect in any way the
meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever the words "include",
"includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they will be deemed to
be followed by the words "without limitation." The words "hereof", "hereto",
"hereby", "herein" and "hereunder" and words of similar import when used in
this Agreement will refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any
particular provision of this Agreement. The term "or" is not exclusive. The
word "extent" in the phrase "to the extent" will mean the degree to which a
subject or other thing extends, and such phrase will not mean simply "if". The
definitions contained in this Agreement are applicable to the singular as well
as the plural forms of such terms. Any agreement, instrument or Law defined
or referred to herein means such agreement, instrument or Law as from time to
time amended, modified or supplemented, unless otherwise specifically
indicated. References to a Person are also to its permitted successors and
assigns. Unless otherwise specifically indicated, all references to

 



94  "dollars" and "$" will be deemed references to the lawful money of the

disfavoring any party by virtue of authorship of any of the provisions of
this Agreement.

Section 9.05. _Severability_. If any term or other provision of
this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any
applicable Law, or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this
Agreement will nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as either
the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is
not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party or such party
waives its rights under this Section 9.05 with respect thereto. Upon such
determination that any term or other provision (or part thereof) is so
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the Parties will negotiate in
good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the
parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the
transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent possible.

Section 9.06. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, all of which will be considered one and the same agreement, and
will become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each

receive the amounts set forth in Section 2.05 (a claim that may not be made
unless and until the Effective Time shall have occurred), is not intended to
confer upon any Person other than the parties any rights or remedies. The
Parties acknowledge and agree that, in addition to the Parties respective
rights under Section 9.10, nothing in this Agreement is intended to preclude
a Party that has sought and been unable to obtain the relief contemplated by
Section 9.10 from asserting that its measure of damages for fraud or
intentional breach of any covenant or agreement in this Agreement by
another Party includes the loss of economic benefits to the holders of such
Partys common stock, subject to the right of the other Parties to assert any
other reason why such measure of damages is

 



95  precluded, unavailable or inappropriate. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a)

conflicts of laws principles (whether of the State of Delaware or any other
jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the Laws of any jurisdiction
other than the State of Delaware; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) the Share
Issuance (to the extent required by the Laws of the State of North Carolina to
be governed thereby) and matters relating to the conduct of directors of
Parent, will be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws of the
State of North Carolina, without giving effect to any choice or conflicts of
laws principles (whether of the State of North Carolina or any other
jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the Laws of any jurisdiction
other than the State of North Carolina.

(b) Each of the Parties hereby (i) expressly and irrevocably submits to the
exclusive personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware (or, to the extent such court declines to accept jurisdiction over a
particular matter, any federal court within the State of Delaware, or, if such
federal court declines to accept jurisdiction, any state court within the
State of Delaware that has jurisdiction) in the event any dispute arises out
of the Transaction Agreements or the Transactions, (ii) agrees that it will
not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or
other request for leave from such court, (iii) agrees that it will not bring
any action relating to the Transaction Agreements or the Transactions in any
court other than such court, (iv) agrees that each of the other parties will
have the right to bring any Action for enforcement of a judgment entered by
such court and (v) expressly and irrevocably waives (and agrees not to plead
or claim) any objection to the laying of venue of any Action arising out of
the Transaction Agreements or the Transactions in such court or that any such
Action brought in such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Each
of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agrees that a final judgment in any
Action will be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit
on the judgment or in any other manner provided by applicable Law.

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Party agrees that it will not bring
or support any Action of any kind or description, whether in law or in equity,
against the Financing Sources in any way relating to this Agreement, including
any dispute arising out of or relating to the Financing, in any forum other
than the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York or, if
under applicable Law exclusive jurisdiction is vested in federal courts, the
United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (and
appellate courts thereof).

 



96 Section 9.09. _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations under this Agreement will be assigned, in whole or
in part, by operation of Law or otherwise by any of the parties without the
prior written consent of the other parties; _provided_ , that (A) Parent and
Merger Sub may assign their rights and obligations pursuant to this Agreement
to any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent after providing
written notice thereof to the Company at least one Business Day prior to such
assignment and (B) as of the Effective Time, Parent and Merger Sub may assign
their respective rights but not their respective obligations under this
Agreement to the Financing Sources solely for purposes of creating a security
herein in respect of the Financing;  _provided_ , that, in each case of
clauses (A) and (B) no such assignment will relieve Parent or Merger Sub of
any of its obligations hereunder. Any purported assignment without such
consent will be void. Subject to the preceding sentences, this Agreement will
be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties
and their respective successors and assigns.

 

Section 9.10. _Specific Performance_. The parties acknowledge and agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of
this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or
were otherwise breached, and that monetary damages, even if available, would
not be an adequate remedy therefor. It is accordingly agreed that the
parties will be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches
of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the performance of terms and
provisions of this Agreement, without proof of actual damages (and each party
hereby waives any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in
connection with such remedy), this being in addition to any other remedy to
which they are entitled at law or in equity. The Parties further agree not to
assert that a remedy of specific enforcement is unenforceable, invalid,
contrary to Law or inequitable for any reason, nor to assert that a remedy of
monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy for any such breach.

 

Section 9.11. _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST
EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY
IN RESPECT OF ANY ACTION ARISING OUT OF THE TRANSACTION AGREEMENTS, ANY OF THE
TRANSACTIONS OR ANY FINANCING (OR AGAINST ANY FINANCING SOURCE). EACH PARTY
(A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY
HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE
EVENT OF ANY ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER
AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO
ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVER AND
CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 9.11.

Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation

 

of []

 



      |  | 
---|---|--- 
    FIRST. |  | The name of the corporation is []. 
   | 
  SECOND. |  | The address of the corporations registered office in the
State of Delaware is 2711 Centerville Road, Suite 400, Wilmington, New Castle
County, Delaware 19808. The name of its registered agent at such address is
Corporation Service Company. 
   | 
  THIRD. |  | The purpose of the corporation is to engage in any lawful
act or activity for which corporations may be organized under the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. 
   | 
  FOURTH. |  | The total number of shares of stock which the corporation
shall have authority to issue is 1,000. All such shares are to be Common
Stock, par value of $.01 per share, and are to be of one class. 
   | 
  FIFTH. |  | Unless and except to the extent that the by-laws of the
corporation shall so require, the election of directors of the corporation
need not be by written ballot. 
   | 
  SIXTH. |  | In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers
conferred by the laws of the State of Delaware, the Board of Directors of the
corporation is expressly authorized to make, alter and repeal the by-laws of
the corporation. 
    | 
  SEVENTH. |  | A director of the corporation shall not be liable to the
corporation or any of its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of
fiduciary duty as a director, except to the extent such exemption from
liability or limitation thereof is not permitted under the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware as the same exists or may hereafter
be amended. If the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware is amended
hereafter to authorize the further elimination or limitation of the liability
of directors, then the liability of a director of the corporation shall be
eliminated or limited to the fullest extent authorized by the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, as so amended. Any
amendment, modification or repeal of this Article SEVENTH shall not adversely
affect any right or protection of a director of the corporation existing at
the time of such amendment, modification or repeal in respect of any act or
omission occurring prior to the time of such amendment, modification or
repeal. 
   | 
  EIGHTH. |  | The corporation shall indemnify its directors and
officers to the fullest extent authorized or permitted by law, as now or
hereafter in effect, and such right to indemnification shall continue as to a
person who has ceased to be a director or officer of the corporation ---|---|--- 
    |  | and shall inure to the benefit of his or her heirs, executors
and personal and legal representatives; provided, however, that, except for
proceedings to enforce rights to indemnification, the corporation shall not be
obligated to indemnify any director or officer (or his or her heirs,
executors or personal or legal representatives) in connection with a
proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person unless such proceeding
(or part thereof) was authorized or consented to by the Board of Directors of
the corporation. The right to indemnification conferred by this Article EIGHTH
shall include the right to be paid by the corporation the expenses incurred in
defending or otherwise participating in any proceeding in advance of its
final disposition upon receipt by the corporation of an undertaking by or on
behalf of the director or officer receiving advancement to repay the amount
advanced if it shall ultimately be determined that such person is not entitled
to be indemnified by the corporation under this Article EIGHTH. The
corporation may, to the extent authorized from time to time by the Board of
Directors of the corporation, provide rights to indemnification and to the
advancement of expenses to employees and agents of the corporation similar to
those conferred in this Article EIGHTH to directors and officers of the
corporation. The rights to indemnification and to the advance of expenses
conferred in this Article EIGHTH shall not be exclusive of any other right
which any person may have or hereafter acquire under this Certificate of
Incorporation, the by-laws of the corporation, any statute, agreement, vote of
stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise. Any repeal
or modification of this Article EIGHTH shall not adversely affect any rights
to indemnification and to the advancement of expenses of a director, officer,
employee or agent of the corporation existing at the time of such repeal or
modification with respect to any acts or omissions occurring prior to such
repeal or modification. 
   | 
  NINTH. |  | The corporation reserves the right at any time, and from
time to time, to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision contained in
this Certificate of Incorporation, and other provisions authorized by the laws
of the State of Delaware at the time in force may be added or inserted, in
the manner now or hereafter prescribed by law; and all rights, preferences and
privileges of any nature conferred upon stockholders, directors or any other
persons by and pursuant to this Certificate of Incorporation in its present
form or as hereafter amended are granted subject to the rights reserved in
this Article NINTH.
