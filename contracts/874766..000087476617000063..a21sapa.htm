to any Business Employee who is a "disqualified individual" (as such term is

(a) Section 5.16(a)(i) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule sets forth a list of
all separate accounts established by the Acquired Companies (collectively, the
"Separate Accounts") as of the date hereof including an indication of whether
each such Separate Account is (i) registered under the Investment Company Act
(and, if applicable, the Investment Company Act registration file number
applicable to such Separate Account) or (ii) associated with an Insurance
Contract that has been offered to a contractholder that is or is deemed to
constitute the assets of an "employee benefit plan" within the meaning of
Section 3(3) of ERISA or an "individual retirement annuity" within the meaning
of Section 4975 of the Code (collectively, "ERISA Separate Accounts"). No

disclosure on the schedule on each Business Day between the fifth (5th)
Business Day prior to the Closing Date and the Closing Date. To the Knowledge
of Seller, since January 1, 2014, neither HLIC nor ILA, to the extent either
would be regarded as a "disqualified person" or "party in interest" (as
defined in Section 4975 of the Code and Section 3(14) of ERISA, respectively)
has engaged in any violation of any fiduciary duty under ERISA or any
nonexempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of
the Code with respect to the ERISA Separate Accounts, in each case, that (A)

way from application of the definition of "fiduciary" under Department of
Labor Regulation Section 2510.3-21(c), as applicable beginning June 9, 2017.
No Acquired Company has any general account that is subject to Title I of
ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code by reason of the application of John Hancock
Mutual Life Ins. v. Harris Trust and Sav. Bank (92-1074), 510 U.S. 86 (1993)
after taking into account Department of Labor Regulation Section
2550.401c-1.To the Knowledge of Seller, neither HLIC nor ILA nor any of HLIC's
or ILA's Affiliates have provided investment advice that has formed or may
form a primary basis for any investment decision in respect of any Insurance
Contract held by any contractholder that is subject to Title I of ERISA or an
"individual retirement annuity," or exercised any management or discretionary
authority that would render it a fiduciary under Title I of ERISA or Section
4975 of the Code with respect to such Insurance Contracts. No payment received
by Seller or any of its Affiliates (including the Acquired Companies) in
respect of any Insurance Contract held by any contractholder that is subject
to Title I of ERISA or an "individual retirement annuity" that is from a third
party unaffiliated with Seller or Acquired Company (i.e., in respect of any
Registered Separate Account, including 12b-1 fees, revenue sharing,
commissions etc.) has resulted or would reasonably be expected to result in a
nonexempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of
the Code. With respect to any Insurance Contract held by contractholder that
is subject to Title I of ERISA or an "individual retirement annuity" that has
one or more separately managed accounts (whether or not a Separate Account),
such account is managed by a qualified professional asset manager (within the
meaning of Department of Labor Prohibited Transaction Class Exemption 84-14,
as amended) pursuant to an effective investment management agreement as to
which such manager has acknowledged (other than for separate accounts that are
registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 or provide for the
guarantee of principal and interest) fiduciary authority under ERISA, the
Code, or both, and to the Knowledge of Seller, no fiduciary breach or other
nonexempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975
has occurred with respect to any such Insurance Contract. From and including
June 9, 2017, none of Seller, any of the Acquired Companies nor any of their
Affiliates have provided any "investment advice" within the meaning of 29 CFR
2510.3(21)(a) pursuant to revised regulations published in the Federal
Register on April 8, 2016 (located at 82 FR 16902 et seq.) and applicable as
of June 9, 2017, with respect to any Insurance Contract held by any
contractholder that is subject to Title I of ERISA or an "individual
retirement annuity" or other account otherwise subject to the prohibited
transaction rules of Section 4975 of the Code.

(b) Each Separate Account is, and since January 1, 2014, has been (i) duly and

definition of an investment company in Section 3(c)(1), 3(c)(7) or 3(c)(11) of
the Investment Company Act and, except as is provided on Section 5.16(a)(i) of
the Seller Disclosure Schedule, is not subject to Title I of ERISA or Section
4975 of the Code. The registration of each Separate Account registered under
the Investment Company Act is in full force and effect. Since January 1, 2014,

(d) Except as set forth in Section 5.16(d) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule,
no examinations, investigations, inspections and formal or informal inquiries
of the Separate Accounts, including periodic regulatory examinations of the
Separate Accounts' affairs and condition, civil investigative demands and
market conduct examinations, by any Governmental Authority have been conducted
since January 1, 2014 through the date hereof.

(e) Except as set forth in Section 5.16(e) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule,
since January 1, 2014, no notice has been received from, and no investigation,
inquiry or review is pending or, to the Knowledge of Seller, threatened by,
any Governmental Authority which has jurisdiction over such Separate Accounts
with respect to any alleged material violation by any Insurance Company of any
applicable Law in connection with the Separate Accounts.

(f) (i) Each Separate Account currently is and has been since January 1, 2014
in compliance in all material respects with its investment objectives,
investment policies and restrictions (as they may be amended from time to
time) and other contract terms; (ii) the value of the net assets of each
Separate Account has been determined and is being determined using portfolio
valuation methods that comply in all material respects with the methods
described in its offering or plan documents and (iii) each Insurance Company
that has provided investment advisory services to any Separate Account has
done so in compliance in all material respects with such Separate Account's
investment objectives, investment policies and restrictions (as they may be
amended from time to time) and other contract terms.

adopted pursuant to Rule 38a-1 of the Investment Company Act that are
reasonably designed to prevent material violations of the United States
Federal Securities Laws, as such term is defined in Rule 38a-1(e)(1) under the
Investment Company Act. Since January 1, 2014, there have been no material
compliance matters that are materially adverse to any Registered Separate

of being remedied.

(h) Each Insurance Company has adopted written anti-money laundering programs
and written customer identification programs applicable to its Separate
Accounts that comply with applicable Law and since January 1, 2014 each
Insurance Company has complied with the terms of such programs in all material
respects.

correct list of all reinsurance agreements (other than any such reinsurance

whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at
law).

Section 6.02 No Conflict. Provided that all consents, approvals,
authorizations and other actions described in Section 6.03 have been obtained
or taken, except as otherwise provided in this Article VI and except as may

and will not require any Governmental Approval to be obtained or made by
Buyer, Buyer Parent, Buyer Parent GP, any other Buyer Party or any of their

expected to, individually or in the aggregate, have a Buyer Material Adverse
Effect.

in financial and business matters so as to be capable of evaluating the merits
and risks of its investment in the Shares, and Buyer is capable of bearing the
economic risks of such investment, including a complete loss of its investment

correct copies of executed equity commitment letters (each, a "Commitment
Letter"), dated as of the date hereof, among Buyer, Buyer Parent and each of
the Persons listed in Section 6.06(a)(i) of the Buyer Disclosure Schedule
(collectively, the "Investors"), pursuant to which, upon the terms and subject
to the conditions set forth therein, each Investor has committed, subject only
to the terms thereof, to invest in Buyer Parent, and to take all actions
within such Investor's power to cause Buyer Parent to invest in Buyer, in cash
the amounts set forth therein with respect to such Investor on or before the
date on which the Closing is required to occur pursuant to Section 3.01
(collectively, the "Commitments").

(b) The aggregate net proceeds from the Commitments, assuming they are funded
when required in accordance with Commitment Letters, as applicable, will be
sufficient to fund all of the amounts required to be provided by Buyer on the
Closing Date for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements, including the payment of the
Purchase Price (assuming the Pre-Closing Dividend Amount is equal to the
Minimum Pre-Closing Dividend Amount) and the payment of all costs and expenses
accrued by Buyer through the Closing Date in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements, including
all liabilities or obligations incurred under Section 8.17(e).

(c) Each of Buyer and Buyer Parent has the requisite power and authority to
execute, deliver and perform the Commitment Letters to which it is a party.
The execution and delivery by each of Buyer, Buyer Parent and each Investor of
the Commitment Letters to which it is a party, the consummation of the
Commitment and the issuance of the Rollover Equity, and the performance by
Buyer, Buyer Parent and each such Investor of its obligations under the
applicable Commitment Letters in accordance with the terms thereof has been
duly authorized by all requisite action on the part of Buyer, Buyer Parent
and, to the Knowledge of Buyer, each such Investor and the execution and
delivery of the Commitment Letters by Buyer, Buyer Parent and each such
Investor does not and will not (i) violate or conflict with the organizational
documents of Buyer, Buyer Parent or Buyer Parent GP or with any Law or other
Governmental Order applicable to Buyer, Buyer Parent, Buyer Parent GP or, to
the Knowledge of Buyer, any such Investor or by which any of the properties or
assets of Buyer, Buyer Parent or Buyer Parent GP or, to the Knowledge of
Buyer, any such Investor is bound or subject or (ii) result in any breach of,
or constitute a default (or event which, with the giving of notice or lapse of
time, or both, would become a default) under, or give to any Person any rights
of termination, acceleration, impairment, alteration or cancellation of, or
result in the creation of any Lien (other than Permitted Liens) on any of the
assets, rights or properties of Buyer, Buyer Parent, Buyer Parent GP or, to
the Knowledge of Buyer, any such Investor pursuant to any material note, bond,
mortgage, indenture or contract which Buyer, Buyer Parent, Buyer Parent GP or,
to the Knowledge of Buyer, any such Investor is a party or by which any of
such assets or properties is bound. As of the date hereof, the Commitment
Letters are in full force and effect and have not been withdrawn, terminated
or rescinded or otherwise amended, supplemented or modified (or contemplated
to be amended, supplemented or modified) in any respect. As of the date
hereof, the Commitment Letters are each a legal, valid and binding obligation
of Buyer, Buyer Parent and to the Knowledge of Buyer, each respective Investor
signatory thereto, enforceable against such parties in accordance with their
terms, subject to the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, reorganization,
insolvency, moratorium, rehabilitation, liquidation, fraudulent conveyance or
similar Laws relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally and subject,
as to enforceability, to the effect of general equitable principles
(regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in
equity or at law). There are no side letters or other contracts or
arrangements relating to the Commitments (other than agreements expressly
contemplated by the Commitments, none of which would adversely affect the
amount or availability of the financing or the conditions to funding). As of
the date hereof, no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of
time or both, would constitute a default or breach on the part of Buyer, Buyer
Parent or, to the Knowledge of Buyer, any Investor under any term, or a
failure of any condition, of the Commitment Letters or otherwise result in any
portion of the Commitment contemplated thereby being unavailable on the date
on which the Closing is required to occur pursuant to Section 3.01. As of the
date hereof, assuming the conditions set forth in Section 11.02 are satisfied
at or before Closing, each of Buyer, Buyer Parent and Buyer Parent GP has no
reason to believe that Buyer, Buyer Parent or any Investor would be unable to
satisfy on a timely basis any term or condition of the Commitment Letters
required to be satisfied by Buyer, Buyer Parent or any Investor. There are no
conditions precedent or other contingencies related to the funding of the full
amount of the Commitment other than as set forth in the Commitment Letters.

(d) Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Buyer has delivered to
Seller the Limited Guarantees. As of the date hereof, each of the Limited
Guarantees is a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Guarantor party
thereto, is in full force and effect, and is enforceable in accordance with
its terms against such Guarantor, subject to the effect of any applicable
bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, moratorium, rehabilitation,
liquidation, fraudulent conveyance or similar Laws relating to or affecting
creditors' rights generally and subject, as to enforceability, to the effect
of general equitable principles (regardless of whether such enforceability is
considered in a proceeding in equity or at law), and no event has occurred
which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a
default or breach under any term, or a failure of any condition, of such
Limited Guarantee or otherwise result in any portion of the Limited Guarantee
being unavailable. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein and
therein, the Limited Guarantees guarantee payment (up to the amount set forth
in each such Limited Guarantee) of (i) the Termination Fee and the Recovery
Costs and (ii) any amounts for which Buyer is required to indemnify or
reimburse Seller and its Affiliates upon or following termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 7.03(d), Section 7.14 or Section 8.17(e) (and
collectively the Limited Guarantees guarantee payment of the entirety of such
amounts referred to in clauses (i) and (ii)).

property is being made and no obligation is being incurred in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement with the intent to hinder,
delay or defraud either present or future creditors of Buyer, Buyer Parent,

Companies).

any applicable Law, Governmental Order or any fiduciary duty, it being
understood that Seller shall (x) cooperate with any requests for, and use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain, any waivers and (y) use its reasonable best
efforts to make other arrangements (including redacting information or

(and, in the case of such filings, applications and notifications, in no event
later than January 12, 2018) make all filings, applications, registrations and
notifications with each Governmental Authority, and use its reasonable best
efforts to promptly obtain all Governmental Approvals, in each case, that may
be or become necessary for their respective execution and delivery of, and the
performance of their respective obligations pursuant to, and the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by, the Transaction Agreements (including the
issuance and repayment of the Closing Date Surplus Note, if any, the
Extraordinary Dividend and the True-Up Dividend) and (ii) subject to Section
7.03(b), use reasonable best efforts to take such actions as may be required
or requested by any applicable Governmental Authorities or as may otherwise be
necessary in order to obtain such Governmental Approvals, including by (A)
seeking to prevent the initiation of, and defending any Action challenging
this Agreement or any other Transaction Agreement or the consummation of the

Governmental Authority any non-privileged information and documents requested
by such Governmental Authority or that are necessary, proper or advisable to
permit consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Transaction
Agreements, (C) avoiding the entry of, or causing to be lifted or rescinded,
any Governmental Order adversely affecting the ability of the parties to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other

Company or any of its Affiliates seeking damages or equitable relief as a
result of this Agreement or the announcement thereof. The parties shall
cooperate with the reasonable requests of each other in promptly seeking to
obtain all such authorizations, consents, orders and approvals. Neither Seller
nor Buyer shall take any action that they should be reasonably aware would
have the effect of delaying, impairing or impeding the receipt of any required
Governmental Approvals.

(b) Notwithstanding anything in Section 7.03(a) to the contrary, Buyer shall
not be obligated to take or refrain from taking or agree to it, its
Affiliates, or any of the Acquired Companies taking or refraining from taking,
any action, or to permit or suffer to exist any material restriction,
condition, limitation or requirement that, individually or together with all
other such actions, restrictions, conditions, limitations or requirements
imposed by Governmental Authorities in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or the other Transaction Agreements, would (i)
have a Company Material Adverse Effect (excluding clause (b) of the definition
thereof), (ii) involve any material deviation from the key terms of Buyer's
business plan set forth on Schedule 7.03(b)(ii), (iii) involve any keep-well
or capital or surplus maintenance arrangements or agreements, other than such
keep-well or capital or surplus maintenance agreements or arrangements that
Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries (including HLI) may be required to enter
into, without such agreement or arrangement providing for funding therefor to
be provided by, or recourse to, the direct or indirect shareholders of Buyer
or any of their respective general partners or managing members or (iv)
involve any Other Support Arrangement other than such Other Support
Arrangements in respect of which Seller elects Alternative 1 or Alternative 2
pursuant to Schedule 7.03(b)(iv) (any such action, restriction, condition,
limitation or requirement, a "Burdensome Condition"). In the event that any
action, restriction, condition, limitation or requirement is imposed by a
Governmental Authority that constitutes or would result in a Burdensome
Condition, prior to Buyer being entitled to invoke the actual or potential
existence of a Burdensome Condition, Seller and Buyer shall cooperate in good
faith to develop a reasonably designed process under which each of Seller and
Buyer shall promptly (A) provide information (subject to the other terms and
conditions of this Agreement relating to cooperation and sharing of
information) reasonably requested by the other to enable the requesting party
to analyze the causes and potential implications of such action, restriction,
condition, limitation or requirement and (B) meet in order to (x) exchange and
review their respective views as to such action, restriction, condition,
limitation or requirement, (y) discuss potential approaches that would avoid
such action, restriction, condition, limitation or requirement or mitigate its
impact, and (z) negotiate in good faith to attempt to agree to modify the
terms of this Agreement, on mutually acceptable terms and on an equitable
basis, in a way that would substantially eliminate any such action,
restriction, condition, limitation or requirement or sufficiently mitigate its
adverse impact so that it would no longer constitute a Burdensome Condition
hereunder; it being understood and agreed that if reasonable steps can be
identified to avoid such action, restriction, condition, limitation or
requirement or sufficiently mitigate the negative impact thereof, each party
shall take, and shall cause its Affiliates to take, as applicable, all such
reasonable steps.

(c) Seller and Buyer shall promptly notify one another of any communication it
or its Affiliates receives from any Governmental Authority relating to the
matters that are the subject of this Agreement and permit the other party to
review in advance any proposed communication by such party to any Governmental
Authority and shall provide each other with copies of all correspondence,
filings or communications between such party or any of its Representatives, on
the one hand, and any Governmental Authority or members of its staff, on the
other hand; provided, that no party shall be required to disclose to the other
any of its or its Affiliates' confidential competitive information or any
personally identifiable information of their respective officers, directors or
other applicable individuals. Except as otherwise required or requested by the
applicable Governmental Authority, neither Seller nor Buyer shall agree to
participate in any meeting with any Governmental Authority (other than a
telephone call initiated by such Governmental Authority and not scheduled in
advance) in respect of any such filings, investigation or other inquiry unless
it consults with the other party in advance and, to the extent permitted by
such Governmental Authority, gives the other party the opportunity to attend
and participate at such meeting. Subject to the Confidentiality Agreement and
Section 7.02, Seller and Buyer shall coordinate and cooperate fully with each
other in exchanging such information and providing such assistance as the
other party may reasonably request in connection with the foregoing; provided,
that neither party shall be required to disclose to the other any of its or
its Affiliates' confidential competitive information or any personally
identifiable information of their respective officers, directors or other
applicable individuals. Neither party shall be required to comply with any
provision of this Section 7.03(c) to the extent that such compliance would be
prohibited by applicable Law.

party shall cooperate with the other and use reasonable best efforts to make

Third-Party Consents (whether before or after Closing) and (B) obtaining the
consent of any counterparty to a Shared Contract to enter into a new contract
with Buyer or an Acquired Company pursuant to Section 7.05 (other than
licensing fees, fees for services provided pursuant to the contract or similar
payments) shall be borne fifty percent (50%) by Buyer and fifty percent (50%)
by Seller; provided, that none of the parties shall be required to compromise
any right, asset or benefit or incur any Liabilities (other than such costs
and expenses) or commence or participate in any Action in order to obtain any
Third-Party Consent.

(ii) To the extent that any Acquired Asset may not be transferred or assigned
to Buyer or an Acquired Company without a Third-Party Consent that has not
been obtained by the Closing, this Agreement shall not constitute an agreement
to transfer or assign the same if an attempted transfer or assignment would
constitute a breach or other contravention thereof or would be ineffective or
unlawful.

(iii) If, on the Closing Date, any Third-Party Consent required to effect the
transfer of any Acquired Asset to Buyer or an Acquired Company has not been
obtained, or if an attempted transfer or assignment of any Acquired Asset
would be ineffective or unlawful, then the parties shall cooperate to reach a
mutually agreeable arrangement under which (A) Buyer or an Acquired Company
would, in compliance with applicable Law, obtain the benefits, assume the
obligations, make all payments and otherwise bear the economic burdens
associated with such Acquired Asset in accordance with this Agreement,
including Seller or its Affiliates (other than the Acquired Companies)
subcontracting, sublicensing or subleasing to Buyer or an Acquired Company,
and (B) Seller or its Affiliates would enforce for the benefit (and at the
expense) of Buyer or the Acquired Companies any and all of their respective
rights against any non-affiliated third party associated with such Acquired
Asset, and pay, or cause its Affiliates to pay, to Buyer when received all
monies received by Seller or its Affiliates in connection with any such
Acquired Asset.

practicable, any such required Third-Party Consents that have not been
obtained as of the Closing Date; provided, that the out-of-pocket costs and
expenses associated with obtaining such Third-Party Consents shall be
allocated to Buyer and Seller in accordance with, and shall be subject to the
limitations set forth in, Section 7.03(d)(i); provided, further, that Seller
shall in no event be required to compromise any right, asset or benefit or
incur any Liabilities (other than such costs and expenses) or commence or
participate in any Action in order to obtain any such Third-Party Consent.

Section 7.04 Notification; Cooperation. From the date of this Agreement until
the Closing Date, Seller, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand, shall
promptly notify the other and keep it advised as to: (i) any pending or
threatened Action of which it has Knowledge that challenges or seeks to
restrain or enjoin the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated
hereby or by the Specified Third-Party Reinsurance Binder; (ii) any

ability of such party or its Affiliates or the Investors to effect the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, any other
Transaction Agreements or the Specified Third-Party Reinsurance Transaction

effect of satisfying any condition set forth in Article XI, nor shall any such
notification have any effect for the purposes of determining the rights of any
party to claim or obtain indemnification under this Agreement or otherwise
enforce its rights and remedies under this Agreement, and no failure to give
any such notice shall result in any party hereto having any additional rights
to indemnification under this Agreement (including pursuant to Section
13.01(a)(ii) or Section 13.02(a)(ii)) nor shall any such notice be deemed to
be a waiver of any failure to satisfy the conditions set forth in Article XI.

all Intercompany Agreements, after giving effect to Section 7.06, such that,
following the Closing, the Acquired Companies shall have no further Liability
under such Intercompany Agreements.

(b) Except for any services provided pursuant to the Transition Services
Agreement and any other applicable Transaction Agreements, as of and following
the Closing, Seller and its Affiliates shall have no further obligation to
provide any ancillary or corporate shared services to the Acquired Companies.

(c) With respect to each surviving Intercompany Agreement, Seller, on behalf
of itself and its Affiliates (other than the Acquired Companies), hereby
waives (i) any breach by, default under or non-compliance with any such
surviving Intercompany Agreement by any of the Acquired Companies to the
extent arising or occurring on or prior to the Closing Date, except in respect
of Liabilities specifically recorded in a general ledger account or in the
supporting workpapers or other detail to a balance sheet or statutory balance
sheet, in each case contained in the books and records, and (ii) any rights
that Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than the Acquired Companies) may
have to terminate, accelerate or cancel under such surviving Intercompany
Agreements relating to, arising out of or in connection with (A) any "change
of control," "change in control" or similar phrase or concept as defined in
such surviving Intercompany Agreement of any of the Acquired Companies
occurring on or prior to the Closing Date or (B) any action or omission by any
of the Acquired Companies occurring prior to the Closing.

(d) Seller shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, seek any damages
with respect to, or revoke, terminate or rescind any surviving Intercompany
Agreement or otherwise claim that any surviving Intercompany Agreement is not
in full force and effect or is invalid or unenforceable (in whole or in part),
in each case, as a result of any of the matters waived pursuant to Section
7.07(c).

Section 7.08 Existing Indemnification Rights. From and after the Closing, upon
the request of Buyer made on or before the sixth (6th) anniversary of the
Closing Date, Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, at Buyer's sole
cost and expense, reasonably cooperate with and assist Buyer and the Acquired
Companies in submitting claims for and pursuing and recovering any applicable
indemnification or reimbursement to which any of the Acquired Companies may be
entitled from any third party that is not an Affiliate of Seller under any
contract to which Seller or any of its respective Affiliates (other than the
Acquired Companies) may be a party. Without the prior written consent of
Buyer, Seller shall not waive or release any such claim or right that any of
the Acquired Companies may have under any such contract.

Section 7.09 Supplements to Seller Disclosure Schedule. From time to time
prior to the Closing, but in no event less than five (5) Business Days prior
to Closing, Seller shall be permitted to supplement the sections of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule that correspond to the representations and warranties set
forth in Article IV and Article V, other than Section 5.02(a), Section
5.02(e), Section 5.04 and Section 5.22 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule,
solely to reflect any event, change or circumstance first arising after the
date hereof that does not arise from any breach of any covenant herein, and
each such supplement shall be deemed to be incorporated into the Seller
Disclosure Schedule for purposes of determining whether the applicable
representation or warranty is true and correct as of the Closing Date. For the
avoidance of doubt, Seller becoming aware after the date hereof of an event,
change or circumstance that arose before the date hereof and the existence of
which would result in a breach of, or inaccuracy in, a representation or
warranty set forth in Article IV or Article V as of the date of this
Agreement, shall not constitute an event, change or circumstance first arising
as of the date hereof. Subject to Section 7.02(c) and upon delivery of any
such supplement, Seller shall provide to Buyer such additional information
available to Seller that is reasonably necessary for Buyer to evaluate any
event, change or circumstance reflected in such supplement. If any event,
change or circumstance reflected in such supplement, absent the delivery by
Seller of such supplement, would, individually or in the aggregate with any
event, change or circumstance reflected in any other supplement delivered by
Seller pursuant to this Section 7.09, result in, if occurring or continuing as
of the Closing Date, the failure of a condition set forth in Section 11.02(a)
to be satisfied, then Buyer shall have the right to terminate this Agreement
upon written notice to Seller delivered no later than ten (10) Business Days
following the delivery by Seller of such supplement. An event, change or
circumstance reflected in a supplement delivered to Buyer in accordance with
this Section 7.09 shall not subsequently form the basis for a claim by Buyer
for indemnification under Section 13.02(a)(i) only if such event, change or
circumstance permits Buyer to terminate this Agreement under this Section 7.09
and Buyer does not elect to exercise such termination right.

Section 7.10 Release.

(a) Effective as of the Closing, Seller, for itself and on behalf of its
Affiliates (other than the Acquired Companies) and each of its and their
successors and assigns (each, a "Seller Releasor"), hereby irrevocably,

relinquishes all claims, demands, Liabilities, defenses, affirmative defenses,
setoffs, counterclaims, actions and causes of action of whatever kind or

GA-6226 or, if applicable, Group Annuity Contracts GA-1010 and GA-6603. Seller
shall, and shall cause each Seller Releasor to, refrain from, directly or
indirectly, asserting any claim or demand or commencing, instituting or
maintaining, or causing to be commenced, any legal or arbitral proceeding of
any kind against any Acquired Company Releasee based upon any matter released
pursuant to this Section 7.10(a). The execution and delivery of this Agreement

Releasor or Acquired Company Releasee of the existence of any such claims or
of Liability for any matter or precedent upon which any Liability may be
asserted.

(b) Effective as of the Closing, Seller, for itself and on behalf of its

Liabilities, defenses, affirmative defenses, setoffs, counterclaims, actions
and causes of action of whatever kind or nature, whether known or unknown,
which any Buyer Releasor has, may have or might have or may assert now or in
the future, against any of Seller, its Affiliates (other than the Acquired
Companies) and any of their respective successors and assigns (in each case in
their capacity as such) (each, a "Seller Releasee"), arising out of, based
upon or resulting from any contract, transaction, event, circumstance, action,
failure to act or occurrence of any sort or type, whether known or unknown,
and which occurred, existed, was taken, permitted or begun prior to the
Closing; provided, that with respect to the Buyer Releasors that are not an
Acquired Company or any of its successors or assigns, nothing contained in
this Section 7.10(c) shall release, discharge, limit, restrict, waive,
relinquish or otherwise affect the rights or obligations of any Buyer Releasor
(other than the Acquired Companies) to the extent such rights or obligations
do not arise out of or relate to any claims, demands, Liabilities, defenses,
affirmative defenses, setoffs, counterclaims, actions or causes of action any
Acquired Company may have had against the Seller Releasee prior to the
Closing; provided, further, that nothing contained in this Section 7.10(c)
shall release, discharge, limit, restrict, waive, relinquish or otherwise
affect the rights or obligations of any party to the extent arising under or
recoverable pursuant to any Intercompany Agreement that survives the Closing
pursuant to Section 7.07 or any of the Transaction Agreements. Buyer shall,
and shall cause each Buyer Releasor to, refrain from, directly or indirectly,
asserting any claim or demand or commencing, instituting or maintaining, or
causing to be commenced, any legal or arbitral proceeding of any kind against
any Seller Releasee based upon any matter released pursuant to this Section
7.10(c). The execution of this Agreement shall not constitute an
acknowledgment of, or an admission by, any Acquired Company Releasor or Seller
Releasee of the existence of any such claims or of Liability for any matter or
precedent upon which any Liability may be asserted.

Section 7.11 Bank Accounts. To the extent any individual other than a
Transferred Employee at the Closing has authority to draw on or has access to

maintained by the Acquired Companies, Seller and its Affiliates shall remove,
effective as of the Closing, such individual's authority unless otherwise
directed in writing by Buyer.

to any legal or regulatory restrictions or prohibitions), Seller shall take or
cause to be taken on or prior to the Closing Date (with effect prior to the

Acquired Companies) to or for the Acquired Companies or the Business as of the
date hereof and (b) in connection therewith, work together in good faith to

separation of the Business, including Information Technology systems,
following the Closing from that of the other businesses of Seller and its
Affiliates (other than the Acquired Companies) and (b) the integration and
migration of the Business, including Information Technology systems, following
the Closing into the business and operations of Buyer (including the Acquired
Companies). Buyer shall bear its own and the Acquired Companies' costs and
expenses incurred in connection with the migration, integration and separation
contemplated by this Section 7.14. Seller shall not, and shall cause the
Acquired Companies not to, incur any out-of-pocket costs and expenses in

cause its Affiliates to, promptly reimburse (i) the Acquired Companies for all
out-of-pocket costs and expenses pre-approved by Buyer and incurred by the
Acquired Companies in connection with the migration, integration and
separation contemplated by this Section 7.14 if Seller terminates this
Agreement pursuant to Section 12.01(e) or Section 12.01(g) and (ii) Seller and
its Affiliates (other than the Acquired Companies) for all out-of-pocket costs
and expenses pre-approved by Buyer and incurred by Seller or its Affiliates

cause its Affiliates to, promptly reimburse Buyer for all out-of-pocket costs
and expenses incurred by Buyer or its Affiliates in connection with the
migration, integration and separation contemplated by this Section 7.14 if
Buyer terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 12.01(d) resulting from
Seller's breach of any of its covenants, representations or warranties
hereunder. If this Agreement is terminated other than as contemplated in the
preceding two (2) sentences, then Seller and its Affiliates (including the

other hand, shall each be responsible for fifty percent (50%) of the aggregate
amount of out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by Buyer, Seller and their
respective Affiliates in connection with the migration, integration and
separation contemplated by this Section 7.14, and, in furtherance of the
foregoing, Buyer and Seller shall cooperate in good faith to determine the
aggregate amount of such out-of-pocket costs and expenses and Buyer or Seller,
as applicable, shall make a payment to the other party as soon as reasonably
practicable following such termination in an amount such that each of Buyer
and Seller bears fifty percent (50%) of such out-of-pocket costs and expenses.

Section 7.15 Assigned Lease. Seller shall use reasonable best efforts to
deliver to Buyer (a) on or prior to the Closing Date a current "statement
relative to the status" from the Assigned Lease Landlord as required to be

Specified Third-Party Reinsurance Binder without the consent of Seller (in the
case of a waiver by Buyer or a waiver by HLIC or ILA after the Closing) or
Buyer (in the case of a waiver by HLIC or ILA prior to the Closing). Buyer

reason other than a material breach by the Reinsurer of Section 2 thereof

withheld, conditioned or delayed). If Buyer intends to terminate the Specified
Third-Party Reinsurance Binder due to a material breach by the Reinsurer of
Section 2 thereof, Buyer shall provide Seller with written notice of such
intention and shall not terminate the Specified Third-Party Reinsurance Binder

ILA not to, take any action that would cause any of the conditions to the
Specified Third-Party Reinsurer's obligations to execute and deliver the
Specified Third-Party Reinsurance Transaction Documents to not be satisfied or
give the Specified Third-Party Reinsurer any right to terminate the Specified
Third-Party Reinsurance Binder or otherwise fail to comply with its

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

Section 8.01 Access to Information. After the Closing, Buyer shall, and shall
cause its Affiliates (including the Acquired Companies) to, preserve, in
accordance with and until such date as may be required by, Buyer's, or its
applicable Affiliates' standard document retention policies (but for not less
than six (6) years from the Closing Date or such later date as may be required
by applicable Law), all pre-Closing Date books and records of the Acquired
Companies other than, with respect to HLI, books (or portions thereof),
records (or portions thereof), personnel, officers and other facilities and
properties to the extent relating to Unrelated HLI Assets or Unrelated HLI
Liabilities and the Business possessed or controlled by such Person. During
such period, upon any reasonable request from Seller or its Representatives,
Buyer or any of its Affiliates holding such books and records shall (a)
provide to Seller or its authorized Representatives reasonable access to such
books and records during normal business hours; provided, that such access
shall not unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the business of Buyer or
its Affiliates holding such books and records and (b) permit Seller to make
copies of such books and records, in each case, at no cost to Seller or its
Representatives (other than for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses). Nothing
herein shall require Buyer or its Affiliates to disclose any information to
Seller if such disclosure would jeopardize any attorney-client privilege, the
work product immunity or any other legal privilege or similar doctrine or
contravene any applicable Law, Governmental Order or any fiduciary duty (it
being understood that Buyer and its Affiliates shall (i) cooperate with any
requests for, and use their reasonable best efforts to obtain, any waivers,
and (ii) use their reasonable best efforts to make other arrangements
(including redacting information or entering into joint defense agreements),
in each case, that would enable otherwise required disclosure to Seller or its
Representatives to occur without so jeopardizing privilege or contravening
such applicable Law, Governmental Order or fiduciary duty or agreement) or
(except as provided in Section 10.04) require Buyer or its Affiliates to
disclose its Tax records (except for Tax records of, or with respect to, the
Acquired Companies) or any personnel or related records. Such books and
records may be requested under this Section 8.01 for any reasonable business
purpose, including to the extent reasonably required in connection with
accounting, litigation, financial reporting, federal securities disclosure,
compliance with contractual obligations of Seller or its Affiliates or other
similar purpose. Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon the expiration of such
retention period, any and all such books and records may be destroyed by Buyer
if Buyer sends to Seller written notice of its intent to destroy such books
and records, specifying in reasonable detail the contents of the books and
records to be destroyed; such books and records may then be destroyed after
the sixtieth (60th) day following such notice unless Seller notifies Buyer
that Seller desires to obtain possession of such books and records, in which
event Buyer shall transfer the books and records to Seller and Seller shall
pay all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of Buyer in connection therewith.

Section 8.02 Books and Records.

(a) At the Closing, (i) all books and records of the Acquired Companies and
the Business located on the Business Premises shall be transferred to Buyer by

relating to the legal existence, ownership and corporate governance of the
Acquired Companies, the HLI Notes or the Business and all Permits of the
Acquired Subsidiaries, in each case, that are not located on the Business
Premises or otherwise possessed or controlled by the Acquired Companies. Prior
to the Closing, Seller and Buyer shall cooperate in good faith to develop and
implement a plan that will result in the delivery or transfer of all other
books and records of the Acquired Companies, the HLI Notes and the Business to
Buyer or the Acquired Companies at, or as soon as reasonably practicable
following, the Closing. Subject to Section 8.03(b), except as otherwise
required by applicable Law, Seller and its Affiliates shall have the right to
retain copies of all books and records of the Acquired Companies and their
business relating to periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date.

(b) After the Closing, Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to,
preserve, in accordance with Seller's, or its applicable Affiliates', standard
document retention policies and until such date as such books and records are
transferred to Buyer or the Acquired Companies, all pre-Closing Date books and
records of the Acquired Companies and the Business that have not been
transferred to Buyer. During such period, upon any request from Buyer or its
Representatives, Seller or any of its Affiliates holding such records shall
(i) provide to Buyer or its Representatives reasonable access to such records
during normal business hours; provided, that such access shall not
unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the business of Seller or its
Affiliates holding such records and (ii) permit Buyer to make copies of such
records, in each case, at no cost to Buyer or its Representatives (other than
for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses). Nothing herein shall require Seller or
its Affiliates to disclose any information to Buyer if such disclosure would
jeopardize any attorney-client privilege, the work product immunity or any
other legal privilege or similar doctrine or contravene any applicable Law,
Governmental Order or any fiduciary duty (it being understood that Seller and
its Affiliates shall (A) cooperate with any requests for, and use their
reasonable best efforts to obtain, any waivers, and (B) use their reasonable
best efforts to make other arrangements (including redacting information or
entering into joint defense agreements), in each case, that would enable
otherwise required disclosure to Buyer or its Representatives to occur without
so jeopardizing privilege or contravening such applicable Law, Governmental
Order or fiduciary duty or agreement) or (except as provided in Section 10.04)
require Seller or its Affiliates to disclose its Tax records (except for Tax
records of, or with respect to, the Acquired Companies) or any personnel,
medical or related records.

Section 8.03 Confidentiality.

(a) The terms of the confidentiality agreement, dated June 17, 2016 (the
"Confidentiality Agreement"), between HFSG and Atlas Merchant Capital LLC are
incorporated into this Agreement by reference and shall continue in full force
and effect until the Closing, at which time the confidentiality obligations
under the Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate; provided, that remedies
with respect to breaches of such Confidentiality Agreement that occurred prior
to the Closing shall survive the Closing. If for any reason the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement are not consummated, the Confidentiality
Agreement shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with its
terms.

(b) From and after the Closing, Seller and its Affiliates shall, and shall
cause their respective Representatives to, maintain in confidence any written,
oral or other information relating to the Acquired Companies obtained prior to
the Closing Date or obtained from Buyer or its Affiliates pursuant to Section
8.01.

(c) From and after the Closing, Buyer and its Affiliates (including the
Acquired Companies) shall, and shall cause their respective Representatives
to, maintain in confidence any written, oral or other information relating to
or obtained from Seller or its Affiliates prior to the Closing Date, other
than information to the extent relating to the Acquired Companies.

(d) The requirements of Section 8.03(b) and Section 8.03(c) shall not apply to
the extent that (i) any such information is or becomes generally available to
the public other than (A) in the case of Buyer, as a result of disclosure by
Seller, its Affiliates or any of its Representatives and (B) in the case of
Seller, as a result of disclosure by Buyer, the Acquired Companies (after the
Closing Date) or any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives, (ii)
any such information is required or requested by applicable Law, Governmental
Order or a Governmental Authority to be disclosed after prior notice has been
given to the other party (to the extent such prior notice is permitted to be
given under applicable Law); provided, that the disclosing party, to the
extent reasonably requested by the other party, shall cooperate with such
other party in seeking an appropriate order or other remedy protecting such
information from disclosure, (iii) any such information is reasonably
necessary to be disclosed in connection with any Action or (iv) any such
information was or becomes available to such party on a non-confidential basis
and from a source (other than a party to this Agreement or any Affiliate or
Representative of such party) that is not bound by a confidentiality agreement
with respect to such information. Each of the parties hereto shall instruct
its Affiliates and Representatives having access to such information of such
confidentiality obligations.

Section 8.04 Insurance.

(a) Except as, and solely to the extent, expressly provided in Section
8.04(b), effective at the time of the Closing, the Acquired Companies shall
cease to be insured by any insurance policies of Seller and its Affiliates
(other than the Acquired Companies).

(b) With respect to events or circumstances relating to the Acquired Companies
that occurred or existed prior to the Closing Date that are covered by
occurrence-based third-party liability insurance policies and any workers'
compensation insurance policies that apply to current or past locations at
which the businesses of the Acquired Companies operated, the Acquired
Companies may make claims under such policies and programs through the
Corporate Risk Management Department of Seller (to the attention of Vice
President or Assistant Vice President, Corporate Risk Management, The Hartford
Financial Services Group, Inc., Tower 12, One Hartford Plaza, 06155) and its
Affiliates; provided, that by making any such claims, Buyer agrees to, or
cause its Affiliates to, reimburse Seller for any costs incurred by Seller or
its Affiliates as a direct result of such claims, including any retroactive or
prospective premium adjustments resulting from such claims and payments within
any self-insured retention or deductible or similar self-insured provision
(including a matching deductible program); provided, further, that the
Acquired Companies shall not be permitted to make any such claims if, and to
the extent that, such claims are covered by insurance policies sponsored by
Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Acquired
Companies). As of the second (2nd) anniversary of the Closing Date, the
Acquired Companies shall no longer have access to such occurrence-based third-
party liability insurance policies of Seller and its Affiliates and Buyer
shall assume full responsibility for, and release Seller and its Affiliates
from, all liability for claims, known or unknown, resulting from such
occurrences prior to the Closing Date. Any claim recovery proceeds received by
Seller or any of its Affiliates from its insurers after the Closing for third-
party claims under occurrence-based third-party liability insurance policies
or workers' compensation insurance policies with respect to Losses occurring
prior to the Effective Time in respect of the Acquired Companies shall be for
the benefit of Buyer unless such proceeds relate to claims that have been made
prior to the Accounts Date or any business interruption occurring prior to the
Accounts Date.

Section 8.05 Trade Names and Trademarks.

contemplated in the Transaction Agreements, Buyer is not purchasing, acquiring
or otherwise obtaining any right, title or interest in or to any Intellectual
Property owned by Seller or its Affiliates (other than the Acquired
Companies), including the name "Hartford," or any Trademark or Internet domain
name related thereto or employing the words "Hartford," or any variation of
the foregoing or any confusingly similar Trademark or Internet domain name,
(including in any and all goodwill, registrations and applications relating
thereto) (collectively, the "Seller Names and Marks"), and, except as
otherwise expressly provided in any Transaction Agreement, neither Buyer nor
any of its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Acquired Companies)
shall have any rights in the Seller Names and Marks and neither Buyer nor any
of its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Acquired Companies) shall
contest the ownership or validity of any rights of Seller or any of its
Affiliates in or to the Seller Names and Marks. Buyer hereby consents to
Seller causing the Acquired Companies to transfer all rights, title and
interests in and to the Seller Names and Marks to Seller or any of its
Affiliates prior to the Closing, and such transfer(s) shall not constitute a
breach of any term or condition of this Agreement.

(b) Except as otherwise provided in any Transaction Agreement, or in
connection with historical, tax, employment or similar references to the
Business, or for purposes of prospectus and similar disclosures as are
necessary and appropriate to describe the historical relationship of the
Acquired Companies and Seller and its Affiliates or as otherwise required by
Law, following the Closing Date, Buyer and its Affiliates (including the
Acquired Companies) shall cease and discontinue all uses of the Seller Names
and Marks, either alone or in combination with other words and all Trademarks
or Internet domain names similar to any of the foregoing or embodying any of
the foregoing alone or in combination with other words. The rights of the
Acquired Companies to the Seller Names and Marks pursuant to the terms of any
existing trademark agreements shall terminate on the Closing Date.

(c) In accordance with the terms of the Transaction Agreements and on the
date(s) specified therein, Buyer and its Affiliates (including the Acquired
Companies) shall re-label, destroy, delete or exhaust all materials bearing
the Seller Names and Marks, including signage, advertising, promotional
materials, Software, packaging, inventory, electronic materials, collateral
goods, stationery, business cards, websites and other materials (except to the
extent any such materials must be retained to comply with applicable Laws or
document retention notices issued by any Governmental Authority), and make all
filings with any office, agency or body to effect the elimination of any use
of the Seller Names and Marks from the businesses of the Acquired Companies,
to the extent required to bring Buyer and its Affiliates into compliance with
this Section 8.05. Thereafter, Buyer shall send a written statement to Seller
verifying that it has re-labeled, destroyed, deleted or exhausted all
materials bearing the Seller Names and Marks and shall send Seller
representative samples of how Buyer is then using advertising and promotional
materials that do not include Seller Names and Marks to the extent required by
the foregoing sentence. Use of the Seller Names and Marks during any period(s)
authorized by the Transaction Agreements shall (i) be only with respect to
goods and services of a level of quality equal to or greater than the quality
of goods and services with respect to which Seller and its Affiliates used the
Seller Names and Marks prior to Closing and (ii) comply with all graphic and
other standards for use of the Seller Names and Marks in effect on the Closing
Date or as the same may be amended by Seller following the Closing Date. Buyer
shall take all necessary action to ensure that other users of the Seller Names
and Marks, whose rights terminate upon the Closing pursuant to this Section
8.05, shall cease use of the Seller Names and Marks, except as expressly
authorized thereafter by Seller. After the Closing Date, Buyer and its
Affiliates (including the Acquired Companies) shall not expressly, or by
implication, do business as or represent themselves as Seller or an Affiliate
of Seller.

(d) In the event Buyer or any Affiliate of Buyer (including any Acquired
Company after the Closing) violates any of its obligations under this Section
8.05, Seller and its Affiliates may proceed against Buyer or its Affiliates at
law or in equity for such damages or other relief as a court may deem
appropriate. A violation of this Section 8.05 may cause Seller and its
Affiliates irreparable harm, which may not be adequately compensated for by
money damages. In the event of any actual or threatened violation of this
Section 8.05, Seller and any of its Affiliates shall be entitled, in addition
to other remedies that they may have, to seek a temporary restraining order
and to seek preliminary and final injunctive relief against Buyer or such
Affiliate of Buyer to prevent any violations of this Section 8.05 without the
necessity of posting a bond.

(e) At the Closing, Buyer shall execute any necessary documentation in order
to amend the organizational documents with respect to the Companies such that
each of the Acquired Companies can effect a change in its name to a name not
containing and not confusingly similar to any of the Seller Names and Marks.
Immediately after the Closing, Buyer shall cause the Acquired Companies to
file the application documents to register a new trade name with each
applicable Governmental Authority and take all other necessary action to
fulfill its obligations set forth in this Section 8.05 as soon as reasonably
practicable.

(f) Buyer shall be permitted to prepare, at its sole expense, a trademark
application to be filed with the United States Patent and Trademark Office
consisting of the term "TALCOTT" (the "Talcott Mark Application") following
the date hereof. Seller shall cooperate with Buyer in all reasonable respects
in preparation of any such Talcott Mark Applications. Within five (5) Business
Days following receipt by Seller of a written request to file the Talcott Mark
Application, which notice shall include a final version of such application,
Seller shall cause HLI or another Acquired Company designated by Buyer in such
notice to provide such materials and execute all such documents reasonably
necessary to file such application with the United States Patent and Trademark
Office or to confirm ownership of the Talcott Mark Application following the
Closing. Buyer shall promptly reimburse Seller and its Affiliates (including
the Acquired Companies) for all costs and expenses incurred by any of them
with respect to such cooperation and filing. Neither Seller nor any of its
Affiliates (including the Acquired Companies) shall have any obligation to
continue to prosecute the Talcott Mark Application or defend any challenge or
other Action with respect to such application (or its subsequent registration)
unless Buyer agrees in writing to pay and promptly reimburse Seller and its
Affiliates (including the Acquired Companies) for all costs and expenses they
incur in connection therewith. Neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates
(including the Acquired Companies) make any representations as to the
availability, registrability, non-infringement or enforceability of the
Talcott Mark Application. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, the Talcott Mark Application shall be owned by Buyer or one of the
Acquired Companies as successor to the business to which the Talcott Mark
Application relates following Closing; provided, that the Talcott Mark
Application shall not be considered Owned Intellectual Property for purposes
of the representations and warranties of Seller nor any of its Affiliates
(including the Acquired Companies) set forth herein.

Section 8.06 Guarantees.

(a) With respect to any and all guarantees, letters of credit, indemnity or
contribution agreements, support agreements, insurance surety bonds or other
similar agreements made in respect of any Acquired Company by HFSG, HLA or
HFIC, in each case, that is set forth in Schedule 8.06(a) (the "Intercompany

to, deliver to HFSG, HLA and HFIC the Buyer Hold Harmless and Indemnification
Agreements.

to which the applicable group annuity is not terminated prior to the Closing,
HFSG shall deliver to Buyer the Seller Hold Harmless and Indemnification

Section 8.07 Transaction Agreements. Subject to Section 7.03, the parties have
agreed to the forms of Transaction Agreements attached as Exhibits A-1 through
P-2 and shall, at or prior to the Closing, in the case of each such
Transaction Agreement execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and
delivered, each such agreement with any changes as may be required by any
Governmental Authority to obtain any Governmental Approval that may be or
become necessary for the execution and delivery of and the performance by the
applicable parties of their respective obligations pursuant to, and
consummation of the transactions contemplated by, the Transaction Agreements.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, subject to the last sentence of Section
7.03(b), the parties shall not be required to accept any such changes required
by any Governmental Authority to the extent such change would result in a
Burdensome Condition.

Section 8.08 Non-Solicitation.

or hire any such Person who was terminated or otherwise discharged by any of
the Acquired Companies or their respective Affiliates at least three (3)
months prior to the first such solicitation or employment; provided, further,
that nothing in this Section 8.08(a) shall prohibit Seller or any of its
Affiliates from employing or hiring any Person who contacts Seller or any of
its Affiliates on his or her own initiative without direct solicitation or as
a result of a general solicitation to the public or general advertising not
directed at Business Employees.

(b) For a period of twelve (12) months from the Closing Date, Buyer shall not,

under the Seller Severance Plan, any Business Employee who does not become a
Transferred Employee or any individual who provides transition services
pursuant to the Transition Services Agreement; provided, that Buyer and its
Subsidiaries may solicit, employ or hire any such individual (other than any
employee who received severance payments under the Seller Severance Plan or
Business Employees who do not become Transferred Employees) who was terminated
or otherwise discharged by Seller or any of its Affiliates at least three (3)
months prior to the first such solicitation or employment; provided, further,
that nothing in this Section 8.08(b) shall prohibit Buyer or any of its
Subsidiaries from employing or hiring any Person (other than any employees who
received severance payments under the Seller Severance Plan or Business
Employees who do not become Transferred Employees) who contacts Buyer or any
of its Subsidiaries on his or her own initiative without direct solicitation
or as a result of a general solicitation to the public or general advertising
not directed at such individuals.

Section 8.09 Non-Competition.

(a) For purposes of this Agreement, "Competing Business" shall mean the
business of issuing, underwriting, selling, marketing and administering (i)
fixed, payout and variable annuity contracts, (ii) individual life insurance
policies, (iii) variable and general account life insurance policies under

owner or a beneficiary of such policy, (iv) variable life insurance policies
offered in transactions intended to qualify as private placements under the
Securities Act, (v) structured settlement annuities and (vi) funding

Notwithstanding the foregoing, a "Competing Business" shall not include any
activities or businesses engaged in by Seller or its Affiliates (other than
the Acquired Companies) as of the date hereof, or proposed to be engaged in by
Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than the Acquired Companies) pursuant
to a publicly announced acquisition or similar agreement entered into by
Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than the Acquired Companies) prior to
the date hereof, including:

(A) underwriting, marketing, producing, selling or administering insurance

"Non-Compete Period"), Seller shall not, and shall not permit any of its
Affiliates (each, a "Restricted Person") to, engage, as a principal or jointly
with others, in the Competing Business in the United States. Seller shall not
have any obligation under this Section 8.09 with respect to any Restricted
Person from and after such time as such Restricted Person ceases to be an
Affiliate of Seller. A "Restricted Person" shall not include any Person that
purchases or receives assets, operations or a business from Seller or any of
its Affiliates, if such Person is not an Affiliate of Seller after such
transaction is consummated. A "Restricted Person" also shall not include any
Affiliate of Seller in which a Person who is not an Affiliate of Seller holds
equity interests and with respect to which Seller or another Affiliate, as
applicable, has contractual or legal obligations (including fiduciary duties
of representatives on the board of directors or similar body of such
Subsidiary) as of the date of this Agreement limiting Seller's ability to
impose on such Affiliate a non-competition obligation such as that in this
Section 8.09.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in Section 8.09(b), and
without implication that the following activities otherwise would be subject
to the provisions of this Section 8.09, nothing in this Agreement shall
preclude, prohibit or restrict Seller from engaging, or require Seller to
cause any Restricted Person not to engage, in any manner in any of the
following:

(i) making investments in the ordinary course of business, including in a
general or separate account of an insurance company, in Persons engaging in a
Competing Business; provided, that each such investment is a passive

to designate a majority of the members of the board of directors or other
governing body of such entity or to otherwise influence or direct the
operation or management of any such entity, (B) is not a participant with any
other Person in any group (as such term is used in Regulation 13D of the

(vi) providing reinsurance to any Person engaging in a Competing Business, so
long as Seller and the Restricted Persons are not engaged in the marketing,
production or administration of such reinsured business;

Business; or

(ix) acquiring (whether by way of merger or stock or asset acquisition or
otherwise), directly or indirectly, any Person or business (an "Acquired
Business") where such Acquired Business derived twenty-five percent (25%) or
more of its net operating revenue on a consolidated basis for its most recent
fiscal year from a Competing Business; provided, that Seller shall either (A)
use reasonable best efforts to, or shall cause the relevant Restricted Person
to use reasonable best efforts to, sell, spin off or otherwise divest itself
(or enter into an agreement to sell, spin off or otherwise divest itself) of
the portion of the division, unit or Person related to such Acquired Business
that engages in the Competing Business within twenty-four (24) months of the
closing of the acquisition of such Acquired Business; or (B) modify, or cause
the relevant Restricted Person to modify, such Acquired Business such that
such Acquired Business derives less than twenty-five percent (25%) of its net
operating revenue on a consolidated basis from a Competing Business.

Section 8.10 DandO Liabilities. From and after the Closing Date until the sixth
(6th) anniversary of the Closing Date, Buyer shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates to, maintain in full the indemnification obligations set forth in
the applicable organizational documents of the Acquired Companies (including
providing insurance coverage to the extent that such insurance coverage is
available and that the annual premium for such insurance coverage does not
exceed 300% of the Acquired Companies' reasonably estimated stand-alone
premium for the most recent comparable period ended prior to the Closing), as
in effect immediately prior to the Closing with such changes as may be
required under applicable Law, with respect to all past directors, officers
and managers of each of the Acquired Companies as well as all directors,
officers and managers of each of the Acquired Companies as of the Closing
Date, in each case, for acts or omissions occurring on or prior to the Closing
Date in their capacities as such, and to indemnify and hold harmless such
Persons in accordance therewith. Buyer, Seller and any Person entitled to
indemnification under this Section 8.10 shall cooperate in the defense of any
litigation under this Section 8.10 and shall provide access to properties and
individuals as reasonably requested and furnish or cause to be furnished
records, information and testimony, and attend such conferences, discovery
proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals, as may be reasonably requested in
connection therewith.

Section 8.11 Deletion of Software. In the event that after the Closing Buyer
becomes aware of any instance of any Software in its possession that is owned
by Seller or any of Seller's Affiliates and that is not licensed to Buyer or
the Acquired Companies, Buyer shall use reasonable best efforts to delete such
instances of the Software as soon as practicable. In the event that after the
Closing Seller or a Seller Affiliate becomes aware of any instance of any
Intellectual Property or Software in its possession that is owned by Buyer or
an Acquired Company, Seller shall use, and shall cause its Affiliates to use,
reasonable best efforts to delete such instances of the Intellectual Property
and Software as soon as practicable.

Section 8.12 Extraordinary Dividend. Seller shall, and shall cause HLI, HLIC
and ILA to, use reasonable best efforts to take such actions as may be
necessary to permit HLIC to pay to HLI prior to the Closing an extraordinary
dividend in an amount necessary to cause the Pre-Closing Dividend Amount to be
no less than the Minimum Pre-Closing Dividend Amount and no greater than the
Specified Pre-Closing Dividend Amount (the "Extraordinary Dividend"). Seller
shall cause HLIC to pay the Extraordinary Dividend to HLI, and, in turn, shall
cause HLI to pay a dividend to Seller in an amount equal to the Extraordinary
Dividend, at or prior to the Closing (but in any case prior to the Effective
Time). The parties hereto shall cooperate and negotiate in good faith to
determine and agree upon which assets of HLI, HLIC and ILA (including any
assets included in any dividends from HLIC to HLI between the date hereof and
the Closing Date) will be included in such dividends and, if HLI, HLIC or ILA
must dispose of assets to pay or facilitate the payment of such dividends,
which assets will be disposed; provided, that nothing contained in this
Section 8.12 shall be deemed to permit Buyer to control the actions of HLI,
HLIC or ILA prior to the Effective Time.

Section 8.13 True-Up Dividend.

(a) Seller shall, and shall cause HLI, HLIC and ILA to, use reasonable best
efforts to take such actions as may be necessary to permit HLIC to pay to HLI
prior to the Closing an extraordinary dividend in an amount equal to the net
amount received by the Acquired Companies through the payment of the Closing
True-Up Payments (such dividend, the "True-Up Dividend"). Seller shall cause
HLIC to pay the True-Up Dividend to HLI, and, in turn, shall cause HLI to pay
a dividend to Seller in an amount equal to the True-Up Dividend, at or prior
to the Closing (but in any case prior to the Effective Time). The True-Up
Dividend shall be comprised solely of cash, unless otherwise required by the
Connecticut Insurance Department.

(b) In the event the Connecticut Insurance Department approves a single
dividend without separate identification or description of the Extraordinary
Dividend and the True-Up Dividend, for purposes of this Agreement such
dividend shall be treated as the True-Up Dividend to the extent of the net
amount received by the Acquired Companies through the payment of the Closing
True-Up Payments, and the remainder shall be treated as the Extraordinary
Dividend.

Section 8.14 Seller Affiliated Funds. From the Closing Date through June 5,
2018, Buyer shall, and shall cause each of the applicable Insurance Companies
to, continue to offer the mutual funds set forth on Schedule 8.14 (the "Seller
Affiliated Funds") as an investment option within the applicable Insurance
Contracts to the same extent such Seller Affiliated Funds are offered as an
investment option within the applicable Insurance Contracts as of the date
hereof; provided, that the applicable mutual fund organization continues to
make such Seller Affiliated Funds available to the applicable Insurance
Company and the holders of such Insurance Contracts upon substantially the
same terms they are made available as of the date hereof.

Section 8.15 Certain Group Annuity Contracts. Following the Closing, upon the
request of Seller, Buyer shall, and shall cause the Acquired Companies to,
cooperate with Seller and its Affiliates in good faith to effect the
transactions described on Schedule 8.15; provided, that Seller shall bear all
out-of-pocket costs and expenses related to such transactions.

Section 8.16 HLI Obligations Relating to Certain Prior Dispositions. After the
Closing, Buyer shall cause HLI to discharge and perform its non-payment
obligations under the agreements set forth on Schedule 8.16; provided, that
Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, cooperate with Buyer and the
Acquired Companies in any administrative matters relating to such obligations.

Section 8.17 Commitments.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, prior to the
Closing, each of Buyer and Buyer Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary to consummate and obtain the equity financing on the terms
and conditions set forth in the applicable Commitment Letters, including using
its reasonable best efforts to: (i) maintain in full force and effect the
Commitment Letters; provided, that Buyer and Buyer Parent may replace,
substitute, amend or terminate the Commitment Letters in accordance with this
Section 8.17; (ii) satisfy all conditions applicable to Buyer or Buyer Parent
in the Commitment Letters; (iii) comply on a timely basis with its obligations
under the Commitment Letters; (iv) cause the financings contemplated by the
Commitment Letters to be consummated at or prior to the date that the Closing
is required to occur in accordance with Section 3.01; and (v) enforce its
rights under the Commitment Letters. Prior to the Closing, Buyer or Buyer
Parent shall give Seller prompt notice of any default, breach or repudiation
by any party to the Commitment Letters

(b) Except as expressly permitted by this paragraph (b), Buyer and Buyer
Parent shall not amend, modify, supplement, restate, terminate, substitute,
waive a provision under or replace (collectively, "Change") any Commitment
Letter. Subject to Section 8.17(f), with the prior consent of Seller (not to
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), Buyer and Buyer Parent
shall have the right to (i) make immaterial Changes to the form of Commitment
Letter for any new Investor that will be executed after the date hereof or
(ii) reduce the amount of any Commitment Letter to be funded at the Closing
and simultaneously increase the amount of any other Commitment Letter or enter
into one or more new Commitment Letters in substantially the same form as the
existing Commitment Letters (with the aggregate amount of such increase or new
commitments equal to or greater than the amount of such reduction); provided,
that (A) no such Change (x) shall result in a breach by Buyer or Buyer Parent
of Section 8.17(d) or (y) would be reasonably expected to make less likely the
satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article XI or delay the
satisfaction of any such condition such that the Closing would be delayed and
(B) unless Buyer has received the prior consent of Seller (which may be
withheld by Seller in its sole discretion), Buyer and Buyer Parent shall not
make any such Change after the earlier of twenty-five (25) days from the date
hereof and the date on which Buyer files its "Form A" with the Connecticut
Insurance Department, if such Change relates to an Investor that would either
before or after such Change be contemplated to own individually 10% or more of
the voting securities of Buyer or Buyer Parent at the Closing or would
otherwise be an "acquiring party" under the insurance Laws of the State of
Connecticut (a "Form A Applicant") and such Change would affect the
information included in Buyer's "Form A" filing. Without limiting the
foregoing, it shall be deemed to be reasonable for Seller to withhold consent
pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence to a Change of any Commitment
Letter if (1) such Change involves a full or partial release of an Investor or
a decrease in its commitment (unless such decrease is expressly conditioned on
the actual funding of a replacement commitment in an amount equal to or
greater than such decrease) under its then existing Commitment Letter in
connection with a substitute, replacement or increased Commitment Letter from
one or more other existing or new Investor(s) and any such Investor providing
such substitute, replacement or increased Commitment Letter, after giving
effect to such substitution, replacement or increase, would be less
creditworthy in the good faith judgment of Seller than the Investor(s) being
substituted or replaced or whose commitment is decreased, (2) any such
proposed replacement or substitute Investor is a Prohibited Person or (3) such
Change could reasonably be expected to make less likely the satisfaction of
any condition set forth in Article XI or delay the satisfaction of any such
condition such that the Closing would be delayed. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, (I) Seller acknowledges and agrees that it may not withhold its
consent based on clause (3) of the preceding sentence in connection with a
replacement or any other Change, in each case at any time, with respect to an
Investor which would not be contemplated to be a Form A Applicant and (II)
Seller's consent to a Change contemplated by the second sentence of this
Section 8.17(b) is hereby deemed to have been given with respect to an
addition or substitution (and a related full or partial release or decrease in
the commitment of one or more then-existing Investor(s) in an aggregate amount
less than or equal to the amount of such addition or substitution) if such
addition or substitution is fully completed and appropriately documented,
before the earlier of the date which is twenty-five (25) days after the date
hereof and the date on which Buyer files its "Form A" with the Connecticut
Insurance Department, of one or more of the potential Investors as agreed to
in writing by Buyer and Seller for up to the ownership percentages of the
voting securities of Buyer Parent and Buyer Parent GP set forth for each such
potential Investor in such writing. If any additional, replacement or
substitute Commitment Letter is obtained, Buyer shall promptly provide Seller
with a true and correct copy of such Commitment Letter and any reference in
this Agreement to (aa) "Commitment Letter" shall include such additional,
substitute or replacement Commitment Letter and (bb) "Investors" shall include
the Investors party to such additional, substitute or replacement Commitment
Letters. If a Commitment Letter from an Investor is terminated or released in
accordance with this Section 8.17, Seller agrees that the Limited Guaranty
provided by such Investor (or its Affiliate) shall be deemed to be cancelled
and of no further force or effect; provided, that one or more limited
guarantees in substantially the same form as the Limited Guaranty being
terminated or released have been executed and delivered by the Investor(s)
providing the replacement Commitment Letters (or their Affiliates which are no
less creditworthy in the good faith judgment of Seller than the Investor (or
its Affiliate) that provided the Limited Guaranty being terminated or
released) and the aggregate amount of the Caps (as defined in the Limited
Guaranty being terminated or released) on the Guaranteed Obligations (as
defined in the Limited Guaranty being terminated or released) in such
replacement limited guarantees equals or exceeds the amount of the related
Caps on the Guaranteed Obligations in the Limited Guaranty being terminated or
released. If the amount of a Commitment Letter from an Investor is reduced in
accordance with this Section 8.17 and provided that one or more limited
guarantees in substantially the same form as the Limited Guaranty being
reduced pursuant to this sentence have been executed and delivered by the
Investor(s) providing the replacement Commitment Letters (or their Affiliates
which are no less creditworthy in the good faith judgment of Seller than the
Investor (or its Affiliate) that provided the Limited Guaranty being reduced)
(the "Additional Limited Guarantees"), Seller agrees that the Caps on such
Investor's Guaranteed Obligations in the Limited Guaranty provided by such
Investor (or its Affiliate) shall be deemed to be reduced in accordance with
the terms thereof by the aggregate amount of the related Caps on the
Guaranteed Obligations set forth in the applicable Additional Limited
Guarantees.

(c) Buyer shall provide Seller with prompt written notice of the receipt of
any notice or other communication from any Investor with respect to such
Investor's failure or anticipated failure to fund its commitments under any
Commitment Letter or definitive agreement in connection therewith. Buyer shall
keep Seller reasonably informed on a current basis of the status of its
efforts to consummate the financing contemplated by the Commitment Letters.

(d) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, each
of Buyer, Buyer Parent and Buyer Parent GP expressly acknowledges and agrees
that its obligations under this Agreement are not conditioned in any manner
upon Buyer, Buyer Parent or Buyer Parent GP obtaining any debt or equity
financing. Furthermore, Buyer and Buyer Parent shall at all times maintain
Commitments sufficient in the aggregate to fund all of the amounts required to
be provided by Buyer on the Closing Date for the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other Transaction
Agreements, including the payment of the amount payable at the Closing under
Section 3.02 (assuming that the Pre-Closing Dividend Amount is equal to the
Minimum Pre-Closing Dividend Amount) and the payment of all costs and expenses
accrued by Buyer or Buyer Parent through the Closing Date in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other Transaction
Agreements, including all liabilities or obligations incurred under Section
7.03(d), Section 7.14 and Section 8.17(e).

(e) Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller and its Affiliates and
their respective Representatives from and against any and all losses, claims,
damages, liabilities, costs, reasonable attorneys' fees, judgments, fines,
penalties and amounts paid in settlement (including all interest, assessments
and other charges paid or payable in connection with or in respect of any
thereof) suffered or incurred in connection with any financing or other
securities offering of Buyer or its Affiliates or any assistance or activities
provided in connection therewith or otherwise under this Section 8.17.

(f) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, if
Buyer or Buyer Parent, between the date hereof and the Closing (i) increases
the aggregate amount of Commitments to be funded at the Closing pursuant to
the Commitment Letters (excluding a temporary increase that is or will be
fully offset by a subsequent reduction in the aggregate amount of Commitments)
or (ii) enters into any new equity financing commitment letters, in each case,
in accordance with Section 8.17(b) (other than in connection with, or for
purposes of, substituting or replacing any Commitments in whole or in part),
then the Rollover Amount shall automatically be reduced by an amount equal to
such new or increased equity financing commitments; provided, that in no event
shall the Rollover Amount be reduced below $100,000,000.

Section 8.18 Further Action.

(a) Seller and Buyer (i) shall execute and deliver, or shall cause to be
executed and delivered, such documents and other papers and shall take, or
shall cause to be taken, such further actions as may be reasonably required to
carry out the provisions of the Transaction Agreements and give effect to the
transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreements, (ii) shall refrain
from taking any actions that could reasonably be expected to impair, delay or
impede the Closing, (iii) without limiting the foregoing, but subject to
Section 7.03(b), shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to cause
all the conditions to the obligations of the other party to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be met as soon as reasonably
practicable and (iv) shall cooperate in good faith to facilitate an orderly
Closing and transition.

(b) Each of Seller and Buyer shall keep each other reasonably apprised of the
status of the matters relating to the completion of the transactions
contemplated hereby, including with respect to the satisfaction of the
conditions set forth in Article XI. From time to time following the Closing,
Seller and Buyer shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to,
execute, acknowledge and deliver all reasonable further conveyances, notices,
assumptions, releases and acquittances and such instruments, and shall take
such reasonable actions as may be necessary or appropriate to make effective
the transactions contemplated hereby as may be reasonably requested by the
other party.

Section 8.19 Seller Confidentiality Agreements. Within ten (10) Business Days
following the date hereof, Seller shall request that all Persons who executed
a confidentiality agreement with HFSG or any of its Affiliates since January
1, 2016 relating to the potential sale of the Business (each, a "Seller
Confidentiality Agreement") return or destroy all confidential information
heretofore furnished to such Person by or on behalf of Seller or its
Affiliates in accordance with the terms of such Seller Confidentiality
Agreement. Following the Closing, Seller shall notify Buyer in the event that
it becomes aware of a breach of any Seller Confidentiality Agreement, and, if
so directed by Buyer, shall enforce its rights under such Seller
Confidentiality Agreement for Buyer's benefit, at Buyer's sole expense.

Section 8.20 Exclusivity. From and after the date of this Agreement, Seller
shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates and its and its Affiliates'
respective Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (a) solicit,
initiate, encourage or facilitate any inquiry, indication of interest,
proposal or offer from any Person other than Buyer or its Representatives (an
"Alternate Bidder") relating to or in connection with a proposal or offer for
a merger, consolidation, amalgamation, bulk reinsurance, business combination,
sale or transfer of properties or assets or sale of any Capital Stock
(including by way of a tender or exchange offer), or similar transaction
involving the Acquired Companies or any part of the Business, whenever
conducted (in each case, other than as permitted under Section 7.01(a) or
Section 7.01(b) or in connection with the acquisition, disposition or custody
of investment assets in the ordinary course of business, an "Acquisition
Proposal"), (b) participate in or attend any discussions or negotiations or
enter into any agreement, arrangement or understanding, whether or not legally
binding, with, or provide or confirm any information to, any Alternate Bidder
relating to or in connection with any Acquisition Proposal by such Alternate
Bidder or (c) accept any proposal or offer from any Alternate Bidder relating
to a possible Acquisition Proposal or otherwise commit to, or enter into or
consummate any transaction contemplated by any Acquisition Proposal with any
Alternate Bidder. In the event that Seller or any of its Affiliates or any of
its or its Affiliates' respective Representatives receives an Acquisition
Proposal, Seller shall promptly notify Buyer of such proposal and provide a
copy thereof (if in written or electronic form) or, if in oral form, a written
summary of the terms and conditions thereof, including the names of the
interested parties.

Section 8.21 Gemini Hedge Specified Entities. Seller shall notify HLIC and ILA
promptly in writing upon the occurrence of any event or condition with respect
to any Gemini Hedge Specified Entities that would result in a "Cross Default"
or "Bankruptcy" with respect to such Gemini Hedge Specified Entities under any
Gemini Hedge Agreement, and Seller shall reasonably cooperate with Buyer as
necessary for a period of at least 120 days following the Closing Date to
engage with the applicable Gemini Counterparty to amend the Gemini Hedge
Agreements to remove all references therein to HLA and any other Gemini Hedge
Specified Entities.

Section 8.22 Management of Prospective Assets. From and after the Closing Date
until the fifth (5th) anniversary of the Closing Date, if Buyer or its
controlled Affiliates (including the Acquired Companies) desire to engage an
investment manager to manage assets not then managed by HIMCO, then Buyer
shall provide HIMCO with the opportunity to make a proposal to manage such
assets and shall consider in good faith any such proposal submitted by HIMCO.

Section 8.23 Seed Money in Mutual Funds. Except as set forth below, until the
second (2nd) anniversary of the Closing Date, the Acquired Companies may not
withdraw seed money invested in the Hartford mutual funds set forth on
Schedule 8.23 (such investments, the "Seed Money Assets"). Within ten (10)
Business Days after the dates that are five (5), eleven (11) and seventeen
(17) months after the Closing Date (each, a "Seed Money Reference Date"),
Seller shall notify Buyer and the Acquired Companies of Seed Money Assets that
may be withdrawn. Such notice shall identify assets constituting at least
twenty-five percent (25%), thirty-three percent (33%) and fifty percent (50%),
respectively, of the Seed Money Assets on the Seed Money Reference Date. Buyer
may elect to withdraw Seed Money Assets up to such amount by notice to Seller
given not more than ten (10) Business Days after the respective notice from
Seller. If Buyer so elects, the withdrawal shall be effected one (1) month
after the Seed Money Reference Date.

Section 8.24 Divisions.

(a) In the event that, at any time following the Closing, Buyer or its
Affiliates (including the Acquired Companies) desire to effect a Division with
respect to the business of any Acquired Company that is the subject of any of
the Intercompany Guarantees, Buyer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates
(including the Acquired Companies) to, use reasonable best efforts to cause
such business to no longer be subject to any of the Intercompany Guarantees,
including by incorporating the release of such Intercompany Guarantees with
respect to such business into any Plan of Division presented by Buyer and its
Affiliates to a Governmental Authority and obtaining any required Governmental
Approvals with respect thereto; provided, that if the Plan of Division is
rejected by the applicable Governmental Authority for reasons attributable to
the inclusion of such release in the Plan of Division or if the applicable
Governmental Authority requires as a condition to obtaining such release any
payment to policyholders or other third parties, then Buyer shall provide
Seller with prompt notice of such rejection or condition and Buyer shall have
no obligation to include such release in any subsequent or revised Plan of
Division or take any further action in pursuit of such release or accept such
condition unless Seller agrees in writing within ten (10) Business Days after
receipt of such notice to reimburse Buyer for all out-of-pocket costs and
expenses required in connection therewith. Buyer and Seller shall, and shall
cause their respective Affiliates (including, in the case of Buyer, the
Acquired Companies), to cooperate in furtherance of the matters referred to in
the preceding sentence.

(b) Subject to Section 8.24(a), Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates
to, at the request of Buyer use reasonable best efforts to cooperate with
Buyer in and assist Buyer in, (A) following the date hereof, developing a Plan
of Division to effect one or more Divisions with respect to the business of
HLIC and ILA that is the subject of any of the Prior Disposition Agreements
set forth in item (a), (b) or (i) of Schedule 1.01(h) and (B) effectuating
such Plan of Division following the Closing Date; provided, that (i) neither

Guarantee to remain in force following the consummation of any Division
contemplated by this paragraph and (ii) in no event shall a Plan of Division
with respect to any such Division be presented to, or filed with, any
Governmental Authority prior to the Closing. Buyer and the Acquired Companies
shall be responsible for their own costs and expenses and shall reimburse
Seller and its Affiliates for any of their out-of-pockets expenses to the
extent related to a Division under this Section 8.24(b). Seller and Buyer
acknowledge and agree that Seller and its Affiliates intend to pursue a
division transaction regarding business unrelated to the Business prior to
allocating significant resources to the filings for the Divisions contemplated
by this Section 8.24(b); provided that the foregoing restriction shall only
apply if the Seller and its Affiliates are diligently pursuing such unrelated
division transaction.

Section 8.25 HVIT Funds Platform. If the mutual funds identified on Schedule
8.25 (the "HVIT Funds Platform") have not been dissolved, liquidated or
otherwise terminated prior to the Closing, then upon the request of Seller,
Buyer shall, and shall cause the Acquired Companies to, cooperate with Seller
and its Affiliates in good faith to enter into any agreements reasonably
necessary to consummate the winding up of the HVIT Funds Platform; provided,
that Seller shall indemnify Buyer and the Acquired Companies under Section
13.01(a)(iii) for all Losses that may be suffered or incurred by Buyer or any
of the Acquired Companies to the extent relating to the dissolution,
liquidation, termination or winding up of HVIT Funds Platform.

Section 8.26 The Hartford International Asset Management Company Limited. If
The Hartford International Asset Management Company Limited and its funds have
not been dissolved, liquidated or otherwise terminated prior to the Closing,
then upon the request of Seller, Buyer shall, and shall cause the Acquired
Companies to, cooperate with Seller and its Affiliates in good faith to enter
into any agreements and take such other actions as are reasonably necessary to
consummate the winding up of The Hartford International Asset Management
Company Limited and its funds; provided, that Seller shall indemnify Buyer and
the Acquired Companies under Section 13.01(a)(iii) for all Losses that may be
suffered or incurred by Buyer or any of the Acquired Companies (as applicable)
to the extent relating to the dissolution, liquidation, termination or winding
up of The Hartford International Asset Management Company, or any failure to
accomplish such dissolution, liquidation, termination or winding up, including
breach of any Laws of Ireland, or any failure to obtain approval under such
Laws in anticipation of such dissolution, liquidation, termination or winding
up being completed prior to the Closing.

Section 8.27 Investment, Hedging and Risk Management Practices and Strategies.
Between the date hereof and the Closing, Seller shall, and shall cause its
respective Affiliates to, reasonably consider in good faith any changes to any
of the Acquired Companies' investment, hedging and risk management practices
and strategies proposed by Buyer; provided, that Seller shall not be required
to implement or cause any of its Affiliates to implement any such changes
proposed by Buyer. Seller shall provide Buyer with written reports regarding
the Acquired Companies' investment, hedging and risk management practices and
strategies that have been regularly prepared by the Acquired Companies and
provided to management of the Acquired Companies, and, no more frequently than
twice per month at Buyer's request, Seller will make reasonably available the
appropriate representatives of Seller and its Affiliates to participate in a
telephonic meeting at such time as the parties may mutually agree to review
any such reports with representatives of Buyer.

Section 8.28 529 Plan Management Agreements. With respect to each agreement
set forth on Schedule 8.28 (collectively, the "529 Plan Management
Agreements") that, prior to the Closing, is not assigned to an Affiliate of
Seller (other than an Acquired Company) or replaced with a new agreement with
an Affiliate of Seller (other than an Acquired Company) and to which new
agreement HLIC is not a party (each, an "Unassigned 529 Plan Management
Agreement"), Buyer shall, and shall cause HLIC to, (a) use reasonable best
efforts to maintain in full force and effect such Unassigned 529 Plan
Management Agreements and (b) refrain from terminating, amending or modifying,
waiving, releasing or assigning any rights under any such Unassigned 529 Plan
Management Agreement without Seller's prior written consent; provided, that
Seller shall be responsible for all costs and expenses incurred by Buyer and
its Affiliates (including the Acquired Companies) related to the actions
described in clauses (a) and (b). Seller and Buyer shall cooperate with each
other to cause each such Unassigned 529 Plan Management Agreement to be
assigned to an Affiliate of Seller (other than the Acquired Companies) or to
be replaced with new agreements with an Affiliate of Seller (other than the
Acquired Companies) and to which HLIC is not a party as soon as reasonably
practicable following the Closing; provided, that Seller shall bear all
parties' costs and expenses related to such cooperation. Following the
Closing, with respect to each Unassigned 529 Plan Management Agreement, until
such Unassigned 529 Plan Management Agreement is assigned to an Affiliate of
Seller (other than the Acquired Companies) or terminated, the parties shall
cooperate with each other to maintain an arrangement under which (i) Seller
and its Affiliates (other than an Acquired Company) shall obtain the benefits,
assume the obligations, make all payments and otherwise bear the economic
burdens associated with such Unassigned 529 Plan Management Agreement, (ii)
Buyer shall, and shall cause HLIC to, enforce for the benefit (and at the
expense) of Seller and its applicable Affiliates any and all of HLIC's rights
under such Unassigned 529 Plan Management Agreement and (iii) Buyer shall, and

all monies received by HLIC in connection with such Unassigned 529 Plan
Management Agreement; provided, that Seller shall be responsible for all costs
and expenses incurred by Buyer and its Affiliates (including the Acquired
Companies) related to the actions described in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii).

Section 8.29 Closing Date Surplus Note. In the event that the Connecticut
Insurance Department indicates that it will not approve the Extraordinary
Dividend in an amount equal to the Specified Pre-Closing Dividend Amount
without an increase in HLIC's surplus by the amount of the Surplus Shortfall,
HLIC will issue to Seller on the Closing Date (but before the Closing) the
Closing Date Surplus Note in exchange for a cash purchase price, payable by
Seller, equal to the principal amount of the Closing Date Surplus Note. The
Closing Date Surplus Note, if any, shall have the terms mutually agreed to by
the Buyer and Seller at the time of issuance. Buyer shall, and shall cause
HLIC to, take all actions necessary for HLIC to redeem and repay in full the
Closing Date Surplus Note effective immediately following the "Closing" (as
defined in the Specified Third-Party Reinsurance Binder), by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the account designated by Seller pursuant to
Section 2.05 of an amount equal to the principal amount of the Closing Date
Surplus Note. Upon such payment, Seller shall cancel and surrender the Closing
Date Surplus Note to HLIC and cooperate with HLIC to effect the cancellation
of such Closing Date Surplus Note immediately following such payment.

ARTICLE IX 
EMPLOYEE MATTERS

Section 9.01 Employee Matters.

(a) Comparable Position.

(i) On or prior to the Employment Offer Date, or, if later, within thirty (30)
days of the date Seller reports to Buyer that an individual has become a
Business Employee (but not later than five (5) days prior to the Closing
Date), Buyer shall extend or shall cause one of its Affiliates to extend to
each Business Employee a written offer of employment, effective as of the
Closing Date (or such later date as is set forth below with respect to those
Business Employees employed by Seller or any of its Affiliates who are
Inactive Business Employees), that constitutes a Comparable Position with
Buyer or its Affiliates (including, following the Closing Date, the Acquired
Companies) (an "Offer of Employment"). Reasonably prior to each date by which
Buyer must make, or cause to be made, an Offer of Employment, Buyer and Seller
shall cooperate to share information about the duties and responsibilities of
each Business Employee prior to, and as proposed with respect to employment
with Buyer or its Affiliates (including the Acquired Companies) following, the
Closing Date. Buyer shall provide Seller with a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment on each general form of Offer of Employment and a list of
the Business Employees to receive such Offer of Employment, which list shall
set forth the title, duties and responsibilities, compensation (including base
salary, commission opportunity, target bonus and long-term incentive
compensation opportunity, in each case, only to the extent applicable) and
principal place of employment each such Business Employee will have with Buyer
or its Affiliates (including an Acquired Company) following the Business
Employee's Effective Hire Date. Such list shall be subject to Seller's
reasonable approval, which approval shall constitute Seller's judgment that
each such proposed Offer of Employment would constitute an offer of a
Comparable Position, and Seller and Buyer shall reasonably cooperate to
resolve any disagreement with respect thereto. The Offer of Employment may
include work product assignment, confidentiality, non-disclosure and non-
solicitation provisions substantially similar to such provisions applicable to
employment with Seller and its Affiliates.

(ii) Except as set forth below with respect to Inactive Business Employees,
the employment relationship of each Business Employee with Seller or its
applicable Affiliate shall terminate effective as of 11:59 p.m., New York City
time, on the Closing Date. Each Business Employee who actually commences
employment with Buyer or one of its Affiliates (including an Acquired Company)
and performs work at his or her then applicable place of employment on the
first (1st) Business Day following the Closing Date on which such Business
Employee is scheduled, expected or permitted to work (taking into account
authorized or legally permitted time off or leave) shall be deemed to have
accepted Buyer's Offer of Employment and shall be considered and referred to
as a "Transferred Employee" of Buyer or Buyer's Affiliates (including the
Acquired Companies) as of 12:00:01 a.m., New York City time, on the first
(1st) day immediately following the Closing Date (which shall be the
"Effective Hire Date" for all Business Employees other than Inactive Business
Employees) for all purposes of this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt,
Buyer or Buyer's Affiliates (including the Acquired Companies) shall have no
responsibility for or obligation to any Business Employee who does not become
a Transferred Employee pursuant to this Section; provided, that Buyer has
complied, and as applicable has caused Buyer's Affiliates (including the
Acquired Companies) to comply, with this Section 9.01(a), Section 9.01(b) and
Section 9.01(d).

(iii) Inactive Business Employees shall remain employed by Seller or Seller's
Affiliate, as the case may be, until the earlier of the date the Inactive
Business Employee becomes a Transferred Employee or the expiration of the
Inactive Business Employee's leave under Seller's or such applicable
Affiliate's policies. An Inactive Business Employee shall only become a
Transferred Employee of Buyer or Buyer's Affiliates (including the Acquired
Companies) if the Inactive Business Employee performs work at Buyer or any
Affiliate (including any Acquired Company) on the first (1st) Business Day on
which such Inactive Business Employee is scheduled, expected or permitted to
work (taking into account authorized or legally permitted time off or leave)
following the Inactive Business Employee's release to return to work from the
leave, which first such date shall be the Effective Hire Date for such
Inactive Business Employee.

(iv) Not less than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing, Seller shall
(A) update Section 5.14(a) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule to add any
individuals who become Business Employees after the date hereof and remove any
individuals who have ceased to be Business Employees after the date hereof (in
each case in compliance with Section 7.01(a)(ii)) and (B) deliver such updated
list of Business Employees to Buyer.

(b) Employee Communications. During the period from the date hereof through
the Closing Date, Buyer and Seller shall reasonably cooperate to communicate
to the Business Employees the details of the proposed terms and conditions of
their employment after the Closing Date with Buyer or its designated
Affiliates (including an Acquired Company). All communications between Buyer
or its Affiliates and the Business Employees shall be subject to Seller's
reasonable prior approval (which approval shall not be unreasonably
conditioned, withheld or delayed) and Seller and its Affiliates shall not
purport to communicate with Business Employees on behalf of Buyer and its
Affiliates or communicate with its employees regarding the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement in a manner that could reasonably be expected
to have the effect of binding Buyer, its Affiliates or the Acquired Companies.

(c) Maintenance of Terms; WARN Act. From a Transferred Employee's Effective
Hire Date through the first (1st) anniversary of the Closing Date or such
earlier date on which such Transferred Employee's employment with Buyer and
its Affiliates terminates, Buyer shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to,
provide such Transferred Employee with terms and conditions of employment that
constitute a Comparable Position. On or before the Closing Date, Seller shall
inform Buyer of any layoffs of Business Employees (if any) that occurred
during the ninety (90) day period ending on the Closing Date. On and during
the ninety (90) days following the Closing Date, Buyer shall not, and shall
ensure that its Affiliates do not, take, cause or permit any act or omission
that would or reasonably could constitute a "plant closing," "mass layoff" or
similar event under the WARN Act with respect to any Transferred Employees.
Thereafter, Buyer shall, and shall cause its applicable Affiliates to, comply
with the WARN Act so as to avoid any liability thereunder for Seller or its
Affiliates with respect to any Transferred Employee.

(d) Work Permits. Buyer shall take, or cause its Affiliates to take, all
reasonably necessary steps to sponsor, or transfer sponsorship of, the work
permits for all Business Employees who are foreign nationals listed in
Schedule 9.01(d), and shall so sponsor, or cause its Affiliates to so sponsor,
such foreign national Business Employees on and after the Closing. Seller
shall cooperate as reasonably necessary to effect Buyer's or its Affiliates'
sponsorship or transfer of sponsorship of all such foreign national Business
Employees. Business Employees who have not obtained the necessary
authorization to work for Buyer and its Affiliates in the United States as of
the Closing shall not become Transferred Employees until such time (within
twelve (12) months after the Closing) as they are permitted to work for Buyer
and its Affiliates under applicable Law, at which time they shall become
Transferred Employees.

(e) Employee Benefits. Buyer and its Affiliates shall establish benefit plans
that waive any waiting period, probationary period, pre-existing condition
exclusion, evidence of insurability requirement, or similar condition with
respect to initial participation under any plan, program, or arrangement
established, maintained, or contributed to by Buyer or any of its Affiliates
under which the Transferred Employees, as applicable, may participate in
respect of health insurance, life insurance, or disability benefits with
respect to each Transferred Employee who has, prior to the Effective Hire
Date, satisfied, under Seller's or its Affiliates' comparable plans (including
the Acquired Companies), the comparable eligibility, insurability or other
requirements referred to in this sentence. Buyer and its Affiliates (including
the Acquired Companies) shall establish benefit plans that recognize the
dollar amount of all co-insurance, deductibles and similar expenses incurred
by each Transferred Employee (and his or her eligible dependents) during the
calendar year in which the Effective Hire Date occurs for purposes of
satisfying such year's deductible and co-payment limitations under the
relevant welfare benefit plans in which each Transferred Employee will be
eligible to participate from and after the Effective Hire Date, subject to
such Transferred Employee's provision of relevant information or documentation
confirming the amount of such co-insurance, deductibles and similar expenses.
Each Transferred Employee shall, for purposes of determining such Transferred
Employee's (i) eligibility to participate in, (ii) vesting and (iii) solely
for purposes of calculating the benefit accrual for paid time off, severance
and disability benefits, be credited under all employee benefit plans,
programs and arrangements of Buyer and its Affiliates with the service of such
Transferred Employee with Seller or its Affiliates up to the Effective Hire
Date, to the same extent as if such Transferred Employee had performed such
service for Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including any Acquired Companies)
but only to the extent that such credit does not result in a duplication of
benefits. In addition to the foregoing, Buyer shall, or shall cause one or
more of its Affiliates to:

(i) adopt a severance plan or policy for the benefit of Transferred Employees
on and after the Closing Date, the terms of which shall provide that from the
Closing Date to the first (1st) anniversary of the Closing Date (or if later,
the Effective Hire Date), Transferred Employees whose employment with Buyer or
any of its Affiliates terminates will be eligible to receive the severance
payments and benefits to which the Transferred Employee would have been
entitled under the applicable Seller Severance Plan covering the Transferred
Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date, taking into account the
Transferred Employee's length of service with Seller and its Affiliates as
provided in this Section 9.01(e) in addition to service with Buyer and its
Affiliates, subject in the discretion of Buyer to such Transferred Employee's
general release of claims and such other terms and conditions as provided
under such severance plan or policy which shall be not be more restrictive
than those provided in the applicable Seller Severance Plan immediately prior
to the date hereof;

(ii) cause the defined contribution plan(s) maintained by Buyer or its
Affiliates to accept a direct rollover of the account (including earnings
thereon through the date of transfer and any promissory note evidencing an
outstanding loan) of any Transferred Employee in the investment and savings
plan of Seller or Seller's Affiliate or any other Tax-qualified retirement
plan of Seller or Seller's Affiliate, that a Transferred Employee elects to
make as a direct rollover, and, to the extent necessary, amend such defined
contribution plan(s) prior to the Closing in order to carry out the intent of
this Section 9.01(e)(ii);

(iii) cause the flexible spending account(s) maintained by Buyer or Buyer's
Affiliates to accept a transfer of the account(s) of any Transferred Employee
under a health or dependent care flexible spending account maintained by
Seller or Seller's Affiliate (each, a "Seller FSA") and in doing so (A)
effectuate the election of any such Transferred Employee as in effect under
the applicable Seller FSA immediately prior to the Closing and (B) assume
responsibility for administering and paying under the applicable plans of
Buyer or Buyer's Affiliate all eligible reimbursement claims of the
Transferred Employees incurred in the calendar year in which the Closing Date
occurs and submitted for payment on or after the Closing Date, whether such
claims arose before, on or after the Closing Date. As soon as practicable
following the Closing Date, Seller or Seller's Affiliate shall cause to be
transferred to Buyer an amount in cash equal to (I) the sum of all
contributions to any Seller FSA made with respect to the calendar year in
which the Closing occurs prior to the Closing Date by or on behalf of the
Transferred Employees, reduced by (II) the sum of all claims incurred by the
Transferred Employees during the calendar year in which the Closing Date
occurs and submitted for payment prior to the Closing Date under any Seller
FSA;

(iv) provide each Transferred Employee with paid (or, in the event Seller or
its Affiliates is required to pay to such Transferred Employee compensation in
respect of accrued and unused time off in compliance with applicable Law of
the jurisdiction of the Transferred Employee's principal work location,
unpaid) time off in an amount equal to the unused paid time off accrued by
such Transferred Employee under an Employee Benefit Plan as of immediately
prior to such Transferred Employee's Effective Hire Date;

(v) from the Closing Date through the first (1st) anniversary of the Closing
Date, provide Transferred Employees with the vacation and paid time off
accrual rate and maximum accrual the Transferred Employee would have been
eligible to receive under the applicable plan, policy or agreement of Seller
or its Affiliates covering the Transferred Employee immediately prior to the
Effective Hire Date; provided, that such vacation and paid time off accrual
rate and maximum accrual shall not be decreased as a result of the obligation
set forth in Section 9.01(e)(iv); and

(vi) reimburse Transferred Employees for education courses for which such
Transferred Employees registered prior to the Effective Hire Date; provided,
that Transferred Employees have not already been reimbursed therefor, to the
extent that Seller's or its Affiliates' policies would provide for such
reimbursement if such Transferred Employees had continued to be employed by
Seller or its Affiliate.

(f) Annual Incentive Bonus. Seller shall, or shall cause one or more of its
Affiliates to, pay a bonus for the 2017 year under the Seller Annual Incentive
Plan to Transferred Employees who were covered under that plan immediately
prior to the Closing and who (i) continue to be employed by Buyer or its
Affiliates as of March 15, 2018, or (ii) whose employment with Buyer or its
Affiliates (including any Acquired Company) is involuntarily terminated (other
than for cause) prior to March 15, 2018. The amount to be so paid by Seller or
its Affiliates to all such Transferred Employees (the "2017 Bonus Pool") shall
be an amount equal to (A) a bonus funding factor, as determined by Seller or
its Affiliates in good faith taking into account the performance of the
Business and other factors comparable to those taken into account by Seller or
its Affiliates in determining bonuses under the Seller Annual Incentive Plan
for participants in other businesses, multiplied by (B) the sum of the target
bonuses applicable to the Transferred Employees under the Seller Annual
Incentive Plan, based on such Transferred Employees' tier and pay immediately
prior to the Closing. Seller shall, or shall cause one or more of its
Affiliates to, pay bonuses to Business Employees for the 2017 year under
Seller's Annual Incentive Plan in accordance with its normal practices and
Seller or its Affiliates shall distribute such bonus pool in their discretion
among eligible Business Employees. Buyer or its Affiliates (including any
Acquired Company) shall provide an incentive bonus to each Business Employee
(including each Inactive Business Employee) who becomes a Transferred Employee
covering the entire 2018 calendar year, on such terms (including performance
goals) as it shall determine in its discretion consistent with Section
9.01(a).

(g) Long-Term Incentive Compensation. Without limiting Buyer's obligations
under Section 9.01(a), to the extent that any Business Employee (including any
Inactive Business Employee) is eligible to participate in the Seller Long-Term
Incentive Plan immediately prior to the Closing Date, (i) if the Closing Date
is on or before the date on which Seller or its Affiliate, as applicable,
grants awards under the Seller Long-Term Incentive Plan, in the ordinary
course, with respect to the performance period beginning in 2018, Buyer shall,
or shall cause one or more of its Affiliates to, implement an incentive plan
or arrangement that provides each Business Employee who becomes a Transferred
Employee with a long-term incentive award, the value of which is substantially
comparable to that provided (or that which would have been provided for the
performance period beginning in 2018) under the Seller Long-Term Incentive
Plan immediately prior to the Closing Date (but without regard to the form of
award under Seller's Long Term Incentive Plan) and (ii) if the Closing Date is
after such date, Seller shall, or shall cause one or more of its Affiliates
to, grant awards for the performance period beginning in 2018 under the Seller
Long-Term Incentive Plan to such Business Employees. Buyer shall replace any
award to a Transferred Employee under the Seller Long-Term Incentive Plan that
will be forfeited by such Transferred Employee solely as a result of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement with an award of economically
equivalent value and with the same vesting schedule as such forfeited award
(but without regard to the form of the forfeited award) where such grant of
any such new award would not, in the reasonable belief of Buyer result in the
imposition of any additional taxes by reason of the application of Section
409A of the Code.

(h) Cooperation. Buyer and Seller shall cooperate, and cause their respective
Affiliates to cooperate, as appropriate to carry out the provisions of this
Section 9.01.

(i) Milestone Employees. Following the Closing Date, Buyer and Seller shall
cooperate, and cause their respective Affiliates (with respect to Buyer,
including the Acquired Companies) to cooperate, as appropriate, to share
information with respect to the employment status of any Milestone Employee
through and including a date specified by Seller or its Affiliates. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, Buyer agrees to provide Seller with
a contact person at Buyer or its Affiliates (including the Acquired Companies)
who shall confirm upon Seller's request the employment status of any Milestone
Employee as of a particular date.

(j) No Amendment of Plans; No Other Non-Party Rights. Notwithstanding anything
in this Agreement to the contrary, no provision of this Agreement is intended
to, or does, constitute the establishment or adoption of, or amendment to, any
employee benefit plan (within the meaning of Section 3(3) of, or subject to,
ERISA), and no Person participating in any such employee benefit plan
maintained by either Seller or its Affiliates or Buyer or its Affiliates, or
any beneficiary thereof, shall have any claim or cause of action, under ERISA
or otherwise, in respect of any provision of this Agreement as it relates to
any such employee benefit plan or otherwise. Without limiting the foregoing or
Section 14.08 in any way, nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is
intended to or shall confer upon any current, former or future Business
Employee or Transferred Employee or any of their beneficiaries or dependents
any legal or equitable right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under
or by reason of this Agreement, including any right to any compensation,
benefits or other terms and conditions of employment from, or to continued
employment for any period with, any of Seller, Buyer or any of their
respective Affiliates, or otherwise changes the at-will nature of employment.

TAX MATTERS

Section 10.01 Liability for Taxes.

(a) Seller shall be liable for and pay, and shall indemnify and hold harmless
the Buyer Indemnified Parties from and against, (i) Taxes imposed on the
Acquired Companies as a result of the Acquired Companies having been a member
of Seller's Group prior to the Closing Date (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, any liability under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 and similar
provisions of state, local or non-U.S. Law, and liability as a successor or
transferee), (ii) income and premium Taxes imposed on the Acquired Companies
for any Pre-Accounts Date Taxable Periods and, with respect to any Straddle

on or before the Closing Date, and, with respect to any Straddle Period, the
portion of such Straddle Period beginning on the day after the Accounts Date
and ending on the earlier of the end of such period and the Closing Date, (iv)
Taxes that arise from or are attributable to any breach of any covenant under
Article X and any inaccuracy in or breach of representation or warranty made
in Section 5.23(d), (e), (f), (g) or (k), (v) any Tax imposed on the Acquired
Companies under Treasury Regulations Section 1.367(b)-3 or otherwise as a
result of the dissolution, liquidation, termination or winding up of the
Hartford International Asset Management Company Limited occurring after the
Closing Date as described in Section 8.27(a), (vi) any Tax imposed on the
Acquired Companies to the extent relating to the dissolution, liquidation,
termination or winding up of the HVIT Funds Platform pursuant to the
provisions of Section 8.26, and (vii) any Tax imposed on the Acquired
Companies to the extent relating to actions required in connection with the
closure of HLIC's Canadian branch; provided, that Seller shall not be liable
for or pay, and shall not indemnify Buyer from and against, (A) any Taxes that
result from any actual or deemed election under Sections 336(e) or 338 of the
Code or any similar provisions of state, local or foreign Law as a result of
the purchase of the Shares or the deemed purchase of the Capital Stock of any
other Acquired Company or that result from Buyer, any Affiliate of Buyer or
(after the Closing Date) the Acquired Companies engaging in any activity or
transaction that would cause the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
to be treated as a purchase or sale of assets of the Acquired Companies for
foreign, federal, state, local or other Tax purposes in each case, other than
the Section 338(h)(10) Elections, (B) any Taxes for which Buyer is liable
under Section 10.01(b) and (C) any Taxes to the extent taken into account as a
Liability or reserve for Taxes in preparing the GAAP Financial Statements as
of the Accounts Date that do not constitute a Deemed Tax Liability (Taxes
described in clauses (A) and (C) of this proviso, "Excluded Taxes"). Seller
shall be entitled to any refund of (or credit for) Taxes allocable to any Pre-
Accounts Date Taxable Periods and, with respect to any Straddle Period, the
portion of such Straddle Period ending on the day before the Accounts Date
except in respect of any refund shown as a current asset on the GAAP Financial
Statements as of the Accounts Date or in respect of any carry back from a
taxable period beginning after the Closing Date to a Pre-Accounts Date Taxable
Period. Any such refunds received by Buyer or its Affiliates shall be
promptly, and in any event within thirty (30) days of the receipt of such
refund, paid over to Seller (less out-of-pocket expenses incurred in
connection with obtaining such refund and less any Taxes incurred in
connection with the receipt of such refund). To the extent it is within its
reasonable control, Buyer shall and shall cause its Affiliates to take
reasonable steps to secure any such refund or credit that would be available.

(b) Buyer shall, without duplication of amounts paid by the Acquired Companies
under Section 10.05(b), be liable for and pay, and shall indemnify and hold
harmless the Seller Indemnified Parties from and against, any Losses with
respect to (i) Taxes to the extent taken into account in the Deemed Tax
Liability calculated for any Post-Accounts Date Taxable Period (or portion
thereof) ending on or before the Closing Date, and, with respect to any
Straddle Period, the portion of such Straddle Period beginning on the day
after the Accounts Date and ending on and including the Closing Date, (ii) any
breach or failure of Buyer to perform any of its covenants or obligations
contained in this Article X, (iii) Taxes imposed or required to be paid by a
Seller Indemnified Party with respect to a Taxable Period of any Acquired
Company ending on or before the Closing Date arising as a result of actions
taken by any Acquired Company after the Closing Date unless otherwise
permitted under this Agreement, and (iv) Excluded Taxes. Buyer shall be
entitled to any refund of (or credit for) Taxes for which Buyer is liable
under Section 10.01 or that arises because of a Tax or carry back allocable to
any Post-Accounts Date Taxable Periods and, with respect to any Straddle
Period, the portion of such Straddle Period starting on the Accounts Date.

(c) For purposes of Section 10.01(a) and Section 10.01(b), whenever it is
necessary to determine the liability for Taxes of the Acquired Companies for a
partial period (including a Straddle Period), the determination of the Taxes
of the Acquired Companies for the portion of the period ending on and
including, and the portion of the period beginning after, the Accounts Date
shall be determined by assuming that the period consisted of two (2) Taxable
years or periods, one which ended at the close of the Accounts Date and, for
income tax purposes (and purposes of any other tax that is based on income),
the other which began at the beginning of the day after the Accounts Date, and
items of income, gain, deduction, loss or credit of the Acquired Companies for
the period shall be allocated between such two (2) Taxable years or periods on
a "closing of the books basis" by assuming that the books of the Acquired
Companies were closed at the close of the Accounts Date (which, for the
avoidance of doubt, shall be treated as the end of a Taxable year or period
for this purpose); provided, that exemptions, allowances or deductions that
are calculated on an annual basis, such as the deduction for depreciation, and
all other allocations for Taxes other than either income Taxes or Taxes that
are based on income (including premium taxes), shall be apportioned between
such two (2) Taxable years or periods on a daily basis based on the relative
number of days in each such two (2) Taxable years or periods.

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Buyer and Seller each
shall pay fifty percent (50%) of any real property transfer or real property
gains Tax, transfer Tax, sales Tax, use Tax, stamp Tax, stock transfer Tax, or
other similar Tax imposed on the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
other than the Seller's Transactions.

(e) In the event that, as a result of an IRS adjustment (following exhaustion
of administrative appeals), the Acquired Companies are required to treat any
Reinsurance Tax Items as (i) occurring on or prior to the Closing Date or (ii)
as a "built-in loss," in each case, for purposes of Section 382 of the Code,
Seller shall be liable for and pay, and shall indemnify and hold harmless the
Buyer Indemnified Parties from and against any increase in federal income Tax
payable by the Acquired Companies to the extent arising from adjustments in
respect of such Reinsurance Tax Items ("Reinsurance Tax Damages"). Reinsurance
Tax Damages shall be determined on a with and without basis with respect to
the transactions contemplated by the Specified Third-Party Reinsurance
Agreements, and shall be calculated on a present-value basis consistent with
the definition of After-Tax Basis. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, in no event shall Seller's liability for Reinsurance Tax Damages under
this Agreement exceed an amount equal to the excess of (A) the Buyer Agreed
Cap over (B) the Final Reinsurance Attribute Allowance, as finally determined.
For the avoidance of doubt, if the Specified Third-Party Reinsurance
Agreements are not executed, Seller shall have no liability under this Section
10.01(e), and this Section 10.01(e) shall have no further force or effect.

Section 10.02 Tax Returns.

(a) (%4) Seller shall timely file or cause to be timely filed when due (taking
into account all extensions properly obtained) (A) all Tax Returns that are
required to be filed by or with respect to an Acquired Company on a combined,
consolidated or unitary basis with Seller or any Affiliate thereof (other than
HLI or any Subsidiary) and (B) all other Tax Returns that are required to be
filed by or with respect to an Acquired Company (taking into account all
extensions properly obtained) on or prior to the Closing Date. Seller shall
remit or cause to be remitted any Taxes due in respect of the Tax Returns
described in clause (A), and the Acquired Company legally responsible for
filing a Tax Return described in clause (B) shall remit any Taxes due in
respect of such Tax Returns or reimburse Seller for amounts paid on its behalf
(without duplication of amounts paid as a Deemed Tax Liability). Buyer shall
timely file or cause to be timely filed when due (taking into account all
extensions properly obtained) all other Tax Returns that are required to be
filed by or with respect to HLI or any Subsidiary after the Closing Date that
relate to a period beginning before the Closing Date and Buyer shall remit or
cause to be remitted any Taxes due in respect of such Tax Returns.

(i) All Tax Returns that Buyer is required to file or cause to be filed in
accordance with this Section 10.02(a)(ii) or Seller is required to file or
cause to be filed in accordance with Section 10.02(a)(i) (but only to the
extent related to the Acquired Companies) that relate to any Taxable year or
period beginning before the Closing Date shall be prepared and filed in a
manner consistent with past practice and, on such Tax Returns, no position
shall be taken, election made or method adopted that is inconsistent with
positions taken, elections made or methods adopted in preparing and filing
similar Tax Returns in prior periods, except as required by applicable Law as
reasonably determined by Buyer with respect to the Tax Returns that it will be
filing or caused to be filed or Seller with respect to the Tax Returns that it
will be filing or cause to be filed, acting in good faith. With respect to any
such Tax Return to be filed by Buyer, not less than thirty (30) days prior to
the due date for such Tax Return, taking into account extensions (or, if such
due date is within thirty (30) days following the Closing Date, as promptly as
practicable following the Closing Date), Buyer shall provide Seller with a
draft copy of such Tax Return for Seller's approval (which approval shall not
be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed). If such draft reflects a
preparation not in conformity with past practice because Buyer has determined
in good faith that such past practice is not permitted by applicable Law, the
parties shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any disagreement. If the
parties cannot resolve such disagreement, the parties shall submit the matter
to an independent third party reasonably acceptable to both parties, shall
file such returns in accordance with the decision of such third party and
shall each bear one-half of any associated costs (such procedures, the "Tax
Dispute Mechanism").

(ii) With respect to any premium and any other material Tax Return that Seller
is required to file or cause to be filed in accordance with Section
10.02(a)(i) (other than the federal consolidated income Tax Return that
includes Seller) that reflects a Tax for which Buyer could be liable under
Section 10.01(b)(i), not less than thirty (30) days prior to the due date for
such Tax Return, taking into account extensions (or, if such due date is
within thirty (30) days following the Closing Date, as promptly as practicable
following the Closing Date), Seller shall provide Buyer, for Buyer's approval
(which approval shall not be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed), a
copy of such Tax Return (or portion thereof relevant solely to the Acquired
Companies) prepared in accordance with past practice of Seller, its Affiliates
and the Acquired Companies. Any disagreements regarding such Tax Return shall
be resolved pursuant to the Tax Dispute Mechanism, and Seller shall file or
cause to be filed such Tax Return as finally agreed to by the parties.

(iii) At least sixty (60) days prior to the due date (including extensions) of
any federal consolidated income Tax Return that includes Seller and that is
prepared with respect to Taxable years beginning on or after the Accounts Date
and on or prior to the Closing Date, the Acquired Companies shall prepare and
deliver to Seller a pro forma copy of such Tax Return prepared solely with
respect to the Acquired Companies, and a separate calculation illustrating the
calculation of the Deemed Tax Liability in respect of federal income Taxes for
the period covered by such Tax Return. Such pro forma Tax Return shall be
prepared in a manner consistent with past practices of Seller, its Affiliates
and the Acquired Companies, other than with respect to the calculation of the
Deemed Tax Liability. Any disagreements regarding such pro forma Tax Returns
and the associated calculation of Deemed Tax Liability shall be resolved
pursuant to the Tax Dispute Mechanism. Seller shall file or cause to be filed
any federal consolidated income Tax Returns governed by this Section
10.02(a)(iv) in accordance with the relevant pro forma Tax Returns as finally
agreed, to the extent related to the Acquired Companies.

(iv) At least sixty (60) days prior to the due date (including extensions) of
the federal consolidated income Tax Return of the Acquired Companies for the
taxable year or period that includes the "Closing" (as defined in the
Specified Third-Party Reinsurance Binder), the Acquired Companies shall
deliver a draft of the Final Reinsurance Terms Schedule setting forth the
actual aggregate amounts described therein with respect to the Specified
Third-Party Reinsurance Agreements along with any information reasonably
requested by Seller in reviewing the Final Reinsurance Terms Schedule. Any
disagreements regarding the Final Reinsurance Terms Schedule shall be resolved
pursuant to the Tax Dispute Mechanism, and such schedule, as finally resolved,
shall constitute the Final Reinsurance Terms Schedule. If the Specified Third-
Party Reinsurance Agreements are not consummated, the Acquired Companies shall
have no obligation to deliver the Final Reinsurance Terms Schedule.

(b) None of Buyer or any Affiliate of Buyer, except as required by applicable
Law as reasonably determined by Buyer acting in good faith, shall (or shall
cause or permit any Acquired Company to) make or change any Tax election,
amend, refile or otherwise modify (or grant an extension of any statute of
limitation with respect to) any Tax Return, or file any Tax Return for the
first time in a jurisdiction not previously filed in, or of a type not
previously filed, in each case, relating in whole or in part to HLI or any
Subsidiary with respect to any Taxable year or period beginning before the
Closing Date without the prior written consent of Seller, or take any other
action that would increase any Tax Liability or reduce any Tax benefit in
respect of any Taxable year or period beginning before the Closing Date. If
Buyer determines that it is required by applicable Law to take any such
actions, Buyer shall provide Seller prior notice of such determination. Unless
required by applicable Law or specifically permitted under this Agreement,
neither Seller nor any Affiliate of Seller shall amend any Tax Return relating
in whole or in part to HLI or any Subsidiary in a manner that could reasonably
be expected to increase the Tax liability or Deemed Tax Liability of HLI or
any Subsidiary for any Post-Accounts Date Taxable Period or take any other
action that would increase any Tax Liability or Deemed Tax Liability or reduce
any Tax benefit of HLI or any Subsidiary in respect of any Post-Accounts Date
Taxable Period without the prior written consent of Buyer. If Seller
determines that it is required by applicable Law to amend any such Tax Return,
Seller shall provide Buyer prior notice of such determination. Any resulting
disagreement between Buyer and Seller shall be resolved through the Tax
Dispute Mechanism. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, Buyer shall
cause any Acquired Company to relinquish any carry back of any net operating
loss, or any other attribute to any Taxable year or period (or portion
thereof) ending prior to the Closing Date.

(c) Each of Seller and Buyer shall reimburse the other within 10 days of
demand therefor for any Taxes for which it is liable under Section 10.01(a) or
(b) (as the case may be) but which are remitted with a Tax Return required to
be filed by the other party or its Affiliates under this Section 10.02.

Section 10.03 Contest Provisions. Buyer shall promptly notify Seller in
writing upon receipt by Buyer, any of its Affiliates or the Acquired Companies
of notice of any pending or threatened federal, state, local or foreign Tax
audits, examinations or assessments which might affect the Tax Liabilities for
which Seller may be liable pursuant to Section 10.01(a) or Section 10.01(e).
Seller shall have the right to represent each Acquired Company's interests in
any Tax audit or administrative or court proceeding relating to Taxable
periods ending on or before the Closing Date or otherwise relating to Taxes
for which Seller may be liable pursuant to Section 10.01(a) or Section
10.01(e), and to employ counsel of its choice at its expense; provided, that
Buyer shall have the right to participate in any such proceeding with respect
to Taxes imposed solely on the Acquired Companies that are not imposed or
calculated on a combined, consolidated or unitary basis with Seller or any
Affiliate of Seller; and provided, further, that neither Seller nor any of its
Affiliates may settle any such Tax claim that could reasonably be expected to
affect the amount of Taxes for which the Acquired Companies are liable after
the Closing Date without the written consent of Buyer, which consent may be
withheld in the reasonable discretion of Buyer. In the case of a Taxable
period beginning before and ending after the Closing Date, Seller shall be
entitled to participate at its expense in any Tax audit or administrative or
court proceeding relating (in whole or in part) to Taxes attributable to the
portion of such period ending on or before the Closing Date. None of Buyer,
any of its Affiliates or any Acquired Company may settle any Tax claim for any
Taxes for which Seller may be liable pursuant to Section 10.01(a) or Section
10.01(e), without the prior written consent of Seller, which consent may be
withheld in the reasonable discretion of Seller.

Section 10.04 Assistance and Cooperation. On and after the Closing Date, each
of Seller and Buyer shall (and shall cause their respective Affiliates to):

(a) assist the other party in preparing any Tax Returns which such other party
is responsible for preparing and filing in accordance with Section 10.02;

(b) cooperate fully in preparing for any audits of, or disputes with Tax
authorities regarding, any Tax Returns of the Acquired Companies;

(c) make available to the other and to any Tax Authority as reasonably
requested all information, records and documents relating to Taxes of the
Acquired Companies;

(d) provide timely notice to the other in writing of any pending or threatened
Tax audits or assessments of the Acquired Companies for Taxable periods for
which the other may have a Liability under Section 10.01;

(e) furnish the other with copies of all correspondence received from any Tax
Authority in connection with any Tax audit or information request with respect
to any such Taxable period;

(f) timely sign and deliver such certificates or forms as may be necessary or
appropriate to establish an exemption from (or otherwise reduce), or file Tax
Returns or other reports with respect to, Taxes described in Section 10.01(d)
(relating to sales, transfer and similar Taxes); and

(g) timely provide to the other powers of attorney or similar authorizations
necessary to carry out the purposes of this Article X.

Section 10.05 Tax Sharing Payments.

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, as of the date
hereof, (i) Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates (including the
Acquired Companies) to, take such actions as may be necessary to terminate all
contracts and agreements between the Acquired Companies, on the one hand, and
Seller or any Affiliate of Seller (other than the Acquired Companies), on the
other hand, relating to Tax allocation, sharing or paying agreements
(including the Tax Sharing Agreement), and none of Seller or its Affiliates
shall have any continuing obligation to the Acquired Companies (or vice versa)
under the Tax Sharing Agreement after the date hereof (other than any such
obligations pursuant to this Agreement). Such termination shall be effective
as of the Accounts Date.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, and
notwithstanding the termination of the Tax Sharing Agreement, as of the date
hereof, each of Seller, HFSG and the Acquired Companies shall make such
payments as would have been required with respect to any period from the
Accounts Date to and including the Closing Date with respect to the Acquired
Companies as if the terms of the Tax Sharing Agreement were continued in
accordance with past practice except that:

(i) with respect to the federal Taxable year of the Acquired Companies ending
on December 31, 2016, Seller and the Acquired Companies have made or will make
the payments set forth on Schedule 10.05(b)(i) after the Accounts Date;

(ii) with respect to Taxable years or periods beginning after the Accounts
Date, payments in respect of federal income Taxes shall be determined in
accordance with the definition of Deemed Tax Liability, but determined without
regard to the clause (c) of the definition thereof, taking into account
payments made under the Tax Sharing Agreement for such periods prior to the
date hereof and the payments set forth on Schedule 10.05(b)(i) (which the
parties acknowledge and agree were not made in accordance with the definition
of Deemed Tax Liability);

(iii) any payments required to be made by an Acquired Company shall be made
without reduction for any payment required to be made to such Acquired
Company;

(iv) no payments shall be made to an Acquired Company by Seller or its
Affiliates (other than the Acquired Companies);

(v) in the event and to the extent an Acquired Company recognizes a Tax
Attribute for a period between the Accounts Date and the Closing Date taken
into account in determining Deemed Tax Liability, Deemed Tax Liability shall
be calculated as if such amount of such Tax Attribute can be carried over or
back to other periods for which Deemed Tax Liability is calculated and paid
pursuant to this Section 10.05; and

(vi) following the finalization of any pro forma Tax Return pursuant to
Section 10.02(a)(iv), Seller or the Acquired Companies, as the case may be,
taking into account payments listed on Schedule 10.05(b)(i) as appropriate,
shall pay such amounts so that the total amount paid with respect to the
Taxable year or period covered by such Tax Return pursuant to this Section
10.05 is consistent with the calculations set forth on such pro forma Tax
Return and the related calculation of Deemed Tax Liability. For the avoidance
of doubt, (A) any reduction in Deemed Tax Liability pursuant to clause (c)
shall be taken into account only once, and shall be reflected in the payments
made under this Section 10.05(b)(vi) with respect to the taxable year or
period of Seller that includes the Closing Date and (B) the provisions of
Section 10.05(b) shall be interpreted so that the total net amount borne by
the Acquired Companies between the Accounts Date and the Closing Date in
respect of federal income Taxes is equal to the amount described in clause (b)
of the definition of "Deemed Tax Liability" for such period.

(vii) Schedule 10.05(b)(vii) sets forth Seller's good faith calculations of
the payments to be made under this Section 10.05(b) (other than following the
finalization of the pro forma Tax Return pursuant to clause (vi)).

(c) On or prior to the Closing, Seller, its Affiliates, and the Acquired
Companies shall make the payments set forth on Schedule 10.05(c) (such
payments, the "Closing True-Up Payments"). At least ten (10) Business Days
prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall deliver to Buyer Schedule 10.05(c),
which shall set forth Seller's determination of certain payments required to
be made among Seller, its Affiliates and the Acquired Companies in respect of
Tax Attributes and other Tax matters. In no event will the Acquired Companies
be required to make a net positive Closing True-Up Payment to Seller and its
Affiliates.

(d) Reinsurance Attribute Payments.

(i) Ten (10) days prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall deliver to Buyer a
copy of the Estimated Reinsurance Terms Schedule setting forth Seller's good
faith estimate as of such date of the aggregate amounts described therein with
respect to the Specified Third-Party Reinsurance Agreements. Absent
notification by Buyer of any manifest error in such schedule within one (1)
Business Day of such delivery, the Estimated Reinsurance Terms Schedule shall
be final as prepared and delivered by Seller.

(ii) At least one (1) day prior to the Closing, Seller shall be obligated to
pay to HLI, and HLI shall be obligated to pay to HLIC, the Estimated
Reinsurance Attribute Allowance, if any. In satisfaction of Seller's and HLI's
obligations under this Section 10.05(d)(ii), Seller shall pay such amounts
directly to HLIC in satisfaction of Seller's and HLI's obligations hereunder.

(iii) Following the finalization of the Final Reinsurance Terms Schedule
pursuant to Section 10.02(a)(iv), (A) if the Reinsurance Attribute True-Up is
positive, then Seller shall pay such amount to HLIC and (B) if the Reinsurance
Attribute True-Up is negative, then HLIC shall pay the absolute value of such
amount to Seller. If the Reinsurance Attribute True-Up is zero, then neither
Seller nor HLIC shall be required to make a payment to the other with respect
to the Reinsurance Attribute True-Up.

(iv) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the Specified Third-
Party Reinsurance Agreements are not consummated following the Closing, the
provisions of Section 10.05(d)(iii) shall not apply and HLIC shall promptly
return to Seller any amount of Estimated Reinsurance Attribute Allowance paid
pursuant to clause (ii).

Section 10.06 Other Tax Matters.

(a) Except for Taxes that arise from or are attributable to any inaccuracy in
or breach of any representation or warranty made in Section 5.14 or Section
5.24 (which shall be governed by Article XIII), the indemnification provided
for in this Article X shall be the sole remedy for any claim in respect of
Taxes and the provisions of Article XIII shall not apply to such claims,
except as expressly provided. For the avoidance of doubt, Losses (other than
Taxes) arising out of a breach of the Tax-Related Representations shall be
recoverable pursuant to the provisions of Article XIII, subject to any limits
therein. Indemnification provided for in this Article X shall be calculated on
an After-Tax Basis.

(b) Any claim for indemnity under this Article X may only be made at a time
prior to sixty (60) days after the expiration of the applicable Tax statute of
limitations with respect to the relevant Taxable period (including all periods
of extension, whether automatic or permissive).

(c) The parties shall treat any indemnification payment made under this
Agreement as an adjustment to the Purchase Price.

(d) Following the Closing, Buyer shall not permit any Acquired Company to
claim any minimum tax credit, within the meaning of Section 53 of the Code,
against federal or state income Tax, which credit arose with respect to
Taxable years or periods (or portions thereof) ending prior to the Closing
Date during which the Acquired Companies were affiliated with Seller, within
the meaning of Section 1504(a) of the Code, determined without regard to the
restrictions under Section 1504(b) of the Code.

(e) The parties acknowledge and agree that as a result of the Section
338(h)(10) Elections, HLI is treated for federal income tax purposes as if it
sold the capital stock of HLIC in a transaction to which the provisions of
Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-36 may apply. Seller covenants that as of
the Closing Date, HLI and its Subsidiaries will have Category B attributes of
at least $596 million and immediately prior to the Closing Date such
attributes will not be subject to any limitation as the result of any
"ownership change" within the meaning of Section 382(g). To the extent
necessary to avoid (i) a reduction pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section
1.1502-36(d)(2) in the Category B attributes of HLI and its Subsidiaries below
an aggregate amount of $596 million and (ii) any reduction pursuant to
Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-36(d)(2) in the Category D attributes of
HLI and its Subsidiaries, Seller shall make, or cause to be made, an election
pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-36(d)(6)(i)(A) to reduce HLI's
basis in the capital stock of HLIC; provided, that the parties acknowledge and
agree that Seller or its Affiliates may elect under Treasury Regulation
Section 1.1502-36(d)(6)(i)(B) or (C) to reattribute Category B attributes from
the Acquired Companies so long as the conditions of clause (i) are met. Seller
shall be permitted, in its discretion, to make any amendment to such filing so
long as the conditions set forth in the prior sentence are still met after
such amended election is made. Upon finalizing or the subsequent amendment of
such filing, Seller shall provide Buyer with sufficient information to
determine the remaining amount of Category B attributes of the Acquired
Companies and any other information reasonably required by the Acquired
Companies in respect of the stock basis of the Acquired Companies, and Buyer
agrees to file Tax Returns in respect of the Acquired Companies in conformity
therewith. Seller agrees that, notwithstanding any other provision of this
Section 10.06(e), it shall not pursuant to any election (or failure to make an
election) under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-36 cause the unamortized
specified policy acquisition expenses (for purposes of Section 848 of the
Code) of or attributed to ILA to be reduced.

(f) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the transactions
contemplated by the Specified Third-Party Reinsurance Agreements constitute a
"mere reinsurance agreement" occurring after the Closing Date, and not as an
applicable asset acquisition (within the meaning of Section 1060 of the Code)
(the "Reinsurance Tax Treatment"). Buyer and Seller shall cause all Tax
Returns to be filed in a manner consistent with the Reinsurance Tax Treatment
unless required to adopt a different treatment pursuant to a final
determination as defined in Section 1313 of the Code.

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in no event shall Seller
or any of its Affiliates be required to make any payment in respect of
Reinsurance Tax Damages and Final Reinsurance Attribute Allowance to the
extent the aggregate of such payments would exceed the Buyer Agreed Cap.

Section 10.07 Section 338(h)(10) Elections.

(a) Seller and Buyer shall make a joint election for HLI, but no other
Acquired Company, under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code and the corresponding
provisions of Tax Law in the states set forth in Schedule 10.07(a) with
respect to the purchase of the Shares (collectively, the "Section 338(h)(10)
Elections"). Seller and Buyer shall each deliver completed and executed copies
of IRS Form 8023, required schedules thereto, and any similar state and
foreign forms at the Closing in accordance with Sections 3.03(d) and 3.04(j).
If any changes are required in these forms as a result of information which is
first available after these forms are prepared, the parties will promptly make
such changes.

(b) Buyer and Seller acknowledge and agree that the amount of the ADSP (as
such term is defined in Treasury Regulation § 1.338-4) allocated to the
capital stock of HLIC shall be equal to (i) the Purchase Price, plus, (ii) the
Rollover Amount, plus (iii) any liabilities of HLI the deemed assumption of
which, as a result of the Section 338(h)(10) Elections, constitute
consideration for Tax purposes, including without limitation the HLI Notes
Payoff Amount, minus, (iv) the fair market value of any Acquired Assets (as
determined pursuant to Section 2.06) transferred to Buyer or HLI (and not to
HLIC) pursuant to Section 2.01, if any. The amount ADSP allocated to any
Acquired Assets transferred to Buyer or HLI pursuant to Section 2.01 shall
equal the fair market value of such Acquired Assets (as determined pursuant to
Section 2.06).

(c) Each of Buyer and Seller agrees that neither it nor any of its Affiliates
shall (i) file any federal, state, local and foreign Tax Returns in a manner
that is inconsistent with Section 10.07(b), or (ii) take, or fail to take, any
action to the extent such action or failure to act, as the case may be, is
inconsistent with or would otherwise prejudice any of the Section 338(h)(10)
Elections.

(d) Buyer Parent and Buyer Parent GP shall cause Buyer to remain in existence
and classified as a corporation for federal income tax purposes for two (2)
years following the Closing Date unless Buyer Parent obtains written consent
from Seller to the contrary, which consent may be withheld in Seller's sole
discretion

(e) From the date hereof through the Closing Date, Seller, Buyer Parent, and
Buyer Parent GP shall use reasonable best efforts to identify and implement
an ownership structure or other arrangement for Buyer Parent and Buyer Parent
GP mutually satisfactory to all parties, such that, with respect to
distributions or other payments made by Buyer Parent in respect of its equity
interests that constitute a dividend for federal income tax purposes, (i)
Buyer Parent is not required to withhold amounts from such payments under
Sections 1441 and 1442, or 1471 through 1474 of the Code or (ii) a foreign
person has assumed responsibility for withholding on such payments.

agree to extend the Outside Date to January 3, 2019 and to continue to use

during any such period of extension; provided, further, the right to terminate
this Agreement under this Section 12.01(b) shall not be available to any party

obligations under this Agreement shall have been the cause of, or shall have
resulted in, the failure of the Closing to occur prior to such date;

Material Adverse Effect or breach within sixty (60) days after receipt of
written notice thereof from Buyer requesting such breach to be cured;

(e) by Seller in the event of a breach by Buyer of any of Buyer's covenants,

(f) by Buyer in accordance with Section 7.09; or

(g) by Seller if (i) the conditions set forth in Section 11.02 (other than

being agreed that any conditions that are not so satisfied due to a breach by
Buyer, Buyer Parent or Buyer Parent GP of any representation, warranty or
covenant contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to be satisfied for
purposes of this clause (g)), (ii) Buyer fails to consummate the transactions

hereby; provided, that nothing in this Section 12.03 shall relieve (i) Buyer
from any liability or obligation in respect of the Termination Fee or Recovery
Costs pursuant to Section 12.04, if applicable, or from any liability or
obligation pursuant to Section 7.03(d), Section 7.14 or Section 8.17(e), (ii)
the parties to the Limited Guarantees of their obligations thereunder in
connection with payment of any obligations of Buyer referred to in the

or this Article XII or (iv) Seller from any Losses resulting from Buyer's
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Sections 12.01(b) or (d) resulting
from Seller's fraud or any willful breach by Seller of this Agreement or
willful failure by Seller to perform its obligations under this Agreement;
provided, that in no event shall Seller's liability under this clause (iv)
exceed $114,420,000.

Section 12.04 Termination Fee.

(a) (%4) If an Applicable Termination occurs, Buyer shall pay to Seller a non-
refundable termination fee of $114,420,000 in cash by wire transfer of same-
day funds (the "Termination Fee") within two Business Days following such
termination. In no event shall Buyer be required to pay the Termination Fee on
more than one occasion, whether or not the Termination Fee may be payable
pursuant to more than one provision of this Agreement at the same or at
different times and upon the occurrence of different events. If Buyer fails to
timely pay all or any portion of the amount due pursuant to this Section
12.04, and, in order to obtain such payment, Seller commences a suit against
Buyer and obtains a final judgment in Seller's favor, then Buyer shall
promptly pay to Seller its reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable
fees and expenses of attorneys, experts and consultants), and interest on the
unpaid amount from the date such payment was required to be made until the
date of payment at the Interest Rate (collectively, the "Recovery Costs"). If,
in order to obtain such payment, Seller commences an Action against Buyer and
does not obtain a final judgment in Seller's favor, then Seller shall promptly
pay to Buyer an amount equal to Buyer's reasonable costs and expenses
(including reasonable fees and expenses of attorneys, experts and consultants)
relating to the defense of such Action, and interest on the unpaid amount from
the date Buyer's costs and expenses were incurred until the date of payment at
the Interest Rate.

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, except for any
liability or obligation pursuant to Section 7.03(d), Section 7.14 or Section
8.17(e) (the "Retained Claims"), if the Termination Fee becomes payable in
accordance with Section 12.04(a)(i), Buyer's payment of the Termination Fee
and any Recovery Costs to Seller when required shall be deemed to be
liquidated damages and Seller, its Affiliates' and their respective
Representatives' sole and exclusive remedy for any and all Losses suffered or
incurred by Seller, Seller's Affiliates and their respective Representatives
in connection with this Agreement, the Commitment Letters (and the termination
thereof), the Limited Guarantees, the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby (and the abandonment or termination thereof) or any matter forming the
basis for such termination, and after Buyer's payment of the Termination Fee
and any Recovery Costs to Seller none of Seller, Seller's Affiliates or their
respective Representatives shall be entitled to seek or obtain any monetary
damages of any kinds, including consequential, special, indirect or punitive
damages, in excess of the Termination Fee and any Recovery Costs or bring or
maintain any claim, action or proceeding against Buyer, Buyer's Affiliates,
the Investors (including the parties to the Limited Guarantees) or any of
their respective Representatives arising out of or in connection with this
Agreement, the Commitment Letters, the Limited Guarantees or any other
document executed in connection herewith or therewith, any of the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby (or the abandonment or termination thereof) or
any matters forming the basis for such termination, in each case other than
the Retained Claims. If the Termination Fee becomes payable in accordance with
Section 12.04(a)(i), upon payment of the Termination Fee and any Recovery
Costs, none of Buyer, Buyer's Affiliates, the Investors (including the parties
to the Limited Guarantees), or any of their respective Representatives shall
have any further Liability or obligation arising out of or in connection with
this Agreement, the Commitment Letters, the Limited Guarantees or any other
document executed in connection herewith or therewith, any of the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby (or the abandonment or termination thereof) or
any matters forming the basis for such termination, except that Buyer, Buyer
Parent, Buyer Parent GP and the Guarantors shall remain liable with respect to
the Retained Claims. If the Termination Fee becomes payable in accordance with
Section 12.04(a)(i), except for the Retained Claims, Seller shall cause any
claim, action or proceeding described in the foregoing sentence to be
dismissed with prejudice promptly, and in any event within five (5) Business
Days, after receipt of the Termination Fee and any Recovery Costs. Except for
the Retained Claims, (A) from and after termination of this Agreement under no
circumstances will Seller be entitled to monetary damages in excess of the
amount of the Termination Fee and any Recovery Costs and (B) while Seller may
pursue both a grant of specific performance in accordance with Section 14.14
and the payment of the Termination Fee and any Recovery Costs under Section
12.04, under no circumstances shall Seller be permitted or entitled to receive
both (x) a grant of specific performance to cause consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby following which the Closing occurs in
accordance with this Agreement and (y) any portion of the Termination Fee.

(ii) If this Agreement is terminated in accordance with Section 12.01, under
no circumstances will the aggregate monetary damages payable to Seller or
Seller's Affiliates by Buyer, Buyer Parent, Buyer Parent GP or any of their
Affiliates for breaches under this Agreement, the Commitment Letters, the
Limited Guarantees or any other document executed in connection herewith or
therewith, any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (or the
abandonment or termination thereof) or any matters forming the basis for such
termination exceed an amount equal to the Termination Fee plus the Recovery
Costs plus the Retained Claims in the aggregate for all such breaches. Subject
to and without limiting or affecting Seller's rights under the Limited
Guarantees, if this Agreement is terminated in accordance with Section 12.01,
in no event will any Buyer Related Party other than Buyer, Buyer Parent and
Buyer Parent GP have any monetary liability to Seller or Seller's Affiliates,
and in no event will Seller or Seller's Affiliates seek or obtain (or permit
any of their Representatives to seek or obtain) any monetary recovery or
monetary award against any Buyer Related Party other than Buyer, Buyer Parent
and Buyer Parent GP, with respect to this Agreement, any other document
executed in connection herewith, or any of the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby (including any breach by Buyer, Buyer Parent or Buyer Parent
GP), the termination of this Agreement, the failure to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or any claims or actions under
applicable Laws arising out of any such breach, termination or failure).
"Buyer Related Party" means Buyer, Buyer Parent, Buyer Parent GP and their
respective current or future equityholders, controlling persons, directors,
officers, employees, general or limited partners, members, managers,
Affiliates, representatives and agents.

(b) Seller, on the one hand, and Buyer, Buyer Parent and Buyer Parent GP, on
the other hand, acknowledge and agree that the agreements contained in this
Section 12.04 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, that the Termination Fee and the Recovery Costs represent
liquidated damages in a reasonable amount and not a penalty and that, without
these agreements, neither Seller nor Buyer would have entered into this
Agreement.

Section 12.05 Extension; Waiver. At any time prior to the Closing, each of
Seller and Buyer may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or other acts of the other party, (b) waive any inaccuracies in
the representations and warranties of the other party contained in this
Agreement or in any certificate, instrument, schedule or other document
delivered pursuant to this Agreement or (c) waive compliance by the other
party with any of the agreements or conditions contained in this Agreement.
Any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument
in writing signed by the party granting such extension or waiver.

ARTICLE XIII 
INDEMNIFICATION

Section 13.01 Indemnification by Seller.

(a) After the Closing and subject to the other provisions of this Article XIII
and Section 14.01, and without duplication of amounts for which
indemnification is provided by Seller under Article X, Seller shall indemnify
and hold harmless Buyer and its Affiliates (including the Acquired Companies),
Representatives, successors and permitted assigns (collectively, the "Buyer
Indemnified Parties") against all Losses suffered or incurred by any Buyer
Indemnified Party, or to which any Buyer Indemnified Party otherwise becomes

(i) the inaccuracy or breach of any representation or warranty made by Seller
in Article IV or Article V of this Agreement or the certificate delivered by
Seller pursuant to Section 11.02(a);

(ii) any breach or failure by Seller or HFSG to perform any of its covenants
or obligations contained in this Agreement (other than the covenant set forth

(b) Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary other than Section
10.01(a), Seller shall not be required to indemnify or hold harmless any Buyer
Indemnified Party against any Losses pursuant to Section 13.01(a)(i) (other
than Losses to the extent arising as a result of the inaccuracy or breach of
any representation or warranty made by Seller in Section 4.01, Section 5.01(a)
and (b), Section 5.02 and Section 5.29, as to which the limitations in this
sentence shall not apply) (i) with respect to any claim (or series of related
claims arising from substantially the same underlying facts, events or
circumstances) unless such claim (or series of related claims arising from
substantially the same underlying facts, events or circumstances) involves
Losses in excess of $50,000 (nor shall any such claim or series of related
claims that does not meet the $50,000 threshold be applied to or considered
for purposes of calculating the aggregate amount of the Buyer Indemnified
Parties' Losses for which Seller has responsibility under clause (ii) below)
and (ii) until the aggregate amount of the Buyer Indemnified Parties' Losses
exceeds $39,375,000, after which Seller shall, subject to the immediately
succeeding sentence, be obligated to indemnify and hold harmless the Buyer
Indemnified Parties against all Losses of the Buyer Indemnified Parties that
in the aggregate are in excess of such amount. The cumulative aggregate
liability of Seller under Section 13.01(a)(i) shall in no event exceed
$315,000,000 (other than in respect of Losses to the extent arising as a
result of the inaccuracy or breach of any representation or warranty made by
Seller in Section 4.01, Sections 5.01(a) and (b), Section 5.02 and Section
5.29, in which case, Seller's aggregate liability shall not exceed the Base
Amount).

Section 13.02 Indemnification by Buyer.

(a) After the Closing and subject to the other provisions of this Article XIII
and Section 14.01, and without duplication of amounts for which
indemnification is provided by Buyer under Article X, Buyer shall, or shall
cause the Acquired Companies (together with Buyer, the "Buyer Indemnifying
Parties") to, indemnify and hold harmless Seller and its Affiliates (but not
the Acquired Companies), Representatives, successors and permitted assigns
(collectively, the "Seller Indemnified Parties") against all Losses suffered
or incurred by any Seller Indemnified Party, or to which any Seller
Indemnified Party otherwise becomes subject, as a result of or in connection
with:

(i) the inaccuracy or breach of any representation or warranty made by Buyer
in Article VI of this Agreement or the certificate delivered by Buyer pursuant
to Section 11.01(a);

(ii) any breach or failure by Buyer to perform any of its covenants or
obligations contained in this Agreement; or

(iii) any Assumed Liabilities.

(b) Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary, the Buyer

Seller Indemnified Party against any Losses pursuant to Section 13.02(a)(i)
(other than Losses arising solely as a result of the inaccuracy or breach of
any representation or warranty made by Buyer in Section 6.01, Section 6.08 or
Section 6.10, as to which the limitations in this sentence shall not apply)
(i) with respect to any claim (or series of related claims arising from
substantially the same underlying facts, events or circumstances), unless such
claim (or series of related claims arising from substantially the same
underlying facts, events or circumstances) involves Losses in excess of
$50,000 (nor shall any such claim or series of related claims that does not
meet the $50,000 threshold be applied to or considered for purposes of
calculating the aggregate amount of the Seller Indemnified Parties' Losses for
which Buyer has responsibility under clause (ii) below) and (ii) until the
aggregate amount of the Seller Indemnified Parties' Losses exceeds
$39,375,000, after which the Buyer Indemnifying Parties shall, subject to the
immediately succeeding sentence, be obligated to indemnify and hold harmless
the Seller Indemnified Parties against all Losses of the Seller Indemnified
Parties that, in the aggregate, are in excess of such amount. The cumulative
aggregate liability of the Buyer Indemnifying Parties under Section
13.02(a)(i) shall in no event exceed $315,000,000 (other than in respect of
Losses arising solely as a result of the inaccuracy or breach of any
representation or warranty made by Buyer in Sections 6.01 or 6.08, in which
case, Buyer's aggregate liability shall not exceed the Base Amount).

Section 13.03 Notification of Claims.

(a) A Person who may be entitled to be indemnified and held harmless under
Section 13.01 or Section 13.02 (the "Indemnified Party"), shall promptly
notify Buyer or Seller, as applicable (the "Indemnifying Party") in writing of
any pending or threatened claim or demand by a third party that the
Indemnified Party has determined has given or could reasonably give rise to
such a right under this Agreement (including a pending or threatened claim or
demand asserted by a third party against the Indemnified Party, such claim
being a "Third-Party Claim"), describing in reasonable detail the facts and
circumstances with respect to the subject matter of such claim or demand and,
if applicable, the specific representation, warranty or provision of this
Agreement that the Indemnified Party alleges to be breached; provided, that
the failure to provide such notice shall not release the Indemnifying Party
from any of its obligations under this Article XIII except to the extent the
Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced by such failure, it being understood
that notices for claims in respect of a breach of a representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement must be delivered prior to the expiration of any
applicable survival period specified in Section 14.01 for such representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement. Following delivery of a notice of a Third-
Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall deliver to the Indemnifying Party,
promptly (and in any event within ten (10) Business Days) after the
Indemnified Party's receipt thereof, copies of all notices and documents
(including court papers) received by the Indemnified Party relating to such
Third-Party Claim.

(b) Following receipt of a notice of a Third-Party Claim from an Indemnified
Party pursuant to Section 13.03(a), the Indemnifying Party may assume the
defense and control of such Third-Party Claim by delivery of written notice to
the Indemnified Party within sixty (60) days after receipt of the Indemnified
Party's claims notice pursuant to Section 13.03(a); provided, that the
Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to assume or maintain control of the
defense of any Third-Party Claim and shall pay the reasonable fees, costs and
expenses of counsel retained by the Indemnified Party to the extent (i) the
Third-Party Claim relates to or arises in connection with any criminal
proceeding, action, indictment, allegation or investigation against the
Indemnified Party or (ii) the Third-Party Claim would reasonably be expected
to result in an injunction or equitable relief against the Indemnified Party
that would, in each case, have a material effect on the operation of the
business of such Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates. The assumption of
the defense by the Indemnifying Party of any Third-Party Claim shall not
require the Indemnifying Party to agree to be liable for any Losses in respect
of such Third-Party Claim and shall be without prejudice to any rights or
defenses of the Indemnifying Party in respect of whether the Indemnified Party
is entitled to indemnification under this Article XIII for any particular Loss
or Losses.

(c) The Indemnified Party may take any actions reasonably necessary to defend
such Third-Party Claim prior to the time that it receives a notice from the
Indemnifying Party as contemplated by Section 13.03(b). If the Indemnifying
Party assumes the defense of any Third-Party Claim in accordance with Section
13.03(b), the Indemnifying Party shall allow the Indemnified Party a
reasonable opportunity to participate in the defense of such Third-Party Claim
with its own counsel and at its own expense; provided, however, that
notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnifying Party shall bear the
reasonable fees, costs and expenses of one (1) such separate counsel if (i)
the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party are both named parties to the
Action and the Indemnified Party shall have reasonably determined in good
faith that the representation of both parties by the same counsel would be
inappropriate due to actual differing interests between them or that there may
be defenses or counterclaims available to the Indemnified Party that are
inconsistent with those available to the Indemnified Party or (ii) the
Indemnifying Party shall have authorized the Indemnified Party to employ
separate counsel at the Indemnifying Party's expense. If the Indemnifying
Party assumes the defense of any Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party
shall not, for so long as it diligently conducts such defense, be liable to
the Indemnified Party for legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the
Indemnified Party in connection with the defense thereof other than provided
in this Section 13.03(c). The Indemnifying Party shall be liable for the
reasonable fees, costs and expenses of counsel employed by the Indemnified
Party for any period during which Indemnifying Party has not assumed or is not
diligently conducting the defense of a Third-Party Claim for which the
Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification hereunder. Seller or Buyer,
as the case may be, shall, and shall cause each of its Affiliates and
Representatives to, reasonably cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in the
defense of any Third-Party Claim. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, from and after the delivery of a notice of a claim for
indemnification with respect to a Third-Party Claim, at the reasonable request
of the Indemnifying Party, each Indemnified Party shall grant the Indemnifying
Party and its Representatives reasonable access, during normal business hours,
to the books, records, personnel and properties of the Indemnified Party to
the extent reasonably related to such Third-Party Claim, at no cost to the
Indemnifying Party (other than for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of the
Indemnified Parties). The Indemnifying Party shall be authorized to consent to
a settlement of, or the entry of any judgment arising from, any Third-Party
Claim, without the consent of any Indemnified Party; provided, that (A) such
settlement provides only for the payment of monetary damages (and does not
impose any injunctive relief or otherwise impose any conditions or
restrictions on the applicable Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates or
Representatives) and does not involve any finding or admission of any
violation of Law or admission of any wrongdoing or any violation of the rights
of any Person and does not include a statement or admission of fault,
culpability or failure to act by or on the part of any Indemnified Party or
any of its Affiliates or Representatives, (B) the Indemnifying Party pays or
causes to be paid all amounts arising out of such settlement or judgment
concurrently with the effectiveness of such settlement or judgment (other than
as contemplated by Section 13.01(b) or Section 13.02(b)), and (C) the
Indemnifying Party obtains, as a condition of any settlement, entry of
judgment or other resolution, a complete and unconditional release of each
Indemnified Party from any and all Liabilities in respect of such Third-Party
Claim. If the Indemnifying Party elects not to defend the Indemnified Party
against a Third-Party Claim to which it is entitled to indemnification
hereunder, whether by not giving the Indemnified Party timely notice of its
desire to so defend or otherwise, then the Indemnified Party shall have the
right but not the obligation to assume its own defense, but without in any way
waiving or otherwise affecting the Indemnified Party's rights to
indemnification pursuant to this Agreement, and the Indemnifying Party shall
bear all fees, costs and expenses of one such counsel engaged by the
Indemnified Party for Third-Party Claims for which such Indemnified Party was
entitled to indemnification hereunder.

(d) No Indemnifying Party shall have any liability under this Article XIII for
any Losses arising out of or in connection with any Third-Party Claim that is
settled or compromised by an Indemnified Party without the prior consent of
such Indemnifying Party (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed).

(e) If an Indemnified Party wishes to make a claim under this Article XIII
that does not involve a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall give
written notice to the Indemnifying Party setting forth (i) a reasonably
detailed description of the claim, (ii) a good faith estimate of the amount of
the claim (to the extent ascertainable) and (iii) the specific representation,
warranty or provision of this Agreement that the Indemnified Party alleges to
be breached, and such notice shall be accompanied by copies of all available
documentation that may be necessary or appropriate for the purposes of
enabling the Indemnifying Party to be informed and to take any and all
appropriate decisions and actions in respect of the matter and Loss that is
the subject of the claim; provided, that the failure to provide such notice on
a timely basis shall not release the Indemnifying Party from any of its
obligations under this Article XIII except to the extent the Indemnifying
Party is actually prejudiced by such failure, it being understood that notices
for claims in respect of a breach of a representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement must be delivered prior to the expiration of any applicable survival
period specified in Section 14.01 for such representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement.

(f) If there shall be any conflict between the provisions of this Section
13.03 and Section 10.03 (relating to Tax contests), the provisions of Section
10.03 shall control with respect to Tax contests.

Section 13.04 Payment. In the event an Action under this Article XIII shall
have been finally determined, the amount of such final determination shall be
paid to the Indemnified Party on demand in immediately available funds. An
Action, and the liability for and amount of damages therefor, shall be deemed
to be "finally determined" for purposes of this Article XIII when the parties
to such Action have so determined by mutual agreement or, if disputed, when a
final nonappealable Governmental Order shall have been entered.

Section 13.05 No Duplication; Exclusive Remedies.

(a) Any liability for indemnification hereunder and under any other
Transaction Agreement shall be determined without duplication of recovery by
reason of the same Loss.

(b) Prior to the Closing, other than in the case of fraud or willful breach by
Seller or any of its Affiliates, the sole and exclusive remedy of Buyer for
any breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty contained in this
Agreement or any certificate or instrument delivered hereunder shall be
refusal to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Transaction
Agreements and termination of this Agreement in accordance with Section 12.01.

(c) Following the Closing, other than in the case of fraud or intentional
misconduct by Buyer or Seller or any of their respective Affiliates, and
except for breaches or non-performance of provisions in this Agreement for
which the remedy of specific performance is available pursuant to Section
14.14, the indemnification provisions of Article XIII and, with respect to
Taxes, Article X, shall be the sole and exclusive remedies of Seller and
Buyer, respectively, for any breach of or inaccuracy in any representations or
warranties in this Agreement and any breach or failure to perform or comply
with any of the covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement. In
furtherance of the foregoing, each of Buyer, on behalf of itself and each
other Buyer Indemnified Party, and Seller, on behalf of itself and each other
Seller Indemnified Party, hereby waives, from and after the Closing, to the
fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, any and all rights, claims and
causes of action (other than claims of, or causes of action arising from,
fraud or intentional misconduct) it may have against Seller or any of its
Affiliates or Representatives and Buyer or any of its Affiliates or
Representatives, as the case may be, arising under or based upon this
Agreement, any certificate or instrument delivered in connection herewith
(whether under this Agreement or arising under common Law or any other
applicable Law), except pursuant to: (i) the indemnification provisions set
forth in this Article XIII or (ii) as provided under (A) the provisions of
Section 2.03, (B) the provisions of Article X, (C) the provisions hereof
providing for equitable remedies or (D) the provisions of any other
Transaction Agreement.

Section 13.06 Additional Indemnification Provisions.

(a) With respect to each indemnification obligation in this Agreement (i) each
such obligation shall be calculated on an After-Tax Basis and (ii) all Losses
shall be net of any actual non-refundable recoveries to the Indemnified Party
described in Section 13.06(b).

(b) In any case where an Indemnified Party recovers from a third Person not
affiliated with such Indemnified Party, including any third-party insurer, but
excluding any recoveries from the Specified Third-Party Reinsurer pursuant to
the Specified Third-Party Reinsurance Agreements, any amount in respect of any
Loss paid by an Indemnifying Party pursuant to this Article XIII, such
Indemnified Party shall promptly pay over to the Indemnifying Party the amount
so recovered (net of any Expenses incurred by such Indemnified Party in
procuring such recovery, which Expenses shall not exceed the amount so
recovered), and, if applicable, net of such Indemnified Party's (i)
retroactive or prospective premium adjustments associated with such recovery
from a third-party insurer and (ii) actual increase(s) in such Person's and
its Affiliates' insurance premium that is reasonably attributable to such Loss
(collectively, the "Premium Increase"), but not in excess of the sum of (A)
any amount previously paid by the Indemnifying Party to or on behalf of the
Indemnified Party in respect of such claim and (B) any amount expended by the
Indemnifying Party in pursuing or defending any claim arising out of such
matter.

(c) If any portion of Losses to be paid by the Indemnifying Party pursuant to
this Article XIII would reasonably be expected to be recoverable from a third
party not affiliated with the relevant Indemnified Party (including under any
applicable third-party insurance coverage) based on the underlying claim or
demand asserted against such Indemnifying Party, then the Indemnified Party
shall promptly after becoming aware of such fact give notice thereof to the
Indemnifying Party and, upon the request of the Indemnifying Party shall use
reasonable best efforts to collect the maximum amount recoverable from such
third party, in which event the Indemnifying Party shall reimburse the
Indemnified Party for (i) all reasonable costs and expenses incurred in
connection with such collection (which costs and expenses of collection shall
not exceed the amount recoverable from such third party) and (ii) any related
Premium Increase. If any portion of Losses actually paid by the Indemnifying
Party pursuant to this Article XIII could have been recovered from a third
party not affiliated with the relevant Indemnified Party based on the
underlying claim or demand asserted against such Indemnifying Party, then the
Indemnified Party shall transfer, to the extent transferable, such of its
rights to proceed against such third party as are necessary to permit the
Indemnifying Party to recover from such third party any amount actually paid
by the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this Article XIII, net of any related
Premium Increase for which the Indemnifying Party has not already reimbursed
the Indemnified Party pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence.

(d) The parties shall treat any indemnification payment made under this
Agreement as an adjustment to the Purchase Price.

(e) For purposes of determining whether a breach of any representation or
warranty made in this Agreement has occurred, and for calculating the amount
of any Loss under this Article XIII, each representation and warranty
contained in this Agreement shall be read without regard to any "materiality,"
"Company Material Adverse Effect," "Buyer Material Adverse Effect" or other
similar qualification contained in or otherwise applicable to such
representation or warranty, other than (i) the representations and warranties
in Section 5.04(b), Section 5.07(e), Section 5.09(a), Section 5.13(a), Section
5.14(b) and Section 5.25(b) and (ii) any use of the defined terms "Material
Contract" or "Material Distributor."

(f) In the event that a party hereto or HFSG: (i) consolidates with or
amalgamates, combines or merges into any other Person and is not the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation,
amalgamation, combination or merger; or (ii) sells, transfers, pledges or
otherwise disposes of all or substantially all of its properties, assets
(including portfolio investments) or Capital Stock of its Subsidiaries
(whether in one transaction or a series of related transactions) to one or
more Persons, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made
prior to the consummation of any such transaction so that each such Person
shall assume by a written instrument entered into for the benefit of, and
enforceable by, the other party hereto the obligations of such party set forth
in this Article XIII or Article X.

(g) The waiver of any condition based on the accuracy of any representation or
warranty set forth in this Agreement, or on the performance of or compliance
with any covenant, agreement, condition and obligation set forth in this
Agreement, shall not affect the right to indemnification or other remedy based
on such representations, warranties, covenants, agreements, conditions and
obligations.

(h) Neither Buyer nor Seller shall have any right to set off any unresolved
indemnification claim pursuant to this Article XIII against any payment due
pursuant to Article II or Article III or any other Transaction Agreement.

Section 13.07 Reserves. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement or the other Transaction Agreements, Seller makes no representation
or warranty with respect to, and nothing contained in this Agreement, any
other Transaction Agreements or in any other agreement, document or instrument
to be delivered in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby is intended or shall be construed to be a representation or warranty
(express or implied) of Seller, for any purpose of this Agreement, the other
Transaction Agreements or any other agreement, document or instrument to be
delivered in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby,
with respect to (a) the adequacy or sufficiency of the Reserves of the
Acquired Companies, (b) the future profitability of the Business or (c) the
effect of the adequacy or sufficiency of the Reserves of the Acquired
Companies on any "line item" or asset, Liability or equity amount.
Furthermore, no fact, condition, circumstance or event relating to or
affecting the development of the Reserves of the Acquired Companies may be
used, directly or indirectly, to demonstrate or support the breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement,
any other Transaction Agreement or any other agreement, document or instrument
to be delivered in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby.

Section 13.08 Participation of Specified Third-Party Reinsurer. Seller shall
(a) allow the participation of, and (b) upon written request by Buyer, allow
the direction by, the Specified Third-Party Reinsurer under the arrangements
contemplated by Section 16.2(d) of the Specified Third-Party Reinsurance
Agreements.

13.03(a) or Section 13.03(f), as the case may be, in which case the claim
shall continue to be subject to indemnification in accordance with Article

Seller shall send to the Specified Third-Party Reinsurer (to the address
therefor set forth in the Specified Third-Party Reinsurance Binder) a copy of
any notice, request or demand given to Buyer under this Agreement prior to the
Closing with respect to any amendment, modification, termination, waiver or
supplement of any Reinsured Business Pre-Closing Covenant (as defined in the
Specified Third-Party Reinsurance Binder) or any Reinsured Business
Fundamental Representation (as defined in the Specified Third-Party
Reinsurance Binder).

Section 14.04 Public Announcements. No party to this Agreement or any
Affiliate or Representative of such party shall issue or cause the publication
of any press release or public announcement or otherwise communicate with any
news media in respect of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other party (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), except as
may be required by Law or applicable securities exchange rules, in which the
case the party required to publish such press release or public announcement
shall allow the other parties a reasonable opportunity to comment on such
press release or public announcement in advance of such publication. Prior to
the Closing, neither of the parties to this Agreement, nor any of their
respective Affiliates or Representatives, shall make any public disclosure
concerning plans or intentions relating to the customers, agents or employees
of, or other Persons with significant business relationships with, the
Acquired Companies without first obtaining the prior written approval of the
other party, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed.

Section 14.05 Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced under any Law or as a
matter of public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement
shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or
legal substance of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is not
affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such
determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced, the parties to this Agreement shall negotiate in
good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the
parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement be consummated as originally
contemplated to the greatest extent possible.

Section 14.06 Entire Agreement. Except as otherwise expressly provided in the
Transaction Agreements, the Transaction Agreements constitute the entire
agreement of the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter of the
Transaction Agreements and supersede all prior agreements and undertakings,
both written and oral (other than the Confidentiality Agreement to the extent
not in conflict with this Agreement), between or on behalf of Seller or its
Affiliates, on the one hand, and Buyer or its Affiliates, on the other hand,
with respect to the subject matter of the Transaction Agreements.

Section 14.07 Assignment. This Agreement shall not be assigned by any party
hereto without the prior written consent of the other parties hereto;
provided, that any such assignment shall not release Buyer, Buyer Parent or
Buyer Parent GP from any liability or obligation hereunder. Any attempted
assignment in violation of this Section 14.07 shall be void. This Agreement
shall be binding upon, shall inure to the benefit of, and shall be enforceable
by the parties hereto and their permitted successors and assigns.

Section 14.08 No Third-Party Beneficiaries. Except as provided in Section 8.10
with respect to the directors, officers and managers of the Acquired Companies
and their successors, assigns heirs and executors and Article XIII with
respect to the Seller Indemnified Parties and Buyer Indemnified Parties, this
Agreement is for the sole benefit of the parties to this Agreement and their
permitted successors and assigns and nothing in this Agreement, express or
implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other Person or entity any
legal or equitable right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or
by reason of this Agreement.

Section 14.09 Amendment. No provision of this Agreement or any other
Transaction Agreement may be amended, supplemented or modified except by a
written instrument signed by all the parties to such agreement.

Section 14.10 Schedules. Any disclosure set forth in the Seller Disclosure
Schedule with respect to any Section of this Agreement shall be deemed to be
disclosed for purposes of other Sections of this Agreement to the extent that
such disclosure sets forth facts in sufficient detail so that the relevance of
such disclosure would be reasonably apparent to a reader of such disclosure.
Matters reflected in any Section of the Seller Disclosure Schedule are not
necessarily limited to matters required by this Agreement to be so reflected.
Such additional matters are set forth for informational purposes and do not
necessarily include other matters of a similar nature. No reference to or
disclosure of any item or other matter in the Seller Disclosure Schedule shall
be construed as an admission or indication that such item or other matter is
material or that such item or other matter is required to be referred to or
disclosed in this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, no such reference
to or disclosure of a possible breach or violation of any contract, Law or
Governmental Order shall be construed as an admission or indication that a
breach or violation exists or has actually occurred.

Section 14.11 Submission to Jurisdiction.

(a) Each of the parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally submits for
itself and its property in any Action arising out of or relating to the
Transaction Agreements, the transactions contemplated by the Transaction
Agreements, the formation, breach, termination or validity of the Transaction
Agreements or the recognition and enforcement of any judgment in respect of
the Transaction Agreements, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the
State of New York sitting in the County of New York, the federal courts for
the Southern District of New York, and appellate courts having jurisdiction of
appeals from any of the foregoing, and all claims in respect of any such
Action shall be heard and determined in such New York courts or, to the extent
permitted by Law, in such federal court.

(b) Any such Action may and shall be brought in such courts and each of the
parties irrevocably and unconditionally waives any objection that it may now
or hereafter have to the venue or jurisdiction of any such Action in any such
court or that such Action was brought in an inconvenient court and shall not
plead or claim the same.

(c) Service of process in any Action may be effected by mailing a copy of such
process by registered or certified mail (or any substantially similar form of
mail), postage prepaid, to such party at its address as provided in Section
14.03.

(d) Nothing in this Agreement or any other Transaction Agreement shall affect
the right to effect service of process in any other manner permitted by the
Laws of the State of New York.

Section 14.12 Governing Law. This Agreement, and the formation, termination or
validity of any part of this Agreement, shall in all respects be governed by,
and construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of New York.

Section 14.13 Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH PARTY HERETO IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION
(WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO
THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER TRANSACTION
AGREEMENTS, OR ITS PERFORMANCE UNDER OR THE ENFORCEMENT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR
ANY OTHER TRANSACTION AGREEMENT.

Section 14.14 Specific Performance. The parties agree that irreparable damage
may occur in the event that any of the covenants or obligations contained in
this Agreement are not performed in accordance with their specific terms or
were otherwise breached. Accordingly, each of the parties hereto shall be
entitled to seek injunctive or other equitable relief to prevent or cure any
breach by the other party of its covenants or obligations contained in this
Agreement and to specifically enforce such covenants and obligations in any
court referenced in Section 14.11(a) or (e) having jurisdiction, such remedy
being in addition to any other remedy to which any party may be entitled at
law or in equity. Subject to the following sentence, the parties acknowledge
and agree that the provisions set forth in Sections 12.04(a) and (b) shall not
be construed to diminish or otherwise impair in any respect any party's right
to specific enforcement. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, it is explicitly agreed that the right
of Seller to an injunction, specific performance or other equitable remedies
to enforce Buyer's, Buyer Parent's or Buyer Parent GP's obligation to cause
the proceeds of the Commitment Letters to be contributed to Buyer and to
consummate the Closing shall be subject to the requirement that: (a) Buyer is
required to consummate the Closing pursuant to Section 3.01 and Buyer fails to
consummate the Closing by the date the Closing is required to have occurred
pursuant to Section 3.01, and (b) Seller has confirmed in writing that if the
proceeds of the Commitment Letters are funded, then Seller would take such
reasonable actions that are within its control to cause the Closing to occur.
The parties acknowledge and agree that, in the event that the other party
seeks an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement or to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, the party
seeking an injunction will not be required to provide any bond or other
security in connection with any such order or injunction.

Section 14.15 Waivers. Any term or provision of this Agreement may be waived,
or the time for its performance may be extended, in writing at any time by the
party or parties entitled to the benefit thereof. Any such waiver shall be
validly and sufficiently authorized for the purposes of this Agreement if, as
to any party, it is authorized in writing by an authorized Representative of
such party. The failure of any party hereto to enforce at any time any
provision of this Agreement shall not be construed to be a waiver of such
provision, nor in any way to affect the validity of this Agreement or any part
hereof or the right of any party thereafter to enforce each and every such
provision. No waiver of any breach of this Agreement shall be held to
constitute a waiver of any preceding or subsequent breach.

Section 14.16 Rules of Construction. Interpretation of this Agreement and the
other Transaction Agreements(except as specifically provided in any such
agreement, in which case such specified rules of construction shall govern
with respect to such agreement) shall be governed by the following rules of
construction: (a) words in the singular shall be held to include the plural

in the Transaction Agreements are for reference purposes only and shall not
affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of the Transaction Agreements;
(g) the Transaction Agreements shall be construed without regard to any
presumption or rule requiring construction or interpretation against the party
drafting or causing any instrument to be drafted; (h) the Schedules and
Exhibits referred to herein shall be construed with and as an integral part of
this Agreement to the same extent as if they were set forth verbatim herein;
(i) unless the context otherwise requires, the words "hereof," "herein" and
"hereunder" and words of similar import when used in this Agreement shall
refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this
Agreement; (j) all terms defined in this Agreement shall have the defined
meanings when used in any certificate or other document made or delivered
pursuant hereto unless otherwise defined therein; (k) any agreement or
instrument defined or referred to herein or any agreement or instrument that
is referred to herein means such agreement or instrument as from time to time
amended, modified or supplemented, including by waiver or consent, and
references to all attachments thereto and instruments incorporated therein;
(l) any statement that a document has been "delivered," "provided" or "made

respect to any party shall mean intentional (and not constructive) fraud by
such party.

Section 14.17 Counterparts. This Agreement and each of the other Transaction
Agreements may be executed in two (2) or more counterparts, and by the
different parties to each such agreement in separate counterparts, each of
which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken
together shall constitute one and the same agreement. Delivery of an executed
counterpart of a signature page to any Transaction Agreement by facsimile or
by electronic delivery in PDF format shall be as effective as delivery of a
manually executed counterpart of any such Agreement.

Section 14.18 HFSG Guaranty. HFSG hereby fully, irrevocably and
unconditionally guarantees to Buyer the full, complete and timely compliance
with and performance of all agreements, covenants and obligations of Seller
from time to time under this Agreement (the "Obligations" and, collectively,
the "Guaranty"). The Obligations shall include Seller's obligation to satisfy
all payment obligations of Seller arising in connection with this Agreement,
in each case, when and to the extent that, any of the same shall become due
and payable or performance of or compliance with any of the same shall be
required. HFSG hereby acknowledges and agrees that the Guaranty constitutes an
absolute, present, primary, continuing and unconditional guaranty of
performance, compliance and payment by Seller of the Obligations when due
under this Agreement and not of collection only and is in no way conditioned
or contingent upon any attempt to enforce such performance, compliance or
payment by a guaranteed party upon any other condition or contingency. HFSG
hereby waives any right to require a proceeding first against Seller. The
Obligations shall not be subject to any reduction, limitation, impairment or
termination for any reason (other than by indefeasible payment or performance
in full of the Obligations) and shall not be subject to (a) any discharge of
Seller from any of the Obligations in a bankruptcy or similar proceeding
(except by indefeasible payment or performance in full of the Obligations) or
(b) any other circumstance whatsoever which constitutes, or might be construed
to constitute, an equitable or legal discharge of HFSG as guarantor under this
Section 14.18. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 14.18, HFSG
shall have the rights, remedies and legal or equitable defenses that are
available to Seller under the terms of this Agreement or applicable Law with
respect to the Obligations. Notwithstanding the foregoing, HFSG's obligations
under this Section 14.18 shall terminate on the third (3rd) anniversary of the
Closing Date unless, prior to such date Buyer or a Buyer Indemnified Party, as
applicable, has provided to Seller or HFSG with notice of a claim (including
an applicable claim notice under Article XIII), in which case such claim shall
continue to be subject to the Guaranty in accordance with this Section 14.18
notwithstanding the passing of such applicable date.
