in this Agreement as the " _Closing Date_ ".

Agreement and the officersÂ’ certificates required by Section 1103 of the CGCL
or other appropriate documents (in any such case, the " _Merger Filing_ ")
executed in accordance with the relevant provisions of the CGCL and shall
make all other filings or recordings required under the CGCL.  The Merger
shall become effective at such

  



  

2   

     
   

  



  

time as the Merger Filing is duly filed with the Secretary of State of the
State of California (the time the Merger becomes effective being the "
_Effective Time_ ").

  



  

SECTION 1.04 _Effects_. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in the
CGCL, including Section 1107 of the CGCL.

  



  

SECTION 1.05 _Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws_. (a) _Articles of
Incorporation_. The Articles of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation
shall be amended at the Effective Time to read in the form of Exhibit A, and,
as so amended, such Articles of Incorporation shall be the Articles of
Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or
amended as provided therein or by applicable Law.

  



  

(b) _Bylaws_. The Bylaws of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law.

  



  

SECTION 1.06 _Directors_. The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation, until
the earlier of their resignation or removal or until their
respective successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be.

  



  

SECTION 1.07 _Officers_. The officers of the Surviving
Corporation immediately after the Effective Time shall be determined by the
directors of the Surviving Corporation, to serve until the earlier of their
resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly elected
or appointed and qualified, as the case may be.

  



  

ARTICLE II 
  
  _Effect on the Capital Stock of the 
 Constituent Corporations; Exchange of Certificates_

  



  

SECTION 2.01 _Effect of Merger on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any
capital stock of the Company or Merger Sub:

  



  

(a) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each issued and outstanding share of
capital stock of Merger Sub shall be converted into and become one fully paid
and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation.

  



  

(b) _Cancellation of Certain Owned Shares_. Each share of Company Common
Stock that is held in the treasury of the Company, or outstanding and held by
Parent or any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent or the
Company, shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled
and retired and shall cease to exist, and no cash or other consideration
shall be delivered or deliverable in exchange therefor.

  



  

(c) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Subject to Sections 2.01(b) and
2.01(d), each issued share of Company Common Stock shall be converted into
the right to receive $13.25 in cash (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). As of
the Effective Time, all such shares

  



  

3   

     
   

  



  

of Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each
holder of a certificate representing any such shares of Company Common Stock
shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to
receive Merger Consideration upon surrender of such certificate in accordance
with Section 2.02, without interest. In the event that prior to the Effective
Time, solely as a result of a reclassification, stock split (including a
reverse stock split), combination or exchange of shares, stock dividend or
stock distribution which in any such event is made on a pro rata basis to all
holders of Company Common Stock, there is a change in the number of shares of
Company Common Stock outstanding or issuable upon the conversion, exchange or
exercise of securities or rights convertible into or exchangeable or
exercisable for shares of Company Common Stock, then the Merger Consideration
shall be equitably adjusted to eliminate the effects of such event.

  



  

(d) _Dissent Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, shares (" _Dissenting Shares_ ") of Company Common Stock that are
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by any
person who is entitled to demand and properly demands payment of the fair
market value of such Dissenting Shares pursuant to, and who complies in all
respects with, Chapter 13 of the CGCL (" _Chapter 13_ ") shall not be
converted into Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.01(c), but
rather the holders of Dissenting Shares shall be entitled to payment of the
fair market value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with Chapter 13;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if any such holder shall fail to perfect or
otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to receive payment of fair
market value under Chapter 13, then the right of such holder to be paid the
fair value of such holderÂ’s Dissenting Shares shall cease and such Dissenting
Shares shall be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into,
and to have become exchangeable solely for the right to receive, Merger
Consideration as provided in Section 2.01(c). The Company shall give prompt
notice to Parent of any demands, attempted withdrawals of such demands and
any other instruments served pursuant to the CGCL received by the Company for
appraisal of shares of Company Common Stock, and Parent shall have the right
to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such
demands, except as required by applicable Law. The Company shall not, except
with the prior written consent of Parent, such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed, make any payment with respect to, settle, offer to
settle, or approve any withdrawal of any such demands.

  



  

SECTION 2.02 _Exchange of Certificates_. (a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the
Effective Time, Parent and the Company shall select a bank or trust company
to act as paying agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ") for the payment of the Merger
Consideration upon surrender of certificates representing Company Common
Stock.  Parent and Opco shall take all steps necessary to enable and cause
the Surviving Corporation to provide to the Paying Agent immediately
following the Effective Time all the cash necessary to pay for the shares of
Company Common Stock converted into the right to receive cash pursuant to
Section 2.01(c) (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange
Fund_ ").

  



  

(b) _Exchange Procedure_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, the Paying Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a
certificate or certificates (the " _Certificates_ ") that immediately prior
to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock
that were converted into the right to receive Merger Consideration pursuant
to Section 2.01, (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that

  



  

4   

     
   

  



  

delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent and
shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably
specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates in exchange for Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of
a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent, together with such letter
of transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably
be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor the amount of cash into which the
shares of Company Common Stock theretofore represented by such Certificate
shall have been converted pursuant to Section 2.01, and the Certificate
so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled.  In the event of a transfer of
ownership of Company Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer
records of the Company, payment may be made to a person other than the person
in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such
Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for
transfer and the person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or
other taxes required by reason of the payment to a person other than the
registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of
Parent that such tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this Section 2.02, each Certificate shall be deemed at any
time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon
such surrender the amount of cash, without interest, into which the shares of
Company Common Stock theretofore represented by such Certificate have been
converted pursuant to Section 2.01. No interest shall be paid or accrue on
the cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate.

  



  

(c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. The Merger
Consideration paid in accordance with the terms of this Article II upon
conversion of any shares of Company Common Stock shall be deemed to have been
paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company
Common Stock except as provided by applicable Law, and after the Effective
Time there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock
that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, any certificates formerly representing shares of
Company Common Stock are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in
this Article II.

  



  

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock for six months
after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any
holder of Company Common Stock who has not theretofore complied with this
Article II shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for
payment of its claim for Merger Consideration.

  



  

(e) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Opco, the Company, Merger Sub, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent or any of their respective
directors, officers, employees and agents shall be liable to any person in
respect of any cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any
Certificate has not been surrendered prior to five years after the Effective
Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which Merger Consideration
in respect of such Certificate would otherwise escheat to or become the
property of any Governmental Entity (as defined in Section 3.05(b))), any
such shares, cash, dividends or distributions in respect of

  



  

5   

     
   

  



  

such Certificate shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the
property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or
interest of any person previously entitled thereto.

  



  

(f) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest any cash
included in the Exchange Fund, as directed by Parent, on a daily basis. Any
interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to
Parent.

  



  

(g) _Withholding Rights_. The Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise
payable to any holder of Company Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement such
amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the
making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the " _Code_ "), or under any provision of state, local or foreign tax Law.
To the extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld by the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the
shares of Company Common Stock in respect of which such deduction
and withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent.

  



  

(h) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such person of a bond in such
reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may require as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration payable pursuant to this
Agreement.

  



  

SECTION 2.03 _Company Options and Unvested Stock_. (a) Except as set forth in
Section 2.03(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter (as defined in Article III),
at the Effective Time each outstanding option to purchase shares of Company
Common Stock (a " _Company Option_ "), whether or not then exercisable, shall
be cancelled and shall entitle the holder thereof to receive, as soon as
reasonably practicable after surrender thereof, only an amount in cash equal
to the product of (x) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to the Company Option times (y) the excess of the value of the Merger
Consideration over the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock under
such Company Option, less applicable Taxes required to be withheld with
respect to such payment.

  



  

(b) All unvested shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall become fully vested as of the
Effective Time.

  



  

(c) The Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
the amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Section 2.03 to any holder of
Company Options such amounts as the Surviving Corporation is required to
deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the
Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign tax Law. To the extent
that amounts are so deducted and withheld by the Surviving Corporation, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the holder of the Company Options in respect of which
such deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation.

  



  

6   

     
   

  



  

(d) The Company Option Plan (as defined in Section 3.03) and the employee
stock purchase plan of the Company shall be terminated immediately after the
Effective Time, and the provisions in any agreement, arrangement or other
benefit plan providing for the issuance, transfer or grant of any capital
stock of the Company or any interest in respect of any capital stock of the
Company shall be deleted immediately after the Effective Time, and the
Company shall take such actions to ensure that following the Effective Time
no holder of a Company Option or any participant in or a party to the Company
Option Plan or any similar plan or other agreement, arrangement or benefit
plan shall have any right thereunder to acquire any capital stock or any
interest in respect of any capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

  



  

ARTICLE III 
  
  _Representations and Warranties of the Company_

  



  

The Company represents and warrants to Parent that, except as set forth in
the corresponding section of the letter, dated as of the date of this
Agreement, from the Company to Parent (the " _Company Disclosure Letter_ "),
or in any other section of the Company Disclosure Letter if the relevance of
such disclosure or matter is reasonably apparent (except that no matter shall
be deemed to be disclosed for purposes of Section 3.05 or Section 3.21 of the
Company Disclosure Letter if it is not set forth or cross-referenced in such
section of the Company Disclosure Letter):

  



  

SECTION 3.01 _Organization, Standing and Power_. Each of the Company and each
of its subsidiaries (the " _Company Subsidiaries_ ") is a corporation,
partnership or limited liability company duly organized, validly existing and
in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction in which it is organized
and has full corporate, partnership or limited liability company power and
authority to conduct its businesses as presently conducted.  The Company and
each Company Subsidiary is duly qualified to do business as a foreign
corporation, partnership or limited liability company and is in good standing
in each jurisdiction where the nature of its business or the ownership or
leasing of its properties make such qualification necessary, except where the
failure to so qualify has not had and could not reasonably be expected to
have a Company Material Adverse Effect (as defined in Section 9.03). The
Company has made available to Parent true and complete copies of the articles
of incorporation of the Company, as amended to the date of this Agreement (as
so amended, the " _Company Charter_ "), the Bylaws of the Company, as amended
to the date of this Agreement (as so amended, the " _Company Bylaws_ ") and
the comparable charter and organizational documents of each Company
Subsidiary.

  



  

SECTION 3.02 _Company Subsidiaries; Equity Interests_. (a) Section 3.02(a) of
the Company Disclosure Letter lists each Company Subsidiary, its jurisdiction
of organization and each holder of outstanding capital stock or other
ownership interests of such subsidiary. All the outstanding shares of
capital stock or other ownership interests of each Company Subsidiary have
been validly issued and are fully paid and nonassessable and, except as set
forth in the Company Disclosure Letter, are owned by the Company, by another
Company Subsidiary or by the Company and another Company Subsidiary, free and
clear of all pledges, liens, hypothecations, claims, charges, mortgages,
encumbrances and security interests of any kind or nature whatsoever
(collectively, " _Liens_ "). No shares of capital stock of any Company

  



  

7   

     
   

  



  

Subsidiary have been issued in violation of any purchase option, call option,
right of first refusal, preemptive right, subscription right or any similar
right. No shares of capital stock of any Company Subsidiary are reserved for
issuance.

  



  

(b) Except for its interests in the Company Subsidiaries, the Company does
not as of the date of this Agreement own, directly or indirectly, (i) any
capital stock, membership interest, partnership interest or other equity
interest in any person or securities convertible into or exchangeable for any
equity interest of any person or (ii) any participating interest in the
revenues or profits of any person, and neither the Company nor any Company
Subsidiary is subject to any obligation to make any investment (in the form
of loan, capital contribution or otherwise) in any person.

  



  

SECTION 3.03 _Capital Structure_. The authorized capital stock of the Company
consists of 100,000,000 shares of Company Common Stock and 10,000,000 shares
of preferred stock, no par value per share (the " _Company Preferred Stock_
" and, together with the Company Common Stock, the " _Company Capital Stock_
"). At the close of business on September 28, 2005, (i) 23,902,267 shares of
Company Common Stock and no shares of Company Preferred Stock were issued and
outstanding, and (ii) 16,500 shares of Company Common Stock were held by the

_Capitalization Date_ "), (i) 2,516,480 shares of Company Common Stock were
subject to outstanding Company Options, (ii) 2,191,540 additional shares of
Company Common Stock were reserved for issuance pursuant to the
Specialty Laboratories, Inc. 2000 Stock Incentive Plan (the " _Company Option
Plan_ ") and (iii) 900,341 additional shares of Company Common Stock were
reserved for issuance pursuant to the CompanyÂ’s employee stock purchase plan.
Since the Capitalization Date, no other shares of capital stock or other
voting securities of the Company have been issued or reserved for issuance,
other than the granting of 12,500 additional Company Options and the issuance
of Company Common Stock upon the exercise of Company Options outstanding on
the Capitalization Date and in accordance with their present terms, and other
than as permitted pursuant to Section 5.01(b). All outstanding shares of
Company Capital Stock are, and all such shares that may be issued prior to
the Effective Time will be when issued, duly authorized, validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable and not subject to or issued in violation of any
purchase option, call option, right of first refusal, preemptive
right, subscription right or any similar right under any provision of the
CGCL, the Company Charter, the Company Bylaws, any Contract (as defined in
Section 3.05) to which the Company is a party or otherwise.  There are not
any bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary having the right to vote (or convertible into, or
exchangeable for, securities having the right to vote) on any matters on
which holders of Company Common Stock or holders of equity securities of
any Company Subsidiary may vote (" _Voting Company Debt_ "). Except as set
forth above there are not any options, warrants, rights, convertible or
exchangeable securities, "phantom" stock rights, stock appreciation rights,
restricted stock awards, dividend equivalent awards, stock-based performance
units, commitments, Contracts (as defined in Section 3.05), arrangements or
undertakings of any kind to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a

capital stock or other equity interests in, or any security convertible into
or exercisable or exchangeable for any capital stock of or other equity
interest in, the Company or of any Company Subsidiary or any Voting Company
Debt or (ii) obligating the Company or any Company Subsidiary to issue,
grant, extend or enter into any

  



  

8   

     
   

  



  

such option, warrant, call, right, security, commitment, Contract,
arrangement or undertaking. There are not any outstanding
contractual obligations of the Company or any Company Subsidiary to
repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any shares of capital stock of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary.

  



  

SECTION 3.04 _Authority; Execution and Delivery, Enforceability_. (a) The
Company has all requisite corporate power and authority to execute and
deliver this Agreement and to consummate the Transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. The execution and delivery by the Company of this Agreement
and the consummation by the Company of the Transactions contemplated by this
Agreement have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the
part of the Company, subject, in the case of the Merger, to receipt of the
Company Stockholder Approval (as defined in Section 3.04(c)). The Company
has duly executed and delivered this Agreement, and this Agreement
constitutes its legal, valid and binding obligation, enforceable against it
in accordance with its terms.

and unanimously adopted resolutions (i) approving this Agreement, the Merger

(c) The only vote of holders of any class or series of Company Capital Stock
necessary to approve this Agreement, the Merger and the other Transactions
contemplated by this Agreement is (i) as required by Section 1201 of the
CGCL, the approval of the principal terms of the Merger by the affirmative
vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock entitled
to vote and (ii) as required by the terms of this Agreement, the approval of
the principal terms of the Merger by the affirmative vote of a majority of
the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock other than the shares of
Company Common Stock held, directly or indirectly, by Founder Parties or
their affiliates (the " _Company Stockholder Approval_ ").

  



  

SECTION 3.05 _No Conflicts; Consents_. (a) The execution and delivery by
the Company of this Agreement do not, and the consummation of the Merger and
the other Transactions contemplated by this Agreement and compliance with the
terms hereof will not, conflict with, or result in any violation of or

SECTION 3.06 _SEC Documents; Undisclosed Liabilities_. (a) The Company has
filed all reports, schedules, forms, statements and other documents required
to be filed by the Company with the SEC since December 31, 2002 pursuant to
Sections 13(a) and 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
(the " _Exchange Act_ ") (the " _Company SEC Documents_ ").

  



  

(b) As of its respective date, each Company SEC Document complied in all
material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules
and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder applicable to such Company
SEC Document, and did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading. Except to the extent that information
contained in any Company SEC Document has been revised or superseded by a
later filed Company SEC Document, none of the Company SEC Documents contains
any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. The consolidated financial statements of the Company included in
the Company

  



  

10   

     
   

  



  

SEC Documents comply as to form in all material respects with applicable
accounting requirements and the published rules and regulations of the SEC
with respect thereto, have been prepared in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles (" _GAAP_ ") (except, in the case of unaudited
statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC) applied on a consistent
basis during the periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes
thereto) and fairly present the consolidated financial position of the
Company and its consolidated subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the
consolidated results of their operations and cash flows for the periods shown
(subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to normal year-end audit
adjustments).

  



  

(c) Except as set forth in the financial statements filed with the 2004 10-K
or incurred in the ordinary course since December 31, 2004, as of the date of
this Agreement neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has any
liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether accrued, absolute,
contingent or otherwise) that, individually or in the aggregate, could
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

(d) None of the Company Subsidiaries is, or has at any time been, subject to
the reporting requirements of Sections 13(a) and 15(d) of the Exchange Act.

  



  

SECTION 3.07 _Information Supplied_. None of the information supplied or to

the time of the Company Stockholders Meeting (as defined in Section 6.01(b)),
or, in the case of the Schedule 13E-3, at the date it is first filed with the
SEC, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,

the rules and regulations thereunder, except that no representation is made

therein based on information supplied by Parent, Opco, Holdings, Merger Sub,
Parent Stockholders or Founder Parties for inclusion or incorporation by
reference therein.

  



  

SECTION 3.08 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_. Since December 31, 2004,
(i) each of the Company and each Company Subsidiary has conducted its
business, in all material respects, only in the ordinary course and in a
manner consistent with past practice (except in connection with the
negotiation and execution and delivery of this Agreement), (ii) no event has
occurred and no action has been taken that would have been prohibited by the
terms of Section 5.01 if such Section had been in effect as of and at all
times since December 31, 2004 and (iii) there has not been any change, event,
condition, circumstance or state of facts (whether or not covered by
insurance), individually or in the aggregate, that has had or that could
reasonably be expected to have, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

SECTION 3.09 _Taxes_.  (a) Each of the Company and each Company Subsidiary
has timely filed, or has caused to be timely filed on its behalf, all Tax
Returns required to be filed by it with the appropriate Governmental Entity,
and all such Tax Returns are true, complete and accurate in all material
respects. All Taxes shown to be due on such Tax Returns, or other Taxes owed,
have been timely paid.  The Company has afforded Parent the opportunity to
examine true

  



  

11   

     
   

  



  

and correct copies of all material Tax Returns, examination reports, ruling
requests and statements of deficiencies, filed, assessed against or agreed to
by the Company or any Company Subsidiary.

  



  

(b) Except as could not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect, each of the Company and each Company Subsidiary has timely
paid any Taxes that are due and payable by it. The most recent financial
statements contained in the Company SEC Documents filed with the SEC prior to
the date of this Agreement (the " _Filed Company SEC Documents_ ") reflect an
adequate reserve for all Taxes payable (or that may become payable) by the
Company or any Company Subsidiary (in addition to any reserve for deferred
Taxes to reflect timing differences between book and Tax items) for all
Taxable periods and portions thereof through the date of such
financial statements. No deficiency with respect to any Taxes has been
proposed, asserted or assessed against the Company or any Company Subsidiary,
and no requests for waivers of the time to assess any such Taxes are pending.

  



  

(c) The Federal income Tax Returns of the Company and each Company
Subsidiary consolidated in such Tax Returns have been examined by and settled
with the United States Internal Revenue Service, or have closed by virtue of
the expiration of the relevant statute of limitations, for all years ending
on or before December 31, 2001. All material assessments for Taxes due with
respect to such completed and settled examinations or any concluded
litigation have been fully paid.

  



  

(d) There are no material Liens for Taxes (other than for current Taxes not
yet due and payable) on the assets of the Company or any Company Subsidiary.
Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is a party to any Contract
with respect to Taxes, including (i) a "closing agreement" as defined under
Code Section 7121 (or any corresponding or similar provision of state, local
or foreign Law), (ii) a waiver of any statute of limitations in respect of
Taxes or the agreement to an extension of time with respect to a material
assessment of deficiency, (iii) any Tax allocation, indemnity or sharing
agreement or (iv) a power of attorney with respect to any Tax.

  



  

(e) Each of the Company and each Company Subsidiary has complied in all
material respects with all applicable Laws relating to the withholding of
Taxes and has timely withheld and paid to the proper Governmental Entities
all amounts required to have been withheld and paid in connection with
amounts paid or owing to any employee, independent contractor, creditor or
stockholder.

  



  

(f) There are no audits or other administrative or court proceedings
presently pending with regard to any Taxes for which the Company or any
Company Subsidiary could be liable. No dispute or claim concerning any Taxes
for which the Company or any Company Subsidiary could be liable has been
claimed or raised by any Governmental Entity in writing to the Company, and
no claim has been made in writing to the Company by any Governmental Entity
in a jurisdiction where the Company or any Company Subsidiary does not file
Tax Returns that the Company or any such Company Subsidiary is, or may be,
subject to taxation by that jurisdiction.

  



  

12   

     
   

  



  

(g) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary (i) has been a member of
an affiliated group filing a consolidated federal income Tax return (other
than such a group of which the Company is the common parent) or (ii) will be
required to pay the Taxes of any other person under Treasury regulation
Section 1.1502-6 (or similar Law), as a transferee or successor, by Contract
or otherwise.

  



  

(h) Within the past five years, neither the Company nor any Company
Subsidiary (i) has constituted either a "distributing corporation" or a
"controlled corporation" within the meaning of Section 355(a)(1)(A) of the
Code in a distribution qualifying (or intended to qualify) under Section 355
of the Code (or so much of Section 356 as related to Section 355) or (ii)
been a party to any transaction that was reported as a reorganization within
the meaning of Section 368.

  



  

(i) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is a party to any Contract
that, individually or collectively, could give rise to the payment of any
amount which would not be deductible by reason of Section 162(m).

  



  

(j) For purposes of this Agreement:

  



  

" _Taxes_ " includes all forms of taxation, whenever created or imposed, and
whether of the United States or elsewhere, and whether imposed by a local,
municipal, governmental, state, foreign, Federal or other Governmental
Entity, or in connection with any agreement with respect to Taxes, including
all interest, penalties and additions imposed with respect to such amounts.

  



  

" _Tax Return_ " means any Federal, state, local, provincial and foreign Tax
return, declaration, statement, report, schedule, form or other information
filed with respect to any Tax, including any claim for refunds of any Tax and

the determination, assessment or collection of any Tax or the administration
of any Laws relating to any Tax.

  



  

SECTION 3.10 _Absence of Changes in Benefit Plans_. Except as disclosed in the
Filed Company SEC Documents, from the date of the most recent financial
statements included in the Filed Company SEC Documents to the date of this
Agreement, there has not been any adoption or amendment in any material
respect by the Company or any Company Subsidiary of any collective bargaining
agreement or any bonus, pension, profit sharing, deferred compensation,
incentive compensation, stock ownership, stock purchase, stock option,
phantom stock, retirement, vacation, severance, change of control,
indemnification, disability, death benefit, hospitalization, medical or other
plan, agreement, arrangement or understanding providing benefits to any
current or former employee, officer or director of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary (collectively, " _Company Benefit Plans_ "). Except as disclosed in
the Filed Company SEC Documents, as of the date of this Agreement there are
not any employment, severance or termination agreements or arrangements
between the Company or any Company Subsidiary and any current or former
executive officer or director of the Company or any Company Subsidiary
(collectively, the " _Company Benefit Agreements_ ").

  



  

13   

     
   

  



  

SECTION 3.11 _ERISA Compliance; Excess Parachute Payments_. (a) The
Company Disclosure Letter contains a list of any and all Company Benefit
Plans, including any and all "employee pension benefit plans" (as defined
in Section 3(2) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974,
as amended (" _ERISA_ ")) (" _Company Pension Plans_ "), "employee
welfare benefit plans" (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA) and all other
fringe benefit plans or arrangements maintained, or contributed to, by the
Company or any Company Subsidiary for the benefit of any current or former
employees, consultants, officers or directors of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary (or the dependents of the foregoing or with respect to which the
Company has or may have any material liability). Each Company Benefit Plan
has been administered in compliance with its terms and applicable Law, other
than instances of noncompliance that, individually and in the aggregate, have
not had and could not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect. All reports and disclosures relating to each Company Benefit
Plan required to be filed with or furnished to any Governmental Entity or
plan participants or beneficiaries have been filed or furnished in all
material respects in accordance with applicable law in a timely manner.
All contributions required to be made to each Company Benefit Plan pursuant
to the terms of such plan have been timely made.  The Company has made
available to Parent true, complete and correct copies of (i) each Company
Benefit Plan (or, in the case of any unwritten Company Benefit Plan, a
description thereof), (ii) the most recent annual report on Form 5500 filed
with the Internal Revenue Service with respect to each Company Benefit Plan
(if any such report was required), (iii) the most recent summary plan
description for each Company Benefit Plan for which such summary plan
description is required and (iv) each trust agreement and group annuity
contract relating to any Company Benefit Plan.

  



  

(b) Each Company Pension Plan intended to be a "qualified plan" within the
meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code has been the subject of a determination
letter from the Internal Revenue Service to the effect that such Company
Pension Plan is qualified and exempt from Federal income taxes under Sections
401(a) and 501(a), respectively, of the Code, and no such determination
letter has been revoked nor, to the knowledge of the Company, has revocation
been threatened, and nothing has occurred since the date of its most recent
determination letter in any respect that would adversely affect its
qualification or materially increase its costs.

  



  

(c) No Company Benefit Plan is a "multiemployer plan" within the meaning
of Section 3(37) of ERISA (a " _Multiemployer Pension Plan_ "), and
no Company Benefit Plan is subject to Title IV or Section 302 of ERISA or
Section 412 or 4971 of the Code.

  



  

(d) None of the Company, any Company Subsidiary, any officer of the Company
or any of the Company Subsidiaries or any of the Company Benefit Plans that
are subject to ERISA, including the Company Pension Plans, any trusts created
thereunder or any trustee or administrator thereof, has engaged in a
"prohibited transaction" (as such term is defined in Section 406 of ERISA or
Section 4975 of the Code) or any other breach of fiduciary responsibility
that could subject the Company, any Company Subsidiary or any officer of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary to the tax or penalty on prohibited
transactions imposed by such Section 4975 or to any liability under Section
502(i) or 502(1) of ERISA, except as could not reasonably be expected to have
a Company Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

14   

     
   

  



  

(e) No Company Benefit Plan or trust has been terminated, nor has there been
any "reportable event" (as that term is defined in Section 4043 of ERISA)
with respect to any Company Benefit Plan during the last five years. Neither
the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has incurred a "complete withdrawal"
or a "partial withdrawal" (as such terms are defined in Sections 4203 and
4205, respectively, of ERISA) since the effective date of such Sections 4203
and 4205 with respect to any Multiemployer Pension Plan.

  



  

(f) With respect to any Company Benefit Plan that is an employee welfare
benefit plan, (i) each such Company Benefit Plan is (x) funded through an
insurance contract and is not a "welfare benefits fund" (as such term is
defined in Section 419(e) of the Code) or (y) unfunded, and (ii) no such
Company Benefit Plan provides for life, health, medical, disability or other
welfare benefits to former employees or beneficiaries or dependents thereof,
except for health continuation coverage provided at no expense to the Company
or any Company Subsidiary as required by Section 4980B of the Code or Part 6
of Title I of ERISA.

  



  

(g) There are no material actions, claims, liens or investigations existing
or pending (other than routine claims for benefits) or, to the knowledge of
the Company, threatened with respect to any Company Benefit Plan. No Company
Benefit Plan is under audit or investigation by any Governmental Entity and
no such completed audit, if any, has resulted in the imposition of any Tax
during the last 12 months.

  



  

(h) Other than payments that may be made to the persons listed in the Company
Disclosure Letter (the " _Primary Company Executives_ "), any amount that
could be received (whether in cash or property or the vesting of property) as
a result of the Merger by any employee, officer or director of the Company or
any of its affiliates who is a "disqualified individual" (as such term is
defined in proposed Treasury Regulation Section 1.280G-1) under any
employment, severance or termination agreement, other compensation
arrangement or Company Benefit Plan currently in effect, would not constitute
an "excess parachute payment" (as defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code).

  



  

SECTION 3.12 _Litigation; Inspections and Investigations_. (a) As of the date
of this Agreement, there is no claim, suit, action, audit or proceeding
pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened against the Company,
any Company Subsidiary or, to the knowledge of the Company, any person that
the Company or any Company Subsidiary has agreed to indemnify in
respect thereof, nor, to the knowledge of the Company, is there any
investigation of the Company (collectively, " _Company Litigation_ ") that if
adversely decided could result (x) in a liability to the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries in excess of $1,000,000 or (y) in injunctive or other
equitable remedy against such parties that would materially affect the
operation of the business of the Company, and the Company is not aware of any
basis for any such claim, suit, action, audit, proceeding or investigation.
As of the date of this Agreement, there is no Company Litigation that,
individually or in the aggregate, has had or could reasonably be expected to
have a Company Material Adverse Effect. As of the date of this Agreement,
there is not any Judgment outstanding against the Company or any Company
Subsidiary or affecting any of their respective properties or assets or
business operations. There is no Judgment (whether outstanding as of the date
of this Agreement or first outstanding after the date of this Agreement) the
effect of which has had or could reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect. The Company and any Company Subsidiaries have in all
material respects

  



  

15   

     
   

  



  

performed all of the obligations required to be performed to the date of this
Agreement by any Judgment against the Company or any Company Subsidiary, or
by any Contract that settled any suit, action or proceeding against the
Company or any Company Subsidiary.

  



  

(b) None of the Company or any Company Subsidiaries nor, to the CompanyÂ’s
knowledge, any of their respective officers, directors, employees or agents
(or stockholders, representatives or other persons acting on the express,
implied or apparent authority of such entities) is currently, or has been
within the last two years, with respect to any state or Federal criminal
enforcement agency or with respect to Medicare, Medicaid, or any other state
or Federal health care payment or reimbursement program: (i) the subject of
any audit or, to the knowledge of the Company, any investigation; or (ii)
party to any Contract or Judgment that (A) requires, or could reasonably be
expected to require, the payment of a material amount of money by the Company
or any of the Company Subsidiaries to any state or Federal agency, program,
or fiscal intermediary, or (B) requires or prohibits any activity by the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries; and which, in the case of either
(A) or (B) of this sentence, is either punitive in nature, or serves as a
civil penalty.

  



  

SECTION 3.13 _Compliance with Applicable Laws; Compliance Program_. (a) The
business of the Company and Company Subsidiaries is currently being conducted
and since January 1, 2004 has been conducted in compliance with all
applicable Laws, including those relating to licensure, certification, and
operation of clinical laboratories, individuals providing services in or to
clinical laboratories, reimbursement for products or services provided by the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries, submission of claims to any payor,
including Medicare, Medicaid or other third party payors, for items or
services, and Environmental Laws (as defined in Section 3.17), except for
instances of noncompliance that, individually and in the aggregate, have not
had and could not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiaries have received any
written notice asserting a failure to comply with any Law, which failure has
had or could reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect, and which notice has not prior to the date of this Agreement
been fully and completely resolved. This Section 3.13 does not relate
to matters with respect to Taxes, which are the subject of Section 3.09.

  



  

(b) The Company and Company Subsidiaries have timely filed all material
filings and reports of every kind whatsoever required by Law or by written or
oral Contract or otherwise to have been filed or made with respect to the
provision of services by the Company and Company Subsidiaries to third-party
purchasers, including, but not limited to, Medicare and Medicaid, insurance
carriers and other fiscal intermediaries. No validation review or program
integrity review related to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries has been
conducted by any commission, board or agency in connection with the Medicare
or Medicaid program, and no such reviews are scheduled, pending or, to the
CompanyÂ’s knowledge, threatened against or affecting the Company or the
Company Subsidiaries or the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby.

  



  

(c) The Company and the Company Subsidiaries maintain an effective voluntary
compliance program to promote compliance with Law that is consistent with
model compliance guidance issued by the United States Department of Health
and Human Services Office of Inspector General (" _OIG_ ") and applicable
laws and regulations. To the knowledge of

  



  

16   

     
   

  



  

the Company, no individual employed by, contracting independently with or
otherwise providing services or supplies in connection with the conduct of
business by the Company or any Company Subsidiary is excluded from
participation in the Medicare or Medicaid programs or is listed on the
excluded individuals list published by the OIG.

or (iii) approve or recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend,
any Company Takeover Proposal (any action described in clauses (i), (ii) or

 Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to obtaining the Company
Stockholder Approval, the Company Board may make an Adverse Recommendation
Change if the Company receives a Superior Company Proposal (as defined in

faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that it is necessary to do so

terminate this Agreement in accordance with Section 8.01(d)(ii) unless and
until it provides Parent not less than three business days notice of such

taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule
14e-2(a) or 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making any
disclosure to the CompanyÂ’s stockholders if, in the good faith judgment of
the Company Board, after consultation with outside counsel, failure so to
disclose would be inconsistent with its obligations under applicable Law;
_provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the Company, the Company
Board or any committee thereof take, agree or resolve to take any action
prohibited by Section 5.02(b). Any action taken by the Company or the
Company Board in accordance with this Section 5.02(d) shall be deemed not to

Merger and this Agreement.

contemplated by this Agreement, taking into account all the terms and
conditions of such proposal and this Agreement (including any proposal by
Parent to amend the terms of this Agreement or the Transactions contemplated

32

aware that has caused or could reasonably be expected to cause any of the
conditions set forth in Section 7.03 and Section 7.02(f) to not be capable of
being satisfied prior to the Outside Date.  The delivery of any notice
pursuant to this Section 6.03(c) is for informational purposes and shall not

parties receiving such notice .

  



  

SECTION 6.04 _Benefit Plans_. (a) Until August 1, 2006, Parent and Opco

the date of this Agreement or (ii) provide or cause the Surviving Corporation
(or, in such case, its successors or assigns) to provide benefits to
employees of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries that, taken as a whole,

Time, Parent and Opco shall provide or cause the Surviving Corporation to
provide the benefits described in Section 6.04(a) of the Company Disclosure
Letter to the persons and on the terms disclosed in such section of the
Company Disclosure Letter. Nothing in this Section 6.04(a) shall be deemed
to prevent the Surviving Corporation or any of its subsidiaries from making
any change required by applicable Law.

  



  

(b) From and after the Effective Time, Parent and Opco shall, and shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to, honor in accordance with their respective terms
(as in effect on the date of this Agreement), all the CompanyÂ’s existing

Company Subsidiary shall, to the extent permitted under applicable Law, be
treated as service with Parent or any of its subsidiaries.

  



  

(d) To the extent permitted by applicable Law, Parent and Opco shall waive,

Subsidiaries (and their eligible dependents) will be eligible to participate
from and after the Effective Time, except to the extent that such pre-
existing condition limitation would have been applicable under the comparable
Company welfare benefit plan immediately prior to the Effective Time. To the
extent permitted by applicable Law, Parent and Opco shall recognize, or cause
to be recognized, the dollar amount of all expenses incurred by each Company
employee (and his or her eligible dependents) during the calendar year in
which the Effective Time occurs for purposes of satisfying such yearÂ’s

limitations under the relevant welfare benefit plans in which they will be
eligible to participate from and after the Effective Time.

  



  

(e) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, if the Effective Time occurs
before the date the fiscal year 2005 bonuses for employees of the Company are
determined, the Company, in consultation with Parent, may determine the
bonuses to be paid to employees of the Company for fiscal year 2005,
consistent with past practice, pursuant to any Contract, any Company Benefit
Plan, or any amounts (not to exceed the amount specified in Section 6.04(e)
of the Company Disclosure Letter) awarded by the Board of Directors prior to
the execution of this Agreement, and the Company may pay such amounts. If the

fullest extent permitted by Law, cause the Surviving Corporation to honor all
the CompanyÂ’s obligations to indemnify (including any obligations to advance
funds for expenses) the current or former directors or officers of the
Company for acts or omissions by such directors and officers occurring prior
to the Effective Time to the extent that such obligations of the Company
exist on the date of this Agreement, whether pursuant to the Company Charter,
the Company Bylaws, individual indemnity agreements, applicable Law or
otherwise, and such obligations shall survive the Merger and shall continue
in full force and effect in accordance with the terms of the Company Charter,
the Company Bylaws and such individual indemnity agreements or applicable Law
for a period of six years from the Effective Time.

  



  

(b) Parent and Opco will purchase prior to the Effective Time a six (6) year
extended reporting provision (so-called "tail policy") under a DirectorÂ’s and

the Company or Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section
8.01(b)(iii), and (ii) the Company Termination Fee less the amount of
Expenses paid pursuant to clause (i) of this sentence if the Company or

respect to this clause (ii) only if (A) a Company Takeover Proposal shall
have been publicly disclosed prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting, and
(B) within 12 months after such termination the Company (or any Company
Subsidiary) enters into a definitive agreement with respect to, or
consummates, a Company Takeover Proposal. Any amounts due under this Section

35   

     
   

  



  

SECTION 6.09 _Stockholder Litigation_. The Company shall notify Parent
promptly of any stockholder litigation against the Company and/or its

such definitive agreements that are within the control of Parent and Opco.
 Parent and Opco shall use commercially reasonable efforts to comply
with their respective obligations, and enforce their respective rights, under
the Commitment Letter. In the event that any portion of the Financing
becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated in the
Commitment Letter, Parent and Opco shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to obtain any such portion from alternative sources; _provided_ ,  _however_
, that in the event that any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable on
the terms and conditions contemplated in the Commitment Letter as a result of
a failure to satisfy any of the conditions set forth in paragraph (e) of
Exhibit B to the Commitment Letter, Parent and Opco shall use best efforts to
obtain any such portion from alternative sources. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Parent and Opco shall be under no obligation to obtain any
alternative financing unless it can be obtained on substantially similar
economic terms (to Parent, Opco and the Equity Investor) as those set forth
in the Commitment Letter. Parent shall give the Company prompt notice of any
breach by any party to the Commitment Letter or any termination of
the Commitment Letter. Parent shall keep the Company informed on a current
basis and in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange the
Financing and shall not permit, without the prior written consent of the
Company, any amendment or modification to be made to, or any waiver under,
the Commitment Letter, in each case, which would materially and adversely
affect the likelihood that the Financing contemplated thereby will be
obtained on a timely basis.

  



  

(b) The Company agrees to provide, and will cause the Company Subsidiaries
and its and their respective officers and employees to provide, all necessary
cooperation reasonably requested by Parent, Opco or Merger Sub in connection
with the arrangement of, and the negotiation of agreements with respect to,
