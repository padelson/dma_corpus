the conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Closing, the Purchaser
shall purchase, acquire and accept from the Seller, and the Seller shall sell,
transfer, assign and deliver to the Purchaser, the Company Interests, free and
clear of all Liens (other than Liens created by Parent or Purchaser).

 



 

 **2.2** ** ****_Consideration_** **.** On the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, the consideration to the Seller for
the sale, transfer, assignment and delivery to the Purchaser of the Company
Interests shall be (i) the cash payment of $80,000,000 (the " _Base Cash
Consideration_ "), as adjusted pursuant to _Section 2.3_ (such adjusted
amount, the " _Cash Consideration_ "), plus (ii) the issuance to the Seller of
the Stock Consideration.

 



 

 **2.3** ** ****_Working Capital Adjustment_** **.**

 



 

(a) The Base Cash Consideration shall be reduced by the amount of the
Estimated Working Capital Deficit, if any, or increased by the amount of the
Estimated Working Capital Surplus, if any, as set forth in the Company Closing
Schedule. Such adjustments shall be referred to herein collectively as the "
_Estimated Adjustment_."

 



 

(b) At least two (2) Business Days prior to the anticipated Closing Date, the
Parties shall agree upon a flow of funds memorandum which shall set forth all
payments required to be made by or on behalf of

      
 

 



 

all Parties at the Closing, including for each such payment an identification
of the payor, the payee, the amount and the wire transfer information.

 



 

(c) Within ninety (90) days following the Closing Date, the Seller shall

Working Capital (the " _Closing Net Working Capital Statement_ "), and a

any adjustments to the Estimated Adjustment based on variances between the

the " _Closing Adjustment_ "). The Purchaser shall assist the Seller in the
preparation of the Closing Net Working Capital Statement if reasonably
requested by the Seller and the Seller shall promptly respond to any
reasonable requests for information from the Purchaser regarding the
preparation of the Closing Net Working Capital Statement.

 



 

(d) The Purchaser shall have a period of forty five (45) days after receipt of
the Closing Net Working Capital Statement and Closing Adjustment to notify the
Seller of its election to accept or reject the Closing Net Working Capital
Statement and/or the Closing Adjustment. In the case of a rejection, such
notice must contain the reasons for such rejection in reasonable detail and
must set forth the amount of the requested adjustment. In the event no notice
is received by the Seller during such forty five (45) day period, the Closing
Net Working Capital Statement and the Closing Adjustment shall be deemed
accepted by the Purchaser and final and binding on the Parties hereto for
purposes of this _Section 2.3_. In the event that the Purchaser timely
rejects the Closing Net Working Capital Statement and/or the Closing
Adjustment, the Purchaser and the Seller shall promptly (and in any event
within thirty (30) days following the date upon which the Seller rejects the
Closing Net Working Capital Statement and/or Closing Adjustment), attempt to
make a joint determination of the Closing Adjustment and such determination
and any required adjustments resulting therefrom shall be final and binding on
the Parties hereto for purposes of this _Section 2.3_.

 



 

(e) In the event that the Seller and the Purchaser are unable to agree upon a
joint determination of the Closing Adjustment within the thirty (30) day
period for making a joint determination as provided in the last sentence of
_Section 2.3(d)_, then the Purchaser and the Seller shall promptly submit the
dispute to the Accounting Firm. The Purchaser and the Seller shall furnish to
the Accounting Firm such work papers and other documents and information
related to the disputed issues that are available to that Party (or its
independent accountant) as the Accounting Firm may request, and each Party
shall be afforded the opportunity to present to the Accounting Firm any
materials related to such issues and to discuss the same with the Accounting
Firm. The Purchaser and the Seller shall request that the Accounting Firm
render its determination within sixty (60) days after the date of engagement
and such determination and any required adjustments resulting therefrom shall
be final and binding on all the Parties hereto for purposes of this _Section
2.3_. The obligation to pay the fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall
be paid 50% by the Purchaser and 50% by the Seller. The Accounting Firm may
consider only those items and amounts comprising the Closing Adjustment that
are in dispute, and shall make no other determination.

 



 

(f) If the Closing Adjustment as finally determined in accordance with the
provisions of this _Section 2.3_ is in the Purchasers favor, then the Seller
shall pay to the Purchaser the amount thereof, together with interest accrued
thereon from and including the Closing Date to and including the date
immediately prior to the date of payment at an annual rate equal to the Prime
Rate, as an adjustment to the Cash Consideration. If the Closing Adjustment as
finally determined in accordance with the provisions of this _Section 2.3_ is
in the Sellers favor, the Purchaser shall pay to the Seller the amount
thereof, together with interest accrued thereon from and including the Closing
Date to and including the date immediately prior to the date of payment at an
annual rate equal to the Prime Rate, as an adjustment to the Cash
Consideration. Any payment required by either Party pursuant to this _Section
2.3(f)_ shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds within

subject, in the case of interim financial statements, to (i) the omission of
notes to the extent permitted by SEC Regulation S-X and (ii) normal year-end

 **5.9** ** ****_Financing_** **.**

 



 

(a) At Closing, the Purchaser will have sufficient funds to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and Parent and the Purchaser will
have obtained all Consents and amendments to agreements related to any
material amount of Indebtedness required to ensure that the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement does not and will not result
in a conflict, breach or event of default thereunder or shall have repaid all
obligations thereunder and terminated such agreements.

      
 

 



 

(b) The Purchaser has delivered to the Seller a true and complete copy of the
executed commitment letter, dated as of the date hereof, between Bank of
America, N.A. and the Purchaser (the " _Debt Commitment Letter_ "), pursuant
to which the lender party thereto has agreed, upon the terms and subject to
the conditions thereof, to lend the amounts set forth therein (the "
_Financing_ "). The Debt Commitment Letter has not been amended, restated or
otherwise modified or waived prior to the date of this Agreement, and the
commitments contained in the Debt Commitment Letter have not been withdrawn,
modified or rescinded in any respect prior to the date of this Agreement. The
Debt Commitment Letter is in full force and effect and constitutes the legal,
valid and binding obligation of each of the Purchaser and, to Parents
Knowledge, the other parties thereto. There are no conditions precedent or
contingencies related to the funding of the full amount of the Financing,
other than as expressly set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter, and there are
no side letters or other contracts or arrangements (oral or written) related
to the Financing other than the Debt Commitment Letter and the related fee
letter. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Debt Commitment Letter, the
net proceeds contemplated from the Financing and Parents other cash, will, in
the aggregate, be sufficient for the satisfaction of all of the Purchasers
obligations under this Agreement, including (a) the payment of the Cash
Consideration and any other amounts required to be paid pursuant to Articles
II and III, and (b) the payment of all fees and expenses and other payment
obligations required to be paid or satisfied by the Purchaser in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Financing,
including any repayment or refinancing of Indebtedness of Parent or Purchaser
as a result of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. As of the date of this Agreement, (i) no event has occurred which
would constitute a breach or default (or an event which with notice or lapse
of time or both would constitute a default), in each case, on the part of the
Purchaser under the Debt Commitment Letter or, to Parents Knowledge, any
other party to the Debt Commitment Letter, and (ii) neither Parent nor
Purchaser has any reason to believe that any of the conditions to the
Financing will not be satisfied or that the Financing or any other funds
necessary for the satisfaction of all of the Purchasers obligations under
this Agreement will not be available to the Purchaser at the Closing. As of
the date of this Agreement, neither Parent nor Purchaser is aware of any fact
or occurrence that makes any of the assumptions, or the representations or
warranties of the Purchaser or Parent in the Debt Commitment Letter inaccurate
in any material respect. The Purchaser has fully paid all commitment fees or
other fees required to be paid as of the date of this Agreement pursuant to
the Debt Commitment Letter.

 



 

 **5.10** ** ****_Solvency_** **.** As of the Closing, assuming satisfaction
of the conditions to the obligation of the Seller to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or waiver of such conditions, and
after giving effect to all of the transactions contemplated hereby, including
the Financing, Parent will be Solvent. For the purposes of this _Section
5.10_ the term " _Solvent_ " when used with respect to any Person, means that,
as of any date of determination, (a) the amount of the "fair saleable value"
of the assets of such Person will, as of such date, exceed (i) the value of
all "liabilities of such Person, including contingent and other liabilities",
as of such date, as such quoted terms are generally determined in accordance
with applicable federal laws governing determinations of the insolvency of
debtors, and (ii) the amount that will be required to pay the probable
liabilities of such Person on its existing debts (including contingent
liabilities) as such debts become absolute and matured, (b) such Person will
not have, as of such date, an unreasonably small amount of capital for the
operation of the businesses in which it is engaged or proposed to be engaged
following such date, and (c) such Person will be able to pay its liabilities,
including contingent and other liabilities, as they mature. For purposes of
this definition, "not have an unreasonably small amount of capital for the
operation of the businesses in which it is engaged or proposed to be engaged"
and "able to pay its liabilities, including contingent and other liabilities,
as they mature" means that such Person will be able to generate enough cash
from operations, asset dispositions or refinancing, or a combination thereof,
to meet its obligations as they become due.

 



 

 **5.11** ** ****_Opinion of Financial Advisor_** **.** The Parent Board has
received an opinion from Keefe, Bruyette and Woods to the effect that, as of the
date of such opinion and subject to the assumptions, qualifications and
limitations set forth in such opinion, the consideration to be paid by the
Purchaser for the Company Interests is fair, from a financial point of view,
to the Purchaser.

of the Parent, any investigation, inquiry, review, demand or request for

Claim, proceeding, arbitration or mediation to recover monies due it or for
damages sustained by it in excess of $10,000, individually.

Parent or any of its Subsidiaries specifically for inclusion or incorporation
by reference in the Proxy Statement will, at the date it is first mailed to

respective businesses, assets, financial condition, prospects or otherwise.

 



 

 **5.24** ** ****_Investment Purposes_** **.** Purchaser is an "accredited
investor" as that term is defined in Rule 501 under the Securities Act. The
Company Interests will be acquired by the Purchaser for its own account for

it being understood that the right to dispose of such Company Interests shall
be entirely within the discretion of the Purchaser.

 



 

 **5.25** ** ****_Mortgage Loan Origination and Servicing and Related
Businesses_** **.** Except to the extent that any breach, failure or
inaccuracy, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected

(a) _Licenses and Qualifications. _(i) The Purchaser is in good standing under
all applicable Laws as a mortgage broker and/or lender, (ii) there is no
pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened, cancellation or reduction
of any Loan Sale Agreement, to which the Purchaser is a party and the
obligations of the Purchaser under each such Loan Sale Agreement are being
performed by the Purchaser and the counterparties to each Loan Sale Agreement
in accordance with its terms, and (iii) there is no breach by the Purchaser
under any Loan Sale Agreement and no third party has exercised or, to the
Knowledge of the Parent, is threatening to exercise its contractual right to
require the Purchaser to repurchase any loan that was originated, closed and
funded by the Purchaser that is held for the Purchasers account, whether or
not for future sale or delivery (a " _Purchaser Loan_ ") from such third party
due to a breach of a representation, warranty or covenant by the Purchaser
under a Loan Sale Agreement.

 



 

(b) _Loan Quality; Pipeline_.

 



 

(i) As of the date of this Agreement, no Purchaser Loan has been held for sale
for a period of time after the date of funding that is outside the

principal balance of such Purchaser Loans held for sale for a period of time
after the date of funding that is outside of the requirements of any
applicable Warehouse Line that would constitute a Material Adverse Effect on
the Purchaser.

outstanding principal balance of such Purchaser Loans that are past due with

Material Adverse Effect on the Purchaser.

loan documents and loan files maintained by the Purchaser with respect thereto
are being maintained by the Purchaser in compliance with all applicable Laws
and, if applicable, the requirements of the Person acquiring such Purchaser
Loan and insurer insuring such Purchaser Loan (if any) in effect and
applicable at the time such insurance was obtained, except, in each case, for
immaterial violations as, individually or in the aggregate, do not have, and
would not be reasonably likely to have, a Material Adverse Effect on the
Purchaser. The Purchaser has not done or omitted to do, or caused to be done
or omitted to be done, any act, the effect of which would operate to
invalidate, impair or be a breach of any approvals or licenses of any
Governmental Authority.

 



 

(d) _Servicing. _The Purchaser Loans serviced by the Purchaser are so serviced
in accordance with applicable Laws and with the requirements of any Loan Sale
Agreement, except for immaterial failures to comply with such requirements as,
individually or in the aggregate, do not have, and would not be reasonably
likely

      
 

 



 

to have, a Material Adverse Effect on the Purchaser. No Purchaser Loan is or
has been serviced using predatory servicing practices.

 



 

(e) _Application of Funds. _All monies received with respect to each Purchaser
Loan and related escrow accounts have been properly accounted for and applied.

N.A. in respect of amounts of cash and cash equivalents required to be pledged
for the benefit of Fannie Mae to secure the Purchasers obligations under its
Fannie Mae DUS program. The Purchaser has fully funded such account with all
amounts required and is in full compliance with all requirements of Fannie Mae
with respect to such amounts.

 



 

(i) _Audits and Inquiries. _Except for customary ongoing quality control
reviews, no audit or investigation by a Governmental Authority is pending or,
to the Knowledge of the Purchaser, threatened that is reasonably likely to
result in:

(ii) rescission of any insurance or guaranty contract or agreement of the
Purchaser,

 



 

(iii) payment, by the Purchaser of a penalty (other than any immaterial
payment) to any Governmental Authority; or

_Section 6.2(b)_ would reasonably be expected to violate the terms of such
Contract (it being agreed that Parent and the Purchaser shall use their
reasonable efforts to comply with this _Section 6.2(b)_ in a manner that does
not cause such violation or prohibition) and (C) any restrictions which Parent
reasonably believes upon the advice of outside counsel are necessary to
preserve the attorney-client privilege of any Purchaser Company.

 



 

 **6.3** ** ****_Non-Negotiation_** **.** Each of the Seller and the Company
covenants and agrees that during the Pre-Closing Period neither it nor any of
its respective Affiliates, nor any representatives, officers, directors,
equity holders, employees or other agents of any of the foregoing, will
initiate, solicit, negotiate, discuss, enter into any agreement with respect
to the potential sale of the Company, or a substantial interest therein (or
any other transaction that would be inconsistent with the transaction
contemplated hereby), whether by a sale of assets or stock, merger,
recapitalization, reorganization or other transaction, or provide any
information to any third party in connection with any such potential
transaction. Consistent therewith, each of the Seller and the Company and its
representatives will immediately terminate any existing activities or
discussions with all parties other than Parent and the Purchaser with respect
to any such transactions. Further, each of the Seller and the Company agrees
that it

      
 

 



 

will disclose to the Purchaser any offers or inquiries it receives regarding
any such proposal or offer during the Pre-Closing Period.

 



 

 **6.4** ** ****_Affiliate Transactions_** **.**

 



 

(a) Except as set forth in _Section 6.4(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter,
the Company shall terminate, cancel and discharge, without payment or other
satisfaction all Affiliate Transactions (other than salary or other
compensation or benefits under Employee Benefit Plans paid or payable in the
Ordinary Course to employees of the Company, in each case, in consideration
for bona fide services performed by such employees) on or prior to the Closing
Date.

 



 

(b) On or prior to the Closing Date, Parent and Purchaser agree and
acknowledge that the Contracts set forth on _Section 6.4(b)_ of the Company
Disclosure Letter shall be amended or terminated in Sellers sole discretion
provided that such amendment or terminate does not increase the Companys
obligations or Liabilities thereunder.

 



 

 **6.5** ** ****_Preparation of Proxy Statement; Stockholder Meetings_** **.**

 



 

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this
Agreement, Parent shall prepare and cause to be filed with the SEC a
preliminary Proxy Statement, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to have
the preliminary Proxy Statement cleared by the SEC for delivery to Parents
stockholders as promptly as practicable. Each of the Company and Parent shall
furnish all information (including financial statements and, subject to such
auditors approval, auditors consents) concerning itself, Parents
Subsidiaries and the respective holders of such partys capital stock or other
equity securities to the other and provide such other assistance as may be
reasonably requested by the other in connection with the preparation, filing
and distribution of the Proxy Statement. Parent shall promptly notify the
Seller upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC or any request from the
SEC for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement, and shall promptly
provide the Seller with copies of all correspondence between it and its
representatives, on one hand, and the SEC, on the other hand. Parent shall use
its reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as practicable to any
comments from the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement and to cause the
Proxy Statement and all required amendments and supplements thereto to be
mailed to the holders of Parent Common Stock entitled to vote at the Parent
Stockholders Meeting as promptly as reasonably practicable after the day
Parent is notified by the SEC that it will not be reviewing the Proxy
Statement or that it has no further comments on the preliminary Proxy
Statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to mailing the Proxy Statement
(or any amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the
SEC with respect thereto, Parent (i) shall provide the Seller an opportunity
to review and comment on such document or response (including the proposed
final version of such document or response) and (ii) shall reflect in such
document or response all comments reasonably proposed by the Seller. Parent
shall also comply with and take any other action required to be taken under
the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, the NYSE, the MGCL, any applicable
foreign or state securities or "blue sky" Laws, and the Laws, rules and
regulations thereunder, in connection with the filing and distribution of the
Proxy Statement, the solicitation of proxies from Parent Stockholders
thereunder and the issuance of Parent Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement,
and the Company shall furnish all information concerning the Company and the
holders of its capital stock as may be reasonably requested in connection with
any such actions.

 



 

(b) If, at any time prior to the Closing, any information relating to the
Company or Parent, or any of their respective Affiliates, shall be discovered
by the Company or Parent which, in the reasonable judgment of the Company or
Parent, should be set forth in an amendment of, or a supplement to, the Proxy
Statement, so that the Proxy Statement would not include any misstatement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, the party which discovers such information shall promptly
notify the other Parties, and the Company and Parent shall cooperate in the
prompt filing with the SEC of any necessary amendment of, or supplement to,
the Proxy Statement and, to the extent required by Law, in disseminating the
information contained in such amendment or supplement to stockholders of the
Company and the stockholders of Parent. Nothing in this _Section 6.5(b_)
shall limit the obligations of any Party under _Section 6.5(a_). For purposes
of _Section 4.21_, _Section 5.13_ and this _Section 6.5_, any information
contained in the Proxy Statement concerning or related to the Company or its
Affiliates which

      
 

 



 

has been specifically provided by the Company for inclusion therein will be
deemed to have been provided by the Company, and any information concerning or
related to Parent, its Affiliates or the Parent Stockholders Meeting which has
been specifically provided by Parent for inclusion therein or otherwise
approved by Parent will be deemed to have been provided by Parent.

 



 

 **6.6** ** ****_Parent Stockholders  Meeting_** **.**

 



 

(a) Parent shall take all action necessary, required and within its powers
under applicable Laws to cause the Proxy Statement promptly (and, in any
event, within 10 days of the SECs approval of the Proxy Statement) to be
mailed to the Parent Stockholders and to call, give notice of and hold a
meeting of the Parent Stockholders to vote on the Parent Stockholder Approval
Matter (such meeting, the " _Parent Stockholders  Meeting_"). The Parent
Stockholders Meeting shall be held as promptly as reasonably practicable,
provided that Parent shall hold the Parent Stockholders Meeting not later
than the date that is thirty (30) days following the mailing of the Proxy
Statement to the Parent Stockholders entitled to vote at the Parent
Stockholders Meeting. The Parent Stockholders Meeting shall be subject to
adjournments for up to twenty (20) additional days solely to the extent
necessary to solicit additional proxies if the Required Parent Stockholder
Vote is not obtained as of the initial Parent Stockholders Meeting date.
Parent shall ensure that all proxies solicited in connection with the Parent
Stockholders Meeting are solicited in compliance with applicable Laws.

 



 

(b) Parent agrees that, subject to _Section 6.6(c)_: (i) the Parent Board
shall unanimously recommend that the Parent Stockholders vote to approve the
Parent Stockholder Approval Matter and shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to solicit such approval within the timeframe set forth in _Section
6.6(a_) above; (ii) the Proxy Statement shall include a statement to the
effect that the Parent Board unanimously recommends that the Parent
Stockholders vote to approve the Parent Stockholder Approval Matter (the
unanimous recommendation of the Parent Board that the Parent Stockholders vote
to approve the Parent Stockholder Approval Matter being referred to as the "
_Parent Board Recommendation_ "); and (iii) the Parent Board Recommendation
shall not be withdrawn or modified in any manner, and no resolution by the
Parent Board or any committee thereof to withdraw or modify the Parent Board
Recommendation in any manner shall be adopted or proposed.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section 6.6(b)_,
at any time prior to the Parent Stockholder Approval by the Parent
Stockholders pursuant to the Required Parent Stockholder Vote, the Parent
Board may withhold, amend, withdraw or modify the Parent Board Recommendation
in a manner adverse to the Company if, but only if, the Parent Board
determines in good faith, based on such matters as it deems relevant and based
on the advice of its outside legal counsel, that the failure to withhold,
amend, withdraw or modify such recommendation would result in a breach of its
fiduciary duties under applicable Laws (a " _Change in Recommendation_ ");
_provided_ , that the Seller receives written notice from Parent confirming
that the Parent Board has determined to change its recommendation at least two
(2) Business Days in advance of the Parent Board Recommendation being so
withdrawn, withheld, amended or modified in a manner adverse to the Seller.

 



 

(d) Parents obligation to call, give notice of and hold the Parent
Stockholders Meeting in accordance with _Section 6.6(a)_ shall not be
limited or otherwise affected by any Change in Recommendation.

 



 

 **6.7** ** ****_Efforts to Close; Regulatory and Other Authorizations;

consummate and make effective as promptly as practicable the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby.

 



 

(b) Parent and the Seller shall (and shall cause their applicable Affiliates
to) (i) promptly make all filings and notifications with, and use their

contemplated by this Agreement and obtaining early termination or expiration
of the "waiting period" (as defined by the HSR Act and the Rules promulgated
thereunder)) (collectively, " _Governmental Approvals_ "), (ii) cooperate with
the reasonable requests of each other in promptly seeking to obtain all such
Governmental Approvals and (iii) take all commercially reasonable actions as
may be reasonably necessary to obtain such Governmental Approvals. No Party
shall take any action that would reasonably be expected to have the effect of
delaying, impairing or impeding the receipt of any Governmental Approvals.

 



 

(c) The Parties shall promptly notify each other of any substantive
communication either of them receives from any Governmental Authority, and
shall permit each other to review in advance any proposed substantive
communication to any Governmental Authority, in each case relating to such
Governmental Authoritys review of the transactions contemplated hereby under
the HSR Act. No Party shall agree to participate in any meeting with any
Governmental Authority relating to such Governmental Authoritys review of the
transactions contemplated hereby under the HSR Act unless such Party consults
with the other Parties in advance and, to the extent permitted by such
Governmental Authority, gives the other Parties the opportunity to attend and
participate at such meeting. The Parties will coordinate and cooperate fully
with each other in exchanging such information and providing such assistance
as such Parties may reasonably request in connection with the foregoing. In no
event shall any Party be obligated to provide to any other Party any portion
of its HSR notification filing not customarily furnished to another party in
connection with HSR filings.

 



 

(d) Each Party agrees that it shall, to the extent necessary to obtain any
waiver or Consent from any Antitrust Authority required to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or to avoid the entry of or have
lifted, vacated or terminated any award, writ, injunction, judgment, order or
decree entered, issued, made or rendered by any Antitrust Authority that is in
effect and has the effect of making illegal or otherwise prohibiting the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, take (and
cause their respective Subsidiaries to take) all actions necessary to avoid or
eliminate each and every impediment under any Antitrust Laws so as to enable
the closing to occur as soon as reasonably possible (and in any event no later
than the Outside Date) including (i) proposing, negotiating, committing to and
effecting, by consent decree, hold separate order, or otherwise, the sale,
divestiture or disposition of such businesses, product lines or assets of the
Company, Parent and their respective Subsidiaries and (ii) otherwise taking or
committing to take actions that after the Closing Date would limit Parents or
its Subsidiaries freedom of action with respect to, or its or their ability to
retain, one or more of the businesses, product lines or assets of the Company;
provided, however, neither Parent nor Seller shall be required to take or
cause any of its Subsidiaries to take any actions with respect to their
respective assets or businesses if any action or all of such actions taken
together have, or would reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse
Effect on the applicable Party and its Subsidiaries. In addition, each Party
agrees to litigate or oppose any Governmental Authority in court or
administrative proceedings concerning the Parties entitlement to Governmental
Approvals or regulatory clearances for the transactions contemplated hereby
and, in the event of any such litigation or opposition, each of Parent and
Purchaser , on the one hand, and Seller , on the other hand, shall pay 50% of
all fees and expenses (including attorneys fees) incurred in connection
therewith.

 



 

(e) Except in connection with communications and meetings with Governmental
Authorities in the Ordinary Course and for matters covered by _Section
6.7(c)_, (i) the Parties shall promptly notify each other of any substantive
communication either of them receives from any Governmental Authority relating
to the matters that are the subject of this Agreement and shall permit each
other to review in advance any proposed substantive communication to any
Governmental Authority, and (ii) no Party shall agree to participate in any
meeting with any Governmental Authority relating to the matters that are the
subject of this Agreement unless such Party consults with the other in advance
and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Authority, gives the other
the opportunity to attend and participate at such meeting. The Parties will
coordinate and cooperate fully with each other in exchanging such information
and providing such assistance as such Parties may reasonably request in
connection with the foregoing.

 



 

(f) The Company and Parent shall work together in good faith to identify
material Contracts and/or Permits of the Company and/or the Parent Companies
that require that consent be obtained, or notice be provided, to ensure that
such Contracts and/or Permits will continue in full force and effect without
any change or modification after the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Transaction Documents. The Company or
Parent, as applicable, shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
such written consents, authorizations and approvals or to provide such
notices.

and

 



 

(vii) any entry of the Company into, or amendment by the Company of, any

Agreement, or (ii) determining whether any of the conditions set forth in
_Article 7_ (other than the condition set forth in _Section 7.2(b)_ as to

No such notice shall be deemed to supplement or amend the Parent Disclosure
Letter for the purpose of (i) determining the accuracy of any of the

or (ii) determining whether any of the conditions set forth in _Article 7_
(other than the condition set forth in _Section 7.3(b)_ as to compliance with
this _Section 6.8(b)_) has been satisfied.

 



 

 **6.9** ** ****_Tax Matters_** **.**

 



 

(a) _Payment of Taxes_. Except as otherwise provided in this _Section 6.9_,
the Seller shall retain liability for, shall pay, and shall indemnify and hold
Parent and the Purchaser harmless from and against, all Taxes with respect to
the Company that relates to any taxable period ending on or before the Closing
Date or that relate to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the

Taxes which the Seller has paid and not been reimbursed by Parent or the
Purchaser, or for which the Seller has reimbursed Parent or the Purchaser,
with respect to the Company that relates to taxable periods ending on or
before the Closing Date or that relate to the portion of the Straddle Period
ending on the Closing Date. Except as otherwise provided in this _Section

of Parent and the Purchaser shall be entitled to any refund of Taxes for all
Taxes which either such entity has paid and not been reimbursed by the Seller,
or for which the Parent or the Purchaser has reimbursed the Seller, with
respect to the Company that relates to taxable periods beginning after the
Closing Date or that relate to the portion of the Straddle Period beginning
after the Closing Date.

 



 

(b) _Straddle Period_. Parent, at its sole cost and expense, shall prepare, or
cause to be prepared, and file, or cause to be filed, all non-income Tax
Returns including Tax Returns with respect to Transfer Taxes that are required
to be filed with respect to the Company for any Straddle Period (" _Straddle
Period Non-Income Tax Returns_ "), and Parent shall pay all such non-income
Taxes for such Straddle Period. For purposes of this Agreement, with respect
to any non-income Taxes for a Straddle Period that are imposed on a periodic
basis (including ad valorem, real property and personal property taxes), (i)
the portion of such Taxes attributable to the portion of the taxable period
ending on the Closing Date shall be determined by multiplying the entire Tax
for the Straddle Period by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of
days in the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date and the
denominator of which is the number of days in the Straddle Period, and (ii)
the portion of such Taxes attributable to the portion of the Straddle Period
beginning after the Closing Date shall be determined by multiplying the entire
Tax for the Straddle Period by a fraction, the numerator of which is the
number of days in the portion of the Straddle Period beginning the day after
the Closing Date and ending on the last date of the Straddle Period and the
denominator of which is the number of days in the Straddle Period.

 



 

(c) _Cooperation on Tax Matters_.

 



 

(i) Parent and the Seller shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates
to, cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other
Parties, in connection with any audit, litigation or other proceeding with
respect to Taxes. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the
request of another Party) the provision of records and information which are
reasonably relevant to any such audit, litigation or other proceeding and
making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide
additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder.

 



 

(ii) Parent and the Seller further agree, upon request, to use commercially
reasonable efforts, upon request by another Party, to obtain any certificate
or other document from any Tax Authority or any other Person as may be
necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed
(including without limitation any Tax with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby).

   

     
 

 



 

(d) _Transfer Taxes_. All sales, transfer, documentary, registration and other
similar such Taxes (including, without limitation, charges for or in
connection with the recording of any instrument or document as provided in
this Agreement, but excluding any Taxes that are based on or measured by
income or gain) (" _Transfer Taxes_ ") payable in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be timely paid 50% by the
Purchaser and 50% by the Seller. Purchaser shall prepare, or cause to be
prepared, and file, or cause to be filed, all Tax Returns that are required to
be filed with respect to the Company with respect to Transfer Taxes payable in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Purchaser
and the Seller shall each cooperate in providing the other with all
information reasonably required by such party in connection with the
preparation and filing of such Tax Returns.

 



 

(e) _Allocation of Seller s Consideration_.

 



 

Within thirty (30) days following the Closing, the Seller shall, in good faith
consultation with the Purchaser, identify a Valuation Expert reasonably
satisfactory to the Purchaser to determine the fair market value of the Stock
Consideration, which fair market value may, if in the view of the Valuation
Expert doing so is appropriate, reflect restrictions on the liquidity of the
Stock Consideration as a block. The Valuation Expert may consult with the
Seller and the Purchaser in the course of making its determination, and Seller
and Purchaser shall each reasonably cooperate with the Valuation Expert and
supply the Valuation Expert with such information as it may reasonably
request. Within fifteen (15) days after it has been appointed, the Valuation
Expert shall by the terms of its agreement with the Seller and Purchaser
inform in writing the parties as to its determination of the fair market value
of the Stock Consideration and the reasons therefor. The Seller will bear one
hundred percent (100%) of the fees and expenses of the Valuation Expert.

 



 

 **6.10** ** ****_Parent Board Designees_** **.**

 



 

(a) Prior to the Closing, Parent shall cause Parent Board and the Nominating
and Corporate Governance Committee of the Parent Board to take all actions
(including making any filings and disclosures, and taking any other actions,
necessary to comply with applicable Law and NYSE Rules) so that, at any time
following the Closing, without any further action by Parent or the Parent
Board, Seller shall have the right to cause (i) the Parent Board to be
increased from eight (8) members to eleven (11) members and (ii) up to two (2)
individuals designated by the Seller or its equityholders, as soon as
reasonably possible after the date on which Seller or its equityholders elects
to exercise such right (and in any event not later than two (2) days
thereafter (each such individual, and any successor thereto, substitute
therefor or replacement thereof designated by the Seller or its equityholders
as provided herein, being referred to herein as a " _Board Designee_ " and
collectively as the " _Board Designees_ ") become members of the Parent Board,
filling the vacancies created by the increase in the size of the Parent Board.

 



 

(b) Promptly following the request of the Parent Board or the Nominating and
Corporate Governance Committee thereof (which request shall, in the case of
any individual designated by the Seller pursuant to _Section 6.10(a)_, be
deemed to have been made immediately upon such designation), any individual
designated by the Seller for election (including pursuant to _Section
6.10(a)_) as a director shall (i) furnish (A) a completed director and officer
questionnaire with respect to the background and qualifications of such
person, substantially in the form provided to and requested to be completed by
the then current members of the Parent Board, and (B) such nominees consent
to Parents engaging in a background check of such nominee (including through
a third party investigation firm), and information reasonably necessary to
complete such a background check, in a manner consistent with background
checks customarily engaged in by Parent for prospective new members of the
Parent Board, and (ii) make himself or herself available for interviews by the
Parent Board (and/or the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee
thereof). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 6.10_, in
the event that the Parent Board determines in good faith, after consideration
by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the Parent Board and
consultation with outside legal counsel, that its nomination, appointment or
election of a particular Board Designee (including a Board Designee designated
by the Seller from the list of potential candidates set forth on _Schedule C_
pursuant to _Section 6.10(a)_) would constitute a breach of its fiduciary
duties to the Parent Stockholders (provided that any such determination with
respect to any individual designated by the Seller pursuant to _Section
6.10(a)_ shall be made no later than forty-five (45) days after the
individuals compliance with the first sentence of this _Section 6.10(b)_),
then the Parent Board shall inform the Seller of such determination in writing
and explain in reasonable detail the basis for such determination and shall
nominate another individual designated for

      
 

 



 

nomination, election or appointment to the Parent Board by the Seller (subject
in each case to this _Section 6.10(b)_) and the Parent Board and Parent shall
take all of the actions required by this _Section 6.10_ with respect to the
election of such substitute Board Designee, effective immediately following
the Sellers request to appoint such substitute Board Designee. It is hereby
acknowledged and agreed that the fact that a particular Board Designee is an
affiliate, director, professional or agent of the Seller or of any of its
Affiliates, shall not in and of itself constitute an acceptable basis for such
a determination by Parent Board.

 



 

(c) Subject to _Section 6.10(d)_, at the annual meeting of shareholders of
Parent to be held during the 2013 and 2014 calendar years, or at any special
meeting of shareholders of Parent held prior to Parents 2014 annual meeting
of shareholders at which directors of Parent are to be elected, or at any
taking of action by written consent of shareholders of the Company prior to
Parents 2014 annual meeting of shareholders with respect to which directors
of Parent are to be elected (each a " _Director Election_ "), the Seller shall
have the right (but not the obligation) to designate two (2) nominees for
election to the Board of Directors (such nominee, the " _Seller Nominees_ ")
at such Director Elections. At or prior to any Director Election: (i) Parents
Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee (or any other committee
exercising a similar function) shall recommend to the Parent Board the
nomination of the Seller Nominees for election to the Parent Board, and (ii)
the Parent Board shall recommend to the Parent Stockholders the election of
the Seller Nominees to the Parent Board. Parent shall exercise all authority
under applicable Law to cause the Seller Nominees to be elected to the Parent
Board at any Director Election, including, without limitation, using its
reasonable efforts to solicit from the shareholders of Parent eligible to vote
in the election of directors of Parent proxies in favor of the Seller Nominee.

 



 

(d) At any time that Seller and its Affiliates (which, solely for purposes of
this _Section 6.10_, shall include Fortress Investment Group LLC and its
Affiliates) cease to collectively own, directly or indirectly, at least 20% of
the Parent Common Stock outstanding as of the Closing Date (after giving
effect to the transactions contemplated hereby), Seller shall forfeit the
right to nominate and appoint one (1) Board Designee, effective as of the next
Parent Stockholder Meeting at which directors are elected. At any time that
Seller and its Affiliates (which, solely for purposes of this _Section 6.10_,
shall include Fortress Investment Group LLC and its Affiliates) cease to
collectively own, directly or indirectly, at least 10% of the Parent Common
Stock outstanding as of the Closing Date (after giving effect to the
transactions contemplated hereby), Seller shall forfeit the right to nominate
and appoint one (1) Board Designee, effective as of the next Parent
Stockholder Meeting at which directors are elected. Each Seller Nominee shall
be entitled to receive the same annual cash and equity consideration as is
paid to the other directors of the Parent Board during any year during which
such Seller Nominee serves on the Parent Board.

 



 

(e) Any Board Designee shall be subject to applicable confidentiality
requirements and other policies of Parent generally applicable to members of
the Parent Board (including Parents insider trading and disclosure policies)
as in effect from time to time, at any time while he or she is on the Parent
Board to the same extent as the other directors on the Parent Board. With
respect to each Board Designee, Parent shall enter into an indemnification
agreement with and for the benefit of such Board Designee, in each case, in
form and substance that is no less favorable to such Board Designee as the
most director favorable indemnification agreement to which Parent is a party
as of the date of this Agreement. The Seller shall be entitled to assign any
or all of its rights hereunder to any of its Affiliates.

 



 

 **6.11** ** ****_Financing_** **.**

 



 

(a) During the Pre-Closing Period, the Company shall provide, and shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause its representatives, including legal
and accounting advisors, to provide, commercially reasonable cooperation
requested by the Purchaser in connection with the Financing (provided that
such requested cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing
operations of the Company), including (i) participation in a reasonable number
of meetings, presentations, due diligence sessions and sessions with rating
agencies, (ii) providing access to materials reasonably required in connection
with the Financing, (iii) assisting with the preparation of materials for bank
information memoranda and similar documents required in connection with the
Financing, (iv) at Closing executing and delivering any pledge and security

any event not later than three Business Days after the occurrence) of (i) any

surrender the proceeds from such sale less any costs, fees and expenses
incurred by Seller in connection with such sale of such shares to such
Purchaser Indemnified Party. For the avoidance of doubt, the time frame during
which Seller is required to deliver such Losses shall be concurrent with the
time frame in which Seller is able to sell such shares of Parent Common Stock
to a bona fide third party purchaser.

 



 

 **9.2** ** ****_Indemnification of the Seller_** **.**

 



 

(a) After the Closing, the Purchaser shall indemnify each of the Seller and
its Affiliates and their respective directors, members, officers, equity
holders, partners, employees, agents, subsidiaries, representatives and
successors and assigns (collectively, the " _Seller Indemnified Parties_ ,"
and together with the Purchaser Indemnified Parties, the " _Indemnified
Parties_ "), and save and hold each of the Seller Indemnified Parties harmless
from and against and pay or reimburse the Seller Indemnified Parties as and
when incurred for:

 



 

(i) any and all Losses which any Seller Indemnified Party may suffer, sustain
or become subject to, to the extent resulting from or arising out of any
inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty of the Parent or the
Purchaser contained in this Agreement as of the date hereof or as of the
Closing Date;

 



 

(ii) any and all Losses which any Seller Indemnified Party may suffer, sustain
or become subject to, to the extent resulting from or arising out of any
nonfulfillment or breach of any covenant or agreement on the part of the
Company after the Closing or on the part of the Parent or the Purchaser;

 



 

(iii) any and all (i) Taxes of the Company for all taxable periods ending
after the Closing Date (as allocated, in the case of a Straddle Period,
pursuant to _Section 6.9(a)_ hereof), or (ii) Transfer Taxes for which the
Purchaser is responsible pursuant to _Section 6.9(d)_.

 



 

(b) The representations and warranties of Parent and the Purchaser contained
in this Agreement and in any certificate delivered pursuant to _Section 3.3_
of this Agreement shall survive the Closing and continue in full force and
effect (i) in the case of the representations and warranties set forth in
_Sections 5.1(a)_, _5.2_ , _5.4_ and _5.22_ , indefinitely; (ii) in the case
of representations and warranties set forth in _Sections 5.19_ and _5.21_
until sixty (60) days following the expiration of the applicable statute of
limitations (including any extension thereof) with respect to the subject
matter of such representations and warranties; and (iii) in the case of all
other representations and warranties, until the date that is twelve (12)
months following the Closing Date. The representations and warranties
identified in clause (i) of the immediately preceding sentence are referred to
herein as the " _Purchaser Fundamental Representations_." Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, if written notice of any claim for
indemnification hereunder has been delivered in accordance herewith prior to
the expiration of the representation or warranty upon which such claim is
based, the relevant representations and warranties shall not expire but solely
as to such claim, and such claim may be pursued until the final resolution of
such claim in accordance with the provisions of this _Article 9_.

 



 

(c) The Purchaser shall not be liable to Seller Indemnified Parties under
_Section 9.2(a)(i)_ and, solely with respect to covenants to be performed
prior to the Closing Date, _Section 9.2(a)(ii)_ unless and until

   

     
 

 



 

the Losses incurred by all Seller Indemnified Parties pursuant thereto exceed,
in the aggregate, the Deductible, in which case the Purchaser shall be liable,
subject to _Sections 9.2(d)_ , (e) and _(f)_ , to the applicable Seller
Indemnified Party for the full amount of the Losses in excess of the
Deductible.

 



 

(d) The aggregate amount required to be paid by the Purchaser for claims for
indemnification made under _Section 9.2(a)(i)_ and, solely with respect to
covenants to be performed prior to the Closing Date, _Section 9.2(a)(ii)_
shall not exceed Twenty-Two Million Dollars ($22,000,000).

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, (i) _Sections
9.2(c)_ and _9.2(d)_ shall not apply to Losses in connection with, resulting
from or arising out of directly or indirectly, any inaccuracy in or breach of
a Purchaser Fundamental Representation or any of the representations and
warranties set forth in _Section 5.21_, any breach of a covenant required to
be performed following the Closing or fraud with respect to Purchasers or
Parents representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement, and (ii)
no indemnification payment made by the Seller with respect to any matter
described in clause (i) of this subsection (e) shall be included in
calculating whether the cap in _Sections 9.2(d)_ has been met.

 



 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, in
no event shall the Purchaser be required to pay any amounts in satisfaction of
claims for indemnification under the provisions of this Agreement in excess of
an amount equal to the Sellers Consideration actually received by the Seller
in the aggregate.

 



 

 **9.3 _Indemnification Procedure_.**

 



 

(a) No Indemnified Party may seek indemnification under this _Article 9_,
unless such Indemnified Party shall have first delivered written notice to the
Seller or the Purchaser, as the case may be (for purposes of this Article 9,
the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") of the facts and circumstances (set forth in
reasonable detail) giving rise to the claim within the applicable survival
period for such claim as set forth in _Section 9.1_ or _Section 9.2_, as
applicable.

 



 

(b) If any Claim shall be brought or asserted by any third party which, if
adversely determined, would entitle the Indemnified Party to indemnity
pursuant to this _Article 9_ (a " _Third Party Claim_ "), the Indemnified
Party shall promptly notify the Indemnifying Party of such Third Party Claim
in writing, specifying the basis of such Third Party Claim and the facts
pertaining thereto, and the Indemnifying Party, if the Indemnifying Party so
elects, may assume and control the defense thereof at the Indemnifying Partys
expense (and shall consult with the Indemnified Party with respect thereto),
including the employment of counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified
Party. If the Indemnifying Party is permitted to assume and control the
defense of a Third Party Claim and elects to do so, the Indemnified Party
shall have the right to employ counsel separate from counsel employed by the
Indemnifying Party in any such action and to participate in the defense
thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel employed by the Indemnified
Party shall be at the expense of the Indemnified Party unless (A) the
Indemnifying Party has specifically agreed in writing otherwise, (B) the
Indemnified Party has been advised by outside counsel that a reasonable
likelihood exists of a material conflict of interest between the Indemnifying
Party and the Indemnified Party, or (C) the Indemnifying Party has failed to
assume the defense and employ counsel; in which case the fees and expenses of
the Indemnified Partys counsel shall be paid by the Indemnifying Party. If
the Indemnifying Party has assumed the defense of a Third Party Claim in
accordance with the terms hereof, the Indemnifying Party may not enter into a
settlement or consent to any judgment without the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Party unless (i) such settlement or judgment involves monetary
damages only, all of which will be paid (subject to the limitations of this
_Article 9_) by the Indemnifying Party and there is no admission of fault or
culpability on behalf of any Indemnified Party, and (ii) a term of the
settlement or judgment is that the Person or Persons asserting such Third
Party Claim unconditionally and irrevocably release all Indemnified Parties
from all liability with respect to such Third Party Claim; otherwise, the
consent of the Indemnified Party shall be required in order to enter into any
settlement of, or consent to the entry of a judgment with respect to, any
Third Party Claim. A failure by an Indemnified Party to give timely, complete
or accurate notice as provided in this _Article 9_ shall not affect the
rights or obligations of any Party hereunder except and only to the extent
that, as a result of such failure, any Party entitled to receive such notice
was directly and materially damaged as a result of such failure to give timely
notice. If the Indemnifying Party does not assume and/or is not controlling
the defense of a Third Party Claim for any reason, the Indemnifying Party
shall have the right to employ counsel separate from counsel

      
 

 



 

employed by the Indemnified Party in any such action and to participate in the
defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel employed by the
Indemnifying Party shall be at the expense of the Indemnifying Party. The
Indemnified Party may not enter into a settlement or consent to any judgment
of any Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying
Party (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned).

 



 

(c) Any claim by an Indemnified Party for indemnification other than
indemnification against a Third Party Claim will be asserted by giving the
Indemnifying Party written notice thereof, and the Indemnifying Party will
have a period of sixty (60) calendar days within which to respond to such
claims. If the Indemnifying Party does not so respond within such sixty (60)
calendar day period, the Indemnifying Party will be deemed to have accepted
such claim.

 



 

 **9.4 _Materiality Qualifiers_.** For purposes of determining the amount of
Losses arising from a breach for which an Indemnified Party is entitled to
indemnification under this _Article 9_ (but not for purposes of determining
whether an indemnifiable breach has occurred), all qualifications contained in
the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement that are based
on materiality (including all usages of "material," "Material Adverse Effect"
or similar qualifiers) will be disregarded.

 



 

 **9.5 _Investigation_.** An Indemnified Partys right to indemnification,
payment of Losses or other remedies based on any representation, warranty,
covenant or obligation of another Party contained in or made pursuant to this
Agreement shall not be affected by any investigation conducted by such
Indemnified Party or any of its representatives or any knowledge acquired (or
capable of being acquired) by any such Indemnified Party or its
representatives, in each case, at any time, whether before or after the
execution and delivery of this Agreement or the Closing.

 



 

 **9.6 _No Right of Contribution_.**

 



 

(a) Effective upon the Closing, the Seller waives, and acknowledges and agrees
that it shall not have and shall not exercise or assert (or attempt to
exercise or assert), any right of contribution, right of indemnity or other
similar right or remedy against the Company in connection with any actual or
alleged breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or obligation of the
Company or the Seller set forth in this Agreement.

 



 

 **9.7 _Payment_.**

 



 

(a) Any indemnification obligation under this Agreement for any Losses shall
be reduced by the amount of any insurance proceeds or any indemnity,
contribution or other similar payment actually received by the Indemnified
Party from any third party with respect thereto, reduced by the amount of any
expenses and increase in applicable premiums/retro-premiums related to the
recovery of such proceeds. In the event that any insurance or other recovery
is recognized or received by any Indemnified Party with respect to any
indemnification obligation for which any such Indemnified Party has been
indemnified under this Agreement, then a refund equal to the aggregate amount
of the recovery (up to the aggregate amount previously paid by the
Indemnifying Party in respect of such indemnification obligation) shall be
made promptly to the Indemnifying Party, net of any expenses and increase in
applicable premiums/retro-premiums related to the recovery of such proceeds.

 



 

(b) Payments of all amounts owing by an Indemnifying Party under this _Article
9_ shall be made promptly upon a final settlement among the Indemnifying Party
and the Indemnified Parties or upon a final adjudication determined by a court
of competent jurisdiction that an indemnification obligation is owed by the
Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party under this _Article 9_.

 



 

 **9.8 _Adjustment to Consideration_.** Any indemnification received under
this _Article 9_ shall be treated by Purchaser and the Seller and their
respective Affiliates, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, as an
adjustment to the consideration received by the Seller.

 



 

 **9.9 _Exclusive Remedy_.** Other than the rights of the Parties to seek
specific performance, injunctive or other equitable relief, or in the case of
fraud with respect to the Parties respective representations and warranties

      
 

 



 

set forth in this Agreement, the provisions of this Agreement set forth the
exclusive rights and remedies of the Parties to seek or obtain damages or any
other remedy or relief from any Party with respect to matters arising under
this Agreement after the Closing.

 



 

 **ARTICLE 10 
MISCELLANEOUS**

 



 

 **10.1 _Successors and Assigns; Assignment_.** This Agreement, the other
Transaction Documents and any other agreement, document or instrument executed
and delivered in connection herewith shall bind and inure to the benefit of
the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns. No Party
may assign its rights under this Agreement except with the prior written
consent of the other Parties, which consent may be given or withheld in such
Parties sole discretion; _provided_ , _however_ , that the any Party may (i)
assign its rights and remedies hereunder as collateral security to any bank or
other financial institution that has loaned funds or otherwise extended credit
to it or any of its Affiliates or (ii) assign its rights under this Agreement
to any Affiliate; _provided_ that, in each case, no such assignment shall
relieve the assignor of its liabilities and obligations hereunder.

 



 

 **10.2 _Notices_.** Any notice to be given by any Party to this Agreement
shall be given in writing and may be effected by facsimile, personal delivery,
overnight courier or e-mail (provided receipt of such email is evidenced by a

conditioned. If any Party is unable to obtain, after reasonable effort, the

all other Transaction Documents, contains the entire agreement among the
Parties pertaining to the transactions contemplated hereby, and fully
supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, if any, among the Parties
pertaining to such transactions, provided that the Confidentiality Agreement,

(the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ") shall remain in full force and effect
until the Closing.

 



 

 **10.8 _Severability_.** If any provision of this Agreement is determined by
a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, the

construction: (a) words in the singular shall be held to include the plural

causing any instrument to be drafted; and (k) each accounting term not

accordance with GAAP.

 



 

 **10.10 _Binding Effect_.** This Agreement shall not be binding upon any
Party unless and until the all Parties have executed this Agreement.

 



 

 **10.11 _Choice of Law_.** As part of the consideration and mutual promises
being exchanged and given in connection with this Agreement, the Parties agree
that all claims, controversies and disputes of any kind or nature arising
under or relating in any way to the enforcement or interpretation of this
Agreement or to the Parties dealings, rights or obligations in connection
herewith, including disputes relating to the negotiations for, inducements to
enter into, or execution of, this Agreement, and disputes concerning the
interpretation, enforceability, performance, breach, termination or validity
of all or any portion of this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the
State of Delaware, regardless of the laws that might otherwise govern under
applicable principles of conflicts of laws thereof.

 



 

 **10.12 _Consent to Jurisdiction_.** Each of the Parties irrevocably and
unconditionally submits, for itself and its property, to the exclusive
jurisdiction of (a) any Delaware State court and (b) the United States
District Court for the District of Delaware, for the purposes of any
Litigation arising out of this Agreement or any transaction contemplated
hereby (and each agrees that no such Litigation relating to this Agreement
shall be brought by it or any of its Affiliates except in such courts). Each
of the Parties further agrees that, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law, service of any process, summons, notice or document by U.S.
registered mail to such Persons respective address set forth in _Section
10.2_ shall be effective service of process for any Litigation in Delaware
with respect to any matters to which it has submitted to jurisdiction as set
forth above in the immediately preceding sentence. Nothing in this Agreement
will affect the right of any Party to serve process in any other manner
permitted by Law. Each of the Parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally
waives (and agrees not to plead or claim) any objection to the laying of venue
of any Litigation arising out of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby in (a) any Delaware State court or (b) the United States
District Court for the District of Delaware, or that any such Litigation
brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.

 



 

 **10.13 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL._** EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE
FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL
BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF,
UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES
THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF ANY
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT
AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT
BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVER AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION
10.13_.

 



 

 **10.14 _Survival of Covenants_.** The covenants of the Parties to be
performed subsequent to Closing shall survive Closing for the periods stated
therein or, if no period is stated, until they have been fully performed.

 



 

 **10.15 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_.** This Agreement is not intended to,
and shall not, confer any rights or remedies upon any Person other than the
Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns, except as
otherwise expressly provided in _Section 6.11(c)_ and _Article 9_. The
representations and warranties in this Agreement are the product of
negotiations among the Parties and are for the sole benefit of the Parties.
Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are subject to waiver
by the Parties in accordance with _Section 10.3_ without notice or liability
to any other Person. The representations and warranties in this Agreement
represent an allocation among the Parties of risks associated with particular
matters, regardless of the knowledge of any of the Parties. Except as
otherwise expressly provided in _Article 9_, Persons other than the Parties
may not rely upon the representations and warranties in this Agreement as
characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this
Agreement or as of any other date.

      
 

 



 

 **10.16 _Counterparts_.** This Agreement may be executed in one or multiple
counterparts, and all such executed counterparts shall constitute the same
agreement. It shall be necessary to account for only one such counterpart in
proving the existence of terms of this Agreement.

 



 

 **10.17 _Electronic Execution and Delivery_.** A facsimile, PDF or other
reproduction of this Agreement may be executed by one or more Parties, and an
executed copy of this Agreement may be delivered by one or more Parties by
facsimile, e-mail or other electronic transmission device pursuant to which
the signature of or on behalf of such Party can be seen, and such execution
and delivery shall be considered valid, binding and effective for all
purposes. At the request of any Party, all Parties agree to execute an
original of this Agreement as well as any facsimile or reproduction thereof.
The Parties hereby agree that neither shall raise the execution of facsimile,
PDF or other reproduction of this Agreement, or the fact that any signature or
document was transmitted or communicated by facsimile, e-mail or other
electronic transmission device, as a defense to the formation of this
Agreement.

 



 

 **10.18 _Specific Performance_.** The Parties acknowledge that their
obligations hereunder are unique and that remedies at law, including monetary
damages, will be inadequate in the event any Party should default in or breach
the performance of its obligations under this Agreement. Accordingly, in the
event of any such breach, the non-defaulting, non-breaching Parties shall be
entitled to equitable relief, without the proof of actual damages, including
in the form of an injunction or injunctions or orders for specific performance
to prevent defaults and breaches of this Agreement and to order the defaulting
or breaching party to affirmatively carry out its obligations under this
Agreement, and such defaulting or breaching Party hereby waives any defense to
the effect that a remedy at law would be an adequate remedy for such breach or
that an award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any
reason of law or equity. Such equitable relief shall be in addition to any
other remedy to which the Parties are entitled to at law or in equity as a
remedy for such default, breach or threatened breach. Each Party hereby waives
any requirements for the securing or posting of any bond or other security or
showing actual damages in connection with such equitable remedy. The foregoing
shall not be deemed to be or construed as a waiver or election of remedies by
any Party, each of which expressly reserve any and all rights and remedies
