permit or property thereunder or would violate any applicable Law
(collectively, a "Non-Assignable Asset"), in each case, without first
obtaining all such necessary Consents of such Third Parties as set forth on
Section 2.2(c) of the Seller Disclosure Letter, and this Agreement and the
Restructuring shall not be deemed to constitute a sale, contribution,

use reasonable best efforts to, with Seller's participation and assistance,
obtain the necessary approvals, consents and waivers to effect the sale,

Seller or its applicable Affiliate (provided that neither Buyer nor any of its
Affiliates shall be required to compensate any Third Party, commence or
participate in any litigation, or offer or grant any concession (financial or
otherwise) to any Third Party to obtain any such consent, approval or waiver).

the Closing to effect the sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance and delivery
of any Non-Assignable Asset, such sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance and
delivery shall be reasonably promptly effected in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement and/or the Restructuring, for no additional consideration,

delivered to Buyer within such sixty (60) day review period, or if Seller
delivers a written acceptance of the Preliminary Closing Statement during such
sixty (60) day period, then the components contained in the Preliminary
Closing Statement prepared by Buyer shall be used to calculate the Final
Closing Date Payment, and the Final Closing Date Payment shall become final,
conclusive, binding and non-appealable as of the end of the sixty (60) day
review period or, if earlier, the date of receipt by Buyer of such written
acceptance. In connection with its review of, or any dispute with respect to,
the Preliminary Closing Statement, Seller and its Representatives shall be
given reasonable access, during normal business hours and upon reasonable
notice, to all relevant work papers, schedules, memoranda and other documents
prepared by Buyer, the Acquired Companies or any of their Affiliates, and to
the finance personnel thereof, and any other information which Seller
reasonably requests, and Buyer shall, and shall cause the Acquired Companies
and their Affiliates to, cooperate with Seller in connection therewith. (c)In the event that Seller delivers a Dispute Notice to Buyer, Seller and
Buyer shall cooperate in good faith to resolve such dispute as reasonably
promptly as practicable and upon such resolution, if any, any adjustments to
the Preliminary Closing Statement or to the Closing Net Working Capital, the
Closing Net Securitization Asset Amount, the Closing Cash, the Closing
Indebtedness or the Closing Transaction Expenses calculated therein agreed to
in writing by Seller and Buyer shall be final, conclusive, binding and non-
appealable upon all Parties. If Seller and Buyer are unable to resolve any
such dispute within twenty (20) Business Days (or such longer period as Seller
and Buyer shall mutually agree in writing) of Seller's delivery of such
Dispute Notice, the specific items or components of the Preliminary Closing
Statement that are still in dispute shall be submitted to the dispute
resolution department of KPMG LLP or, if such accounting firm is unable or
unwilling to serve in such role, another independent nationally recognized
accounting, valuation firm to be agreed upon by Seller and Buyer acting
reasonably (either such firm, the "Settlement Accountant"). The Settlement
Accountant shall determine whether and to what extent, if any, such items or
components of the Preliminary Closing Statement require adjustment; provided
that (i) the Settlement Accountant may consider only those items and amounts
(and related items and amounts) on the Preliminary Closing Statement and/or
the Preliminary Closing Statement as to which Seller and Buyer have disagreed
within the time periods and on the terms specified above, and (ii) the
Settlement Accountant's determination of any disputed amount set forth on the
Preliminary Closing Statement and/or the Preliminary Closing Statement may
neither be less than the lower, nor more than the higher, of Seller's and
Buyer's respective calculations of such amount as set forth in the Dispute
Notice. The Settlement Accountant shall be instructed to use reasonable best
efforts to make its final determination within thirty (30) days of submission
by the Parties of the dispute to it and, in any case, as promptly as
practicable after such submission. The Settlement Accountant's written
determination shall be final, conclusive, binding and non-appealable on the
Parties and all Acquired Companies, absent manifest error. All negotiations
pursuant to this Section 3.5(c)shall be treated as compromise and settlement
negotiations for purposes of Rule 408 of the Federal Rules of Evidence and
comparable state rules of evidence, and all negotiations and submissions to
the Settlement Accountant, and the dispute resolution proceedings under this
Section 3.5(c), shall be treated as confidential information. All fees and
expenses of the Settlement Accountant incurred pursuant to this Section 3.5(c)
shall be borne by Buyer, on the one hand, and Seller, on the other hand, in
proportion to the final allocation made by the Settlement Accountant of the
disputed items weighted in relation to the claims made by Seller and Buyer,
such that the prevailing party pays the lesser proportion of such fees, costs
and expenses. For example, if Seller claims that the appropriate adjustments
are $1,000 greater than the amount determined by Buyer and if the Settlement
Accountant ultimately resolves the dispute by awarding to Seller $300 of the
$1,000 contested, then the fees, costs and expenses of the Settlement
Accountant shall be allocated thirty percent (30%) (i.e., 300 divided by
1,000) to Buyer and seventy percent (70%) (i.e., 700 divided by 1,000) to
Seller. Subject to limitations set forth in Section 3.5(b), Buyer and Seller
shall make available to the Settlement Accountant and to each other all
relevant books and records and working papers relating to the Preliminary
Closing Statement and the Dispute Notice (including reasonable access during
reasonable business hours to personnel at the Acquired Companies who prepared
the Preliminary Closing Statement) and all other items reasonably requested by
the Settlement Accountant. The Preliminary Closing Statement, Closing Net
Working Capital, the Closing Net Securitization Asset Amount, the Closing
Cash, the Closing Indebtedness and the Closing Transaction Expenses calculated
therein (i) if deemed final in accordance with Section 3.5(b) because there is
no Dispute Notice given, (ii) as otherwise amended through a mutually agreed
upon writing by Buyer and Seller, or (iii) if a Dispute Notice has been timely
delivered by Seller in accordance with Section 3.5(b), and not otherwise
mutually agreed upon in writing by Buyer and Seller, as finally determined by
the Settlement Accountant in accordance with this Section 3.5(c), shall be
used to calculate the "Final Closing Date Payment"). (d)If the Final Closing Date Payment exceeds the Estimated Closing Date
Payment (the amount of such excess, the "Additional Purchase Price"), then,
within three (3) Business Days following such determination, Buyer shall pay
to Seller the Additional Purchase Price by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account designated in writing by Seller.

(e)If the Estimated Closing Date Payment exceeds the Final Closing Date
Payment (the amount of such excess, the "Shortfall Amount"), then within three
(3) Business Days following such determination, Seller shall pay to Buyer, the
Shortfall Amount by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated in writing by Buyer.

(f)Seller and Buyer agree to treat all payments made either to or for the
benefit of the other pursuant to this Section 3.5 as adjustments to the
Closing Date Payment for all Tax purposes, except as otherwise required by
applicable Law.

result in the loss of trade secret rights in and to such information. Each
employee or independent contractor who has contributed to the development of
Intellectual Property owned by an Acquired Company has entered into a valid
and enforceable agreement (or has similar obligations by operation of law)
assigning to an Acquired Company or a predecessor owner such employee's or
contractor's rights in and to such Intellectual Property and obligating such

security of the Systems (and all information stored or contained therein or
transmitted thereby from any unauthorized intrusion, breach, use, access,
interruption or modification by any Person) and to ensure that all Systems are
fully functional and operate and run in a reasonable and efficient business
manner. For the three (3) years prior to the date of this Agreement, there
have been no failures, breakdowns, outages, bugs, continued substandard
performance, or other adverse events affecting any of the Systems that have
caused or could reasonably be expected to result in the substantial disruption
or interruption in or to the Business which have not been resolved. The
Systems are sufficient for the operation of the Business in all material
respects. Each of the Acquired Companies and Seller and its other Affiliates
(with respect to the Business) has taken commercially reasonable steps to
ensure that the Business can continue to operate in all material respects in
the event of a failure of the Systems, has implemented and maintains
commercially reasonable back-up and disaster recovery plans, and has in place
commercially reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect
against the unauthorized or unlawful processing of, or accidental loss,
destruction or damage of, data.

(d)Each of the Acquired Companies has been, and is, in compliance in all
material respects with all Data Security Requirements. For the three (3) years

unauthorized use or theft of, access to, or intrusion or breach of security
with respect to, (i) any of the Systems, or (ii) any personal information,
payment card information, confidential or proprietary data, or any other
information collected, maintained, or stored by or on behalf of the Business
or any of the Acquired Companies (or any loss, destruction, compromise, or
unauthorized disclosure thereof) in any material respect. During the three (3)
years prior to the date of this Agreement, no Acquired Company nor Seller nor
any of its other Affiliates (with respect to the Business) has received, or
been subject to, any notice, complaint, investigation, inquiry or enforcement
proceedings from any Person, alleging material non-compliance with the Data

that requires the disclosure, licensing, or distribution of any source code
for any portion of the proprietary Software or of any Intellectual Property
owned by an Acquired Company, or otherwise requires an Acquired Company to
distribute any proprietary Software of an Acquired Company on a royalty-free
basis. Each Acquired Company and Seller and its Affiliates (with respect to
the Business) has taken commercially reasonable steps to maintain the source
code to the proprietary Software of the Acquired Companies in confidence and
(i) the source code of such proprietary Software has not been disclosed to any
Person other than employees and contractors subject to valid and enforceable
written agreements (or similar obligations by operation of law) providing for
confidentiality, (ii) there is no current or contingent obligation to disclose
any such source code to any other Person, and (iii) no Person other than the
Acquired Companies (and such employees and contractors) is in possession of
any such source code. Each Acquired Company is in material compliance with all

than routine claims for benefits, there are no Actions pending or, to the
Knowledge of Seller, threatened in writing with respect to any Seller Plan,
except as would not result in a material Liability to any of the Acquired
Companies, Buyer or any of its Affiliates. (c)Each Seller Plan intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code

similar documents required to be filed with any Governmental Entity or
distributed to any Seller Plan participant have been timely filed or
distributed. None of the Acquired Companies have incurred, nor do any of them

to adversely affect any such approval or good standing; (ii) that is intended
to qualify for special Tax treatment meets all requirements for such
treatment; and (iii) if required to be book reserved, funded or insured, is so
reserved, funded or insured, in compliance with applicable Laws. No Foreign

reasonably expected to arise in connection with the Transaction. (g)Neither the execution of this Agreement nor the Transaction could (either

events, directly or indirectly): (i) result in any payment becoming due or
increase the amount of any compensation due to any current or former Business
Employee or any other natural service provider to the Business, (ii) increase
any compensation or benefits otherwise payable under, or trigger any funding
obligation under or to, any Seller Plan, (iii) accelerate the time of payment,

under Section 4999 or Section 409A of the Code.

Section 4.17 Compliance with Laws

written notice, inquiry, or internal or external allegation, (ii) made any
voluntary or involuntary disclosure to a Governmental Entity or (iii)

whole. Neither any Acquired Company nor Seller (in each case, to the extent
relating to the Business), have or has within the three (3) years prior to the
date of this Agreement received any written claims, notices or complaints
regarding the use or processing by the Business or the Acquired Companies of
any personal data or other personally identifiable information and non-public
information of individuals, except as would not, individually or in the

Governmental Entity or its agents has resulted in material adverse findings,
directives, requests, Orders, or corrective actions, that have not been fully
resolved, implemented, or otherwise remain outstanding. None of Seller nor any
Acquired Company has received written notice from any Governmental Entity
threatening to suspend, revoke, withdraw or modify any such Consent and none
of the material Consents are reasonably expected to be terminated as a result
of or in connection with the Transaction or any Transaction Documents.

between Buyer and Barclays, Deutsche Bank AG New York Branch, Deutsche Bank
Securities Inc., Bank of America, N.A. and BofA Securities, Inc. (the "Debt

all exhibits, schedules and annexes thereto and the executed fee letter
associated therewith and referenced therein (which fee letters may be redacted

similar economic terms (including flex terms) set forth therein)), dated as of
November 6, 2019, between an Affiliate of Buyer and Wells Fargo Bank, National
Association, and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., London Branch (the "Securitization
Commitment Letter" and, together with the Debt Commitment Letter,
collectively, the "Debt Financing Commitments"), pursuant to which Debt
Financing Sources party thereto have committed, subject only to the terms and
conditions expressly set forth therein, to provide debt financing and
securitization financing, respectively, in the amounts set forth therein for
the purposes of funding the Transaction and terminating the existing U.S.
securitization facilities of the Acquired Companies (the "Debt Financing") and
(iii) the executed equity commitment letter (including all exhibits, schedules
and annexes thereto), dated as of November 6, 2019, between Buyer and the
Guarantors (the "Equity Financing Sources" and such equity commitment letter,
the "Equity Financing Commitments" and, together with the Debt Financing
Commitments, the "Financing Commitments"), pursuant to which the Equity
Financing Sources have committed, subject only to the terms and conditions
expressly set forth therein, to provide equity financing in the amounts set
forth therein for the purposes of funding the Transaction (the "Equity
Financing" and, together with the Debt Financing, the "Financing"). (b)The Equity Financing Commitments provide, and will continue to provide,
that Seller is an express Third Party beneficiary thereof on the terms
specified therein with respect to the provisions specified therein. Each of
the Financing Commitments, as delivered, is in full force and effect on the
date of this Agreement and, as of the date of this Agreement, the respective
commitments contained in the Financing Commitments have not been withdrawn,
rescinded or terminated, or otherwise amended, supplemented or modified in any
respect, and no withdrawal, rescission, termination, amendment, supplement or
modification is contemplated (except in connection with any amendments or
modifications to effectuate any "market flex" terms contained in the Debt
Financing Commitments provided as of the date hereof or to add any additional
agents or other financial institutions thereto as provided for therein). As of
the date of this Agreement, the Financing Commitments constitute legal, valid
and binding obligations of Buyer and, to the knowledge of Buyer, the other
parties thereto, enforceable in accordance with its respective terms against
the parties thereto (except as may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,
fraudulent transfer, moratorium, reorganization, preference or similar Laws of
general applicability relating to or affecting the rights of creditors
generally and subject to general principles of equity (regardless of whether
enforcement is sought in equity or at law)). As of the date of this Agreement,
Buyer has fully paid (or caused to be fully paid) any and all commitment fees,
costs and expenses or other fees, costs and expenses required to be paid on or
prior to the date of this Agreement pursuant to the Financing Commitments, and
Buyer will fully pay (or will cause to be fully paid), after the date of this
Agreement, any and all other commitments or other fees, costs and expenses
pursuant to the Financing Commitments as and when they become due and payable.
Except for the Financing Commitments and as set forth therein, there are no
other agreements, side letters, understandings or other arrangements of any
kind to which Buyer or any of its Affiliates is a party that (i) relate to the
Financing, or (ii) impose additional conditions, or modify, amend or expand
the conditions to the funding of the Financing in a manner that would impair
the availability of the Financing. Assuming satisfaction of the conditions set
forth in Article X, as of the date of this Agreement, Buyer does not know of
any facts or circumstances that could be expected to result in Buyer being
unable to satisfy, prior to Closing, any term or condition of Closing to be
satisfied by it contained in the Financing Commitments, or that could
otherwise cause the Financing to be unavailable on the Closing Date. As of the
date of this Agreement, no party to any Financing Commitment has notified
Buyer, or any of its Affiliates, of its intention to terminate the Financing
Commitment or not to provide the Financing.

(c)As of the date of this Agreement, no event has occurred or circumstance
exists which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would (x)
constitute a default or breach on the part of Buyer or, to Buyer's knowledge,
any other party thereto under any term or condition of any of the Financing
Commitments or (y) result in any portion of the Financing Commitments being
unavailable on the Closing Date. As of the date of this Agreement, neither
Buyer nor any of its Affiliates has any reason to believe (both before and
after giving effect to any market flex provisions contained in the Debt
Financing Commitments) that any of the terms or conditions contained in the
Financing Commitments will not be satisfied on a timely basis on or before the
Closing Date or that the full amounts committed pursuant to the Financing will
not be available to Buyer on the Closing Date if the terms or conditions to be
satisfied by it contained in the Financing Commitments are satisfied. The
aggregate proceeds contemplated by the Financing Commitments and cash held by
Buyer will be sufficient for Buyer to (i) pay the Closing Date Payment, (ii)
to pay any and all fees and expenses required to be paid by Buyer in
connection with the Financing or the Transaction, (iii) (without duplication
to clause (i)), to satisfy when due all of the payment obligations of Buyer
required pursuant to this Agreement to consummate the Transactions and the
Financing on or prior to the Closing, (iv) repay or refinance all Indebtedness
set forth in Section 7.21(a) of the Seller Disclosure Letter required to be
repaid, refinanced, redeemed and (v) terminate and repay in full the Apple
Ridge Funding LLC securitization program (as in effect on the date hereof) of
the Acquired Companies (clauses (i) through (v), the "Required Amount"). (d)Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Buyer has caused the
Guarantors to deliver a true, accurate and complete copy of the fully executed
Limited Guaranty (including all exhibits, schedules and annexes thereto),
dated as of the date of this Agreement, to Seller. The Limited Guaranty is in
full force and effect and has not been withdrawn or terminated or otherwise
amended, supplemented or modified in any respect. The Limited Guaranty is a
legal, valid and binding obligation of the Guarantors, enforceable against the
Guarantors in accordance with its terms. The execution and delivery of the
Limited Guaranty by each Guarantor, and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated thereby in accordance with the terms thereof, do not (i) violate,
conflict with or result in a default (whether after the giving of notice,
lapse of time or both) under, or give rise to a right of termination of any
provision of the Organizational Documents of such Guarantor, (ii) violate or
result in a violation of, or constitute a default (whether after the giving of
notice, lapse of time or both) under, any provision of material Law applicable
to such Guarantor, or (iii) violate, conflict with or result in a default
(whether after the giving of notice, lapse of time or both) under, or give
rise to a right of termination under, or require any Consent under, any
material Contract to which such Guarantor is a party. No event has occurred or
circumstance exists that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, could
constitute a default or breach on the part of the Guarantors under such
Limited Guaranty.

(e)Buyer acknowledges that, subject in all respects to Article XI and Section
13.8(b), its obligations set forth in this Agreement are not contingent or
conditioned upon Buyer's, its Affiliate's or any other Person's ability to
obtain financing (including the Financing or any Alternative Financing) for or

consolidated basis shall (i) be able to pay its debts as they become due; (ii)
own property having a fair saleable value greater than the amounts required to
pay debts (including a reasonable estimate of the amount of all contingent
liabilities); and (iii) have adequate capital to carry on its business. No
transfer of property is being made and no obligation is being incurred in
connection with the Transaction with the intent to hinder, delay or defraud
either present or future creditors of Buyer.

Section 6.8 Brokers. No broker, investment banker, financial advisor or other
Person is entitled to any broker's, finder's, financial advisor's or other
similar fee or commission in connection with this Agreement or the Transaction
based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of Buyer or any of its
Affiliates.

Section 6.9 No Reliance. Buyer has conducted, to its satisfaction, its own
independent investigation, review and analysis of the business, results of
operations, prospects, condition (financial or otherwise) or assets of the
Acquired Companies, and acknowledges that it and its Representatives (a) have

properties, premises, equipment, contracts and other assets of the Acquired
Companies which it and its Representatives have deemed necessary to review and
(ii) the "data rooms" and "virtual data rooms" in connection with the
Transaction, and (b) have had adequate opportunity to meet with the management
of Seller and the Acquired Companies and to discuss the business and assets of

Transaction, Buyer has relied solely on the results of its own independent
review and analysis and the covenants, representations and warranties in this
Agreement (including Article IV and Article V), the other Transaction
Documents and the certificate contemplated in Section 10.2(d). Buyer hereby
acknowledges that, notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the
contrary, (x) neither Seller, any of the Acquired Companies, nor any other Person, makes

with respect to the Acquired Companies or their respective business or
operations, including with respect to the accuracy or completeness of any
information provided or made available to Buyer or any of its Representatives

and Article V),the other Transaction Documents and the certificate

available to Buyer or any of its Representatives or any information developed
by Buyer or any of its Representatives other than those expressly given solely
by Seller in this Agreement (including Article IV and Article V), the other
Transaction Documents and the certificate contemplated in Section 10.2(d). In
connection with Buyer's independent investigation, Buyer, as well as its
Representatives, may have certain projections and other forecasts, including

acknowledges that (i) there are uncertainties inherent in attempting to make

uncertainties and is taking responsibility for making its own evaluation of

modification to be made to, or any waiver of any provision or remedy under, or
any replacement of, any of the Debt Financing Commitments if such amendment,
supplement, replacement, modification or waiver would reasonably be expected
to: (x) reduce (or have the effect of reducing) the aggregate amount of the

original issue discount in respect of the Debt Financing) such that the
aggregate Financing that would be available on the Closing Date would not be
sufficient to pay the Required Amount; (y) impose any new or additional
conditions or contingencies to the Debt Financing Commitments in a manner that

Buyer shall promptly deliver to Seller copies of any amendment, modification,
supplement or waiver to or under, or any replacement of, any Debt Financing
Commitment.

Commitments, in each case, by any party thereto, of which Buyer becomes aware;
and (iii) the occurrence of any event or development that would reasonably be
expected to adversely impact the ability of Buyer to obtain all or any portion
of the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitments on the
terms and conditions, in the manner or from the sources contemplated by any of
the Debt Financing Commitments. If any portion of the Debt Financing becomes
unavailable on the terms and conditions (including any market flex provisions)
thereof or from the Debt Financing Sources contemplated in the Debt Financing
Commitments or any of the Debt Financing or Debt Financing Commitments (or any
definitive financing agreement relating thereto) shall expire or be withdrawn,
terminated, repudiated or rescinded, in whole or in part, for any reason (but
without limiting the obligations of Buyer in this Section 7.3(a)) (unless such
portion of the Debt Financing is not reasonably required to consummate the
Transaction), Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to (x) arrange and
obtain, as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event,
alternative financing from the same or alternative sources (the "Alternative
Financing") in an amount sufficient to consummate the Transaction with terms
and conditions not materially less favorable in the aggregate to Buyer than
those set forth in the Debt Financing Commitments (or replace any unavailable
portion of the Financing) and (y) obtain a debt financing commitment letter
(including any associated fee letter) with respect to such Alternative
Financing, true, accurate and complete copies of which shall be promptly
provided to Seller upon execution thereof (which fee letters may be redacted
with respect to any interest rates, fee amounts, pricing caps and other
similar economic terms (including flex terms) set forth therein). The
Alternative Financing (A) shall be sufficient to pay, when added to the Equity
Financing and the remaining Debt Financing (if any), the Required Amount and
(B) shall not include conditions or contingencies that could reasonably be
expected to materially impair, delay or prevent or make less likely to occur
the funding of the Debt Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions to the
Debt Financing) on the Closing. For purposes of this Agreement, references to
the term "Debt Financing Commitments" shall mean the Debt Financing
Commitments as permitted or required to be amended, supplemented, modified or
replaced by this Section 7.3, and references to the "Debt Financing" and the
"Financing" shall include the financing contemplated by the Debt Financing
Commitments as permitted or required to be amended, modified, supplemented or
replaced by this Section 7.3. (d)Buyer shall not agree to, or permit, any amendment or modification of, or
waiver under, or replacement of, the Equity Financing Commitments or other
documentation relating to the Equity Financing other than to increase the
amount of the Equity Financing. In addition, Buyer shall take, or use its
reasonable best efforts to cause to be taken, all actions and do, or use its
reasonable best efforts to cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to obtain the Equity Financing, including to (i) maintain in effect
the Equity Financing Commitments, (ii) satisfy on a timely basis all
conditions applicable to Buyer in such Equity Financing Commitments that are
within its control, (iii) consummate the Equity Financing at or prior to the
Closing, (iv) enforce its rights (including through litigation) under the
Equity Financing Commitments, including seeking any specific performance of
the parties' obligations thereunder and (v) cause the Equity Financing Sources
and any other Person providing financing to fund the Equity Financing no later
than the Closing.

(e)Notwithstanding anything contained in this Section 7.3 or anything else in
this Agreement, in no event shall the reasonable best efforts of Buyer be
deemed or construed to required Buyer to, and Buyer shall not be required to,
(x) incur or pay any fees to obtain a waiver or amendment of any term of the
Debt Financing Commitments or fees (in the aggregate) in excess of those
contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitments as of the date hereof, (y)
agree to conditionality or economic terms of the Debt Financing Commitments
that are less favorable than those contemplated by the Debt Financing or
related fee letter (including any flex provisions therein) as of the date
hereof, or (z) seek equity financing from a Person other than the Guarantors
or in an amount in excess of the Equity Financing Commitments as of the date
hereof.

(f)Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, but without
limiting or amending the provisions of Article XI or Section 13.8, Buyer
acknowledges and agrees that its obligations set forth in this Agreement are
not contingent or conditioned upon any Person's ability to obtain financing
for or in connection with the Transaction.

Section 7.4 Financing Cooperation. (a) (a) (a)Prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall use, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries (including the Acquired Companies) to use, reasonable best
efforts to provide reasonable cooperation as is customary in connection with
the arrangement and reasonably requested by Buyer in connection with the

portion of the Debt Financing, including reasonable assistance with the

in connection with obtaining financing, including providing customary
authorization letters to the Debt Financing Sources as contemplated by the
Debt Financing Commitments (provided that such customary authorization letters
(or the bank information memoranda, offering memoranda or private placement
memoranda in which such letters are included) shall include language that
exculpates Seller, the Acquired Companies and their respective Representatives
from any liability in connection with the use or misuse by the recipients
thereof of the information set forth in any such bank confidential information
memoranda or similar memoranda or report distributed in connection therewith);
(iv) furnish to the Debt Financing Sources at least three (3) Business Days
prior to the Closing Date (to the extent requested at least ten (10) Business

beneficial ownership and anti-money laundering rules and regulations,
including the PATRIOT Act to the extent required by the Debt Financing
Commitments; (v) request customary accountants' consents with respect to

its counsel in delivery of customary legal opinions by Buyer and its counsel
in connection with effectuating the Debt Financing; (vii) provide such

customary information documents used in financings of the type contemplated by
the Debt Financing Commitments (including any offering or private placement of
non-convertible debt securities pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities
Act) as of the date hereof (provided that other than with respect to the
Required Financial Information, Seller shall have no obligation to provide any
financial or other information that is not reasonably available to Seller);
(viii) prevent the offer, placement, issuance or arrangement of any debt
securities or bank or other credit facilities by or on behalf of the Acquired
Companies (but excluding any debt securities or bank or other credit

securitization and mortgage repurchase facilities, indebtedness incurred in
the ordinary course of business (including, without limitation, working
capital facilities, capital lease obligations, purchase money and equipment
financings, borrowings of revolving credit loans and letters of credit) of the
Retained Business) that would reasonably be expected to have a material
adverse impact on the primary syndication of the Debt Financing Commitments;
provided that notices, requests for consent and other contacts with customers
shall not be required prior to Closing; (ix) take all actions (including
delivery of all notices and any other documents, obtain all Consents, delivery
of any reports (including any audits, field exams and requested weekly report
information) and any financial data (including on a pro forma basis), and
execute any agreements, transfers, or amendments) necessary to facilitate the
sale of the receivables under the securitization facilities included in the
Debt Financing; (x) cooperate as reasonably requested in connection with the
obtaining, amending, funding and the taking of any other action otherwise
required in connection with any securitization financing included as part of
the Debt Financing; (xi) take such corporate actions as shall be reasonably

Financing (including (subject to and contingent upon the Closing) the Acquired
Companies executing agreements to pledge, grant security interests in, and
otherwise grant liens on, the assets of the Acquired Companies); (xii) if all
or any portion of the Debt Financing is taking the form of secured notes as
provided in the Debt Commitment Letters, execute and deliver a customary
certificate of the chief financial officer (or other comparable officer) of
the Seller in customary form with respect to financial information
constituting Required Financial Information that is included in the offering
materials used in connection with the offer and sale of secured notes as
reasonably requested by the Debt Financing Sources; and (xiii) request and
facilitate the independent auditors of the Acquired Companies to (A) provide
comfort letters (including "negative assurance" comfort and change period
comfort) with respect to financial information relating to the Acquired
Companies as reasonably requested by Buyer as necessary or customary for
financing similar to the Debt Financing (including any offering or private
placement of debt securities pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act)
and (B) participating in accounting due diligence sessions. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary set forth herein, in no event shall Seller or any of
its Affiliates (including the Acquired Companies) be required to: (1) pay any
commitment or other similar fee or reimburse any expenses with respect to the
Debt Financing, or incur any other actual or potential liability in connection
with the Financing (excluding in connection with any authorization letters
delivered by Seller in connection with the Debt Financing or contemplated by
clause (iii) above); (2) take any actions to the extent such actions would
unreasonably interfere with their respective ongoing business or operations;

result in any violation or breach of, or default (with or without notice or
lapse of time, or both) under, any of their respective organizational and
governing documents, any applicable Laws or any Contract to which such Person
is a party; (4) cause any condition to Closing set forth in Article X to not
be satisfied or otherwise cause any breach of this Agreement; (5) provide
access to or disclose information that Seller reasonably determines would
violate any attorney-client privilege of, or conflict with any confidentiality
requirements applicable to, Seller or any or any of its Affiliates (including
the Acquired Companies) or waive or eliminate any privilege (provided that in
the case of any confidentiality obligation, Seller shall, to the extent
permitted by such confidentiality obligations, notify Buyer if any such
information that Buyer or any Debt Financing Source has specifically
identified and requested is being withheld as a result of any such obligation
of confidentiality); provided, that if all or any portion of the Debt
Financing is taking the form of secured notes as provided in the Debt
Commitment Letter, Buyer will take reasonable steps to ensure that the
Required Financial Information does not contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make
the statement contained in the Required Financial Information, in the context
in which it was made, not misleading; (6) become an issuer or other obligor
with respect to the Debt Financing, except, solely in the case of the Acquired
Companies, unless and until the Closing occurs; (7) take any action that could
result in any director, officer or employee of Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries (including the Acquired Companies) to incur or have any personal
liability under the Debt Financing Commitments or any other agreements related
to the Debt Financing or having to give any indemnity in connection with the
Debt Financing (except, solely in the case of the Acquired Companies, unless
and until the Closing occurs); (8) deliver or cause the delivery of any legal
opinions in connection with the Debt Financing; or (9) execute or deliver, or
take any corporate or other action to adopt or approve, any document,
agreement, certificate or instrument with respect to the Financing, except,

Financing or contemplated by clause (iii) above, and, solely in the case of
the Acquired Companies, that would be effective prior to the Closing. Seller
consents to the reasonable use of the logos of the Acquired Companies in
connection with the Debt Financing if such logos are used solely in a manner
that is not intended to or reasonably likely to harm or disparage Seller, any
of its Affiliates (including the Acquired Companies) or the reputation or
goodwill of any of the foregoing.

(b)Except as otherwise provided by Section 7.4(c) or Section 7.4(d) with
respect to providing the financial information required to be delivered
thereunder, whether or not the Closing occurs, Buyer shall, reimburse Seller,
on the earlier of the Closing Date or the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with Article XI, for all out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred
by Seller or any of its Representatives in connection with such cooperation
pursuant to Section 7.4(a) or otherwise in connection with the Financing,
including reasonable fees and expenses of legal, accounting and other
advisors. Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller and its
Representatives from and against any and all Damages suffered or incurred by
any of them in connection with the Financing and any information used in
connection therewith, except to the extent any such Damage results from the
Fraud, bad faith, willful misconduct or gross negligence of Seller as
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final and non-appealable
judgment. (c)Without limiting the generality of the foregoing provisions of Section

out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by Seller or any of its
Representatives in connection with the preparation, review and audit of the
Required Financial Information described in clauses (i) - (ix) above pursuant

addition, Seller covenants and agrees that, following the Closing Date, it
will provide Buyer and the independent accountants for the Business with
reasonable access to all books, records and other information within it or its
Affiliates' control and access to Seller's and its Affiliates' independent
accountants and accounting and financial reporting personnel in order to
enable Buyer and the independent accountants for the Business and statutory
auditors to prepare, support and complete such other financial statements and

Commitments or Law for periods ending on or prior to Closing Date or that
include the Closing Date, including as such financial statements or financial
information may be audited or reviewed by the independent accountants for
Buyer or the Business as provided in applicable Statement on Auditing
Standards; provided, however, that Buyer acknowledges that Seller shall have
the right to prepare all financial statements in respect of the Business with
respect to any period ending on or prior to the Closing Date and Buyer shall
not separately require cooperation to prepare such financial statements to the
extent that Seller is timely preparing and delivering such financial
statements to Buyer. Buyer shall reimburse Seller promptly upon request for
all costs and expenses incurred by it and its Affiliates (including any fees
and costs of auditors) in connection with providing information pursuant to
the immediately foregoing sentence of this Section 7.4(d).

(e)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, it is
understood and agreed that the condition precedent set forth in Section
10.2(b), as applied to Seller's obligations under Section 7.4(a) shall be
deemed to be satisfied unless the Debt Financing has not been obtained as a
result of Seller's breach of its obligations under Section 7.4(a) and such
breach remains uncured as of the date that is ten (10) days following receipt
of written notice by Seller of such breach from Buyer.

Section 7.5 Directors and Officers Liability.

(a)From and after the Closing, Buyer shall cause the applicable Acquired
Companies to (i) indemnify and hold harmless each present and former director,
officer or equivalent positions in non-U.S. entities of such Acquired
Companies (collectively, the "Covered Persons"), against any Damages incurred
or suffered by any of the Covered Persons in connection with any liabilities
or any Action, arising out of or pertaining to matters existing or occurring
prior to the Closing, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Closing, to the fullest extent that the Acquired Companies would have been
permitted under the Organizational Documents of such Acquired Companies as in
effect on the date of this Agreement, to indemnify such Covered Persons and
(ii) advance expenses as incurred by any Covered Person in connection with any
matters for which such Covered Person is entitled to indemnification from
Buyer pursuant to this Section 7.5(a) to the fullest extent permitted under
such Organizational Documents of such Acquired Companies; provided, however,
that the Covered Person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking
to repay such advances if it is ultimately finally determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction and all rights of appeal have lapsed, that such Covered
Person is not entitled to indemnification under applicable Law, the
Organizational Documents of the Acquired Companies, or pursuant to this
Section 7.5(a).

(b)For a period of six (6) years following the Closing, Buyer shall cause each
Acquired Company to maintain in effect a directors' and officers' liability
insurance policy covering those persons who are currently covered by such
Acquired Company's directors' and officers' liability insurance policy with
coverage in amount and scope at least as favorable as Buyer's existing
coverage.

(c)Buyer hereby agrees that it will not (i) cause or permit any Acquired
Company to amend or modify the indemnification provisions in the
Organizational Documents of such Acquired Company or (ii) amend or revoke any
indemnification agreement between any Acquired Company and its director or
officer currently in effect, in each case, in any way that diminishes or
adversely affects the indemnification or exculpation provisions as provided
therein or herein. (d)In the event that Buyer, the Acquired Companies or any of their respective
successors and assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving entity in such consolidation or
merger, (ii) has all of its equity securities purchased by or transferred or
conveyed to any Person or (iii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Buyer or the
Acquired Companies, as the case may be, fulfill and comply with the
indemnification and other obligations set forth in this Section 7.5. Any such
assumption of the obligations of Buyer or the Acquired Companies, as the case
may be, shall not operate to release, relieve, waive, terminate or modify the
obligations of Buyer or the Acquired Companies, as the case may be, under this
Section 7.5.

(e)The terms and provisions of this Section 7.5 are intended to be in addition
to the rights otherwise available to the Covered Persons by applicable Law or
the Organizational Documents, and shall operate for the benefit of, and shall
be enforceable by, the Covered Persons and their respective heirs and
Representatives, each of whom is an intended Third Party beneficiary of this
Section 7.5.

Section 7.6 Regulatory and Other Authorizations. (a)In accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Agreement, each Party shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to
cause the conditions set forth in Article X to be satisfied as soon as
practicable following the date of this Agreement (giving effect, among other
things, to the remaining provisions of this Section 7.6 (including the last
sentence of this Section 7.6(a) and Section 7.6(b)) and in any event on or
prior to the Outside Date (as the same may be extended in accordance with this

avoid an Action by, any Governmental Entity necessary in connection with the
consummation of the Transaction; (ii) the defending of any Actions, whether
judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or the consummation of
the Transaction, performed or consummated by such Party in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement, including seeking to have any stay or temporary
restraining order entered by any court or other Governmental Entity vacated or
reversed; and (iii) the execution and delivery of any additional instruments
reasonably necessary to consummate the Transaction and any other transactions
to be performed or consummated by such Party in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement and to carry out fully the purposes of this Agreement. Each
Party shall (x) promptly (and in no event later than ten (10) Business Days
following the date of this Agreement) make and not withdraw its respective
filings under the HSR Act, (y) as promptly as reasonably practicable, make any
other applications and filings as reasonably determined by the Parties to be

respective filings set forth on Section 7.6(a) of the Seller Disclosure
Letter; neither Buyer nor Seller shall, without prior written consent of the
other Party (not to be unreasonably delayed, conditioned, or withheld

herewith)): (i) withdraw its filing under the HSR Act or any other applicable
Antitrust Laws or (ii) commit to or agree with any Governmental Entity to
stay, toll or extend any applicable waiting period under the HSR Act or
applicable Antitrust Laws or to delay consummation of the Transaction.

(b)Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, and shall cause its
Affiliates to use their reasonable best efforts to take, promptly any and all
steps necessary to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment and obtain all
Consents under any Antitrust Laws that may be required by any foreign or U.S.
federal, state or local Governmental Entity, in each case, with competent
jurisdiction, so as to enable the parties to consummate the Transaction as
promptly as practicable, including committing to or effecting, by consent
decree, hold separate orders, trust, or otherwise, the sale or other
disposition of such assets or businesses as are required to be divested, or
other behavioral remedies or other commitments, in each case, in order to
avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of or vacate or lift, any
Order, that would otherwise have the effect of preventing or materially
delaying the consummation of the Transaction as promptly as practicable.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Buyer will not be
obligated to take or refrain from taking, or to agree that Buyer will take or
refrain from taking, any action, or to suffer to exist any condition,
limitation, restriction or requirement that with any other actions,
conditions, limitations, restrictions or requirements, would result in, either
individually or in the aggregate, the reduction, on a pro forma basis, of
annual revenues of Buyer and its Affiliates (including the Acquired Companies)
on a combined basis by an amount in excess of $30,000,000 of revenues for the
year ended December 31, 2018. (c)Each Party shall furnish to the other Party such necessary information and

Companies, (B) as necessary to comply with contractual arrangements, (C) as
necessary to comply with applicable Law, and (D) as necessary to address
reasonable privilege or confidentiality concerns; provided, further, that
Buyer and Seller may reasonably designate any competitively sensitive material
provided to the other under this Section 7.6(c) as "Outside Counsel Only." The
foregoing obligations in this Section 7.6(c) shall be subject to any attorney-
client, work product or other privilege considerations. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, each of Buyer and Seller shall consult and
cooperate with one another, and consider in good faith the views of one
another, in connection with any analyses, appearances, presentations,
memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals made or submitted by or
on behalf of any Party hereto in connection with proceedings under or relating
to the HSR Act or any applicable foreign antitrust or competition-related
Antitrust Law. Buyer and Seller shall cooperate fully with each other in
connection with the making of all such filings or responses.

(d)Notwithstanding anything in this Section 7.6 to the contrary, nothing in
this Section 7.6 shall require, or be deemed to require, Seller or any of its
Affiliates to propose, negotiate, offer to commit, effect or agree to (i) any
sale, divestiture, license or disposition of assets or businesses of the
Acquired Companies or (ii) any behavioral remedy of the Acquired Companies
that is not conditioned on the occurrence of the Closing.

Section 7.7 Shared Contracts; Required Third Party Consents.

(a)The Parties acknowledge that Seller and its Affiliates are parties to
certain contracts set forth on Section 7.7(a) of the Seller Disclosure Letter
that relate to both the operations or conduct of the Business and the Retained
Business (the "Shared Contracts"). From the date of this Agreement until the
earlier of termination of this Agreement or the Closing, the Parties shall
reasonably cooperate and shall use their respective commercially reasonable
efforts to separate the Shared Contracts and obtain the agreement of the
counterparties to each such Shared Contract to enter into a new Contract (or
an amendment thereto, as applicable), effective as of the Closing Date or as
soon thereafter as is reasonably possible, pursuant to which Seller or its
Affiliate, as applicable, will receive substantially the same goods, services
and Intellectual Property rights provided to Seller and its Affiliates with
respect to the Business as of the date of this Agreement pursuant to the
Shared Contract (the "Shared Contract Rights") on terms and conditions
substantially similar to those contained in the Shared Contract as of the date
of this Agreement (each, a "Replacement Contract") and to cause the applicable
counterparty to release Buyer and its applicable Affiliates from any
obligations under the Shared Contract that become the obligation of Seller or
its Affiliates under the Replacement Contract. If one or more Replacement
Contracts are not so obtained (unless the Parties otherwise agree in writing
or unless doing so would not be permitted by applicable Law, the terms of the
applicable Shared Contract or the applicable counterparty) for a reasonable
period of time following the Closing (not to exceed six (6) months), Buyer
will, or will cause its applicable Affiliate to, use commercially reasonable
efforts, and Seller will cooperate in all reasonable respects with Buyer
and/or its Affiliates, as applicable, so that Seller or its Affiliates, as
applicable, receive the benefits of the Shared Contract Rights following the

the Closing, all Contracts between an Acquired Company, on the one hand, and
Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than an Acquired Company), on the other
hand (collectively, "Terminating Agreements"), shall be terminated as between
them without any further force and effect, and there shall be no further
obligations of any of the relevant parties thereunder. Buyer agrees to take
and to cause the Acquired Companies and their Subsidiaries to take any action
following the Closing that would be required to give effect to the termination
of the Terminating Agreements. (b)Except as set forth in Section 7.13(b) of the Seller Disclosure Letter, all

Company, on the one hand, and Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than an
Acquired Company), on the other hand, effective upon the Closing, shall be
eliminated (by way of capital contribution, cash settlement or as otherwise
determined by Seller in its sole discretion) prior to the Calculation Time, in
each case without any Liability to any Acquired Company.

(c)At or prior to Closing, Seller shall cause each confidentiality and

design or engineering of products or creation of Intellectual Property, on the

Seller Disclosure Letter (collectively, the "Assigned Contracts") to be
assigned with respect to the Business to Buyer (or an Acquired Company

Subsidiaries' respective right, title and interest (if any) in and to all
assets and property (including any and all Intellectual Property rights and
registrations and applications therefor, including any of the foregoing for
which ownership interests arise through the operation of any assignment
provisions in employment agreements or employee invention assignment
agreements) that are listed on Schedule 7.13 attached hereto and all other

interest of Seller and/or any of its Subsidiaries in any assets or property
(including any and all Intellectual Property rights and registrations and
applications therefor) of the Acquired Companies, including all assets located
on the premises of any Acquired Company or otherwise conveyed to the Acquired
Company hereunder, in each case other than the Excluded Assets.

Section 7.14 Seller Guarantees. With respect to each Seller Guaranty, Buyer
shall use its reasonable best efforts to (a) cause itself or one or more of
its Affiliates to be substituted in all respects for Seller or any of its

obligations of Seller or its Affiliates under any Seller Guaranty by offering
such beneficiary a guaranty of Buyer of like character and on terms (financial
and otherwise) no less favorable to such beneficiary and (b) arrange for the
release effective at or as soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing of
Seller and its Affiliates from their respective obligations to the beneficiary
of such Seller Guaranty. To the extent any Seller Guarantees are not
terminated or released, from and after the Closing, Buyer shall (i) indemnify,
defend and hold harmless Seller and its Representatives (individually, a
"Seller Indemnified Person" and collectively, the "Seller Indemnified
Persons") from and against any and all Damages incurred by any of them
relating to the Seller Guarantees and (ii) not permit any of the Acquired
Companies or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates to (x) renew or extend the
term of or (y) increase its obligations under, or transfer to another Third
Party, any loan, lease, Contract or other obligation for which any Seller
Indemnified Person is or would reasonably be expected to be liable under such
Seller Guaranty. The failure by Buyer or its Affiliates to achieve any such
substitution or release shall not (A) constitute a failure to satisfy any
condition set forth in Article X, (B) relieve Seller from its obligation to
consummate the Transaction or any of the other Transaction Documents or (C)
relieve Buyer from its obligation under Section 12.3. Section 7.15 RandW Insurance Policy. The Parties acknowledge that, as of the
date of this Agreement, Buyer has obtained a binder to the RandW Insurance
Policy, a true and correct copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit B. The
Parties further acknowledge that obtaining the RandW Insurance Policy is a
material inducement to Seller entering into the Transaction and the other
Transaction Documents, and that Seller is relying on Buyer's covenants and
obligations set forth in this Section 7.15. Buyer shall bear the cost of all
fees, expenses and premiums relating to the procurement and binding of the RandW
Insurance Policy. Prior to and after the Closing, Buyer shall take all
commercially reasonable actions necessary to complete the conditions in the
conditional binder to the RandW Insurance Policy within the times set forth
therein so that the RandW Insurer will issue the RandW Insurance Policy. The RandW
Insurance Policy shall provide that the RandW Insurer shall waive and not pursue
any subrogation rights against Seller, except for Fraud. Following the
Closing, the RandW Insurance Policy may not be amended in any manner materially
adverse to Seller (including with respect to the subrogation provisions,
policy term, retention amount or coverage amount), and neither Buyer nor any
of Buyer's Affiliates shall cause the cancellation of the RandW Insurance
Policy, without Seller's prior written consent (which consent shall be given
or withheld in the sole and absolute discretion of Seller).

the general public prior to, on or after the Closing Date (other than as a

violation of this Section 7.16), (ii) any information that becomes available
to the Receiving Party or any of its Representatives after the Closing Date on

"Disclosing Party") or its Representatives; provided that such source was not,
to the knowledge of the Receiving Party, prohibited from disclosing such
information by a legal, contractual, fiduciary or other obligation, (iii)
except as provided in clause (vi) below, any disclosure requested or required
by applicable Law or any Governmental Entity, including any applicable Tax
Laws, securities Laws or securities exchange or listing regulations or
requirements; provided that, to the extent such disclosure is requested or
required in connection with an Order, the Receiving Party shall, to the extent
reasonably practicable and legally permissible, promptly notify the Disclosing
Party of such disclosure under this clause (iii) prior to making such
disclosure with reasonably sufficient time, where reasonably practicable, to
allow the Disclosing Party to seek protective measures for such Confidential
Information (and the Receiving Party and its Representatives shall cooperate
with the Disclosing Party in seeking such protection, at the Disclosing
Party's sole cost and expense), (iv) any Order in connection with the
enforcement of a Party's rights or remedies under this Agreement or the other

Information as confidential and non-public), (v) any disclosure or use of
Confidential Information in connection with the preparation of financial
statements, (vi) in connection with and to the extent necessary for a Party or

Agreement or the Closing, Seller shall give Buyer and the Debt Financing
Sources reasonable access, upon reasonable notice during normal business hours
to all properties, books, records (other than personnel records) and key
management personnel of or pertaining to the Acquired Companies (to the extent
relating to the Business), solely for purposes of consummating the Transaction
and as otherwise provided in Section 7.25; provided, however, that the
foregoing will not: (i) interfere unreasonably with the day-to-day operations
of the Acquired Companies; or (ii) require the Acquired Companies to provide
access or to disclose information where such access or disclosure would
contravene any Law or Contract, or would relate to commercially sensitive
information, or would result in the waiver of any legal privilege or work-
product protection as identified by Seller's legal counsel. Any information
disclosed will be subject to the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement.
In the event of a conflict or inconsistency between the terms of this
Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement, the terms of this Agreement will
govern. The Parties acknowledge and agree that the Acquired Companies may
designate any competitively sensitive information made available to Buyer
under this Agreement as "clean team members only," and such information shall
be given only to the clean team members of Buyer and may not be shared with
Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives
(other than such clean team members). Notwithstanding anything herein or in
the Confidentiality Agreement to the contrary, the parties agree that the
Agreed Communications Plans shall be implemented substantially in accordance
with its terms and no such party shall be in breach of this Agreement or the
Confidentiality Agreement as a result of such implementation in accordance
with its terms.

Acquired Companies or the Business in the form presently operated, and to such
other information to the extent relating to the Business for audit purposes or
in connection with any dispute or proceeding brought by or against any Third
Party or Governmental Entity; provided, however, that the foregoing will not:
(i) interfere unreasonably with the day-to-day operations of Buyer or the
Acquired Companies; or (ii) require Buyer or the Acquired Companies to provide
access or to disclose information where such access or disclosure would
violate (based upon good faith advice of outside counsel) any Law or Contract
to which Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including the Acquired Companies) is
subject or is a party, or would relate to Buyer Confidential Information or
other commercially sensitive information unrelated to the Business in the form
as presently operated, or would (based upon good faith advice of outside
counsel) result in the waiver of any legal privilege or work-product
protection relating to such information (provided that Buyer will use its
reasonable best efforts to provide Seller such access or make such disclosure
(or as much of it as possible) in a manner that does not have such
consequences).

(c)From the Closing Date and subject to applicable Law, until the date which
is six (6) years following the Closing Date, Seller shall, and shall cause its
Representatives to, afford Buyer and its Representatives reasonable access,
upon reasonable notice, during normal business hours to all books, records and
Representatives of Seller to the extent pertaining to the Acquired Companies
or the Business prior to the Closing, and to such other information to the
extent relating to the Business prior to the Closing for audit purposes or in
connection with any dispute or proceeding brought by or against any Third
Party or Governmental Entity; provided, however, that the foregoing will not:
(i) interfere unreasonably with the day-to-day operations of Seller and its
Affiliates; or (ii) require Seller or its Affiliates to provide access or to
disclose information where such access or disclosure would violate (based upon
good faith advice of outside counsel) any Law or Contract to which Seller or
any of its Affiliates is subject or is a party, or would relate to
confidential information of Seller or other commercially sensitive information
unrelated to the Business prior to the Closing, or would (based upon good
faith advice of outside counsel) result in the waiver of any legal privilege
or work-product protection relating to such information (provided that Seller
will use its reasonable best efforts to provide Buyer such access or make such
disclosure (or as much of it as possible) in a manner that does not have such
consequences). (d)At the Closing, (i) Seller shall cause all tangible books and records (and
copies of all intangible books and records) of the Acquired Companies or
otherwise primarily related to the Business to be located on the Leased Real
Properties to be transferred to Buyer by possession of such premises and (ii)
Seller shall transfer, or cause to be promptly transferred, to Buyer all
original corporate records of the Acquired Companies relating to the legal
existence, ownership and corporate governance of the Acquired Companies.

(e)For a period of five (5) years after the Closing, Buyer shall provide
reasonable assistance to Seller (at Seller's sole cost and expense) in
connection with any reporting obligations of Seller pursuant to the Securities
Act or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or any of the rules or
regulations promulgated thereunder, and any other financial reporting
obligations of Seller, in each case, related to the operations of the
activities of the Business or the Acquired Companies prior to Closing.

Section 7.18 Insurance. Effective at the time of the Closing, other than
pursuant to the Transition Services Agreement, the Acquired Companies and the
Business shall cease to be insured by any insurance policies or self-insurance
programs of Seller and its Affiliates. In addition, with respect to any
claims, acts, omissions, events, circumstances, occurrences or losses that
occur prior to the Closing and which Seller or any of its Affiliates becomes
aware (excluding constructive knowledge) of prior to the Closing for which
coverage under such policies would be available, Seller shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to file all claims for coverage thereunder in the ordinary
course of business in accordance with its standard risk management and claims
procedures. For the avoidance of doubt, subject to its obligations pursuant to
this Agreement, Seller shall retain all rights to control its insurance
policies and self-insurance programs, including the right to exhaust, settle,
release, commute, buy-back or otherwise resolve disputes (but not the policies
themselves) with respect to any of its insurance policies and self-insurance
programs to the extent provided in the third-to-last sentence of this Section
7.18 and Seller shall retain any premiums or other retentions paid by the
Business prior to the Closing Date in respect of any insurance coverage. For
any claim that may be asserted by the Acquired Companies or their Affiliates
with respect to the Business after the Closing Date arising out of events,
incidents, conduct or circumstances that occurred prior to the Closing (such
claims, "Pre-Closing Claims"), the Acquired Companies or their Affiliates may
tender such Pre-Closing Claim to Seller for submission by Seller or one of its
Affiliates to the applicable Third Party insurer under any of the Third Party
insurance policies of Seller or its Affiliates issued prior to the Closing
Date to the extent such insurance coverage exists at the time the Pre-Closing
Claim is tendered to Seller and under which the Acquired Companies or the
Business were insured as of the date of the events, incidents, conduct or
circumstances giving rise to such Pre-Closing Claim if permitted by the terms
of such policy (such policies, the "Pre-Closing Policies" and each such claim,
a "Noticed Pre-Closing Claim"), and Seller shall reasonably promptly
thereafter tender, or cause one of its Subsidiaries to, tender such Pre-
Closing Claim to the applicable insurer for coverage; provided, however, that
(a) none of Buyer, the Acquired Companies or any of their respective
Affiliates shall have any recourse to Seller pursuant to this Section 7.18 for
any uninsured or uncovered amounts for such Pre-Closing Claims (including any
deductible or other amount for which Seller provides self-insurance), except
for (i) amounts directly resulting from a breach of Seller to provide timely
notice of any Noticed Pre-Closing Claim to the applicable insurer upon
Seller's receipt of notice of such Noticed Pre-Closing Claim from the Acquired Companies or their Affiliates if required to do so under this Section 7.18 or
(ii) matters with respect to which any Buyer Indemnified Person is entitled to
indemnification in accordance with this Agreement; (b) except for matters with
respect to which any Buyer Indemnified Person is entitled to indemnification
in accordance with this Agreement, Buyer or the applicable Acquired Company
shall be responsible for the satisfaction or payment of any and all associated
self-retentions, deductibles, costs and expenses with respect to any Pre-
Closing Claims and shall promptly reimburse Seller or its applicable
Affiliates for its respective reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses
incurred in connection with collecting insurance proceeds in respect of such
claims or otherwise under this Section 7.18; (c) Buyer shall reasonably
cooperate with Seller with respect to the tendering of any such claims
including providing notices, information and backup materials as may be
necessary in connection therewith; (d) the Parties shall work in good faith
and use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure compliance with all of the
applicable terms of such policies so as to minimize the risk of loss of
coverage thereunder; (e) Seller shall not be required to make any concessions
to any insurance carrier in connection with any Pre-Closing Claim; and (f)
Seller shall not be required to take any action that would violate any Pre-
Closing Policy (and Seller makes no representation or warranty with respect to
the ability to take any of the actions otherwise contemplated by this Section
7.18). Seller shall notify Buyer and the applicable Acquired Company of all
coverage determinations made by the insurer(s) in respect of any Pre-Closing
Claims and, if any amounts are paid or to be paid by the insurer in respect
thereof, shall request that such insurer make payment directly to the
applicable Acquired Company, or shall transfer such insurance net proceeds
actually received by Seller or its applicable Affiliates to the applicable
Acquired Company no later than ten (10) days after receipt of such insurance
proceeds. Seller shall not release, commute, buy-back or otherwise eliminate
the coverage available under any Pre-Closing Policy without Buyer's consent
(not to be unreasonably delayed, conditioned or withheld). Buyer agrees (A)
that neither it nor any of the Acquired Companies shall have the right to
request that Seller make any claim under any Pre-Closing Policy unless Buyer
has previously made or is contemporaneously making a claim under the RandW
Insurance Policy or any other insurance policy of Buyer, in each case that
would reasonably be expected to cover such losses and to the extent that any
such insurance proceeds are received with respect to such claim after the date
that an insurance payment is made hereunder, then the Buyer shall return to
Seller such amounts so recovered from its insurers (but not to exceed the
amount of the proceeds received from the Pre-Closing Policy, and net of the
cost of obtaining such recovery) and (B) in no event will Buyer or any of the
Acquired Companies have the right to receive any benefits or coverage under
any Pre-Closing Policy (either individually or together with all other claims
made or benefits or coverage sought by Buyer or any of the Acquired Companies
after the Closing) in excess of thirty three and one-third percent (33.3%) of
the limit of such policy. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to waive or
abrogate in any way Seller's or its Affiliates' own rights to insurance
coverage for any liability, whether relating to the Acquired Companies or
otherwise.

Section 7.19 Mutual Release. (a)Effective as of the Closing, Seller does hereby, for itself and each of its
Affiliates (other than the Acquired Companies) (each, a "Seller Releasing
Party"), release and absolutely forever discharge each Acquired Company, Buyer
and each of their respective Affiliates (each, a "Seller Released Party") from
and against all Seller Released Matters. For purposes of this Agreement,
"Seller Released Matters" means any and all claims, demands, proceedings,
damages, debts, liabilities, obligations, costs, expenses (including
attorneys' and accountants' fees and expenses), actions and causes of action
of any nature whatsoever, whether now known or unknown, suspected or
unsuspected, primary or secondary, direct or indirect, absolute or contingent
("Claims"), that any Seller Releasing Party now has, or at any time previously
had, or shall or may have in the future, as an owner of the Business or any of
the Acquired Companies, or as a counterparty to any Contract with any Acquired
Company or otherwise, in each case, arising with respect to any matter
occurring at or prior to the Closing; provided that Seller Released Matters
shall not include (i) any Claim arising out of, relating to or pursuant to
this Agreement or any other Transaction Document or (ii) any Claim unrelated
to the Business and the Acquired Companies, the Transaction or any other
Transaction Document. It is the intention of Seller in providing this release
to the Seller Released Parties, and in giving and receiving the consideration
called for in this Agreement, that this release shall be effective as a full
and final accord and satisfaction and general release of and from all Seller
Released Matters and the final resolution by the applicable Seller Releasing
Party and the Seller Released Parties of all Seller Released Matters.

(b)Effective as of the Closing, Buyer does hereby, for itself and each of the
Acquired Companies and each of its Affiliates (each, a "Buyer Releasing
Party"), release and absolutely forever discharge Seller and each of its
Affiliates (other than the Acquired Companies) (each, a "Buyer Released
Party") from and against all Buyer Released Matters. For purposes of this
Agreement, "Buyer Released Matters" means any and all Claims that any Buyer
Releasing Party now has, or at any time previously had, or shall or may have
in the future, as a Buyer Released Party, or as an owner of the Business, or
as a counterparty to any Contract with any Buyer Released Party, or as Person
managed or otherwise directed by any Buyer Released Party or otherwise, in
each case, arising with respect to Seller's ownership of the Business at or
prior to the Closing; provided that Buyer Released Matters shall not include
(i) any Claim arising out of, relating to or pursuant to this Agreement or any
other Transaction Document or (ii) any Claim unrelated to the Business and the
Acquired Companies or the Transaction or any other Transaction Document. It is
the intention of Buyer agreeing to the Buyer Releasing Parties providing this
release to the Buyer Released Parties, and in giving and receiving the
consideration called for in this Agreement, that this release shall be
effective as a full and final accord and satisfaction and general release of
and from all Buyer Released Matters and the final resolution by the applicable
Buyer Releasing Party and the Buyer Released Parties of all Buyer Released
Matters.

Section 7.20 Required Cash Distributions. Prior to the Calculation Time,
Seller shall take (and shall cause each of its Affiliates (including the
Acquired Companies) to take) all actions required such that at the Calculation
Time (i) all Cash of each Acquired Company organized under the laws of any
state of the U.S. (other than such an Acquired Company that is Person that is
a Subsidiary of a Person organized outside the U.S.) have been distributed to
Seller or an Affiliate of Seller (other than an Acquired Company), as directed
by Seller, (ii) all Cash of the Acquired Companies organized under the laws of
any jurisdiction outside the U.S. and Subsidiaries of an Acquired Company
organized under the laws of any jurisdiction outside the U.S. ("Foreign Cash")
is not less than $16,000,000, and (iii) Foreign Cash in excess of $16,000,000
has been distributed to Seller and its Affiliates; provided that (a) no such distribution of Cash shall be required hereunder to the extent such
distribution would be prohibited by applicable Law and (b) no such
distribution of Cash shall involve the creation or assumption of any
intercompany loans or accounts (whether (i) between Seller or any of its
Affiliates (other than the Acquired Companies), on the one hand, and any of
the Acquired Companies, on the other hand, or (ii) between or among any
Acquired Companies), in each case, that are not extinguished at or prior to
the Calculation Time without Liability to Buyer or any of the Acquired
Companies from and after the Calculation Time. Without limiting Seller's
obligations under the preceding sentence, in the event that Seller leaves less
than $16,000,000 in Foreign Cash as of the Calculation Time in the Acquired
Companies, Seller will have the opportunity to cure such shortfall (which will
not be considered a breach under this Agreement as long as such shortfall is
inadvertent) by transferring such shortfall amount to the Acquired Company or
one of its Subsidiaries, or, at Seller's option and expense, to Buyer with
further direction to Buyer to transfer such amount to the applicable Acquired
Company or Subsidiary (the "Shortfall Transfer"), as applicable, within ten
(10) Business Days following the Closing Date. Seller shall be solely
responsible for payment of all Taxes and other Liabilities with respect to the
distributions contemplated by this Section 7.20.

Section 7.21 Credit Support Obligations and Company Indebtedness.

(a)Seller shall take all actions required such that all Credit Support
Obligations (including all Encumbrances on each and every asset and equity
security of the Acquired Companies related to such Credit Support Obligations)
shall be released and terminated in writing automatically as of the Closing
without further action on the part of any of the Acquired Companies or any
other Person and without further Liability to Buyer or any of the Acquired
Companies. Furthermore, Seller shall ensure that all applicable requirements
of the Credit Support Documents are complied with in full and all releases and
terminations of Encumbrances and Credit Support Obligations are effective upon
the Closing and take actions within its control to cause the agents and
trustees referred to in the immediately foregoing sentence to deliver lien
and/or guarantee release letters and evidence of the releases referred to in
the immediately foregoing sentence.

(b)Seller shall use reasonable best efforts to deliver to Buyer, on or prior
to the Closing Date, a payoff letter (the "Payoff Letter") for all
indebtedness for borrowed money of the Acquired Companies set forth in Section
7.21(a) of the Seller Disclosure Letter, which Payoff Letter shall be in
customary form, shall be executed by all Persons required therefor and provide
that (i) all Liabilities and obligations of the Acquired Companies under or
with respect to such Indebtedness shall be satisfied (other than unmatured
contingent indemnification obligations set forth in the written agreements
governing such Indebtedness) and all amounts owing thereunder for which the
Acquired Companies are liable shall be repaid upon receipt of the amounts
indicated therein and (ii) all Encumbrances and guarantee obligations in
respect of such indebtedness relating to the assets and properties of the
Acquired Companies shall be released and terminated automatically upon, and
subject only to, receipt of the payoff amounts indicated therein. (c)Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Acquired
Companies to obtain and deliver to Buyer final invoices and/or releases for
all Transaction Expenses described in clause (i) of the definition thereof on
or prior to the Closing Date, together with applicable customary Tax forms.

Section 7.22 Use of Cartus and Realogy Names and Trademarks. The Parties
acknowledge that, as between Buyer and the Acquired Companies, on the one
hand, and Seller and its other Affiliates, on the other hand, Buyer and the
Acquired Companies will hold as of the Closing all rights with respect to the
name "Cartus" and all derivations, combinations, and translations thereof
(collectively, the "Cartus Marks"), and Seller and its other Affiliates will
hold as of the Closing all rights with respect to the name "Realogy" and all
derivations, combinations, and translations thereof (collectively, the
"Realogy Marks") (and the Cartus Marks with respect to Seller and its other
Affiliates, and the Realogy Marks with respect to Buyer and the Acquired
Companies, the "Other Party's Marks."). As soon as reasonably practical after
the Closing Date, but in any event within sixty (60) days after the Closing
Date, Seller will (and will cause its Affiliates to), and Buyer and the
Acquired Companies will, cease to use the Other Party's Marks in any form and
will, at their own expense, (a) remove any and all exterior signs and other
identifiers located on their property or premises that refer or pertain to or
that include the Other Party's Marks and (b) remove from the letterhead,
envelopes, invoices, supplies, labels, packaging, advertising, catalogues,
product brochures, websites, website publications and other communications
media of any kind of theirs all references to the Other Party's Marks. The
foregoing shall not preclude Seller, Buyer or their respective Affiliates from
using the Other Party's Marks in accurate historical references or in a manner
that could otherwise be used by a third party under applicable Law.

Section 7.23 Intellectual Property Chain of Title. Prior to the Closing,
Seller shall make filings at the United States Patent and Trademark Office and
intellectual property offices or agencies in any other jurisdictions as
necessary to remedy any material title breaks or title deficiencies, and
evidencing the release of any Encumbrances (other than Encumbrances that will
be discharged as of the Closing) in any registered Intellectual Property or
applications for registrations of Intellectual Property owned by the Acquired
Companies, such that the title records at the applicable intellectual property
offices and agencies properly reflect (or will reflect, after any such filing
is processed) ownership of all such registered Intellectual Property or
applications for registrations of Intellectual Property in the name of an
Acquired Company and a clean chain of title (free of material title breaks,
title deficiencies, and the unreleased recordation of any Encumbrances other
than Encumbrances that will be discharged as of the Closing). In the event any
title breaks, title deficiencies, or unreleased Encumbrances remain on the
title record of any Intellectual Property registrations or applications in any
intellectual property office or agency after the Closing, Seller shall take
such further action (including the execution and delivery of such further
instruments and documents) as Buyer may reasonably request, at the sole cost
and expense of Seller, as necessary to correct any title breaks, title
deficiencies, or recorded Encumbrances existing prior to the Closing and to
evidence a clean chain of title with ownership of the same in an Acquired
Company.

Section 7.24 Resignations. Seller shall use its reasonable best efforts to
deliver to Buyer at or prior to the Closing, for each director of the Acquired
Companies as set forth in Section 7.24 of the Seller Disclosure Letter, a
customary letter effecting his or her resignation as a director (in each case, in such director's capacities as a director and not
as an employee), to be effective as of the Closing.

Section 7.25 Separation Planning and Collaboration.

(a)Between the date hereof and Closing, Seller shall, upon Buyer's reasonable
request, make its and its Affiliates' personnel and facilities available
during regular business hours to Buyer and its advisers for purposes of
facilitating discussions and activities around pre-Closing separation and
migration activities in anticipation of the separation of the Business from
Seller and of the services to be provided under the Transition Services
Agreement. The Parties shall collaborate and work together in good faith to
prepare for such separation and services, including Seller taking reasonable
measures with respect to logical separation of systems and data and other
activities for Closing Date readiness for services under the Transition
Services Agreement and operation of the Business.

(b)Promptly following the date hereof (and in any event prior to the Closing),
the Parties will negotiate in good faith to agree by the Closing Date the
Service Charge (as defined in the Transition Services Agreement) for each
Service (as defined in the Transition Services Agreement) set forth on the
Schedules to the Transition Services Agreement; provided, that if the Parties
are unable to agree on a Service Charge for a particular Service, then the
Service Charge for such Service shall be calculated as the Provider's fully-
loaded cost for the provision thereof (but, in no event shall the aggregate
cost of all Services set forth on Schedule 2.01-1, as in effect on the date of
this Agreement, to the Transition Services Agreement excluding those Services
set forth on Schedule 2.08 -- Migration Support -- to the Transition Services
Agreement and any other IT Services set forth on Schedule 2.01-1 relating to
the Migration Support - for example, discrete project costs, such as the
Oracle Upgrade, Clone of the Oracle Instance) and the Tax Transfer Pricing
Study -- exceed 120% of the total amount of corporate cost allocations (both
direct billed corporate costs and general corporate overhead) included in the
Unaudited Financial Statements for Cartus's relocation business for the year
ended December 31, 2018.

ARTICLE VIII

EMPLOYEE MATTERS

Section 8.1 Employment. (a)No later than twenty-five (25) days prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall
provide Buyer with an update to the list of Business Employees and related
information as set forth in Section 4.14 to reflect terminations and
replacement hires for such terminated employees occurring between the date of
this Agreement and the Closing Date consistent with Section 7.1(a); provided
that no such termination or replacement shall be as a result of a transfer of
employment between Seller and its Affiliates and an Acquired Company except as
consented to in writing by Buyer. As of no later than ten (10) days prior to
the Closing Date, Buyer shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, make an Offer
to (and Seller and its Affiliates shall terminate the employment of, if the
Offer is accepted) each Business Employee whose employment will not transfer
to Buyer or its Affiliates by operation of law in connection with the Closing
other than the Inactive Employees ("Offer Employees"), which employment (and
termination, if applicable) shall be effective as of the Closing. The offer of
employment in each case must be for the same position (including requiring the
same or similar primary duties and responsibilities), within twenty-five (25)
miles of such Business Employee's location of employment as in effect
immediately prior to the Closing, on terms compliant with Section 8.1(a) and
not subject to any background check or pre-employment testing (an "Offer").
Such Offers shall be presented to Seller for reasonable review and comment
prior to the time that such Offers are made. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Section 8.1, if any Business Employee is not actively at work
and is receiving, or in a waiting or elimination period for, short-term or
long-term disability benefits as of the Closing Date pursuant to a Seller Plan
(other than a Business Plan) (each, an "Inactive Employee"), and such Inactive
Employee is within nine (9) months following the Closing Date, able to return
to active service (in accordance with the terms of the applicable Seller
Plan), with or without a reasonable accommodation, Buyer shall make an Offer
to such employee as soon as possible after Seller notifies Buyer of such
Inactive Employee's return to active service date, such Offer to be on terms
consistent with those applicable to Offer Employees generally under this
Article VIII but effective on the date of such return to active service. With
respect to each such Inactive Employee who commences employment with Buyer,
references to "Closing" and "Closing Date" in this Agreement shall be deemed
to refer to the date that such Inactive Employee commences employment with
Buyer and its Affiliates.

(b)Continuation Period. Subject, and in addition, to the requirements imposed
by local Law, Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer shall provide each Continuing
Employee with (i) for the twelve (12) month period following the Closing Date
(or, if earlier, until the date of termination of the relevant Continuing
Employee), a base salary or wage rate that is no less than that provided to
such Continuing Employee by Seller and its Affiliates immediately prior to the
Closing Date, (ii) for a period ending December 31, 2020 (or, if earlier,
until the date of termination of the relevant Continuing Employee) (the
"Continuation Period"), short-term cash incentive compensation opportunities
no less favorable than that provided to such Continuing Employee by Seller and
its Affiliates immediately prior to the Closing Date and (iii) for the
Continuation Period, other employee benefits, in the aggregate that are
either: (A) substantially comparable to those provided to such Continuing
Employee by Seller and its Affiliates immediately prior to the Closing Date
(excluding defined benefit pension, post-termination or retiree welfare
benefits, deferred compensation, transaction-based compensation, and equity or
equity-based compensation) or (B) no less favorable than those provided to a
similarly situated employee of Buyer or its Affiliates. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing and subject to the requirements imposed by local
Law, Buyer shall provide, or shall cause its Affiliates to provide, each
Continuing Employee who experiences a termination of employment from Buyer or
any of their respective Affiliates during the twelve (12) month period
following the Closing Date with severance benefits, in the aggregate, that are
no less favorable than those that would have been provided to such Continuing
Employee by Seller and its Affiliates under the applicable severance policies
had such termination occurred prior to the Closing Date. (c)Welfare Plan Obligations and Service Credit. Subject, and in addition, to
the requirements imposed by local Law, with respect to the employee benefit
plans maintained by Buyer or any of its Affiliates (a "Buyer Benefit Plan") in
which any Continuing Employee becomes eligible to participate, Buyer or its
Affiliates shall recognize such Continuing Employee's past service with Seller
and its Affiliates for purposes of eligibility to participate and vesting to
the same extent and for the same purpose that such service was recognized
prior to the Closing Date under the analogous Seller Plan, but in no event
shall credit be provided where it would result in a duplication of benefits or
for benefit accrual purposes under any defined benefit pension plan, deferred
compensation plan, or post-termination or retiree welfare plan. Effective from
and after the Closing Date, subject, and in addition, to the requirements
imposed by local Law, to the extent that a Continuing Employee becomes
eligible to participate in a Buyer Benefit Plan providing group health
benefits, Buyer or its applicable Affiliate shall use reasonable best efforts
to (i) waive any pre-existing condition exclusion, actively-at-work
requirement or waiting period under any such Buyer Benefit Plan, except to the
extent such pre-existing condition exclusion, requirement or waiting period
would have applied to such individual under the corresponding Employee Benefit
Plan immediately prior to the date on which such Continuing Employee becomes
eligible to participate in the applicable Buyer Benefit Plan, and (ii) provide
credit under such Buyer Benefit Plan to the same extent and for the same
purpose as credited under the corresponding Employee Benefit Plan providing
group health benefits for co-payments, deductibles and similar payments such
Continuing Employee made or incurred under such corresponding Employee Benefit
Plan as of immediately prior to the date on which such Continuing Employee
becomes eligible to participate in the applicable Buyer Benefit Plan for the
same plan year.

(d)Buyer Assumed Employee Liabilities. On and following the Closing Date,
Buyer shall indemnify Seller and its Affiliates as provided in Section 12.3
and assume, and shall pay, discharge or perform when due, (i) all Liabilities,
other than the Liabilities retained or assumed by Seller as provided for in
Section 8.1(e), with respect to the service of the Business Employees
(excluding Offer Employees and Inactive Employees who do not accept an offer
of employment by Buyer or its Affiliates made consistent with this Article
VIII) incurred prior to, on or following the Closing Date, including any
severance, notice pay or other similar Liabilities (including Liabilities
related to the WARN Act) paid to such Business Employees that are incurred by
Seller or any of its Affiliates on or following the Closing Date as a result
of either (a) Buyer and its Affiliates failing to comply with the requirements
of Section 8.1(a) and Section 8.1(b) or (b) any terminations of employment
made by Seller or its Affiliates at the written direction of Buyer after the
date hereof and prior to the Closing Date, (ii) all Liabilities with respect
to the employees or natural service providers of Seller and its Affiliates to
the extent included in the calculation of Closing Indebtedness, Closing Net
Working Capital or Closing Transaction Expenses, and (iii) all Liabilities
under the Business Plans (the "Buyer Assumed Employee Liabilities"). For the
avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Article VIII shall result in the
assumption by Buyer of any Liabilities arising from or related to the
Restructuring, or with respect to any person that is not a Business Employee. (e)Seller Retained Liabilities. Seller, or its applicable Affiliates, shall,
as of the Closing Date, retain or assume the sponsorship of and indemnify
Buyer and its Affiliates as provided in Section 12.2 for all Liabilities and
obligations under or relating to each Seller Plan (including (i) those related
to the service of the Business Employees, (ii) those related to the Realogy
Group LLC Pension Plan, and (iii) any ERISA "controlled group" Liabilities)
and all Liabilities and obligations related to any employee of Seller and its
Affiliates (other than Business Employees), other than (A) all Liabilities
with respect to employees or natural service providers of Seller and its
Affiliates to the extent included in the calculation of Closing Indebtedness,
Closing Net Working Capital or Closing Transaction Expenses, (B) Liabilities
and obligations relating to Offer Employees and Inactive Employees who accept
an offer of employment by Buyer or its Affiliates made consistent with this
Article VIII, or (C) Liabilities under the Business Plans. Unless otherwise
provided under the Transition Services Agreement, effective as of the Closing
Date, the Seller or its Affiliates shall take all necessary or appropriate
action such that Continuing Employees shall cease all active participation in
and accrual of benefits under the Seller Plans (other than the Business Plans)
and to remove the Acquired Companies as participating employers in such Seller
Plans.

(f)WARN Act. Subject, and in addition, to the requirements imposed by local
Law, and provided that prior to the Closing Date Seller delivers to Buyer a
list (including the name, work location, and termination date) of all Business
Employees whose employment was terminated by Seller or its Affiliates within
the ninety (90) days immediately preceding the Closing, Buyer agrees (i) that
in the ninety (90) days following the Closing it will not, and will cause its
Affiliates (including the Acquired Companies) not to, cause any of the
Continuing Employees to suffer an "employment loss" for purposes of the WARN
Act if such employment loss would reasonably be expected to create any
liability for Seller or its Affiliates under the WARN Act and (ii) to be
solely responsible for all termination and severance benefits, costs, charges
and liabilities of any nature incurred with respect to the termination of a
Continuing Employee after the Closing Date, including any claims arising out
of or relating to any plant closing, mass layoff or similar event under
applicable Law occurring on or after the Closing Date. Seller agrees to be
solely responsible for all Liabilities incurred as a result of Seller or its
Affiliates' failure to comply with the WARN Act with respect to employment
losses occurring on or prior to the Closing Date.

(g)Vacation and Other Leave. Subject, and in addition, to the requirements
imposed by local Law, which may require a cash payment by Seller or its
Affiliates in lieu of any assumption by Buyer, Buyer shall, or shall cause its
Affiliates to, recognize and credit paid time-off accrued in accordance with
any of Seller's or its applicable Affiliate's policies but unused by the
Continuing Employees as of the Closing to the extent included in the
calculation of Closing Indebtedness, Closing Net Working Capital or Closing
Transaction Expenses. (h)Health Claims; Disability Benefits. Any claims incurred by a Continuing
Employee under a Buyer Benefit Plan for medical, dental, vision and
prescription drug services rendered on or after the Closing Date shall be the
responsibility of the applicable Buyer Benefit Plan. Any claims incurred by a
Continuing Employee under a Seller Plan (other than a Business Plan) for
medical, dental, vision and prescription drug services rendered prior to the
Closing Date (or otherwise during such Continuing Employees' participation in
such Seller Plan) shall be the responsibility of the applicable Seller Plan.
For purposes of this Section 8.1(h), a claim is incurred upon provision of
medical, dental, vision and prescription drug services, materials or supplies.
Seller and its Affiliates (other than the Acquired Companies) shall be
responsible for providing the continuation of group health coverage required
by Section 4980B(f) of the Code to any Business Employee (and his or her
qualified beneficiaries) whose employment is located in the U.S. for whom a
"qualifying event" within the meaning of Section 4980B(f) of the Code occurs
on or prior to the Closing Date. Buyer and its Affiliates shall be responsible
for providing the continuation of group health coverage required by Section
4980B(f) of the Code to any Continuing Employee (and his or qualified
beneficiaries) whose employment is located in the U.S. for whom a "qualifying
event" within the meaning of Section 4980B(f) of the Code occurs after the
Closing Date. Seller and its Affiliates (other than the Acquired Companies)
shall be responsible for ensuring that each Inactive Employee shall continue
to receive or be entitled to receive short and long-term disability benefits
under such Seller Plan until the end of the benefit period described in such
plan.

(i)401(k) Plan. Seller shall cause each Continuing Employee to be given the
opportunity to receive a distribution of his or her account balance from the
Realogy Group LLC Employee Savings Plan (the "Seller 401(k) Plan") on account
of the Transaction, and Buyer or any of its Affiliates shall establish or
maintain a defined contribution plan and trust intended to qualify under
Section 401(a) and Section 501(a) of the Code (the "Buyer 401(k) Plan") that
on or after the Closing Date shall cover eligible Continuing Employees and
accept a contribution in cash from such Continuing Employees attributable to
any eligible rollover distribution (within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31)
of the Code) from the Seller 401(k) Plan. Seller and Buyer shall cooperate in
good faith to take any and all commercially reasonable actions needed to
permit each Continuing Employee with an outstanding loan balance under the
Seller 401(k) Plan as of the Closing Date to continue to make scheduled loan
payments to the Seller 401(k) Plan on and after the Closing Date, pending the
distribution and in-kind rollover of the notes evidencing such loans from the
Seller 401(k) Plan to the Buyer 401(k) Plan so as to prevent, to the extent
reasonably possible, a deemed distribution or loan offset with respect to such
outstanding loans. On or immediately prior to the Closing Date, the Seller, or
any applicable Affiliate, shall make any employer contributions to the Seller
401(k) Plan on behalf of the Business Employees for all periods prior to the
Closing (including those that would have been made irrespective of any end-of-
year service requirement otherwise applicable to such contributions, prorated
for the portion of the year ending on the Closing Date), and shall fully vest
any unvested account balances of the Business Employees who participate in the
Seller 401(k) Plan. (j)U.S. Flexible Spending Accounts. Effective as of the Closing Date, Buyer or
one of its Affiliates will cover each Continuing Employee who has elected to
participate in a flexible spending account plan maintained by Seller or any of
its Affiliates in the United States ("Seller's FSA") under a flexible spending
account plan maintained by Buyer or one of its Affiliates in the United States
("Buyer's FSA"). Each Continuing Employee will be treated as if his or her
participation in Buyer's FSA had been continuous from the beginning of the
plan year under Seller's FSA in which the Closing occurs and each existing
salary reduction election will be taken into account for the remainder of the
plan year under Buyer's FSA in which the Closing occurs, as if made under
Buyer's FSA. Effective as of the Closing Date, Buyer and its Affiliates will
cause Buyer's FSA to accept a spin-off of the flexible spending accounts of
each Continuing Employee who participates in Seller's FSA immediately prior to
the Closing Date. As soon as practicable following the Closing Date, (i)
Seller shall cause to be transferred from Seller's FSA to Buyer's FSA the
excess, if any, of the aggregate accumulated contributions to the flexible
spending accounts made by the Continuing Employees prior to the Closing Date
during the plan year in which the Closing occurs over the aggregate
reimbursement payouts paid to the Continuing Employees for such year from such
accounts and (ii) Buyer shall reimburse Seller for the excess, if any, of the
aggregate reimbursement payouts paid to the Continuing Employees from the
flexible spending accounts prior to the Closing Date during such year over the
aggregate accumulated contributions to such accounts made by the Continuing
Employees prior to the Closing Date during such year. Subject to the transfers
described above, from and after the Closing Date, Buyer shall assume and be
solely responsible for all claims by the Continuing Employee under Seller's
FSA incurred at any time during the plan year in which the Closing Date
occurs, whether incurred prior to, on or after the Closing Date, that have not
been paid in full as of the Closing Date.

(k)Annual Bonus.

(i)In the event that the Closing Date occurs prior to Seller paying in full
cash incentives in respect of any period including on or prior to December 31,
2019, there shall be included in Closing Indebtedness for each Continuing
Employee a bonus in respect of such period in an amount equal to the cash
bonus amount based on the actual or projected actual level of achievement of
the applicable performance criteria as determined in good faith by Seller in
accordance with the Seller's and its Subsidiaries' (as applicable) ordinary
course cash incentive compensation plans, and without regard to any costs and
expenses associated with the Transaction or any non-recurring events that
would not reasonably be expected to have affected Seller and its Affiliates in
the absence of the Transaction (individually, a "2019 Bonus", and collectively
the "2019 Bonuses"). To the extent that 2019 Bonuses have not been paid in
full prior to the Closing, the Acquired Companies shall pay each Continuing
Employee his or respective 2019 Bonuses, less any required withholding Taxes,
no later than March 15, 2020, whether or not such Continuing Employee is
employed with Buyer or its Affiliates on such payment date.

(ii)In the event that the Closing Date occurs on or following January 1, 2020,
there shall be included in Closing Indebtedness for each Continuing Employee a
portion of a cash annual bonus in respect of 2020 in an amount equal to the
pro rata portion of the employee's cash annual bonus for service from January
1, 2020 through the Closing Date, based on the projected actual level of
achievement of the applicable performance criteria as determined by Seller
consistent with prior years, and without regard to any costs and expenses
associated with the Transaction or any non-recurring events that would not
reasonably be expected to have affected Seller and its Affiliates in the
absence of the Transaction (individually, a "2020 Pro Rata Bonus" and
collectively, the "2020 Pro Rata Bonuses"). The Acquired Companies shall pay
each Continuing Employee the 2020 Pro Rata Bonus (if any), less any required
withholding Taxes, at the same time annual bonuses are paid by Buyer and its
Affiliates, but no later than March 15, 2021, and whether or not such
Continuing Employee is employed with Buyer or its Affiliates on such payment
date.

(l)Withholding. For purposes of payroll taxes with respect to the Continuing
Employees whose employment is located in the U.S., the Parties shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to treat the Transaction as a transaction
described in Treasury Regulation Sections 31.3121(a)(1) 1(b)(2) and
31.3306(b)(1)-1(b)(2) and the Parties further agree to implement this
treatment by utilizing solely Section 4 of Revenue Procedure 2004-53, STANDARD
PROCEDURE FOR PREDECESSORS AND SUCCESSORS. (m)Employee Communications. Subject, and in addition, to the requirements
imposed by applicable local Law, on and after the date of this Agreement, and
prior to the Closing, any communications (including any website posting)
provided to Business Employees by Buyer with respect to employment,
compensation or benefits matters addressed in this Agreement or related,
directly or indirectly, to the Transaction shall be subject to the prior
approval of Seller, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld.

(n)Other Employee Matters. Seller agrees on behalf of itself and its
Affiliates that it will not enforce any restrictive covenants against any
Continuing Employee with respect to activities in furtherance of the Business.

(o)No Amendment; No Third Party Beneficiaries. Nothing in this Section 8.1 (i)
amends, or will be deemed to establish, amend, modify or terminate any Seller
Plan, Buyer Benefit Plan or any other employee benefit plan, policy, program,
agreement or arrangement or (ii) shall prevent the amendment, modification or
termination of, any Seller Plan, Buyer Benefit Plan or any other employee
benefits or compensation plan, program or arrangement. Nothing contained in
this Section 8.1 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall be construed as a
guarantee of continued employment for any employee for any period of time or
to prohibit Buyer or any of its Affiliates from terminating the employment of
any Continuing Employee at any time after the Closing. The provisions
contained in this Section 8.1 are included for the sole benefit of the Parties
to this Agreement and nothing herein, whether express or implied, shall create
any third party beneficiary or other rights in any Person, including any
Continuing Employees or any other employee, former employee or participant in
any employee benefit plan or other compensation arrangement of the Seller,
Buyer, or their respective Affiliates.

ARTICLE IX

TAX MATTERS

Section 9.1 Section 338 Tax Matters. (a)Seller and Buyer shall jointly make (or cause to be jointly made by the
required party) a timely and valid election provided for by Section 338(h)(10)
of the Code (and any corresponding election under state, local or non-U.S. Tax
Law) with respect to the purchase and sale of the Shares hereunder and the
deemed sale of each of the Acquired Companies that is a member of the
consolidated group for U.S. federal income tax purposes that includes Seller
(the "Section 338(h)(10) Entities") (collectively, the "Section 338(h)(10)
Elections"). Seller and Buyer shall, or shall cause their relevant Affiliates
to, timely file all Tax Returns consistent with such Section 338(h)(10)
Elections and hereby agree not to take any action that could cause such
Section 338(h)(10) Elections to be invalid, and shall not take any position
contrary thereto unless required to do so pursuant to a final "determination"
(as defined in Section 1313(a) of the Code or any similar provision of state,
local or non-U.S. Tax Law). Seller shall prepare copies of the IRS Form 8023
(Elections Under Section 338 for Corporations Making Qualified Stock
Purchases) and including any schedules thereto, and any similar state, local
or non-U.S. forms (collectively, the "Section 338 Forms") as may be required.
Buyer shall cooperate with Seller in the preparation of such Section 338
Forms, and Buyer and Seller shall deliver duly executed final copies of such
Section 338 Forms to such other parties at the Closing on the Closing Date
consistent with Sections 2.4(a)(v) and 2.4(b)(v). Seller and Buyer shall also
cooperate with each other to take all actions necessary and appropriate
(including filing such additional forms, Tax Returns, elections, schedules and
other documents as may be required) to effect and preserve the Section
338(h)(10) Elections in accordance with the provisions of Treasury Regulation
Section 1.338(h)(10)-1 (and comparable provisions of each applicable state,
local or non-U.S. Tax Law) or any successor provisions.

(b)The Purchase Price (plus the liabilities of the Acquired Companies and any
other amounts that should be included in determining the "aggregate deemed
sales price" and the "adjusted grossed-up basis" as described in Treasury
Regulations Sections 1.338-4 and 1.338-5, respectively) shall be allocated
among the Acquired Companies and the assets of the Section 338(h)(10) Entities
in accordance with Sections 338 and 1060 of the Code and the Treasury
Regulations thereunder (and any similar provisions of state, local or non-U.S.
Tax Law, as appropriate) and in a manner consistent with the methodology set
forth in Treasury Regulation Section 1.338-6(b). No later than ninety (90)
days following the Closing, Seller shall prepare and deliver a proposed
allocation to Buyer (the "Proposed Allocation" and as finalized in accordance
with this Section 9.1(b), the "Allocation"). Buyer and Seller agree that, for
Tax purposes, Buyer will not be deemed to receive a payment from Seller in
exchange for assuming any deferred revenue of Seller. Buyer shall have thirty
(30) days to provide Seller, through a written notice of objection delivered
by Buyer, with any objections to the Proposed Allocation delivered by Seller.
Seller and Buyer shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to resolve
any such objection and, if any item of dispute is so resolved, the Proposed
Allocation shall be modified to the extent necessary to reflect such
resolution. If a final resolution is not obtained within thirty (30) days
after Seller has received the written notice of objection from Buyer, Buyer
and Seller shall submit the issue(s) in dispute to the Settlement Accountant
for resolution, it being understood that any item not included in the
submission to the Settlement Accountant shall be conclusive and binding upon
each of the parties as set forth on the Proposed Allocation. The determination
of the Settlement Accountant shall be set forth in a written notice delivered
to Buyer and Seller by the Settlement Accountant and shall be final, binding
and conclusive for all purposes hereunder. Each Party shall bear its own
attorney's fees, costs and expenses relating to such dispute and all
reasonable fees, costs and expenses invoiced by the Settlement Accountant
relating to such dispute shall be borne by Buyer, on the one hand, and Seller,
on the other hand, in proportion to the final allocation made by the
Settlement Accountant of the disputed items weighted in relation to the claims
made by Seller and Buyer, such that the prevailing party pays the lesser
proportion of such fees, costs and expenses (in a manner as described under
Section 3.5(b)).

(c)The Allocation shall be revised appropriately to take into account any
other payments made pursuant to Section 9.5 or Article XI, or any other
provision of this Agreement, and Seller shall deliver to Buyer an amended
Allocation reflecting any such revisions within sixty (60) days of the end of
the Tax Period (including valid extensions) in which such payments are made. (d)Seller, Buyer, their respective Affiliates and any other applicable Persons
(each, a "Tax Filing Party") shall file all Tax Returns consistent with the
Allocation (as it may be amended pursuant to Section 9.1(c)), including IRS
Form 8883 (Asset Allocation Statement Under Section 338), using where
applicable the "aggregate deemed sales price" and the "adjusted grossed-up
basis" as described in Treasury Regulations Sections 1.338-4 and 1.338-5,
respectively. Each Tax Filing Party shall not take any Tax position
inconsistent with such Allocation, and no Tax Filing Party shall agree to any
proposed adjustment to the Allocation by any Taxing Authority, in each case,
unless otherwise required pursuant to a final "determination" (as defined in
Section 1313(a) of the Code) or any similar provision of state, local or
non-U.S. Tax Law.

(e)Buyer shall make or cause to be made a valid and timely election under
Section 338(g) of the Code and any comparable provision of state, local,
provincial or non-U.S. Tax Law with respect to the acquisition (or deemed
acquisition) of each of the Acquired Companies that are treated as "controlled
foreign corporations" as defined in Section 957(a) of the Code.

Section 9.2 Tax Returns; Allocation of Taxes

(a)Seller and Buyer shall prepare and file Tax Returns as follows:

(i)Seller shall (at its sole cost and expense) prepare and timely file, or
cause to be prepared and timely filed, when due (taking into account any valid
extension of a required filing date) all Tax Returns of the Acquired Companies
related to Pre-Closing Tax Periods that are due (taking into account any valid
extension of a required filing date) on or before the Closing Date.

(ii)Buyer (or its Affiliates) shall (at Seller's cost and expense, but only to
the extent such costs and expenses are reasonable and incurred solely (A) with
respect to Buyer-Filed Tax Returns related solely to a Tax period ending on or
before the Closing Date and (B) are in excess of the amount accrued for such
costs and expenses in Net Working Capital (as finally determined)) prepare and
timely file, or cause to be prepared and timely filed, when due (taking into
account any extensions of a required filing date) all other Tax Returns of the
Acquired Companies related to Pre-Closing Tax Periods (including Straddle
Periods) that are first due after the Closing Date (each such Tax Return, a
"Buyer-Filed Tax Return").

(iii)All Tax Returns filed with respect to Pre-Closing Tax Periods in
accordance with this Section 9.2(a) shall be prepared in a manner consistent
with past practice, except to the extent required by applicable Tax Law. (iv)Any Buyer-Filed Tax Return shall be submitted in draft form to Seller
(together with schedules, statements or other supporting documentation
reasonably requested) at least twenty (20) days (or, in the case of any Tax
Return that is not an income Tax Return, as soon as reasonably practicable)
prior to the due date (including any applicable valid extension) of such
Buyer-Filed Tax Return. Seller shall have the right to review and comment on
such Buyer-Filed Tax Return and Buyer shall incorporate reasonable comments
thereto that are provided by Seller to Buyer in writing at least seven (7)
days prior to the due date (including any applicable valid extensions of
time). Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, nothing shall require
Buyer or its Affiliates to wait to file a Buyer-Filed Tax Return until after
its due date (taking into account any applicable extensions) and timely filing
any such Tax Return shall not void any indemnity obligation under this
Agreement.

(v)Except to the extent otherwise required pursuant to a final "determination"
within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code (or any comparable provision
of state, local or non-U.S. Tax Law), none of Acquired Companies shall amend
any Tax Return or agree to the waiver or any extension of the statute of
limitations relating to a Pre-Closing Tax Period of the Acquired Companies
(other than as a result of ordinary course extension of time to file Tax
Returns consistent with past practice) to the extent such aforementioned
amendment would adversely affect Seller or any of its Affiliates without the
prior written consent of Seller (not to be unreasonably conditioned, delayed,
or withheld).

(b)Buyer shall pay or cause to be paid to Seller any refund or credit of Taxes
actually received, realized, or utilized by Buyer, any of its Affiliates or
the Acquired Companies solely with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period;
provided, however, that the Buyer shall not be required to pay over any such
refund or credit to the extent (i) such refund or credit arises as a result of
a Tax (A) paid by Buyer or one of its Affiliates (including the Acquired
Companies) after the Closing, (B) which was not included in Indebtedness or
Net Working Capital (in each case, as finally determined) and (C) which is not
a Tax for which the Buyer Indemnified Persons have been fully indemnified
pursuant to this Agreement, (ii) such refund or credit was previously included
in the determination of Net Working Capital or Indebtedness, (iii) such refund
or credit is required to be paid to a third-party pursuant to a Contract in
place as of the Closing or to the insurer pursuant to the terms of the RandW
Insurance Policy, or (iv) such refund or credit in lieu thereof is
attributable to a carryback of an item that was generated in a Post-Closing
Tax Period. The amount of such refunds, credits or other overpayments shall be
paid to Seller no later than ten (10) days following receipt or the filing of
the Tax Return reflecting utilization thereof to offset a Tax that would have
otherwise been required to be paid, net of any Taxes with respect to the
receipt or delivery thereof and any reasonable out-of-pocket costs or expenses
incurred in obtaining such refund or credit. At Seller's reasonable request,
Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to claim any refund or credit
of Taxes solely with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period to which Seller
reasonably believes Buyer or the Acquired Companies may be entitled and which,
if actually received and utilized would be payable to Seller in accordance
with this Section 9.2(b). (c)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, all excise,
sales, use, value added, registration stamp, recording, documentary,
conveyancing, property, transfer and similar Taxes, levies, charges and fees
arising (excluding any capital gain Taxes (including Taxes under Public Notice
7) imposed with respect to the sale of the Shares under this Agreement)
("Transfer Taxes") from the purchase of the Shares shall be borne 50% by Buyer
and 50% by Seller. All Transfer Taxes arising from the Restructuring shall be
borne solely by Seller. Buyer and Seller shall cooperate in timely making all
filings, returns, reports and forms as necessary or appropriate to comply with
the provisions of all applicable Laws in connection with the payment of such
Transfer Taxes and shall cooperate in good faith to minimize the amount of any
such Transfer Taxes payable in connection herewith and any capital gains Taxes
triggered by the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(d)With respect to any income or employment Tax included in the determination
of "Indebtedness" (as finally determined), if the amount of any such Tax so
included exceeds the amount of such Tax payable to the relevant Taxing
Authority, then Buyer shall pay over to Seller the amount of such excess
within fifteen (15) days of the filing of the relevant Tax Return (or, if no
Tax Return is due with respect to such Tax, the payment of such Tax). With
respect to any overpayment of Taxes included in the determination of
"Indebtedness" (as finally determined), if the amount of any such overpayment
of Taxes is less than the amount of such overpayment of Taxes to which the
relevant Acquired Company is entitled, Seller shall pay over to Buyer the
amount of such difference within fifteen (15) days of the filing of the
relevant Tax Return reflecting such lesser overpayment amount (or, if no Tax
Return is due with respect to such Tax, the payment of a greater amount of
Taxes as a result of such difference in overpayment). For the avoidance of
doubt, no amount of such income or employment Taxes or such overpayment of
Taxes actually included in the determination of "Indebtedness" (as finally
determined) or payable pursuant to this Section 9.2(d) shall give rise to an
indemnification claim pursuant to this Agreement, or a right to receive a
refund or credit of Tax pursuant to this Agreement.

Section 9.3 Tax Sharing Agreements and Powers of Attorney. All Tax sharing
agreements or similar agreements with respect to a consolidated, combined,
unitary or similar group for Tax purposes involving any of the Acquired
Companies and all powers of attorney with respect to Taxes relating to the
Acquired Companies shall be terminated as of the Closing Date and, after the
Closing Date, none of the Acquired Companies shall be bound thereby or have
any liability to Seller or any of its Affiliates thereunder.

Section 9.4 Cooperation on Tax Matters. Buyer and Seller shall cooperate fully
as and to the extent reasonably requested by Buyer or Seller, as applicable,
in connection with the preparation, execution and filing of any Tax Returns
and any Tax Proceeding. Such cooperation shall include access to records and
information that are reasonably relevant to any such Tax Return or Tax
Proceeding, making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to
provide additional information and explanation of any material provided
hereunder; provided, however, that Seller shall not be required to provide any
copies of any portion of its consolidated, combined or unitary Tax Returns not
related to the Acquired Companies or the Business under this Section 9.4 or
any other provisions of this Agreement. Seller and Buyer shall retain all
books and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Acquired
Companies relating to any Tax Period beginning before the Closing Date until
the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations of the respective Tax
Periods or Tax matters and abide by all record retention agreements entered
into with any Taxing Authority. Buyer and Seller each agree, upon request, to
use reasonable efforts to obtain any certificate or other document from any
Taxing Authority or any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce
or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed with respect to the Transaction.

Section 9.5 Tax Indemnification. (a)Effective as of and after the Closing, Seller shall indemnify, defend and
hold harmless Buyer and its Subsidiaries and each of their respective
Representatives and Affiliates (individually, a "Buyer Indemnified Person" and
collectively, the "Buyer Indemnified Persons") against and agrees to hold each
of them harmless from any and all Indemnified Taxes and any and all
reasonable, out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable fees and expenses of
attorneys, accountants and other professional advisors and all reasonable
amounts incurred or paid in investigation, defense and/or settlement of any of
the foregoing) and costs associated therewith sustained, incurred or suffered
by any Buyer Indemnified Person to the extent resulting from such Indemnified
Taxes; provided that Seller shall not be required to indemnify and hold
harmless the Buyer Indemnified Persons from and against any Taxes (including
estimated Taxes) or expenses, to the extent (i) such Taxes are reflected in
the calculation of Indebtedness or Net Working Capital (as finally
determined), (ii) that Seller or its Affiliates duly and timely paid in full
on or before the Closing Date, (iii) to the extent resulting from any action
taken on the Closing Date after the Closing by Buyer or its Affiliates
(including, after the Closing, the Acquired Companies) outside the ordinary
course of business or not otherwise contemplated under this Agreement (such as
Section 338(h)(10) Elections) or (iv) resulting from or attributable to any
breach or violation (or failure to fully perform) by Buyer or its Affiliates
(including the Acquired Companies after the Closing) of a covenant, agreement,
undertaking or obligation in this Article IX. For the avoidance of doubt, (A)
Indemnified Taxes shall be determined taking into account any net operating
losses, capital losses and other Tax attributes generated in a Pre-Closing Tax
Period to the extent such net operating losses, capital losses, or other Tax
attributes actually reduce cash Taxes payable, and (B) Seller shall have no
indemnity obligation hereunder with respect to the existence or utilization of
any net operating loss, capital loss, or other Tax attributes (i) in a Taxable
period or portion thereof beginning after the Closing Date or (ii) in a Pre-
Closing Tax Period unless the non-existence or non-utilization of any such net
operating loss, capital loss, or other Tax attributes results in any
Indemnified Taxes (without duplication).

(b)For purposes of allocated Taxes of a Straddle Period between a Pre-Closing
Tax Period and a Post-Closing Tax Period:

(i)real, personal and intangible property Taxes and any other Taxes levied on
a per diem basis ("Per Diem Taxes") of any Person for a Pre-Closing Tax Period
shall be equal to the amount of such Per Diem Taxes for the entire Straddle
Period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days
during the Straddle Period that are in the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the
denominator of which is the total number of days in the Straddle Period; and

(ii)Taxes of any Person (other than Per Diem Taxes) for any Pre-Closing Tax
Period shall be computed as if such Tax Period ended as of the end of the
Closing Date.

(c)If any Tax Proceeding shall be initiated, which, if successful, could
result in an indemnification obligation of Seller pursuant to this Section
9.5, Buyer shall notify Seller within fifteen (15) days of receipt of notice
of such Tax Proceeding; provided that the failure to give such notice shall
not affect the indemnification provided hereunder except to the extent that
such failure or delay shall have actually prejudiced the indemnifying parties
as a result thereof. (d)Buyer shall assume and control the applicable Tax Proceeding; provided,
however, that Seller shall have the opportunity to timely elect to control, at
Seller's sole expense, any such Tax Proceeding that relates to a Pre-Closing
Tax Period and is not reasonably expected to materially and adversely affect a
Post-Closing Tax Period. Any such Seller election must be made in writing to
Buyer within twenty (20) days of Seller receiving notice of such Tax
Proceeding. Regardless of who controls such Tax Proceeding, (i) the non-
controlling party shall reasonably cooperate with the party controlling the
Tax Proceeding in pursuing such defense, including by executing any powers of
attorney in favor of the controlling party where required, (ii) the party
controlling such Tax Proceeding shall keep the other party reasonably informed
of all material developments and events relating to such Tax Proceeding, (iii)
the non-controlling party, at its own expense and with its own counsel, shall
have the right to participate in (but not control) the Tax Proceeding, and
(iv) the party controlling such Tax Proceeding (nor any of its Affiliates)
shall not settle or otherwise compromise (or extend the statute of limitations
for) any Tax Proceeding without the non-controlling party's prior written
consent (not to be unreasonably delayed, conditioned or withheld).
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, neither
Buyer nor any of its Affiliates shall be entitled to participate in any Tax
Proceeding relating to any consolidated, combined, affiliated or unitary Tax
Return that includes Seller or any of its Affiliates, excluding, following the
Closing, the Acquired Companies.

Section 9.6 Treatment of the Restructuring. The parties agree that the
Restructuring is intended to be treated as a distribution described in Section
332 of the Code as described in Treasury Regulation Section 1.338(h)(10)-1(e)
Ex. (2) by each of the Acquired Companies that are domestic subchapter C
corporations for U.S. federal income tax purposes of their assets to Seller,
except to the extent otherwise required pursuant to a final "determination"
within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code (or any comparable provision
of state, local or non-U.S. Tax Law).

Section 9.7 Survival. This Article IX (including Claims under Section 9.5)
shall survive the Closing until ninety (90) days after the expiration of the
statute of limitations (including extensions) applicable to the relevant Tax
matter. No Claim may be made or brought by any Party after the expiration of
the applicable survival period (as extended) unless such Claim has been
asserted by written notice reasonably specifying the details supporting the
Claim on or prior to the expiration of the applicable survival period (as
extended).

Section 9.8 Satisfaction of Claims. Except in the event of Fraud, the
indemnification provisions provided in Section 9.5(a) are the sole and
exclusive remedy for any Tax matters between the parties. Seller has no
obligation to indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Persons under Section 9.5(a)
with respect to (i) any Taxes arising from, or attributable to, any of the
Acquired Company's change in or continuation of, after the Closing, any Tax
practice, procedure, policy or reporting position followed by the Acquired
Companies prior to the Closing, or (ii) Taxes resulting from any voluntary
disclosure (or similar proceedings or actions) to a Taxing Authority for a
Pre-Closing Tax Period or a Straddle Period that is initiated by Buyer, its
Affiliates or the Acquired Companies after the Closing Date without the
consent of Seller (such consent not to be unreasonably conditioned, delayed,
or withheld).

Section 9.9 Treatment of Payments. Seller and Buyer agree to treat all
payments made either to or for the benefit of the other (and each of their
respective Affiliates) pursuant to this Article IX or the Shortfall Transfer as adjustments to the Purchase Price
for all Tax purposes, except as otherwise required by applicable Tax Law.

Section 9.10 Conflict. This Article IX (and not Article XII) shall control
with respect to Taxes and Tax matters.

ARTICLE X

prior to the Closing, of the conditions set forth in this Section 10.1:

(a)Governmental and Regulatory Approvals. (i) All waiting periods (and any
extensions thereof) under the HSR Act and any agreement between the Parties

as though made on and as of such date (unless any such representation or
warranty is made only as of a specific date, in which event such
representation or warranty shall be true and correct only as of such specific
date), except where the failure of any such representation or warranty to be
so true and correct (disregarding all qualifications and exceptions contained
therein regarding "materiality" or a "Material Adverse Effect") would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on the
Business, taken as a whole, and (ii) Seller Fundamental Representations shall
be true and correct in all material respects (disregarding all qualifications
and exceptions contained therein regarding "materiality" or a "Material
Adverse Effect") as of the Closing Date as though made on and as of such date
(unless any such representation or warranty is made only as of a specific
date, in which event such representation or warranty shall be so true and
correct only as of such specific date). (b)Performance. Seller shall have performed and complied with, in all material
respects, each covenant and obligation required by this Agreement to be so
performed or complied with by Seller on or before the Closing.

(c)No Material Adverse Effect. Since the date of this Agreement, no events or
circumstances shall have occurred that, individually or in the aggregate, have
had a Material Adverse Effect.

(d)Officer's Certificate. Buyer shall have received a certificate of a duly
authorized executive officer of Seller, dated as of the Closing Date,
certifying that the conditions set forth in Section 10.2(a), Section 10.2(b),
Section 10.2(c) and Section 10.2(e) have been satisfied.

(e)Restructuring. The Restructuring shall have been completed in all material
respects in accordance with Section 2.2(a) of the Seller Disclosure Letter.

Section 10.3 Conditions to the Obligations of Seller. The obligations of
Seller to effect the Closing and consummate the Transaction pursuant to this
Agreement shall be subject to the satisfaction at or prior to the Closing of
each of the conditions set forth in this Section 10.3, any of which may be, to
the extent not prohibited by Law, waived, in writing, exclusively by Seller in
its sole and absolute discretion:

(a)Representations and Warranties of Buyer. (i) The representations and
warranties of Buyer set forth in this Agreement (other than Buyer Fundamental
Representations) shall be true and correct as of the Closing Date as though
made on and as of such date (unless any such representation or warranty is
made only as of a specific date, in which event such representation or
warranty shall be true and correct only as of such specific date), except
where the failure of any such representation or warranty to be so true and
correct (disregarding all qualifications and exceptions contained therein
regarding "materiality" or a "Material Adverse Effect") would not prevent
Buyer from consummating the Transaction or materially impair Buyer's ability
to perform its obligations under this Agreement and (ii) Buyer Fundamental
Representations shall be true and correct in all material respects
(disregarding all qualifications and exceptions contained therein regarding
"materiality" or a "Material Adverse Effect") as of the Closing Date as though
made on and as of such date (unless any such representation or warranty is
made only as of a specific date, in which event such representation or
warranty shall be true and correct in all material respects only as of such
specific date).

(b)Performance. Buyer shall have performed and complied with, in all material
respects, each covenant and obligation required by this Agreement to be so
performed or complied with by Buyer at or before the Closing.

(c)Officer's Certificate. Seller shall have received a certificate of a duly

ARTICLE XI

TERMINATION Section 11.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior
to the Closing:

(a)by either Seller or Buyer at or after 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time, on April 30,
2020 (as may be extended pursuant to the immediately following proviso, the
"Outside Date") unless the Closing has occurred on or prior to the Outside
Date; provided that if, on or prior to the Outside Date, all of the conditions
to Closing set forth in Article X have been and continue to be satisfied or
(to the extent permitted by applicable Law) waived (other than those
conditions that by their terms or nature are to be satisfied or measured at
the Closing, but subject to such conditions being capable of being satisfied
at the Closing and the date of termination) other than Section 10.1(a)(i) or
Section 10.1(b) with respect to Antitrust Laws, then the Outside Date may be
extended by either Seller or Buyer to November 6, 2020 by delivery of written
notice of such extension to the other Party on or prior to the Outside Date,
in which case the Outside Date shall be deemed for all purposes to be such
later date; provided, further, that the right to terminate this Agreement
under this Section 11.1(a) shall not be available to any Party whose failure
to take any action required under or breach of this Agreement shall have been
the primary cause of, or shall have resulted in, the failure of the Closing to
occur by the Outside Date;

(b)by either Seller or Buyer in the event that any Governmental Entity has
enacted, issued, enforced or entered into any statute, rule, regulation,
injunction or other order, restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the
Transaction, taken as a whole, that has become final and non-appealable;
provided, however, that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 11.1(b) shall not be available to any Party whose failure to take any
action required under this Agreement shall have been the cause of, or shall
have resulted in, an injunction or other order that had the effect of
restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the Transaction;

(c)by Buyer if (i) any of the representations and warranties of Seller
contained in this Agreement fail to be true and correct such that the
condition set forth in Section 10.2(a) would not be satisfied at the Closing,
or (ii) Seller has breached or failed to comply with any of its obligations
under this Agreement such that the condition set forth in Section 10.2(b)
would not be satisfied at the Closing, and, in each case of clauses (i) and
(ii), such failure or breach with respect to any such representation, warranty
or obligation is not capable of being cured, or, if curable, shall remain
uncured as of the earlier of (x) the date that is twenty (20) Business Days
following receipt by Seller of written notice of such breach or failure from
Buyer and (y) the Outside Date; provided that Buyer shall not have the right
to terminate this Agreement under Section 11.1(c) if Buyer is then in material
breach of its obligations under this Agreement; (d)by Seller if (i) any of the representations and warranties of Buyer
contained in this Agreement fail to be true and correct such that the
condition set forth in Section 10.3(a) would not be satisfied at the Closing,
or (ii) Buyer has breached or failed to comply with any of its obligations
under this Agreement such that the condition set forth in Section 10.3(b)
would not be satisfied at the Closing, and, in each case of clauses (i) and
(ii), such failure or breach with respect to any such representation, warranty
or obligation is not capable of being cured, or, if curable, shall remain
uncured as of the earlier of (x) the date that is twenty (20) Business Days
following receipt by Buyer of written notice of such breach or failure from
Seller and (y) the Outside Date; provided that Seller shall not have the right
to terminate this Agreement (A) under Section 11.1(d) if Seller is then in
material breach of its obligations under this Agreement or (B) with respect to
the first sentence of Section 7.6(a) or first sentence of Section 7.6(b) prior
to the expiration or termination of the Marketing Period (determined for this
purpose as though clause (x)(b) of the first sentence of the definition of
Marketing Period was deleted therefrom);

(e)by Seller if (i) all of the conditions set forth in Section 10.1 and
Section 10.2 have been and continue to be satisfied or (to the extent
permitted by applicable Law) waived (other than those conditions that by their
terms or nature are to be satisfied by actions to be taken at the Closing,
each of which shall then be capable of being satisfied at the Closing) and
Buyer fails to consummate the Closing on the date required pursuant to the
terms of Section 2.3, (ii) after the occurrence of clause (i), Seller has
irrevocably confirmed to Buyer in writing that all of the conditions set forth
in Section 10.1 and Section 10.2 have been and continue to be satisfied or (to
the extent permitted by applicable Law) waived (other than those conditions
that by their terms or nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, each of
which shall then be capable of being satisfied at the Closing and the date of
termination) and that if the Debt Financing and Equity Financing are funded,
then Seller will consummate the Closing in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, and (iii) Buyer has failed to consummate the Closing within three
(3) Business Days after receipt of such irrevocable confirmation (it being
understood that the conditions to the obligations of Buyer to consummate the
Closing set forth in Section 10.1 and Section 10.2 shall remain satisfied or
waived at the close of business on such third (3rd) Business Day, and during
such time, Buyer has not terminated this Agreement pursuant to Section
11.1(a)); or

(f)by the mutual written consent of Seller and Buyer.

Section 11.2 Effect of Termination. In the event that this Agreement is
terminated under Section 11.1, written notice thereof shall be given to the
other Party, specifying the provisions of this Agreement pursuant to which
such termination is made, and this Agreement shall forthwith become null and
void and of no effect without liability on the part of any Party or its
Affiliates or any of their respective directors, officers, employees,
stockholders, partners, members or representatives and all rights and
obligations of any Party shall cease; provided, however, that no such
termination shall relieve (i) Buyer of its obligations as expressly provided
for in Section 11.3 or (ii) Seller of any Liability resulting from any Willful
Breach of this Agreement prior to such termination, in which case Buyer shall
be entitled to all rights and remedies available at law or in equity;
provided, further, that the Confidentiality Agreement and the provisions of
Section 7.4(b), the last sentence of Section 7.4(c), the last sentence of
Section 7.4(d), Section 7.16(a), this Section 11.2, Section 11.3 and Article
XIII (provided that Section 13.8 shall survive only with respect to those
provisions of this Agreement that expressly survive termination pursuant to
this Section 11.2) shall survive any termination of this Agreement in
accordance with their respective terms.

Section 11.3 Termination Fees.. (a)If this Agreement is terminated (i) by either Seller or Buyer pursuant to
Section 11.1(a) and all conditions to Closing set forth in Section 10.1 (other
than Section 10.1(a)(i) and other than Section 10.1(b)(to the extent arising
under Antitrust Laws)) and Section 10.2 are satisfied or capable of being
satisfied or are waived (other than those conditions that by their nature are
to be satisfied at the Closing, each of which shall be capable of being
satisfied at the Closing and the date of termination), (ii) by either Seller
or Buyer pursuant to Section 11.1(b) and the applicable injunction or other
order giving rise to such termination right arises under Antitrust Laws, or
(iii) by Seller pursuant to (x) Section 11.1(d) or (y) Section 11.1(e), then,
in each such case, Buyer shall, no later than two (2) Business Days after the
date of such termination, pay, or cause to be paid, to Seller or its designee
an amount equal to thirty million dollars ($30,000,000) (the "Termination
Fee") without deduction or offset of any kind. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, in no event shall Buyer be required to
pay the Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

(b)The Parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this Section 11.3
are an integral part of the Transaction, and that without these agreements,
the Parties would not have entered into this Agreement. Solely for the
purposes of establishing the basis for the amount thereof, it is agreed that
the Termination Fee is not a penalty, but is liquidated damages, in a
reasonable amount that will compensate Seller in the circumstances in which
such fee is payable for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities
foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement
and on the expectation of the consummation of the Transaction, which amount
would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision.

(c)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, but
subject to Section 13.8 prior to termination, Seller's right to receive
payment from Buyer of the Termination Fee pursuant to Section 11.3(a), shall
constitute the sole and exclusive remedy of Seller against Buyer or its
Affiliates, any of the Debt Financing Sources or any of the Guarantors for all
losses and damages suffered as a result of the failure of the Transaction to
be consummated or for a breach or failure to perform hereunder, and subject to
payment of such amount, none of Buyer, any of its Affiliates, any of the Debt
Financing Sources or any of the Guarantors shall have any further or other
liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the
Transaction.

ARTICLE XII

REMEDIES

Section 12.1 Survival.

(a)Other than the Seller Fundamental Representations and the Buyer Fundamental

(1st) anniversary of the Closing Date, none of the representations or
warranties contained in Article IV, Article V and Article VI of this Agreement
shall survive the Closing.

(b)Claims for breach of any covenants in this Agreement requiring performance
prior to the Closing shall survive the Closing and terminate on the first
(1st) anniversary of the Closing Date. All of the covenants in this Agreement
contemplating performance after the Closing shall survive in accordance with
their respective terms. (c)The obligations of Seller to retain and indemnify Buyer Indemnified Persons
pursuant to clauses (iii) and (iv) of Section 12.2(a) shall, in each case,
survive the Closing indefinitely and terminate on the fifth (5th) anniversary
of the Closing Date.

(d)Any claim for indemnity under this Agreement with respect to any breach of
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements not made within the
period specified in Section 12.1(a) and Section 12.1(b) shall be deemed time-
barred (except as provided by Section 12.1(c)), and no such claim shall be
made after the periods specified in Section 12.1(a) and Section 12.1(b),
except that if written notice of a claim or claims for indemnification under
this Article XII shall have been provided to Seller or Buyer, as the case may
be, prior to termination or the applicable survival period, then any
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements that are the subject of
such Indemnification Claim that would otherwise terminate as set forth above
shall survive as to such claim, and that claim only, until such time as such
claim or claims is fully and finally resolved.

(e)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, nothing in this Section 12.1 is
intended to limit the survival periods contained in the RandW Insurance Policy.
It is hereby understood and agreed that nothing in such RandW Insurance Policy
shall affect any of the terms of this Agreement, and Buyer hereby agrees and
covenants that such RandW Insurance Policy shall acknowledge that Seller and its
Representatives (all of which shall be express Third Party beneficiaries of
this understanding and agreement) shall have no liability for breaches of
representations and warranties hereunder and that the insurer has no right of
subrogation (and recourse) against Seller other than in the case of Fraud
committed by Seller.

Section 12.2 Indemnification by Seller.

(a)Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Article XII, except
in respect of Taxes (indemnification in respect of Taxes being governed as set
forth in Article IX), following the Closing, Seller shall pay, indemnify,
defend and hold harmless the Buyer Indemnified Persons from and against any
and all Damages sustained, incurred or suffered (in each case whether before
or after delivery of an Indemnification Claim) by any Buyer Indemnified Person
to the extent resulting from, arising out of, or relating to:

(i)any misrepresentation or inaccuracy of any Seller Fundamental
Representation as of the Closing Date (as though such representations and
warranties were made on and as of the Closing Date);

(ii)any breach or non-performance of any covenant or obligation of Seller set
forth in this Agreement;

(iii)any Retained Liabilities;

(iv)the Restructuring;

(v)the Excluded Assets; and

(vi)the Retained Business. (b)Any and all indemnification payments required to be made to Buyer
Indemnified Persons under Section 12.2(a) shall be made by Seller; provided,
however, that any such indemnification obligation under Section 12.2(a)(i)
shall be paid only to the extent that the Damages underlying such
indemnification obligation are not fully recoverable by the amount of
insurance proceeds actually received by Buyer under the RandW Insurance Policy.

Section 12.3 Indemnification by Buyer. Subject to the terms and conditions set
forth in this Article XII, following the Closing, Buyer shall indemnify,
defend and hold harmless the Seller Indemnified Persons from and against, and
shall reimburse the Seller Indemnified Persons for, all Damages sustained,
incurred or suffered (in each case whether before or after delivery of an
Indemnification Claim) by any Seller Indemnified Persons to the extent
resulting from, arising out of, or relating to:

(a)any misrepresentation or inaccuracy of any Buyer Fundamental Representation
as of the Closing Date (as though such representations and warranties were
made on and as of the Closing Date);

(i)any breach or non-performance of any covenant or obligation of Buyer set
forth in this Agreement; and

(ii)except to the extent Buyer is entitled to be indemnified therefor from
Seller pursuant to Section 12.2, any liabilities resulting from the ownership,
operation or conduct of the Acquired Companies or the Business by Buyer or its
Affiliates, in any event after the Closing.

Section 12.4 Direct Claims.

(a)In the event an Indemnified Party desires to make a claim for
indemnification pursuant to Section 12.2 or Section 12.3 against the
applicable Indemnitor (a "Direct Claim"), the applicable Indemnified Party
shall give reasonably prompt written notice of the claim (a "Notice of Claim")
to the Indemnitor, describing to the extent reasonably practicable and to the
extent based on the facts then known by the Indemnified Party in reasonable
detail the nature of the claim and the specific basis or bases on which the
Indemnitor has liability for the claim under this Agreement, including (if
available) reasonably detailed non-privileged supporting documentation, and
referring to this Section 12.4 and the terms hereof. Failure, or delay, in
giving such Notice of Claim shall not affect the indemnification provided
hereunder except to the extent that such failure or delay shall have
materially and actually prejudiced the Indemnitor as a result thereof.

(b)Following receipt of a Notice of Claim with respect to a Direct Claim, the
Indemnitor shall have forty five (45) days to investigate the Direct Claim and
respond in writing. For purposes of the investigation, the Indemnified Party
shall make available to the Indemnitor the information relied upon by the
Indemnified Party to substantiate the Direct Claim, together with such other
information as the Indemnitor may reasonably request. (c)If the Indemnitor disputes the validity or amount of the Direct Claim, the
Indemnitor shall provide written notice of the dispute to the Indemnified
Party within the forty five (45) day period specified in Section 12.4(b). The
dispute notice must describe in reasonable detail the nature of the
Indemnitor's dispute. During the thirty (30) day period immediately following
receipt of a dispute notice by the Indemnified Party, the Indemnitor and the
Indemnified Party shall attempt in good faith to resolve the dispute. If the
Indemnitor and the Indemnified Party fail to resolve the dispute within that
thirty (30) day time period, the Indemnified Party shall be permitted to
pursue all rights and remedies available to it, subject to this Agreement. If
the Indemnitor fails to respond in writing to the Direct Claim within the
forty five (45) day period specified in Section 12.4(b), the Indemnitor is
deemed to have rejected the Direct Claim, in which event the Indemnified Party
is free to pursue all rights and remedies available to it, subject to this
Agreement.

Section 12.5 Third Party Claims.

(a)Except with respect to claims or demands for Taxes, which shall be governed
by Section 9.5, if any legal proceeding is instituted or any claim or demand
is made by a Third Party (a "Third Party Claim") against an Indemnified Party
that (if prosecuted successfully) would be a matter for which such Indemnified
Party may be entitled to indemnification under this Article XII, and a claim
for indemnification under this Article XII (an "Indemnification Claim") is to
be made against the Party from which indemnification is sought, such
Indemnified Party shall (to the extent known and practicable) give Notice of
Claim to (i) such Indemnitor (following the Indemnified Party's knowledge of
such claim and knowledge that such claim is likely to be the basis of a claim
under this Agreement) and (ii) the RandW Insurer, in each case, requesting such
indemnification and specifying in reasonable detail the basis on which
indemnification is sought. Such Notice of Claim shall contain or be
accompanied by such other material information as such Indemnified Party shall
have concerning the Third Party Claim. The failure, or delay, in notifying the
Indemnitor or the RandW Insurer shall not relieve the Indemnitor or the RandW
Insurer of any duty to indemnify which otherwise might exist with regard to
such claim unless (and only to the extent that) such failure or delay in
notifying materially and actually prejudices the Indemnitor or the RandW Insurer
as a result thereof. The Indemnified Party shall promptly deliver to the
Indemnitor or the RandW Insurer copies of all notices and documents (including
court papers) received by such Indemnified Party relating to any such Third
Party Claim. (b)If a Third Party Claim is made or commenced and an Indemnification Claim is
made with respect thereto, the Indemnitor shall have the right, upon giving
written notice to the Indemnified Party following receipt of the Notice of
Claim, to participate in the defense of such claim (to the extent permissible
under applicable Law) or to assume the defense of such Third Party Claim
through an attorney selected by the Indemnitor at the Indemnitor's sole cost
and expense; provided, however, that (i) the Indemnitor shall have
acknowledged in writing such Party's obligation to indemnify the Indemnified
Party for such proceeding (and the Damages in connection therewith) in
accordance with this Agreement (provided that such acknowledgment shall not be
an admission to the plaintiff in the proceeding to the claims alleged in the
Third Party Claim or liability therefor) and (ii) the Indemnitor shall not
have the right to assume or continue the defense of such Third Party Claim if:
(w) such Third Party Claim principally seeks an injunction or other equitable
relief against the Indemnified Party, (x) such Third Party Claim relates to a
criminal or quasi-criminal Action against an Indemnified Party, (y) the
Indemnified Party has been advised in writing by counsel that (A) a reasonable
likelihood exists of a conflict of interest between the Indemnitor and the
Indemnified Party or (B) there are legal defenses available to the Indemnified
Party that are different from or additional to those available to the
Indemnitor or (z) the Indemnitor has failed or is failing to diligently defend
such Third Party Claim.

(c)If the Indemnitor is entitled to and elects to assume the defense of a
Third Party Claim, (i) the Indemnified Party will reasonably cooperate with
the Indemnitor (and its Representatives) and make available to the extent
reasonably available and relevant, such information, books and records in its
possession or under its control as may be reasonably necessary or useful in
connection with such defense, (ii) the Indemnified Party shall not file any
papers or consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement
with respect to such Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of
the Indemnitor and (iii) the Indemnitor shall have the right to consent to the
entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to such Third
Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party if the
judgment or settlement (x) involves only money damages for which the
Indemnified Party is entitled to full indemnification under this Agreement and
does not seek an injunction or other equitable relief (other than customary
confidentiality obligations that do not limit the operation of the Indemnified
Party's business), (y) the Indemnified Party is not required to admit any
wrongdoing, take or refrain from taking any action, acknowledge any rights of
the Person making the Third Party Claim and (z) contains a legally binding and
enforceable unconditional release from any and all obligation or liabilities
of the Indemnified Party with respect to such Third Party Claim. If such
conditions are not satisfied and such unconditional release is not obtained,
then the Indemnitor shall not compromise or settle such claim without the
prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned). If the Indemnitor conducts the
defense of a claim, the Indemnified Party may retain separate co-counsel at
its own cost and expense and participate in such defense, which, for the
avoidance of doubt, shall not constitute Damages for purposes of this Article
XII.

(d)If the Indemnitor is not entitled to, or does not elect to assume the
defense of, a Third Party Claim, (i) the Indemnified Party shall have the
right to conduct such defense, (ii) the Indemnified Party may only consent to
entry of any judgment upon, or compromise and settle in good faith any such
Third Party Claim, with the prior written consent of the Indemnitor (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) and (iii) if
it is ultimately determined that the claim of loss which shall form the basis
of such judgment or settlement is one that is validly an obligation of the
Indemnitor that elected not to assume the defense, then such Indemnitor shall
be bound by any ultimate judgment or settlement as to the existence and the
amount of the claim, and the amount of said judgment or settlement (including
the costs and expenses of defending such claims) shall be conclusively deemed
for all purposes of this Agreement to be a liability on account of which the
Indemnified Party is entitled to be indemnified hereunder, subject to any
limits on the right to be so indemnified hereunder. Upon the determination of
liability under and subject to Section 12.2 or Section 12.3 and Section 12.7,
the appropriate Party shall, within ten (10) Business Days of such
determination, pay the amount of such claim.

Section 12.6 Limitations. (a)The Indemnified Party shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i) obtain
any insurance proceeds under the RandW Insurance Policy with respect to any
claim for indemnification that it has asserted under Section 12.2(a)(i) and
(ii) observe its common law duty to mitigate Damages in respect of any claim
for which it is seeking indemnification.

(b)The amount of Damages for which indemnification is provided under this
Article XII shall be net of amounts (i) actually received in connection with
an Indemnification Claim by the Indemnified Party from a Third Party
(including under the RandW Insurance Policy) and (ii) paid by a Third Party to
another for the account or benefit of the Indemnified Party with respect to
the settlement or resolution of a Third Party Claim. To the extent that any
amount is recovered by any Indemnified Party under an insurance policy
(including the RandW Insurance Policy) or any other source of indemnification is
realized after the date that an indemnity payment is made hereunder, in each
case in respect of the Damages suffered, then such Indemnified Party shall pay
to the Indemnitor such amounts so recovered in respect of such Damages no
later than ten (10) Business Days after such proceeds are received (but not to
exceed the amount of the indemnity payment, and net of the cost of obtaining
such recovery).

(c)UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL SELLER OR BUYER BE LIABLE UNDER THIS Article
XII OR OTHERWISE, FOR ANY (I) EXEMPLARY OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES OR LOSSES OR (II)
SPECIAL OR INDIRECT DAMAGES OR LOSSES THAT ARE NOT A REASONABLY FORESEEABLE
RESULT OF THE EVENT, MATTER AND/OR BREACH THAT GAVE RISE THERETO, EXCEPT IN
EACH CASE OF EACH OF THE FOREGOING CLAUSES (I) AND (II), (X) IN THE EVENT OF
FRAUD, OR (Y) TO THE EXTENT AWARDED TO A THIRD PARTY PURSUANT TO A THIRD PARTY
CLAIM (OR SETTLEMENT THEREOF IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS Article XII).

(d)Neither Party shall be entitled to recover any indemnification payment or
other amounts due from the other Party hereunder by retaining and setting off
the amounts (whether or not such amounts are liquidated or reduced to
judgment) against any amounts due or to become due from such Party hereunder
or under any document delivered pursuant hereto or in connection herewith.

(e)Solely with respect to indemnity under this Article XII, for purposes of
determining whether there was an inaccuracy in or breach of any representation
or warranty of any Person, and calculating Damages hereunder, any materiality,
Material Adverse Effect or similar qualifications in the representations and
warranties will be disregarded.

Section 12.7 Exclusive Remedy. Except (a) with respect to claims arising from
Fraud, (b) the remedies set forth in Article IX and (c) the remedies set forth
in Section 13.8, the Parties agree that from and after the Closing Date, the
exclusive remedies of the parties for any Damages based upon, arising out of
or otherwise in respect of the matters set forth in this Agreement are the
indemnification obligations of the parties set forth in this Article XII, and
that the RandW Insurance Policy shall be the sole and exclusive remedy for any
Indemnification Claim based on Damages arising out of Section 12.2(a)(i)
(except with respect to the Seller Fundamental Representations); provided,
however, that nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed a waiver by any Party
of any right to specific performance, injunctive relief or other equitable
remedy to the extent set forth herein. ARTICLE XIII

MISCELLANEOUS

Section 13.1 Fees and Expenses. Except as otherwise specified in this
Agreement, each of the Parties shall bear its own costs and expenses
(including any accounting, financial advisory and legal fees and expenses)
incurred in connection with the negotiation, preparation, execution,
performance and consummation of this Agreement and the Transaction. Such fees
and expenses of the Acquired Companies shall be paid by Seller, except that

Section 13.3 Severability. If any term or provision of this Agreement or the
application of any such term or provision to any Person or circumstance shall
be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect by a court of
competent jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall
not affect any other term or provision hereof.

Section 13.4 Assignment; Binding Effect. This Agreement and the rights
hereunder are not assignable (by operation of Law or otherwise) by either
Party unless such assignment is consented to in writing by the other Party;
provided, however, (a) Buyer may without the consent of any other Party assign
this Agreement to any Debt Financing Source pursuant to the terms of the Debt
Financing for purposes of creating a security interest herein or otherwise
assign as collateral in respect of the Debt Financing, and (b) prior to, at or
following the Closing, Buyer may, without the consent of Seller, assign its
rights and obligations under this Agreement to one or more Affiliates of
Buyer, so long as such assignment does not relieve of Buyer of its obligations
hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall an assignment
permitted pursuant to this Section 13.4 be reasonably expected to (i) delay
the Closing or (ii) adversely affect Seller, in each case in any material
respect. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement and all the
provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the
benefit of the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns.
No assignment shall relieve the assigning Party of any of its obligations
hereunder; provided that to the extent performance or payment is made at or
after the Closing by an Affiliate of Buyer (including any Acquired Company)
with respect to an obligation of Buyer hereunder, such obligation shall be in
full satisfaction of such obligation of Buyer hereunder (solely to the extent
such obligation was fully performed by the Affiliate). Any attempted
assignment in violation of this Section 13.4 shall be void ab initio.

Section 13.5 Headings. The headings contained in this Agreement are inserted
for convenience only and shall not be considered in interpreting or construing
any of the provisions contained in this Agreement.

Section 13.6 Waiver and Amendment. This Agreement may be amended, modified or
supplemented only by a written mutual agreement executed and delivered by
Seller and Buyer. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, any failure
of any Party to comply with any obligation, covenant or other agreement in
this Agreement may be waived by the Party entitled to the benefits thereof
only by a written instrument signed by the Party granting such waiver, but
such waiver or failure to insist upon strict compliance with such obligations,
covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with
respect to, any subsequent or other failure. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, the provisions set forth in Section 11.3, Section
13.4, this Section 13.6, Section 13.7, Section 13.8, Section 13.9(b), Section
13.10(a), Section 13.11, Section 13.15 or Section 13.16 (and, in each case,
any related provision or defined terms to the extent a modification, waiver or
termination of such provision or defined terms would modify the substance of
any of the foregoing provisions) may not be amended, modified or altered in a
manner that is adverse in any material respect to the Debt Financing Sources
without the prior written consent of the Debt Financing Sources.

Section 13.7 Third Party Beneficiaries. Except as set forth in Section 7.5
(which is for the benefit of the Covered Persons), Article IX and Article XII,
this Agreement is for the sole benefit of the Parties and their permitted
successors and assigns, and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is
intended to or shall confer upon any other Person or entity any legal or
equitable right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason
of this Agreement; provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing, each Debt
Financing Source shall be an express Third Party beneficiary of, and shall be
entitled to enforce, the rights of the Debt Financing Sources set forth in
Section 11.3, Section 13.4, Section 13.6, this Section 13.7, Section 13.8,
Section 13.9(b), Section 13.10(a), Section 13.11, Section 13.15 and Section
13.16.

Section 13.8 Specific Performance and Other Equitable Relief.

(a)The Parties hereby expressly recognize and acknowledge that immediate,
extensive and irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even if
available, would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that the
Parties do not perform the provisions of this Agreement (including failing to
take such actions as are required of it hereunder to consummate the
Transaction) in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach such
provisions. Accordingly, subject to the terms and conditions in this Section
13.8, the Parties acknowledge and agree that the Parties shall be entitled to
an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled
at law or in equity. Each of the Parties agrees that it will not oppose the
granting of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to
any Party that is expressly entitled to bring an action therefor pursuant to
the terms of this Agreement on the basis that any other Party has an adequate
remedy at law or that any award of specific performance is not an appropriate
remedy for any reason at law or in equity. Any Party expressly entitled
hereunder to seek an injunction or injunctions or any other equitable relief
to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms
and provisions of this Agreement shall not be required to show proof of actual
damages or provide any bond or other security in connection with any such
order or injunction. (b)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, (i)
in no event shall Seller or any of its Representatives (including the Acquired
Companies prior to the Closing) be entitled to, or permitted to seek, specific
performance against the Debt Financing Sources, except in each case indirectly
through the enforcement of Buyer's obligations hereunder, and (ii) Seller
shall be entitled to bring an Action to specifically enforce Buyer's
obligation to consummate the Closing and Buyer's rights under the Equity
Financing Commitments to cause the Equity Financing to be funded if (and only
if and for so long as) (A) all of the conditions set forth in Section 10.1 and
Section 10.2 have been and continue to be satisfied or (to the extent
permitted by applicable Law) waived (other than those conditions that by their
terms or nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, each of which shall then
be capable of being satisfied at the Closing and the date of termination) and
Buyer fails to consummate the Closing on the date required pursuant to the
terms of Section 2.3, (B) the proceeds of the Debt Financing (or any
alternative debt financing) have been funded to Buyer or the agent for the
Debt Financing Sources under the Debt Financing Commitments (or any definitive
agreements executed pursuant thereto) has irrevocably confirmed in writing to
Buyer that the Debt Financing will be funded subject only to the funding of
the Equity Financing, (C) Seller has not terminated this Agreement in
accordance with Article XI and has irrevocably confirmed to Buyer in writing
that all of the conditions set forth in Section 10.1 and Section 10.2 have
been and continue to be satisfied or (to the extent permitted by applicable
Law) waived (other than those conditions that by their terms or nature are to
be satisfied by actions to be taken at the Closing, each of which shall then
be capable of being satisfied at the Closing) and that if the Debt Financing
and Equity Financing are funded, then Seller will consummate the Closing in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement, and (D) Buyer has failed to
consummate the Closing within three (3) Business Days after receipt of such
irrevocable confirmation. For the avoidance of doubt, (a) in no event shall
Seller be entitled to specifically enforce (or to bring any Action in equity
seeking to specifically enforce) Buyer's rights under the Equity Financing
Commitments to cause the Equity Financing to be funded other than as expressly
provided in the immediately preceding sentence, and (b) in no event shall
Seller be entitled to seek to specifically enforce any provision of this
Agreement or to obtain an injunction or injunctions, or to bring any other
Action in equity in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, against Buyer other than against Buyer and, in such case, only
under the circumstances expressly set forth in this Section 13.8.

Section 13.9 Choice of Law.

(a)THIS AGREEMENT AND ALL ACTIONS, PROCEEDINGS OR COUNTERCLAIMS (WHETHER BASED
ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT,
OR THE ACTIONS OF BUYER OR SELLER IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION,
PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT THEREOF, SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN
ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE, WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO
ANY CHOICE OR CONFLICT OF LAWS PROVISION OR RULE (WHETHER OF THE STATE OF
DELAWARE OR ANY OTHER JURISDICTION) THAT WOULD CAUSE THE APPLICATION OF THE
LAWS OF ANY JURISDICTION OTHER THAN THE STATE OF DELAWARE; PROVIDED, HOWEVER,
THAT ANY ACTION BROUGHT AGAINST ANY OF THE DEBT FINANCING SOURCES SHALL BE
GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW
YORK. (b)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, each
of the Parties: (i) agrees that it will not bring or support any Person in any
Action before any Governmental Entity of any kind or description, whether at
law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against any of
the Debt Financing Sources arising out of or in any way relating to this
Agreement or the Transaction, including any dispute arising out of or relating
in any way to the Debt Financing Commitments, the Debt Financing or the
performance thereof or the financings contemplated thereby, in any forum other
than the U.S. Federal and New York State courts located in New York County,
State of New York; and (ii) agrees that, except as specifically set forth in

Financing Sources arising out of or in any way relating to this Agreement, the
Debt Financing Commitments, the Debt Financing or the performance thereof or
the financings contemplated thereby, shall be exclusively governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York, without
giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of

application of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of New York.

Section 13.10 Consent to Jurisdiction.

(a)Each of the Parties (i) irrevocably consents to the service of the summons
and complaint and any other process in any action or proceeding relating to
this Agreement or the Transaction, for and on behalf of itself or any of its

Section 13.10 shall affect the right of any party to serve legal process in
any other manner permitted by applicable Law; (ii) irrevocably submits itself
and its properties and assets to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if the Court of Chancery of the State
of Delaware declines to accept or does not have jurisdiction over a particular
matter, the Superior Court of the State of Delaware or any federal court
sitting in the State of Delaware) for the purpose of any Action or
counterclaim (whether based on contract, tort or otherwise) arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or the actions of the parties hereto in the
negotiation, administration, performance and enforcement of this Agreement and
the Transaction; (iii) consents to submit itself to the personal jurisdiction
of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware declines to accept or does not have
jurisdiction over a particular matter, the Superior Court of the State of
Delaware or any federal court sitting in the State of Delaware) for the
purpose of any Action or counterclaim; (iv) agrees that it will not attempt to
deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave

and (vi) agrees that it will not bring any Action or counterclaim relating to
this Agreement or the Transaction in any court other than the aforesaid
courts. Each of the Parties agrees that a final judgment in any action or
proceeding in such courts as provided above shall be conclusive and may be
enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner
provided by applicable Law. The Parties hereby further agree that New York
state or U.S. Federal courts sitting in New York County, State of New York
shall have exclusive jurisdiction over any action (whether at law, in equity,
in contract, in tort or otherwise) brought against any Debt Financing Source
in connection with the Transaction, including to the extent arising out of or
relating in any way to the Debt Commitment Letter. (b)The Parties hereby consent to and grant any such court jurisdiction over
the Person of such Parties and, to the extent permitted by Law, over the
subject matter of such dispute and agree that mailing of process or other
papers in connection with any such Action in the manner provided in Section
13.2 or in such other manner as may be permitted by Law shall be valid and
sufficient service thereof.

Section 13.11 Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL
RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR
OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE DEBT FINANCING
COMMITMENTS OR THE ACTIONS OF THE PARTIES HERETO IN THE NEGOTIATION,
ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT OF THIS AGREEMENT (INCLUDING THE
DEBT FINANCING AND ANY ACTION AGAINST OR INVOLVING ANY DEBT FINANCING SOURCE)
AND THE TRANSACTION. EACH PARTY HEREBY CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT
OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT
SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF ANY SUCH ACTION, SEEK TO ENFORCE
THE FOREGOING WAIVER.

Section 13.12 Counterparts; Electronic Signatures. This Agreement may be
executed in any number of counterparts, each of which when executed shall be
deemed to be an original and all of which together shall be deemed to be one
and the same instrument binding upon all of the Parties notwithstanding the
fact that all Parties are not signatory to the original or the same
counterpart. For purposes of this Agreement, electronic and .PDF signatures
shall be deemed originals.

Section 13.13 Entire Agreement. The Transaction Documents, the Limited
Guaranty and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement of
the Parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement, and
supersede all prior discussions, understandings, agreements and
representations and shall not be modified or affected by any offer, proposal,
statement or representation, oral or written, made by or for any Party in
connection with the negotiation of the terms of this Agreement.

Section 13.14 Conflicts and Privilege. Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom
LLP ("Skadden") has been engaged by Seller to represent Seller in connection
with the Transaction. Buyer (on its behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates)
hereby (a) agrees that, in the event that a dispute arises after the Closing
between Buyer or any of its Affiliates, on the one hand, and Seller, on the
other hand, Skadden may represent Seller in such dispute even though the
interests of Seller may be directly adverse to Buyer, the Acquired Companies
or any of their respective Affiliates and even though Skadden may have
represented an Acquired Company in a matter substantially related to such
dispute, or may be handling ongoing matters for Buyer or any Acquired Company
and (b) waives any conflict in connection therewith. Buyer (on its behalf and
on behalf of its Affiliates) further agrees that, notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, as to all communications among any of Skadden
and the Acquired Companies (including any of their respective directors,
officers or employees) or Seller that relate in any way to this Agreement or
the Transaction, the attorney-client privilege and the expectation of client
confidence belong to Seller and shall be controlled by Seller and shall not
pass to or be claimed by Buyer, any Acquired Company or any of their
respective Affiliates. Buyer (on its behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates)
further understands and agrees that the Parties have each undertaken
commercially reasonable efforts to prevent the disclosure of confidential or
attorney-client privileged information. Notwithstanding those efforts, Buyer
(on its behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates) further understands and agrees that the consummation of the
Transaction may result in the inadvertent disclosure of information that may
be confidential or subject to a claim of privilege. Buyer (on its behalf and
on behalf of its Affiliates) further understands and agrees that any
disclosure of information that may be confidential or subject to a claim of
privilege will not prejudice or otherwise constitute a waiver of any claim of
privilege. Buyer (on its behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates) agrees to use
commercially reasonable efforts to return promptly any inadvertently disclosed
information to the appropriate Person upon becoming aware of its existence.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a dispute arises between
Buyer, any Acquired Company or any of their respective Affiliates and a Third
Party, such Acquired Company may assert the attorney-client privilege to
prevent disclosure of confidential communications by Skadden to such Third
Party; provided, however, that the Acquired Companies may not waive such
privilege without the prior written consent of Seller. Skadden shall be a
Third Party beneficiary for purposes of this Section 13.14.

Section 13.15 Liability of Financing Sources. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, each of Seller and Buyer agrees it shall
not have any rights or claims against any Debt Financing Sources in connection
with this Agreement, the Debt Financing or the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby. The foregoing will not limit the rights of the parties to
the Debt Financing under the Debt Financing Commitments or the definitive debt
documents executed in connection with the Debt Financing. In addition, in no
event will any Debt Financing Source, Buyer, Seller or their respective
Affiliates be liable for consequential, special, exemplary, punitive or
indirect damages (including any loss of profits, business or anticipated
savings) or damages of a tortious nature.

Section 13.16 Non-Recourse. This Agreement may be enforced only against Seller
and Buyer. All Actions (whether in contract, tort, or equity, at law, or
granted by statute, whether by or through attempted piercing of the corporate,
limited partnership or limited liability company veil or otherwise) that may
be based upon, arise under, out or by reason of, be connected with, or relate
in any manner to (a) this Agreement or any of the other agreements or
documents contemplated hereby, (b) the negotiation, execution, or performance
of this Agreement or any of the documents contemplated hereby (including any
representation or warranty made in connection with, or as an inducement to,
this Agreement or any of the other agreements or documents contemplated
hereby), (c) any breach or violation of this Agreement (including the failure
of any representation and warranty to be true or accurate) or any of the other
agreements or documents contemplated hereby, and (d) any failure of the
Transaction, in each case, may be made only against (and are those solely of)
the Persons that are expressly named as parties to this Agreement, the
Transaction Documents, the debt commitment, letter, the fee letter, the equity
commitment letter, the Limited Guaranty, and the Confidentiality Agreement,
and then only to the extent of the specific obligations of such Persons set
forth in such document, as applicable. In furtherance and not in limitation of
the foregoing, and notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to
the contrary, each party hereto covenants, agrees and acknowledges that
(except to the extent named as a party to any of the Transaction Documents,
the Debt Financing Commitments, the Equity Financing Commitments, the Limited
Guaranty, and the Confidentiality Agreement, and then only to the extent of
the specific obligations of such parties set forth in such document, as
applicable) no recourse under this Agreement, any related document or any
documents or instruments delivered in connection with this Agreement or any related document shall be had against any past,
present or future direct or indirect equityholder, controlling person,
Affiliate, member, manager, general or limited partner, stockholder,
incorporator, director, officer, employee, agent, attorney, advisor or other
Representative, successor, or assignee of any of Buyer or the Guarantors
(including any Person negotiating or executing this Agreement on behalf of a
party) (each, a "Non-Recourse Person"), shall have any liability or obligation
(whether in contract, tort, or equity, at law, or granted by statute, whether
by or through attempted piercing of the corporate, limited partnership or
limited liability company veil or otherwise). For the avoidance of doubt, it
is expressly agreed and understood by the Parties that nothing contained in
this Section 13.16 shall limit Seller's remedies under the equity commitment
letter or the Limited Guaranty against the parties thereto on the terms set
forth therein.

 EXHIBIT A



Form of Limited Guaranty



LIMITED GUARANTY



This Limited Guaranty, dated as of November 6, 2019 (this "Limited Guaranty"),
by Madison Dearborn Capital Partners VII‑A, L.P., Madison Dearborn Capital
Partners VII‑C, L.P. and Madison Dearborn Capital Partners VII Executive‑A,
L.P., each a Delaware limited partnership (each of the foregoing, a
"Guarantor" and collectively, the "Guarantors") is made in favor of Realogy
Holdings Corp., a Delaware corporation ("Seller"). Reference is hereby made to
the Purchase and Sale Agreement (as it may be amended, restated, supplemented
or otherwise modified from time to time, the "Purchase Agreement"), dated as
of the date hereof, by and between SIRVA Worldwide, Inc., a Delaware
corporation ("Buyer"), and Seller. Capitalized terms used but not otherwise
defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Purchase
Agreement.



1.Limited Guaranty. Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the
Guarantors, in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Percentages (as
hereinafter defined), hereby irrevocably and unconditionally guarantee to
Seller, the due, punctual and complete payment of the Termination Fee, if and
when due pursuant to the terms and conditions of Section 11.3 of the Purchase
Agreement (the "Guaranteed Obligation"); provided that the maximum amount
payable by the Guarantors hereunder shall not exceed thirty million dollars
($30,000,000) (the "Cap"), it being agreed by the Buyer that this Limited
Guaranty may not be enforced against the Guarantors without giving effect to
the Cap; provided, further that this Limited Guaranty will expire and will
have no further force or effect, and Seller and its Affiliates will have no
rights hereunder, upon termination of the obligations and liabilities of the
Guarantors hereunder in accordance with Section 6 hereof. Seller hereby agrees
that the Guarantors shall in no event collectively be required to pay more
than the Guaranteed Obligation (or, in the case of each Guarantor, its Pro
Rata Percentage (as hereinafter defined) of the Guaranteed Obligation) or make
any payment (other than payment of the Guaranteed Obligation) pursuant to this
Limited Guaranty (with it being understood and agreed that, in circumstances
where the Termination Fee is due and payable by Buyer, Buyer shall have no
other payment obligations to Seller and this Limited Guaranty shall be
construed accordingly), that no Guarantor or Guarantor Affiliate (as
hereinafter defined) shall have any obligation or liability to any Person
relating to, arising out of or in connection with, this Limited Guaranty
(other than for the Guaranteed Obligation), and that this Limited Guaranty may
not be enforced against the Guarantors without giving effect to these
limitations (with it being understood and agreed that such limitations are an
integral part of each Guarantor executing and delivering this Limited Guaranty
and no Guarantor would have delivered this Limited Guaranty if such
limitations were not given full force and effect). All payments hereunder
shall be made in lawful money of the United States, in immediately available
funds.

2.Terms of Limited Guaranty.

(a)This Limited Guaranty is one of payment, not collection, and a separate
Action or Actions may be brought and prosecuted against any or all of the
Guarantors to enforce this Limited Guaranty, irrespective of whether any
Action is brought against Buyer or whether Buyer is joined in any such Action
or actions. (b)Except as otherwise provided herein and without amending or limiting the
other provisions of this Limited Guaranty (including Section 6 hereof), the
liability of the Guarantors under this Limited Guaranty shall not be released
or discharged, in whole or in part, and shall, to the fullest extent permitted
under applicable Law, be absolute and unconditional, unaffected, in each case
by and irrespective of:

(i)any change in the corporate existence, structure or ownership of Buyer, any
Guarantor or any other Person interested in the Transaction, or any
insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization, moratorium or other similar proceeding
affecting Buyer, any Guarantor or any other Person interested in the
Transaction or any of their respective assets;

(ii)any rescission, waiver, compromise, consolidation or other amendment or
modification of the Purchase Agreement in accordance with its terms, or change
in the time, manner, place or terms of payment or performance, or any change
or extension of the time of payment or performance of, renewal or alteration
of, the Guaranteed Obligation, any escrow arrangement or other security
therefor, any liability incurred directly or indirectly in respect thereof, or
any other agreement or arrangement entered into by Seller, on the one hand,
and Buyer, on the other hand, in connection therewith;

(iii)the existence of any claim, set off or other right that the Guarantors
may have at any time against Buyer, Seller or any other Person, whether in
connection with the Guaranteed Obligation or otherwise;

(iv)the adequacy of any means Seller may have of obtaining payment related to
the Guaranteed Obligation;

(v)the failure or delay on the part of Seller to assert any claim or demand or
to enforce any right or remedy against Buyer or any Guarantor;

(vi)the addition, substitution or release of any Person now or hereafter
liable with respect to the Guaranteed Obligation or otherwise interested in
the Transaction (including any other Guarantor); or

(vii)any other act or omission that may or might in any manner or to any
extent vary the risk of the Guarantors or otherwise operate as a discharge of
the Guarantors as a matter of Law or equity (other than payment of the
Guaranteed Obligation or as permitted by Section 2(e) of this Limited
Guaranty). (c)The Guarantors hereby expressly, absolutely, irrevocably and
unconditionally waive (i) any and all notice of the creation, renewal,
extension or accrual of the Guaranteed Obligation and notice of or proof of
reliance by Seller upon this Limited Guaranty or acceptance of this Limited
Guaranty and (ii) any and all rights or defenses arising by reason of any
applicable Law which would otherwise require any election of remedies by
Seller. The Guaranteed Obligation shall conclusively be deemed to have been
created, contracted or incurred in reliance upon this Limited Guaranty, and
all dealings between Buyer or the Guarantors, on the one hand, and Seller, on
the other, shall likewise be conclusively presumed to have been had or
consummated in reliance upon this Limited Guaranty. When pursuing its rights
and remedies hereunder against any Guarantor, Seller shall be under no
obligation to pursue such rights and remedies it may have against Buyer or any
Guarantor for the Guaranteed Obligation or any right of offset with respect
thereto, and any failure by Seller to pursue such other rights or remedies or
to collect any payments from Buyer or any Guarantor or to realize upon or to
exercise any such right of offset shall not relieve any Guarantor of any
liability hereunder.

(d)Seller shall not be obligated to file any claim relating to the Guaranteed
Obligation in the event that Buyer becomes subject to a bankruptcy,
reorganization or similar proceeding, and the failure of Seller to so file
shall not affect the Guarantors' liabilities or obligations hereunder. In the
event that any payment to Seller in respect of the Guaranteed Obligation is
rescinded or must otherwise be returned for any reason whatsoever, this
Limited Guaranty shall continue to be effective or reinstated, as the case may
be, and the Guarantors shall remain liable hereunder with respect to the
Guaranteed Obligation as if such payment had not been made.

(e)Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Limited
Guaranty, Seller hereby agrees that (i) each of the Guarantors may assert, as
a defense to, or release or discharge of, any payment or performance by such
Guarantor under this Limited Guaranty or any claim, set‑off, deduction,
defense or release that Buyer could assert against Seller under the terms of,
or with respect to, the Purchase Agreement (including, without limitation, any
such claim or defense that the Termination Fee is not then required to be due
and payable by Buyer pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Purchase
Agreement) and (ii) to the extent Buyer is relieved of all or any portion of
the Guaranteed Obligation under the Purchase Agreement, the Guarantors shall
likewise automatically and without any further action on the part of any
Person be relieved of their obligations under this Limited Guaranty.

3.Waiver of Acceptance, Presentment; Etc. Without amending or limiting the
other provisions of this Limited Guaranty (including Section 6 hereof), the
Guarantors irrevocably waive any promptness, diligence, acceptance hereof,
presentment, demand, protest and any notice of any kind not explicitly
provided for herein or not required to be provided to Buyer under or in
connection with the Purchase Agreement, other than defenses that are available
to Buyer (i) under the Purchase Agreement, (ii) in respect of a breach by
Seller of this Limited Guaranty and (iii) in respect of fraud of Seller or any
of its Affiliates in connection with the Purchase Agreement or the
Transaction. Each Guarantor acknowledges that it will receive substantial
direct and indirect benefits from the transactions contemplated by the
Purchase Agreement and that the waivers set forth in this Limited Guaranty are
knowingly made in contemplation and consideration of such benefits.

4.Sole Remedy.

(a)Seller acknowledges and agrees that no funds are expected to be contributed
to Buyer unless the Closing occurs, and that, except for rights against Buyer
to the extent expressly provided in Section 7 of the Equity Commitment Letter
and Section 13.8(b) of the Purchase Agreement and subject to all of the terms,
conditions and limitations herein and therein, Seller shall not have any right
to cause any assets to be contributed to Buyer by any Guarantor, any Guarantor
Affiliate (as hereinafter below) or any other Person. (b)Seller further agrees and acknowledges that no Person other than the
Guarantors has any obligations hereunder and that, notwithstanding that the
Guarantors may be limited partnerships, Seller does not have any remedy,
recourse or right of recovery against, or contribution from, (i) any former,
current or future general or limited partner, stockholder, holder of any
equity, partnership or limited liability company interest, officer, member,
manager, director, employee, agent, attorney, controlling Person, assignee or
affiliate of any Guarantor, (ii) any lender or prospective lender, lead
arranger, arranger, agent or representative of or to Buyer or (iii) any
former, current or future general or limited partner, stockholder, holder of
any equity, partnership or limited liability company interest, officer,
member, manager, director, employee, agent, attorney, controlling Person,
assignee or affiliate of any of the foregoing (other than Buyer and any of the
Guarantors) (those Persons and entities described in the foregoing clauses (i)
through (iii) being referred to herein collectively as "Guarantor
Affiliates"), through any Guarantor, Buyer or otherwise, whether by or through
attempted piercing of the corporate veil or similar action, by the enforcement
of any assessment or by any legal or equitable proceeding, by virtue of any
statute, regulation or applicable Law, by or through a claim by or on behalf
of any Guarantor or Buyer against any Guarantor or any Guarantor Affiliate, or
otherwise, except for the Retained Claims (as defined below); provided,
however, that in the event any Guarantor (x) consolidates with or merges with
any other Person and is not the continuing or surviving entity of such
consolidation or merger or (y) transfers or conveys all or a substantial
portion of its properties and other assets to any Person such that the sum of
all of such Guarantor's remaining net assets plus uncalled capital commitment
is less than such Guarantor's Pro Rata Percentage of the Cap, then, and in
each such case, Seller may seek recourse, whether by the enforcement of any
judgment or assessment or by any legal or equitable proceeding or by virtue of
any statute, regulation or other applicable Law, against such continuing or
surviving entity or such Person (in either case, a "Successor Entity"), as the
case may be, but only to the extent of the unpaid liability hereunder up to
the applicable Pro Rata Percentage of the Guaranteed Obligation for which such
Guarantor is liable, as determined in accordance with this Limited Guaranty.
As used herein, unless otherwise specified, the term Guarantor shall include
such Guarantor's Successor Entity.

(c)Seller hereby covenants and agrees that it shall not institute, and shall
cause each of its Affiliates and their respective Representatives not to
institute, directly or indirectly, any Action arising under, or in connection
with, this Limited Guaranty, the Purchase Agreement, the Financing Commitments
or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, against any Guarantor or
any Guarantor Affiliate except for (i) claims by Seller against any Guarantor
(and its permitted legal successors and permitted assigns of its obligations
hereunder pursuant to Section 18 hereof) under, in accordance with and subject
to all limitations of this Limited Guaranty (the "Retained Guaranty Claims"),
(ii) claims by Seller against Buyer under and in accordance with and subject
to all limitations set forth in the Purchase Agreement (the "Retained Purchase
Agreement Claims"), (iii) with respect to the Confidentiality Agreement, dated
September 15, 2019, between Buyer and Seller (the "NDA"), claims by Seller
against Buyer under and in accordance with the NDA (the "Retained NDA Claims")
or (iv) to the extent (but only to the extent) Seller is expressly entitled to
enforce the Equity Commitment Letter in accordance with Section 7 of the
Equity Commitment Letter and Section 13.8(b) of the Purchase Agreement, and
subject to all of the terms, conditions and limitations herein and therein,
claims by Seller against Buyer seeking to cause Buyer to enforce the Equity
Commitment Letter in accordance with its terms (the "Retained Equity
Commitment Claims," and together with the Retained Guaranty Claims, the
Retained Purchase Agreement Claims and the Retained NDA Claims, the "Retained
Claims").

(d)Recourse (i) against each Guarantor, as applicable, solely with respect to
the Retained Guaranty Claims, (ii) against Buyer with respect to the Retained
Purchase Agreement Claims, (iii) against Buyer solely with respect to the
Retained NDA Claims and (iv) against Buyer and the Investors (as defined in
the Equity Commitment Letter) with respect to the Retained Equity Commitment
Claims, shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Seller and all of its
Affiliates against any Guarantor or any Guarantor Affiliate in respect of any
liabilities or obligations arising under, or in connection with, the Purchase
Agreement, this Limited Guaranty, the Equity Commitment Letter and the NDA or
the transactions contemplated thereby and hereby, and such recourse shall be
subject to the limitations described herein and therein. 5.Subrogation. The Guarantors will not exercise any rights of subrogation or
contribution against Buyer, whether arising by contract or operation of Law
(including, without limitation, any such right arising under bankruptcy or
insolvency Laws) or otherwise, by reason of any payment by any of them
pursuant to the provisions of Section 1 hereof unless and until the Guaranteed
Obligation has been paid in full.

6.Termination.

(a)No Guarantor shall have any further liability or obligation under this
Limited Guaranty from and after the earliest to occur of (i) the Closing, (ii)
the valid termination of the Purchase Agreement in accordance with its terms
(other than a termination of the Purchase Agreement for which a Termination
Fee is, in accordance with Section 11.3(a) of the Purchase Agreement, due and
owing by Buyer (any such termination for which the Termination Fee is so due
and owing, a "Qualifying Termination")), and (iii) the 60th day after a
Qualifying Termination unless prior to the 60th day after a Qualifying
Termination, Seller shall have commenced a suit, action or other proceeding
against Buyer alleging a Termination Fee is due and owing or against the
Guarantors that amounts are due and owing from the Guarantors pursuant to
Section 1 hereof (a "Qualifying Suit"); provided that if a Qualifying
Termination has occurred and a Qualifying Suit is filed prior to the 60th day
after a Qualifying Termination, no Guarantor shall have any further liability
or obligation under this Limited Guaranty from and after the earliest of (w)
the Closing, (x) a final, non‑appealable resolution of such Qualifying Suit
determining that either Buyer does not owe a Termination Fee or that the
Guarantors do not owe any amount pursuant to Section 1 hereof, (y) a written
agreement among the Guarantors and Seller terminating the obligations and
liabilities of the Guarantors pursuant to this Limited Guaranty, and (z)
satisfaction of the Guaranteed Obligation by the Guarantors or Buyer.

(b)In the event that Seller, any of its Representatives or any of their
respective Affiliates commences any Action (i) asserting that the provisions
of this Limited Guaranty are illegal, invalid or unenforceable in whole or in
part or that the Guarantors are liable in excess of or to a greater extent
than the Cap, (ii) against any Guarantor or any Guarantor Affiliate arising
under, or in connection with, this Limited Guaranty, the Purchase Agreement,
the Financing Commitments or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby, other than a Retained Claim, and in the case of (i) or (ii) Seller
shall not have filed documents necessary to effect the dismissal of such
unauthorized Action within ten (10) Business Days after receipt of written
demand for such withdrawal by Buyer, or (iii) in respect of a Retained Claim
in any jurisdiction other than Delaware, then (x) the obligations of the
Guarantors under this Limited Guaranty shall terminate ab initio and be null
and void, (y) if any Guarantor has previously made any payments under this
Limited Guaranty, such Guarantor shall be entitled to recover such payments
from Seller, and (z) none of the Guarantors, Buyer nor any Guarantor Affiliate
shall have any liability to Seller or any of its Affiliates under this Limited
Guaranty or with respect to the Purchase Agreement, the Financing Commitments
or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. Upon the request of any
Guarantor after any valid termination of the obligations and liabilities of
the Guarantors pursuant to the provisions of this Section 6, Seller shall
provide such Guarantor with written confirmation of such termination. 7.Continuing Guaranty. Except to the extent that the obligations and
liabilities of the Guarantors are terminated pursuant to the provisions of
Section 6 hereof, this Limited Guaranty is a continuing one and shall remain
in full force and effect until the indefeasible payment and satisfaction in
full of the Guaranteed Obligation, shall be binding upon each Guarantor, its
successors and permitted assigns, and shall inure to the benefit of, and be
enforceable by, Seller and its successors and permitted transferees and
assigns. All obligations to which this Limited Guaranty applies or may apply
under the terms hereof shall be conclusively presumed to have been created in
reliance hereon. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Limited Guaranty, Seller hereby agrees that to the extent Buyer is relieved of
any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in
the Purchase Agreement so as to render any continuing liability or obligations
arising in connection with the Purchase Agreement inapplicable or Buyer is
relieved of its payment obligation under Section 11.3(a) of the Purchase
Agreement, each Guarantor shall be similarly relieved of their applicable
Guaranteed Obligation under this Limited Guaranty.

8.Release. By its acceptance of this Limited Guaranty, to the maximum extent
permitted by Law, Seller, on its own behalf and, on behalf of its
Representatives and their respective Representatives (collectively, the
"Releasing Persons") hereby waives each and every right of recovery against
each Guarantor and each Guarantor Affiliate under or in connection with or
related to this Limited Guaranty, the Purchase Agreement, the Financing
Commitments or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or otherwise
relating thereto and hereby releases each Guarantor and each Guarantor
Affiliate from and with respect to any claim, known or unknown, now existing
or hereafter arising, in connection with this Limited Guaranty, the Purchase
Agreement, the Financing Commitments or any of the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby or otherwise relating thereto, whether by or through
attempted piercing of the corporate (or limited liability company or
partnership) veil, by or through a claim by or on behalf of any Guarantor,
Buyer or any other Person against any Guarantor or any Guarantor Affiliate, or
otherwise under any theory of law or equity (the "Released Claims"); provided
that the foregoing shall not limit, and the Released Claims shall not include,
any of the Retained Claims. Without otherwise limiting the generality of the
foregoing or any rights or remedies available to any Guarantor or any
Guarantor Affiliate, Seller agrees, on its own behalf and on behalf of the
other Releasing Persons, that this Limited Guaranty shall serve as a complete
defense to any Released Claim (but expressly excluding any Retained Claim)
against any Guarantor or any Guarantor Affiliate.

9.Entire Agreement. This Limited Guaranty, together with the Purchase
Agreement (including all exhibits, schedules and ancillary documents
contemplated thereby), the NDA and the Equity Commitment Letter, constitute
the entire agreement of the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter
hereof and supersede any and all prior discussions, negotiations, proposals,
undertakings, understandings and agreements, whether written or oral, among
Buyer and the Guarantors or any Guarantor Affiliate, on the one hand, and
Seller or any of its Affiliates, on the other hand. No representations,
warranties, covenants, understandings or agreements, oral or otherwise,
relating to the transactions contemplated by this Limited Guaranty exist
between any of the parties hereto except as expressly set forth in this
Limited Guaranty, the Equity Commitment Letter and the Purchase Agreement.

10.Amendments and Waivers. No amendment or waiver of any provision of this
Limited Guaranty will be valid and binding unless it is in writing and signed,
in the case of an amendment, by the Guarantors and Seller, or in the case of
waiver, by the party against whom the waiver is to be effective. No waiver by
any party of any breach or violation of, or default under, this Limited
Guaranty, whether intentional or not, will be deemed to extend to any prior or
subsequent breach, violation or default hereunder or affect in any way any
rights arising by virtue of any prior or subsequent such occurrence. No delay
or omission on the part of any party in exercising any right, power or remedy
under this Limited Guaranty will operate as a waiver thereof. 11.No Third Party Beneficiaries. Except (a) for the provisions of this Limited
Guaranty which reference Guarantor Affiliates (each of which shall be for the
benefit of and enforceable by each Guarantor Affiliate) and (b) each parties'
respective permitted legal successors and permitted assigns, the parties
hereby agree that their respective representations, warranties and covenants
set forth herein are solely for the benefit of the other parties hereto, in
accordance with and subject to the terms of this Limited Guaranty, and this
Limited Guaranty is not intended to, and does not, confer upon any Person
other than the parties hereto and the Guarantor Affiliates any rights or
remedies hereunder, including the right to rely upon the representations and
warranties set forth herein.

12.Counterparts and Delivery by Electronic Transmission. This Limited Guaranty
and any amendments or waivers hereto may be executed in any number of
counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original
and all of which together shall be deemed to be one and the same instrument
binding upon all of the parties hereto notwithstanding the fact that all
parties are not signatory to the original or the same counterpart. For
purposes of this Limited Guaranty, electronic and .PDF signatures shall be
deemed originals. This Limited Guaranty will become effective when duly
executed by each party hereto.

13.Notices. All notices, requests, consents, claims, demands, waivers and
other communications under this Limited Guaranty shall be in writing and shall
be deemed to have been duly given when delivered personally (with written
confirmation of receipt if delivered by courier), when sent by electronic mail
(with confirmation of transmission), one (1) Business Day after being sent by
a nationally recognized overnight courier service (providing written proof of
delivery) or three (3) Business Days after being mailed by certified or

taken if reasonably likely to materially delay, prevent, impair or impede the

to release such information) in connection with any Action to enforce this
Limited Guaranty, the Equity Commitment Letter, or the Purchase Agreement, in
connection with the approval or consummation of the Transaction or for
disclosures to such Person's respective Representatives, so long as such
Persons agree to keep such information confidential on terms substantially
identical to the terms contained in this Section 20; provided, further, that

convenience purposes only and will not in any way affect the meaning or
interpretation hereof. 22.Relationship of the Parties; Several Liability. Each party acknowledges and

November 6, 2019



Realogy Holdings Corp.



Attention: Executive Vice President and General Counsel



Ladies and Gentlemen:



Reference is hereby made to that certain Purchase and Sale Agreement, dated as
of November 6, 2019 (as amended, modified and/or waived from time to time in
accordance with its terms, the "Purchase Agreement"), by and between SIRVA
Worldwide, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Buyer"), and Realogy Holdings Corp.,
a Delaware corporation ("Seller"), providing for the acquisition of all of the
issued and outstanding common shares, par value $0.01 per share, of Cartus
Corporation (the "Shares"), after giving effect to the Restructuring, in each
case, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Purchase
Agreement. Capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined herein shall have
the meanings ascribed to such terms in the Purchase Agreement.

In connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the
Purchase Agreement, Global Relocation and Moving Services, LP, a Delaware
limited partnership and the parent company of Buyer ("Parent"), and Seller
hereby agree as follows:

1.Deferred Payment. As additional consideration for the Shares and subject to
the terms and conditions set forth in this letter agreement, Seller shall be
entitled to receive from Parent an additional payment in an amount equal to
the Deferred Payment Amount (the "Deferred Payment"), by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by Seller,
such amount to be paid no later than the earlier of (i) two (2) Business Days
after the consummation of a Sale of Parent, and (ii) such earlier date that
Parent determines to make the Deferred Payment.

2.No Distributions. Until the Deferred Payment is paid in full, Parent shall
not declare or make any dividend, distribution or other similar payment in
respect of its equity securities or repurchase or redeem any of its equity
securities (other than any repurchase or redemption of equity securities from
former employees of (or independent contractors to) Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries upon termination of employment or other service that is permitted
under the terms of Buyer's first lien credit agreement), in each case without
the prior written consent of Seller. 3.Certain Acknowledgements and Agreements. Seller hereby acknowledges and
agrees, for itself and on behalf of its Representatives and their respective
successors and assigns, as follows: (i) the obligation of Parent to pay the
Deferred Payment shall not be represented by any form of certificate or other
instrument, is not guaranteed or secured in any fashion and shall be the
obligation solely of Parent and of no other Person; (ii) the right to receive
the Deferred Payment is solely an unsecured contractual right and is not a
security for purposes of any federal or state securities laws (and shall
confer upon Seller only the rights of a general unsecured creditor under
applicable federal or state law, subject to the restrictions set forth
herein); (iii) no duty (whether arising under law or otherwise) shall be
deemed owed by Parent or any of its Affiliates (including indirectly through
Parent) by virtue of the covenants and agreements of Parent hereunder, (iv)
the Deferred Payment shall not at any time constitute or be deemed to be any
equity interest in Parent, nor be converted into or exchanged (directly or
indirectly and whether in connection with any bankruptcy, insolvency or
otherwise) for any equity interest in Parent, nor entitle the holder thereof
to any dividend rights, voting rights, liquidation rights, preemptive rights
or other rights or powers common to holders of Parent's or any of its
Affiliates' equity interests, other than the right to receive payment of money
as described in this letter agreement; (v) the Deferred Payment may not be
sold, assigned, pledged, gifted, conveyed, transferred or otherwise disposed,
except as permitted pursuant to Section 13.4 of the Purchase Agreement, and
any attempted such transfer in violation of this Agreement shall be null and
void; and (vi) no interest is payable with respect to the Deferred Payment
(except as provided in the definition of Deferred Payment Amount).

4.Treatment of Deferred Payment. All payments made under this letter agreement
shall be treated by the Parties as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for Tax
purposes unless otherwise required by applicable law.

5.Certain Definitions. As used in this letter agreement, the following terms
have the respective meanings set forth below.

"Base Amount" means $25,000,000.

"Deferred Payment Amount" means (i) if the Deferred Payment is made to Seller
on or prior to the first anniversary of the Closing Date, an amount equal to
the Base Amount; (ii) if the Deferred Payment is made to Seller after the
first anniversary of the Closing Date and on or prior to the second
anniversary of the Closing Date, an amount equal to $26,000,000; and (iii) if
the Deferred Payment is made to Seller after the second anniversary of the
Closing Date, an amount equal to the sum of (x) the Base Amount plus (y) a
notional amount accruing on a daily basis at the rate of 8% per annum,
compounded annually, during the period from the Closing Date until the second
anniversary of the Closing Date, and at the rate of 10% per annum, compounded
annually, from and after the second anniversary of the Closing Date until the
date on which the Deferred Payment Amount is paid in full hereunder.

"Sale of Parent" means (i) a direct or indirect sale or disposition, in one or
a series of transactions, of all or substantially all of the assets (including
equity interests in Subsidiaries) of Parent and its Subsidiaries on a
consolidated basis, whether through a sale or transfer of assets,
distribution, public offering, merger, consolidation or other business
combination, (ii) any transaction or series of related transactions that
results in any Person or group (within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules or regulations
promulgated thereunder), other than the limited partners of Parent as of the
Effective Date and their Affiliates, becoming the beneficial owner of more
than 50% of the equity securities of Parent (whether measured by vote or
value) in the aggregate or (iii) Madison Dearborn Partners ceasing to have a
direct or indirect interest in Parent or Buyer.
