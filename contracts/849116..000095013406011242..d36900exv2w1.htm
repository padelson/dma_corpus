required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor the Merger Consideration into which the shares of Company Common Stock
theretofore represented by such Certificate shall have been converted pursuant to <U>Section
1.6(a)</U>, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. The Exchange Agent
shall accept such Certificates upon compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the
Exchange Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal exchange
practices. In the event of a transfer of ownership of such Company Common Stock which is not

Company Common Stock which remain unpaid or unsatisfied at the Effective Time, and there shall be
no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of
the shares of Company Common Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.
If, after the Effective Time, the Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the
Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be

applicable Law.

complied with this <U>Article&nbsp;I</U> shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation and
only as general creditors thereof for payment of their claim for the Merger Consideration and, if
applicable, any unpaid dividends or other distributions which such holder may be due on Company
Common Stock, under applicable Law. All rights of any former holder of Company Common Stock to

unclaimed, terminate on the date that is six months prior to the date on which such unclaimed

abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

included in the Exchange Fund, as directed by the Surviving Corporation, on a daily basis. Any

Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &#147;<U>Code</U>&#148;), or any provision of state, local or foreign

was made by the Surviving Corporation.
