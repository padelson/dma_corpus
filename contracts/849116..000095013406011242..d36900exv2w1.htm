 (c) Unless otherwise determined by Parent prior to the Effective Time, the directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial directors of the Surviving Corporation, and the officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation, in each case, until their successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified in the manner provided in the Surviving Corporations Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws, or as otherwise provided by applicable law. 

   

 SECTION 1.6. _Conversion of Securities_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Merger Sub, the Company or the holder of any shares of Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the " _Company Common Stock_ ") or any shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub (the " _Merger Sub Common Stock_ "): 

   

 (a) _Company Common Stock_. Each share of Company Common Stock that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any shares of Company Common Stock to be cancelled in accordance with _Section 1.6(c)_ and Dissenting Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive from the Surviving Corporation, and become exchangeable for, an amount in cash equal to $30.00 per share of Company Common Stock, without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). As of the Effective Time, all shares of Company Common Stock upon which the Merger Consideration is payable pursuant to this _Section 1.6(a)_ shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate representing any such shares of Company Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration. 

   

 (b) _Merger Sub Common Stock_. Each share of Merger Sub Common Stock that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of the Surviving Corporation. 

   

 (c) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent and Merger Sub-Owned Company Common Stock_. All shares of Company Common Stock that are owned by the Company or any direct or indirect Subsidiary of the Company and any shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any subsidiary of Parent or Merger Sub or held in the treasury of the Company shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no cash or other consideration shall be delivered or deliverable in exchange therefor. 

   

 (d) _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, shares of the Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who has not voted in favor of the adoption of the Merger 

    ##### 

  

    

Agreement or consented thereto in writing and who has properly demanded such
holders right to appraisal for such shares in accordance with Article 5.12
of the TBCA (and who has neither effectively withdrawn nor lost his, her or
its right to such appraisal) (" _Dissenting Shares_ "), shall not
be converted into a right to receive cash pursuant to _Section 1.6(a)_, and
the holder thereof shall be entitled to only such rights as are granted by
the TBCA. If after the Effective Time such holder fails to perfect or
withdraws or otherwise loses his, her or its right to appraisal,
such Dissenting Shares shall be treated as if they had been converted as of
the Effective Time into a right to receive the Merger Consideration, without
interest thereon. The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any demands
received by the Company under Article 5.12 of the TBCA for appraisal of
shares of the Company Common Stock, and Parent shall have the right to
participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands.
The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make
any determination of fair value or any payment with respect to, or settle or
offer to settle, any such demands. 

   

 SECTION 1.7. _Exchange of Certificates_. 

   

 (a) _Exchange Agent_. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with a bank or trust company designated by Parent (the " _Exchange Agent_ "), for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock that have been converted into the right to receive, and become exchangeable for, the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 1.6(a)_, for exchange in accordance with this _Article I_ through the Exchange Agent, an amount equal to the aggregate Merger Consideration (such consideration being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Exchange Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions of the Surviving Corporation, make payments of the Merger Consideration out of the Exchange Fund. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. 

   

 (b) _Exchange Procedure for Certificates_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Certificates_ ") that were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 1.6(a)_: (x) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such other customary provisions as the Surviving Corporation may reasonably specify); and (y) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by the Surviving Corporation, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration into which the shares of Company Common Stock theretofore represented by such Certificate shall have been converted pursuant to _Section 1.6(a)_ , and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. The Exchange Agent shall accept such Certificates upon compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Exchange Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices. In the event of a transfer of ownership of such Company Common Stock which is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment may be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate so 

    ##### 

  

    

surrendered is registered, if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or
otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the Person requesting
such payment shall pay any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the
payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or
establish to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Taxes
have been paid or are not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by
this _Section 1.7(b)_, each Certificate (other than a Certificate
representing shares of Company Common Stock cancelled in accordance with
_Section 1.6(c)_ and other than Dissenting Shares) shall be deemed at any
time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon
such surrender the Merger Consideration, without interest, into which the
shares of Company Common Stock theretofore represented by such Certificate
shall have been converted pursuant to  _Section 1.6(a)_. No interest will be
paid or will accrue on the consideration payable upon the surrender of any
Certificate. 

   

 (c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. All consideration paid upon the surrender of Certificates in accordance with the terms of this _Article I_ shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock theretofore represented by such Certificates, subject, however, to any obligation of the Surviving Corporation to pay any dividends or make any other distributions with a record date prior to the Effective Time which may have been authorized or made with respect to shares of Company Common Stock which remain unpaid or unsatisfied at the Effective Time, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, the Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this _Article I_, except as otherwise provided by applicable Law. 

   

 (d) _Termination of the Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates for six months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation and any holders of the Certificates who have not theretofore complied with this _Article I_ shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation and only as general creditors thereof for payment of their claim for the Merger Consideration and, if applicable, any unpaid dividends or other distributions which such holder may be due on Company Common Stock, under applicable Law. All rights of any former holder of Company Common Stock to receive the Merger Consideration hereunder shall, to the extent such Merger Consideration remains unclaimed, terminate on the date that is six months prior to the date on which such unclaimed Merger Consideration would otherwise become payable to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. 

   

 (e) _No Liability_. None of the Company, Merger Sub, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent, or any of their respective employees, officers, directors, stockholders, agents or affiliates, shall be liable to any Person in respect of any cash delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. 

   

 (f) _Investment of the Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund, as directed by the Surviving Corporation, on a daily basis. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to the Surviving Corporation. To the extent that there are losses with respect to such investments, or the Exchange Fund diminishes for other reasons below the level required to make prompt payments 

    ##### 

  

    

of the Merger Consideration as contemplated hereby, the Surviving Corporation
shall promptly replace or restore the portion of the Exchange Fund lost
through investments or other events so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund
is, at all times, maintained at a level sufficient to make such payments. 

   

 (g) _Withholding Rights_. The Surviving Corporation and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock such amounts as the Surviving Corporation is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), or any provision of state, local or foreign tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld by the Surviving Corporation, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation. 

   

 (h) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may require as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration payable pursuant to this Agreement in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate. 

   

 SECTION 1.8. _Stock Plans_. 

   

 (a) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Board of Directors of the Company (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof administering any of the Companys stock option and stock incentive plans listed in _Section 3.2_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, each as amended (collectively, the " _Option Plans_ ")) shall adopt such resolutions or take such other actions as may be required to effect the following: 

    

 (i) no later than ten (10) days prior to the Effective Time, each then outstanding option to purchase shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Options_ ") shall become vested and exercisable with respect to all of the  shares of Company Common Stock subject thereto; 

   

 (ii) adjust the terms of each share of Company Common Stock subject to vesting and transfer or other restrictions (" _Restricted Stock_ ") as necessary to provide that, in accordance with the terms of the applicable Restricted Stock award agreement, at the Effective Time, such shares shall become fully vested and all restrictions on such shares shall lapse and pursuant to Section 1.6(a), such shares shall be canceled, retired and shall cease to exist, and shall be converted into the right to receive from the Surviving Corporation the Merger Consideration (it being understood that restricted stock awards set forth on _Schedule 1.8_ which in accordance with their original terms are to be granted only upon achievement of specified performance-based goals that have not been achieved prior to the Effective Time shall not be granted in connection with the 

   ##### 

  

    

Merger nor shall they vest or be converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that any such shares that, by
their original terms are granted upon a change of control shall be granted
and shall vest and be converted at the Effective Time into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration); and 

   

 (iii) make such other changes to the Option Plans as Parent and the Company may agree are appropriate to give effect to the Merger. 

  

 (b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions necessary to provide that, at the Effective Time, each then outstanding Option granted under any Option Plan, or granted other than pursuant to such Option Plans, whether or not then exercisable or vested, shall be cancelled in exchange for the right to receive from Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation an amount in cash in respect thereof equal to the product of (i) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the per share exercise price of such Option, multiplied by (ii) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Option (such payment to made by the Company through its customary payroll procedures and net of applicable withholding Taxes). 

   

 (c) Except as provided herein or as otherwise agreed to by the parties, (i) the Company shall cause the Option Plans to terminate as of the Effective Time and cause the provisions in any other plan, program or arrangement providing for the issuance or grant by the Company of any interest in respect of the capital stock of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to terminate and have no further force or effect as of the Effective Time and (ii) the Company shall ensure that following the Effective Time no holder of Options or any participant in the Option Plans or anyone other than Parent shall hold or have any right to acquire any equity securities of the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary thereof. 

   

 SECTION 1.9. _Time and Place of Closing_. Unless otherwise mutually agreed upon in writing by Parent and the Company, the closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") will be held at the offices of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP, 4 Times Square, New York, New York, at 10:00 a.m., local time, on the second business day following the date that all of the conditions precedent specified in _Article VI_ (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the fulfillment or waiver of those conditions) have been satisfied or, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, waived by the party or parties permitted to do so (such date being referred to hereinafter as the " _Closing Date_ "). The Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby shall be deemed to have become effective at 12:01 a.m. on the Closing Date.

The Company and each of its Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed as a foreign corporation to do business, and is in good standing, in each jurisdiction where its business or the character of its properties owned, possessed, licensed, operated or leased, or the nature of its activities, makes such qualification necessary, except for such failure which, when taken together with all other such failures, would not result in a Company Material Adverse Effect. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Company Material Adverse Effect_ " means any effect, change, fact, event, occurrence, development or circumstance that, individually or together with any other effect, change, fact, event, occurrence, development or circumstance, (A) is or could reasonably be expected to result in a material adverse effect on or change in the condition (financial or otherwise), properties, business, operations, results of operations, assets or liabilities of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (B) could reasonably be expected to prohibit, restrict or materially impede the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger; _provided_ _,_ _however_ , that none of the following shall be taken in to account in determining whether there has been a Company Material Adverse Effect, or a 

    ##### 

  

    

Company Material Adverse Effect could reasonably be expected to occur: (i)
any change in the U.S. securities markets, generally; (ii) any change in the
market price or trading volume of the Company Common Stock after the date
hereof, _provided_ that the exception in this clause (ii) shall not prevent
an assertion that any underlying cause of such change independently has
contributed to a Company Material Adverse Effect; (iii) any failure by
the Company to meet internal projections or forecasts or published revenue or
earnings predictions for any period ending (or for which revenues or earnings
are released) on or after the date hereof,  _provided_ that the exception in
this clause (iii) shall not prevent an assertion that any underlying cause of
such failure independently has contributed to a Company Material
Adverse Effect; (iv) any change in accounting requirements or principles
required by GAAP or required by any change in applicable Laws and any
restatement of the Companys financial statements as a result thereof or
public announcement related thereto, _provided_ that the exception in this
clause (iv) shall not prevent an assertion that any underlying cause of such
restatement independently has contributed to a Company Material Adverse
Effect; (v) any determination under SOX that the Company has a material
weakness or significant deficiency in its internal controls or procedures, 
_provided_ that the exception in this clause (v) shall not prevent an
assertion that any underlying cause of such material weakness or deficiency
independently has contributed to a Company Material Adverse Effect; (vi) any
adverse change, effect, event, occurrence, state of facts or development to
the extent attributable to the announcement or pendency of the Merger
(including any reduction in revenues, any disruption in supplier,
distributor, partner or similar relationships or any loss of employees);
(vii) any adverse change, effect, event, occurrence, state of facts
or development related to any action or inaction by Parent or Merger Sub
(including any reduction in revenues, any disruption in supplier,
distributor, partner or similar relationships or any loss of employees);
(viii) any adverse change, effect, event, occurrence, state of facts or
development attributable to conditions affecting the U.S. economy as a whole
or the industries in which the Company participates, excluding any adverse
change, effect, event, occurrence, state of fact or development that would
reasonably be expected to have a materially disproportionate impact on
the condition (financial or otherwise), properties, business, operations,
results of operations, assets or liabilities of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (ix) any adverse change, effect, event,
occurrence, state of fact or development resulting from any change in Laws
after the date hereof or the Guidelines for Payday Lending which were
publicly announced by the FDIC on or about March 1, 2005 (the "Guidelines")
or any subsequent implementation or modification thereof or any public
announcement pertaining thereto, unless all such changes in Laws and
Guidelines after the date hereof, in the aggregate, would reasonably be
expected to result in a loss of EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Agreement),
damages or liabilities in an amount exceeding twenty percent (20%) of LTM
EBITDA (as hereinafter defined) in which case all such changes will be
considered in determining whether a Company Material Adverse Effect has
occurred or could reasonably be expected to occur; (x) any adverse change,
effect, event, occurrence, state of facts or development attributable or
relating to expenses incurred in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including as a result of the Companys entry
into, and as permitted by, this Agreement, the payment of any amounts due to,
or the provision o f any other benefits (including benefits relating to
acceleration of stock options) to, any officers or employees under employment
contracts, non-competition agreements, employee benefit plans,
severance arrangements or other arrangements in existence as of the date of
this Agreement or as disclosed in this Agreement; or (xi) any adverse change,
effect, event, occurrence, state of facts or development resulting from or

Corporation may substitute therefor policies issued by an insurance carrier
with the same or better credit rating as the Companys current insurance

be unreasonably withheld or delayed). 

   

 (b) The Company agrees to provide, and will cause its Subsidiaries and its and their respective officers, employees and advisors to provide, all cooperation reasonably necessary in connection with the arrangement of Financing to be consummated prior to or contemporaneously with the Effective Time in respect of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including participation in meetings, due diligence sessions, road shows, the preparation of offering memoranda, private placement memoranda, prospectuses and similar documents, or other requested certificates or documents, including audited and unaudited financial statements, comfort letters of accountants (it being understood that the Company does not control its accountants) and legal opinions as may be reasonably requested; _provided_ that nothing herein shall require such cooperation to the extent it would delay the Closing beyond the date contemplated in _Section 1.9_ or interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of the Company or otherwise result in any significant interference with the prompt and timely discharge by such employees of their normal duties. Parent shall, promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred by the Company in connection with all such cooperation.
