days after receipt of the Settlement Statement, that Seller objects to the
computation contained therein, specifying in detail the basis for such
objection (the " _Objection Notice_ "), Purchasers calculations set forth in
the Settlement Statement shall be binding upon the parties. The
calculation set forth in the Settlement Statement shall not be disputed as to
accounting principles, procedures or methodologies so long as the principles,
procedures and methodologies used to compute it are consistent with GAAP,
subject to Section 5.8(k) regarding the 2009 MIP Accrual. For thirty (30)
calendar days following Purchasers receipt of any Objection Notice, the
parties shall, in good faith, negotiate to resolve all objections set forth in
the Objection Notice, and any such resolutions shall be incorporated by
Purchaser into the Settlement Statement. If Purchaser and Seller are unable to
resolve all objections set forth in the Objection Notice within thirty (30)
calendar days following Purchasers receipt of the Objection Notice (or
within such extended time period as is mutually agreed to by the parties),
unresolved objections shall be referred for a final determination of such
unresolved objections (but only such matters) to an accounting firm mutually
acceptable to Purchaser and Seller, in each case acting reasonably (the "
_Accounting Firm_ "). Purchaser and Seller shall instruct the Accounting Firm
to make final determination of the disputed items in accordance with
the guidelines and procedures set forth in this Agreement. Purchaser and
Seller shall cooperate with the Accounting Firm during the term of its
engagement (including by executing an engagement letter in customary form with
the Accounting Firm reflecting the terms of this Agreement and any other
customary provisions mutually agreed upon by Purchaser and Seller). Purchaser
and Seller shall instruct the Accounting Firm not to, and the Accounting Firm
shall not, assign a value to any item in dispute greater than the greatest
value for such item assigned by Purchaser, on the one hand, or Seller, on the
other hand, or less than the smallest value for such item assigned by
Purchaser, on the one hand, or Seller on the other hand. Purchaser and Seller
shall also instruct the Accounting Firm to make its determination based solely
on presentations by Purchaser and Seller which are in accordance with the
guidelines and procedures set forth in this Agreement (i.e., not on the basis
 



 

12  of an independent review). The Settlement Statement and the resulting
calculation of Final Working Capital shall become final and binding on the
parties hereto on the date the Accounting Firm delivers its final resolution
in writing to Purchaser and Seller (which final resolution shall be requested
by the parties to be delivered not more than forty-five (45) calendar days
following submission of such disputed matters), and such resolution by the
Accounting Firm shall not be subject to court review or otherwise appealable.
The fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be paid by Seller, on the
one hand, and Purchaser on the other hand, based on the ratio of the disputed
amount not awarded to such Person to the total amount actually disputed by
Seller and Purchaser. For example, if the aggregate amount disputed by Seller
is $1,000, and if Purchaser contests only $500 of the amount disputed by
Seller, and if the Accounting Firm ultimately resolves the dispute by finding
that Seller properly disputed $300 of the $500, then the fees and expenses of
the Accounting Firm will be paid 60% (i.e., 300 divided by 500) by Purchaser
and 40% (i.e., 200 divided by 500) by Seller. The parties agree that, from and
after the Closing, the provisions of this Section 2.4.2 and the arbitration
provisions contemplated hereby shall be the exclusive remedy and
exclusive forum of the parties with respect to the determination of Final
Working Capital.

2.4.3 Seller and Purchaser shall provide the other and their Representatives
with reasonable access during normal working hours to the employees, books,
records and other supporting information and documents as reasonably requested
in connection with the preparation and review of the Settlement Statement and
any objections thereto.

2.4.4 In the event an Excess Amount exists, Purchaser shall remit the Excess
Amount to Seller pursuant to Section 2.4.5, and Purchaser and Seller shall
promptly (but in any event within three (3) Business Days) direct TD Bank, in
accordance with the terms of the TD Escrow Agreement, to remit to Seller the
entire Working Capital Escrow. In the event a Shortfall Amount exists and is
less than the Working Capital Escrow, Purchaser and Seller shall promptly (but
in any event within three (3) Business Days) direct TD Bank, in accordance
with the terms of the TD Escrow Agreement, to remit (i) an amount equal to
the Shortfall Amount from the Working Capital Escrow to Purchaser, and (ii)
the remainder of the Working Capital Escrow to Seller. In the event a
Shortfall Amount exists and exceeds the Working Capital Escrow, Purchaser and
Seller shall promptly (but in any event within three (3) Business Days) direct
TD Bank, in accordance with the terms of the TD Escrow Agreement, to remit the
entire Working Capital Escrow to Purchaser, and Seller shall remit to
Purchaser an amount equal to such difference pursuant to Section 2.4.5.

2.4.5 Any payment required to be made by Purchaser or Seller under Section
2.4.4 shall be paid in accordance with the instructions of the appropriate
recipient (i) within the lesser of thirty-five (35) calendar days after
delivery by Purchaser of the Settlement Statement, or five (5) calendar days
after Seller notifies Purchaser that it does not object to the amounts set
forth on the Settlement Statement; or (ii) if Seller shall have delivered an
Objection Notice to Purchaser, within five (5) calendar days following final
determination of the disputed items pursuant to Section 2.4.2.



 

13 2.5 _Closing_. The closing of the sale and purchase of the Shares (the "
_Closing_ ") shall be held at a mutually acceptable location, at 9:00 a.m.
local time on March 31, 2009, or, if later, promptly following the
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to Closing set forth in Articles 6
and 7. The date on which the Closing occurs is referred to herein as the "

15 ARTICLE 3

_REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SELLER AND PARENT_

Seller and Parent hereby jointly and severally represent and warrant to
Purchaser and ICF as of the date of this Agreement and, if the Closing occurs,
as of the Closing Date as follows:

3.1 _Organization and Existence_. The Company is a corporation, duly
incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
State of Delaware. The Company has the requisite power and authority to own
its properties and operate its business as presently conducted. The Company
is qualified to do business in each jurisdiction in which the conduct of its
business or the ownership or leasing of its properties makes such
qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to result
in a Material Adverse Change. _Schedule 3.1_ sets forth the jurisdictions in
which the Company is qualified to do business and each jurisdiction in which
the Company operates an office, including without limitation any branch office
or representative office. True and complete copies of the Certificate of
Incorporation and Bylaws (or other charter documents) of the Company
have been delivered to Purchaser.

3.2 _Authorization_. The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement
and the Ancillary Agreements have been duly authorized by all necessary
action required to be taken by Seller and Parent. Seller and Parent have the
requisite power and authority to enter into this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements, to perform their respective obligations hereunder and thereunder
and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.

3.3 _Due Execution; Binding Obligations_. This Agreement has been duly
executed and delivered by Seller and Parent. This Agreement constitutes a
legal, valid and binding agreement of Seller and Parent, enforceable against
Seller and Parent in accordance with its terms, except to the extent that
enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, reorganization,
insolvency, moratorium or other laws affecting the enforcement of creditors
rights generally and by general principles, of equity, regardless of whether
such enforcement is considered a proceeding at law or in equity.

3.4 _Books and Records_. The Books and Records are (a) except as disclosed on
_Schedule 3.4_, maintained by the Company at office locations leased by the
Company, and (b) complete and correct in all material respects. The Company
and each Subsidiary maintains accounting controls sufficient to insure that
its transactions are (a) in all material respects executed in accordance with
its managements general or specific authorization, and (b) recorded as
necessary to permit the preparation of financial statements in conformity
with GAAP. The Books and Records have been made available to Purchaser. The
Corporate Records are complete and accurate and all corporate proceedings and
actions reflected in the Corporate Records have been conducted or taken in
compliance with all applicable Laws and with the certificate of incorporation
and by-laws of the Company, except to the extent that any failure to be or do
so would not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Change. 



 

16 3.5 _Capital Stock_. The authorized capital of the Company consists of 500
shares of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of which 355 shares of
common stock have been issued and are outstanding as fully paid and non-
assessable. Seller owns, beneficially and of record, all of the Shares, free
and clear of all Encumbrances, other than any Encumbrances arising under the
Credit Facility. The Shares were issued in compliance with all applicable Laws
and are not subject to, nor were they issued in violation of, any preemptive
rights. No shares of capital stock of the Company are reserved for issuance
and there are no outstanding or authorized options, warrants, rights,
subscriptions, claims of any character, agreements, obligations, convertible
or exchangeable securities, or other commitments, contingent or
otherwise, relating to the capital of the Company, pursuant to which the
Company is or may become obligated to issue any shares or any securities
convertible into, exchangeable for, or evidencing the right to subscribe for,
any shares of its capital. There are no voting trusts, proxies or other
agreements or understandings to which the Company, Parent or Seller is a party
with respect to the voting of the Shares. Except for Purchasers right under
this Agreement, no Person has any written or oral agreement, option or
warrant or any right or privilege (whether by Law, pre-emptive or contractual)
capable of becoming such for (i) the purchase or acquisition from Seller or
Parent of any of the Shares, or (ii) the purchase, subscription, allotment or
issuance of any of the unissued shares or other securities of the Company.

3.6 _Subsidiaries_. The Company does not directly or indirectly own any
equity or similar interest in, or any interest convertible into or
exchangeable or exercisable for any equity or similar interest in, any Person
other than the Subsidiaries set forth on _Schedule 3.6_. Each of the
Subsidiaries is an entity duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the Laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation or organization.
Each Subsidiary has all necessary corporate power and authority to own its
respective properties and to carry on its respective businesses as presently
conducted and is duly qualified or licensed to do business in good standing in
all jurisdictions in which the nature of its businesses requires licensing or
qualification, except where the failure to be so qualified or licensed would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a
Material Adverse Change. _Schedule 3.6_ sets forth the jurisdictions in which
each of the Subsidiaries is qualified to do business. All the outstanding
shares of capital stock of, or other ownership interests in, each of the
Subsidiaries are validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable and are owned
beneficially and of record by the Company, free and clear of all
Encumbrances, other than any Encumbrances arising under the Credit Facility.
_Schedule 3.6_ sets forth the authorized, issued and outstanding capital stock
of, or other ownership interests in, each of the Subsidiaries and
each jurisdiction in which a Subsidiary operates an office, including without
limitation, any branch office or representative office. Seller has delivered
to Purchaser complete and correct copies of the certificate of incorporation,
certificate of formation, operating agreements, and bylaws or other
organizational documents of each of the Subsidiaries. None of the Subsidiaries
directly or indirectly own any equity or similar interest in, or any interest
convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for any equity or similar
interest in, any Person. There is no outstanding subscription, option,
warrant, call, right, or other agreement or commitment obligating any
Subsidiary to issue, sell, deliver, or transfer (including any right of
conversion or exchange under any outstanding security or other instrument) any
security or other evidence of any ownership interest such Subsidiary.

3.7 _No Conflict or Violation_. Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.7_ ,
neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the Ancillary
Agreements, nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby will result in (a) a material violation of, or a  



 

17  material conflict with, the charter documents of Seller, Parent, the Company
or any Subsidiary or any subscription, stockholders or similar agreements
or understandings to which Seller, Parent, the Company or any Subsidiary is a
party; (b) a material breach of, or a material default under (or an event
which, with notice or lapse of time or both would constitute a material
default under, or result in the termination of, or accelerate the performance
required by, or create a right of termination, acceleration, or payment under)
any Material Contract (other than any Government Contract or Grant),
Encumbrance or Permit to which Seller, Parent, the Company or any Subsidiary
is party or by which Seller, Parent, the Company or any Subsidiary is bound;
(c) the payment by, or the creation of any obligation (absolute or contingent)
to pay on behalf of, the Company or its Subsidiaries of any severance,
termination, change of control, "golden parachute," or other similar payment
pursuant to any employment agreement or other Contract or the triggering of
any severance notice obligation with respect to any of the employees of the
Company or its Subsidiaries; (d) a material violation by the Company or any
Subsidiary of any applicable Law; (e) a material violation of any order,
judgment, writ, injunction decree, or award to which Seller, Parent, the
Company or any Subsidiary is a party or subject; or (f) an imposition of any
Encumbrance on the Shares or any property or asset of the Company or any
Subsidiary. Seller has previously provided to Purchaser a true and correct
copy of that certain Fifth Amendment to Second Amended and Restated Credit
Agreement dated as of March 23, 2009 by and among Parent, Lenders (as defined
therein), Syndication Agents (as defined therein), Documentation Agent (as
defined therein) and Administrative Agent (as defined therein) (the " _Fifth
Amendment_ "). The Fifth Amendment has been duly executed and is valid and
binding and has not been amended or modified.

3.8 _Consents and Approvals_. Except for the matters disclosed on _Schedule
3.8_ , and except for compliance with the HSR Act, no consent, Permit,
approval or authorization of, or declaration, filing, application, transfer or
registration with, any Governmental Entity or regulatory authority or any
other Person is required to be made or obtained by Seller, Parent, the Company
or any Subsidiary (a) by virtue of the execution, delivery or performance of
this Agreement; (b) to avoid the loss of any Permit or the material breach of
any Contract or the creation of an Encumbrance on any of the assets or
properties of the Company or any Subsidiary as a result of the transactions
contemplated hereunder; (c) to enable Purchaser to own the Shares; or (d) to
enable Purchaser to continue the operations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries following the Closing Date as presently conducted; provided,
however, that with respect to any Contracts, the representation and warranty
set forth in subparts (a), (b) and (d) above is made only with respect to the
Material Contracts (excluding any Government Contract or Grant).

3.9 _Litigation_. Except as disclosed on _Schedule 3.9_ , there is no pending
or, to Parents and Sellers knowledge, threatened, Action, (i) to which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, or (ii) affecting Seller,
Parent, the Company or any Subsidiary which could affect the enforceability of
this Agreement or which could adversely affect any of the assets or
properties of the Company or any Subsidiary or the ability of Seller or Parent
to consummate the sale of the Shares contemplated by, or perform their
respective obligations under, this Agreement. None of the Actions set forth
in _Schedule 3.9_ could reasonably be expected to result in any Material
Adverse Change. With respect to each such Action, insofar as such Action
relates to the Company and/or any of its Subsidiaries, copies of
all pleadings, filings, correspondence with opposing parties and their
counsel, results of studies, judgments, orders,  



 

18  attachments, impositions of or recordings of Encumbrances and other
documents have been made available to Purchaser. Neither the Company nor any
Subsidiary is subject to any outstanding injunction, judgment, order, decree
or ruling. To Parents and Sellers knowledge, there is no existing state of
facts, circumstances or contemplated event that is reasonably likely to give
rise to an Action against the Company or any Subsidiary.

3.10 _Financial Statements_. Attached hereto as _Schedule 3.10_ are copies
of (i) balance sheets of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of December 31,
2008, and December 31, 2007 (the December 31, 2008 balance sheet referred to
herein as the " _Balance Sheet_ "), (ii) income statements for the years then
ended, and (iii) monthly financial statements in respect to the period January

and present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the
Company and its Subsidiaries as of the respective dates thereof and the
results of operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries for the respective
periods then ended in conformity with GAAP, except (a) for the effect of
Parent or Seller transactions that have not been separately allocated to the
Company, and (b) that any unaudited Financial Statements are subject to
normal year-end adjustments (none of which are material, individually or in
the aggregate) and lack footnotes and other presentation items. Seller has
provided to Purchaser true and correct copies of all internal audit reports
for the past two (2) years relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries,
including, without limitation, reports on internal controls. To Parents and

understanding or commitment, or any right or privilege capable of becoming

the aggregate) assets or properties.

3.14 _Unclaimed Property_. To Parents and Sellers knowledge, and except to
the extent included in the $70,938 accrual for unclaimed property reflected in

and its Subsidiaries have no material assets that may constitute unclaimed
property under applicable Laws. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the Company and its Subsidiaries have established and followed

any Liability for the improper classification by the Company or any

collective bargaining agreements with any union or other bargaining group for
any employees of the Company or any Subsidiary and Seller has no knowledge of

28  Except as specified on _Schedule 3.19_ , no employee described in _Exhibit

January 1, 2007. No current Key Employee has indicated any present or future
intention or, to Parents and Sellers knowledge, intends to terminate his or
her employment with the Company or any Subsidiary or not to engage in
employment with Purchaser. With respect to all current and former employees,
each of the Company and each Subsidiary is and has been in compliance with all
provisions of Law pertaining to the employment and terminating of
employees, including without limitation all Laws relating to labor relations,
equal employment practices, fair employment practices, pay equity,
entitlements, prohibited discrimination, terms and conditions of employment,
occupational health and safety, wages and hours, withholding requirements, or
other similar employment or hiring practices or acts, and neither the Company
nor any Subsidiary is or has been engaged in any unfair labor practice, except
where such noncompliance would not reasonably be expected to result in a
Material Adverse Change. To Parents and Sellers knowledge, with respect to
all current and former employees, each of the Company and each Subsidiary is
and has been in compliance with all provisions of Law pertaining to the
employment and terminating of employees, including without limitation all Laws
relating to labor relations, equal employment practices, fair employment
practices, pay equity, entitlements, prohibited discrimination, terms
and conditions of employment, occupational health and safety, wages and

engaged in any unfair labor practice. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary
is a party to any Action involving a violation or alleged violation of any of
the Laws referred to in the preceding sentence. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, with respect to all United States employees, (A)

compliance with the WARN Act, the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation
Act of 1985, as amended (" _COBRA_ "), the Immigration and Nationality Act,
as amended, the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of

Company and the Subsidiaries are and have at all times in the past been in
compliance with the WARN Act, COBRA, the Immigration and Nationality Act, as
amended, USERRA, and the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986. Except as
set forth on _Schedule 3.19_ , the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement will not (either alone or in conjunction with
another event, such as a termination of employment or other services or
continuation of employment) entitle any employee or other Person to receive
severance, any stay or retention bonus or other compensation which would
not otherwise be payable absent the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or cause the vesting or acceleration of the
time of payment of any award or entitlement under any Employee Benefit Plan.
All amounts due or accrued for all salary, wages, bonuses, commissions,
vacation with pay, and benefits under Employee Benefit Plans have either been
paid or are accurately reflected in the Books and Records. The Company and its

workplace safety or insurance Laws, and neither the Company nor any Subsidiary
has been reassessed under such Laws during the past three years, and to the
knowledge of Parent and Seller, no audit of the Company or any Subsidiary is
currently being performed with respect to any applicable workplace safety and
insurance Laws.



 

29 3.20 _Employee Benefit Plans_.

(a) _Schedule 3.20(a)_ hereto sets forth a list of all Employee Benefit Plans
for the benefit of any employee, retiree or former employee of, or consultant
to, the Company or any Subsidiary (or beneficiary, survivor or dependent of
any such individual), indicating the sponsor of such plan (i.e., the Company
or any Subsidiary). Seller has provided to Purchaser a true and complete copy
of each such Employee Benefit Plan and each relevant brochure or summary plan
description provided to employees.

(b) Except as set forth on  _Schedule 3.20(b)_ , none of Purchaser, Parent,
Seller, the Company or its Subsidiaries is a party to, bound by, or will incur
any Liability under, any severance agreement, deferred compensation agreement,
employment agreement, similar agreement, or Employee Benefit Plan as a result
of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, either
alone or together with another event.

(c) Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.20(c)_ , the execution of, and
performance of the transactions contemplated in, this Agreement will not
constitute an event under any Employee Benefit Plan that will or may result
in any payment (whether of severance pay or otherwise), acceleration,
forgiveness of indebtedness, vesting, distribution, increase in benefits or
obligation to fund benefits with respect to any employees, officers or
directors.

(d) Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.20(d)_ , each Employee Benefit Plan
that is an "employee pension benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(2) of

Section 401(a) of the Code; the trust, if any, forming part of such plan is
exempt from U.S. federal income tax under Section 501(a) of the Code; a
favorable determination letter has been issued by the Internal Revenue Service
(" _IRS_ ") after January 1, 2002, and takes into account the series of
legislation commonly referred to as "GUST" (or, if the plan is documented on
a prototype, such prototype is currently approved by the IRS and takes "GUST"
into account), or has been submitted for a favorable determination letter
under the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 ("
_EGTRRA_ "), or is still within the EGTRRA remedial amendment period provided
by Code Section 401(b) with respect to each plan and trust and each amendment
thereto or such plan and trust and/or amendment; and since the date of such
determination letter there are no circumstances that are likely to adversely
affect the qualification of such plans. Except as set forth on _Schedule
3.20(d)_ , any employee pension benefit plan intended to meet the requirements
of Section 401(a) has been amended in good faith to comply with any
provisions of EGTRRA and, to the extent required, the Pension Protection Act
of 2006 (" _PPA_ ") that are instituted voluntarily by the end of the plan
year in which such changed provision is effective. Except as set forth on
_Schedule 3.20(d)_ , none of Parent, Seller, the Company or its Subsidiaries
has received any correspondence or written or verbal notice from the IRS, the
U.S. Department of the Treasury, the Employee Benefits Security
Administration, any participant in, or beneficiary of, an Employee Benefit
Plan, or any agent representing any of the foregoing that brings into question
the compliance referred to in this Section 3.20. 



 

30 (e) No Tax Liabilities have arisen and are currently unpaid in relation to a
violation of any applicable Employee Benefit Plan of Section 409A of the
Code, nor is any Tax Liability expected to arise in connection with any
payment as a result of the transaction contemplated in this Agreement. All
Employee Benefit Plans subject to Section 409A of the Code have been
documented to conform to such Section.

(f) Neither the Company nor its Subsidiaries has any "leased employees"
within the meaning of Section 414(n) of the Code.

(g) No Employee Benefit Plan is a "voluntary employees beneficiary
association" (within the meaning of Section 501(c)(9) of the Code), and since
January 1, 1988, there have been no other "welfare benefit funds" relating to
employees or former employees within the meaning of Section 419 of the Code.

(h) No event or condition exists with respect to any Employee Benefit Plan
that could subject Purchaser, the Company or its Subsidiaries to any material
Tax under Section 4980B of the Code.

(i) With respect to each Employee Benefit Plan, Seller has heretofore
delivered to Purchaser complete and correct copies of the following documents,
where applicable: (i) the most recent annual report (Form 5500), together with
schedules, as required, filed with the Department of Labor (" _DOL_ "), and
any financial statements and opinions required by Section 103(a)(3) of ERISA
or, for each top-hat plan, a copy of all filings with the DOL, (ii) the most
recent determination letter issued by the IRS, (iii) the most recent summary

Plan and of any trust, insurance, or annuity contracts maintained in
connection therewith including any and all amendments thereto, (v) the most
recent actuarial report, if any, relating to the Employee Benefit Plan, and
(vi) the most recent actuarial valuation, study, or estimate of any retiree
medical and life insurance benefits plan or supplemental retirement benefits
plan.

(j) Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.20(j)_ , all required reports and
descriptions (including but not limited to Form 5500 annual reports and
required attachments (including but not limited to any required independent
audit), Forms 1099-R, summary annual reports, Forms PBGC-1, and summary plan
descriptions) have been filed or distributed appropriately with respect to
each Employee Benefit Plan. All required Tax filings with respect to each
Employee Benefit Plan have been made, including but not limited to IRS Forms
990-T and 5330, and any Taxes due in connection with such filings have been
paid.

(k) None of the Employee Benefit Plans is a "multiemployer plan" (within the
meaning of Section 3(37) or 4001(a)(3) of ERISA) or a single employer pension
plan (within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(15) of ERISA), including a single
employer plan for which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries could incur
Liability under Section 4063 or 4064 of ERISA. Neither the Company nor its
Subsidiaries maintain or contribute to or in any way directly or indirectly
have any Liability (whether contingent or otherwise) with respect to any
"multi-employer plan." 



 

31 (l) No Employee Benefit Plan is subject to Title IV of ERISA. No contingent or
other Liability with respect to which the Company or its Subsidiaries has or
could have any Liability existing under Title IV of ERISA to the Pension
Benefit Guaranty Corporation (the " _PBGC_ ") or to any Employee Benefit Plan
or any plan sponsored by an employee organization that provides benefits to
the Companys or its Subsidiaries employees, and no assets of the Company or
its Subsidiaries are subject to an Encumbrance under Section 4064 or 4068 of
ERISA.

accrued for in the Books and Records of the Company and its Subsidiaries. All
Employee Benefit Plans are in compliance with Code Section 412, to the extent
that is applicable to the Employee Benefit Plan. Except as set forth on
_Schedule 3.20(m)_ , the assets under each Employee Benefit Plan that is an
"employee pension benefit plan" (as such term is defined in ERISA Section
3(2)) equal or exceed the present value of all vested and unvested liabilities
thereunder, as determined in accordance with the terms of such Employee
Benefit Plan, the Code, ERISA, and to the extent applicable, PBGC methods,
factors, and assumptions applicable to employee pension benefit plans on the
date of such determination.

(n) Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.20(n)_ , the Company and its
Subsidiaries have no obligation to provide postretirement medical or
other benefits to employees or former employees or their survivors,
dependents, and beneficiaries, except as may be required by Section 4980B of
the Code or Part 6 of Title I of ERISA or applicable state medical benefits
continuation law, and the Company and its Subsidiaries may terminate any such
postretirement medical or other benefits upon thirty (30) days notice or less
without any Liability therefore.

(o) Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.20(o)_ , except for those events and
conditions which would not reasonably be expected to result in a
Material Adverse Change, there have been no "prohibited transactions" within
the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code or Part 4 of Subtitle B of Title I of
ERISA in connection with any of the Employee Benefits Plans that, assuming
the Taxable period of such transaction expired as of the date hereof or the
Closing Date, could subject the Company or its Subsidiaries to a Tax or
penalty imposed by either Section 4975 of the Code of Section 502(i) of
ERISA; each Employee Benefit Plan has been administered in accordance with
the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code, and applicable Law and with the

Employee Benefit Plan is maintained; all reports and information required to
be filed with the DOL, the IRS, or the PBGC with respect to any Employee
Benefit Plan have been timely filed or delivered; there is no Action
threatened involving an Employee Benefit Plan (other than routine claims for
benefits), and there is no basis for such a claim; there are no unaccrued
Liabilities with respect to an Employee Benefit Plan; and none of the Employee
Benefit Plans nor any fiduciary thereof (in their capacity as fiduciary) has
been the direct or indirect subject of an investigation or examination by a
Governmental Entity. Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.20(o)_ , to Parents
and Sellers knowledge, there have been no "prohibited transactions" within
the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code or Part 4 of Subtitle B of Title I of
ERISA in connection with any of

such audit or such other activity is either outside the ordinary course of
business or would reasonably be expected to result in a material Liability to
the Company or its Subsidiaries). Except as set forth in  _Schedule 3.31(c)_
, no audit, review, inspection, investigation, survey or examination of
records has revealed any fact, occurrence, or practice that would reasonably
be expected to affect in any adverse manner the assets, business or
financial statements of the Company or any Subsidiary, or their respective
continued eligibility to receive and perform Government Contracts or Grants.
Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has made any payment, directly or
indirectly, to any Person in violation of applicable Law, including Laws
relating to bribes, gratuities, kickbacks, lobbying expenditures, political
contributions and contingent fee payments. Each of the Company and each
Subsidiary has complied in all material respects with all applicable

allegations that could reasonably be expected to give rise to such a claim or
dispute in the future. Except as described in _Schedule 3.31(d)_ , to Parents
and Sellers knowledge, there are neither any outstanding claims or disputes
relating to any Government Contract or Grant that, if resolved unfavorably to
the Company or any Subsidiary, would increase by five percent (5%) or more the
cost of the Company and its Subsidiaries to complete performance of any task
order under such Government Contract or Grant above the amounts set forth in
the estimates to complete previously prepared by the Company and its
Subsidiaries and delivered to Purchaser for such Government Contract or
Grant, nor any reasonably foreseeable expenditures that would increase by five
percent (5%) or more the cost to complete performance of any task order under
such Government Contract or Grant above the amounts set forth in the
estimates to complete described above. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has been, or is currently under, any administrative, civil or
criminal investigation or indictment disclosed to the Company or any
Subsidiary involving alleged false statements, false claims or other
misconduct relating to any Government Contract or Grant, or quotations, bids,
proposals and applications for Government Contracts or Grants, and to Parents
and Sellers knowledge, there is no basis for any such investigation or
indictment. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has been, or is currently,
a party to any administrative or civil litigation involving alleged false
statements, false claims or other misconduct relating to any Government
Contract or Grant, or quotations, bids, proposals and applications for
Government Contracts or Grants, and to Parents and Sellers knowledge, there
is no basis for any such proceeding. Except as described in  _Schedule
3.31(d)_, neither any Governmental Entity nor any prime contractor or higher-
tier subcontractor or grantee under a Government Contract or Grant has
withheld or set off, or attempted to withhold (other than the hold-backs
pursuant to contracts  



 

43  in the ordinary course of business) or set-off, material amounts of money
otherwise acknowledged to be due to the Company or any Subsidiary under any
such Government Contract or Grant. Except as described in _Schedule
3.31(d)_, to Parents and Sellers knowledge, neither any Governmental Entity
nor any prime contractor or higher-tier subcontractor or grantee under an
outstanding Government Contract or Grant has disallowed, or raised any basis
for disallowance of, any material costs claimed by the Company or any
Subsidiary under any such Government Contract or Grant, and to Parents and
Sellers knowledge, there is no fact or occurrence that could reasonably be
expected to be a basis for disallowing any such costs.

(e) _Sanctions_. Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.31(e)_ , neither any
Governmental Entity nor any prime contractor or higher-tier subcontractor or
grantee under a Government Contract or Grant nor any other Person has notified

breach of any Law, representation, certification, disclosure obligation,
contract term, condition, clause, provision or specification. Except as set
forth on _Schedule 3.31(e)_ , neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has
received any show cause, cure, deficiency, default or similar notices relating
to any Government Contract or Grant. Neither the Company, nor any Subsidiary,
nor any Key Employee nor, to Parents and Sellers knowledge, any other
director, officer or employee of the Company nor, to Parents and Sellers
knowledge, any consultant or Affiliate of the Company or any Subsidiary, has
been or is currently suspended, debarred or, to Parents and
Sellers knowledge, proposed for suspension or debarment from any
Governmental Entity contracting, and to Parents and Sellers knowledge, no
facts exist that could reasonably be expected to cause or give rise to such
suspension or debarment or proposed suspension or debarment. To Parents and
Sellers knowledge, no determination of non-responsibility has ever been
issued against the Company or any Subsidiary with respect to any quotation,
bid, proposal or application for a Government Contract or Grant.

Government Contract or Grant relating to the Companys or any of its
Subsidiaries business has been terminated for default or convenience since
December 31, 2000. Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.31(f)_ , neither the

Agreement, from the date hereof through the Closing Date, Seller and Parent

(including any payment not expressly contemplated by the applicable Contract,
Permit or Law), to obtain any consent, clearance, waiver, authorization or
approval.

Parent, Seller or their auditors reasonably required by Purchaser, ICF or
their independent accountants, (ii) reasonably cooperate, and use their

2009. Parent shall promptly advise ICF of any material issues relating to the
preparation of the Audited Financial Statements or Interim Financial
Statements. Parent shall include in its engagement letter with KPMG LLP, for
the services to be provided by KPMG LLP as described in this Section 5.9(b),
KPMG LLPs agreement to provide its consent, at no additional fee, cost or
expense, for the use of its reports and the Audited Financial Statements and
Interim Financial Statements in the Form 8-K required to be filed by ICF
following Closing (the " _Form 8-K_ ") and ICFs Annual Report on Form 10-K
for the year ended December 31, 2009 (the " _Form 10-K_ "). Seller and Parent

consent for the use of its reports and the Audited Financial Statements and
Interim Financial Statements in any other reports, registration statements or
other documents filed by ICF under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or the
Securities Act of 1933, as needed. All costs, fees and expenses associated
with the preparation and delivery of the Audited Financial Statements, the
Interim Financial Statements and the reports referred to in this Section
5.9(b), as well as the consents required for use of the Audited Financial
Statements, the Interim Financial Statements or any reports of KPMG LLP in the
Form 8-K and the Form 10-K, including, without limitation, all fees, costs
and expenses of KPMG LLP, shall be the sole and exclusive responsibility of
Parent and Seller, and Purchaser, ICF and their Affiliates shall have no
Liability with respect thereto. Purchaser and ICF shall be solely and
exclusively responsible for any fees, costs and expenses associated with
obtaining any consents with respect to the use of the Audited Financial
Statements, the Interim Financial Statements or any reports of KPMG LLP in any
reports, registration statements or other documents filed by ICF under the

Form 8-K and the Form 10-K, and Parent, Seller and their Affiliates shall have
no Liability with respect thereto.

5.10 _Insurance_. Seller and Parent agree to (i) be responsible for and pay,
or cause its applicable plans, policies (or similar arrangements) or carriers
to be responsible for and pay (subject to the terms of the applicable plan,

hold harmless each of Purchaser, ICF, the Company and its Subsidiaries
from and against all loss, Liability or damage which Purchaser, ICF, the

Company or its Subsidiaries may be subjected, relating to or arising directly
or indirectly out of the occurrence on or prior to the Closing Date (whether
known or unknown as of the Closing Date) of an event that would have been
covered under Parents or Sellers insurance policies and insurable risk
programs, including, without limitation, any item that would otherwise be
subject to Parents or Sellers insurance program and whether or not such
loss, Liability or damage is in excess of any insurance amounts.

Closing, the Company and ORC shall transfer to Seller all of their rights,
title and interest in and to the name "ORC Telecommunications Ltd.," all
derivations thereof (including any derivations using the term "ORC") and all
trademarks, tradenames and goodwill associated therewith, and Purchaser and
ICF hereby acknowledge and agree that, upon the Closing, the Company and ORC
shall have, and Purchaser and ICF shall acquire, no rights or interest therein
or thereto. In the event any trademark, tradename or domain name includes
both "ORC", on the one hand, and "Macro", on the other hand, no party to this
Agreement or their Affiliates shall use such trademark, tradename or domain
name and, as related thereto, all right, title and interest to the Macro name
shall be retained by the Company and all right, title and interest to the ORC
name shall be retained by Seller.

5.12 _Receivables_. Following Closing, to the extent that either Parent or
Seller (or their Affiliates) receives payment of receivables owned by the
Company or Purchaser (or their Affiliates), Parent and Seller agree to
promptly remit such proceeds to Purchaser (or such other party as Purchaser
may direct).

5.13 _Post-Closing Record Retention and Access_. The parties acknowledge that
the Books and Records described on _Schedule 3.4_ (the " _Retained Records_ ")
will, if not provided to the Company at Closing, be retained by Parent. To the
extent any such Retained Records are retained by Parent, Parent shall provide
Purchaser and its Representatives with reasonable access (for the purpose of
examining and copying), during normal business hours, to any such Retained
Records to the extent relating to the Company or its Subsidiaries, and shall
cooperate with Purchaser and its Representatives with respect to such access
and the review of such Retained Records. Unless otherwise consented to in
writing by Purchaser, Parent shall not, for a period of six (6) years
following the Closing Date, destroy, alter or otherwise dispose of any such
Retained Records, or any portions thereof, to the extent related to the
Company or its Subsidiaries without first providing to Purchaser not less than
30 days written notice of Parents intended action and providing Purchaser
the opportunity to copy such Retained Records or such portions thereof prior
to such action; provided however, that notwithstanding the above, Parent shall
continue to retain following such six (6) year anniversary date all Retained
Records which (i) are required by Law to be retained, which Retained Records
shall be retained for the period(s) so required by Law, or (ii) relate to any
Tax audit, which Retained Records shall be retained until the audit and
related indemnity, if any, is fully and finally resolved.

contemplated hereby may be abandoned, at any time prior to the Closing Date:

(a) by mutual written agreement of Parent, Seller, ICF and Purchaser; 

(b) by either Seller or Purchaser, if Closing shall not have occurred on or
before April 17, 2009 (the " _Termination Date_ "); provided that (i) the
party seeking to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(b) (and
its Affiliates) shall not have breached in any material respect its (or their)

which the terminating party may pursue all remedies available at law or in

ARTICLE 9

otherwise provided in Section 10.11, (ii) those representations and warranties
set forth in Section 3.17 (Environmental Matters) and Section 3.20 (Employee

extent of, such claim) until the final resolution of such claim or action,
including all applicable periods for appeal; and further provided, however,

misconduct or fraud, all representations and warranties relating to the

(a) _Indemnification by Seller and Parent_. Seller and Parent, jointly and
severally, shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Purchaser, ICF,
the Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives and
Affiliates (the " _Purchaser Indemnified Persons_ "), and shall reimburse the
Purchaser Indemnified Persons on demand, for any Damages (including any
Damages suffered after the end of any applicable survival period, provided
that notice of the respective claim has been given pursuant to this Article 9
prior to the end of such survival period) resulting from, arising out of,
relating to or caused by:

 



     | (i) | Any breach or default in the performance by Seller, Parent
or the Company of any covenant or agreement of Seller, Parent or the Company
contained herein, in any agreement contemplated hereby, or in any Exhibit
hereto or thereto, or in any certificate delivered or to be delivered by or on
behalf of Seller, Parent or the Company pursuant hereto or thereto; 
---|---|--- 


 

59 Seller or Parent herein, in any agreement contemplated hereby, or in any
Exhibit hereto or thereto, or in any certificate delivered or to be delivered
by or on behalf of Seller, Parent or the Company pursuant hereto or thereto; 
---|---|--- 



     | (iii) | Any Liabilities of the Company or its Subsidiaries
existing at or arising out of or from business conducted on or before the
Closing Date, to the extent such Liabilities are not (i) accrued or reserved
in the calculation of Final Working Capital, and (ii) executory obligations to
provide services after the Closing Date under Contracts entered into by the
Company or its Subsidiaries in the ordinary course of business other than any
such obligations resulting from any breach, violation or default by the
Company or any Subsidiary thereunder; 
---|---|--- 



     | (iv) | Any Liabilities arising from or relating to the Macro
401(k) Plan, including without limitation the maintenance, sponsorship,
qualification, and administration thereof, and contributions thereto; 
---|---|--- 



     | (v) | Any Liabilities arising from or relating to the Management
Incentive Plans, other than Purchasers obligation to pay or to cause the
Company to pay the 2009 MIP Accrual (including the Companys obligation to
pay the "stay bonuses" and "success bonuses" identified on _Schedule 3.20(r)_
); 
---|---|--- 



     | (vi) | Any Excluded Liabilities, other than any deferred rent and
deferred leasehold incentives; or 
---|---|--- 


     | (vii) | Any Liabilities arising out of or relating to the matters
referred to in _Exhibit L_. 
---|---|--- 
(b) _Indemnification by Purchaser and ICF_. Purchaser and ICF, jointly and
severally, shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Seller, Parent and their
Representatives and Affiliates (the " _Seller Indemnified Persons_ "), and
shall reimburse the Seller Indemnified Persons on demand, for any Damages
resulting from any of the following:



     | (i) | Any breach or default in the performance by Purchaser or ICF
of any covenant or agreement of Purchaser or ICF contained herein, in any
agreement contemplated hereby, or in any Exhibit hereto or thereto, or in any
certificate delivered or to be delivered by or on behalf of Purchaser or ICF
pursuant hereto or thereto; 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | Any breach of any warranty or representation made by
Purchaser or ICF herein, in any agreement contemplated hereby, or in any
Exhibit hereto or thereto, or in any certificate delivered or to be delivered
by or on behalf of Purchaser or ICF pursuant hereto or thereto; or 
---|---|--- 



 

60 arising directly out of or from the Companys and its Subsidiaries conduct
after Closing of the business acquired hereunder, excluding, however, any
Liabilities for which Parent or Seller has indemnification obligations under
this Agreement, any Ancillary Agreement, any Exhibit hereto or thereto, or in
any certificate delivered or to be delivered on behalf of Seller, Parent or
the Company pursuant hereto or thereto. 
---|---|--- 

(c) _Claims for Indemnity_. If a claim for Damages (a " _Claim_ ") is
proposed to be made by a party entitled to indemnification hereunder (the "
_Indemnified Party_ ") against the party from whom indemnification is claimed
(the " _Indemnifying Party_ "), the Indemnified Party shall give written
notice (a " _Claim Notice_ ") to the Indemnifying Party as soon as practicable
after the Indemnified Party becomes aware of any fact, condition or event
which may give rise to Damages for which indemnification may be sought under
this _Section 9.2_. If any Claim is made against any party entitled to the
benefit of indemnity hereunder by a Person who is not an Affiliate or
Representative of a party hereto (" _Third Party Claim_ "), written notice
thereof shall be given to the Indemnifying Party as promptly as practicable
(and in any event within twenty (20) Business Days after the service of the
citation or summons). The failure of any Indemnified Party to give timely
notice hereunder shall not affect rights to indemnification hereunder, except
to the extent that the Indemnifying Party demonstrates actual damage caused by
such failure. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Claim Notice that relates to
a matter that is subject to a survival period set forth in _Section 9.1_
must be made within such survival period, whether or not the Indemnifying
Party is prejudiced by any failure to give a Claim Notice relating thereto. A
Claim Notice shall describe in reasonable detail the nature of the Claim and
the basis of the Indemnified Partys request for indemnification under this
Agreement.

(d) _Defense of Claims_. After receipt of a Claim Notice relating to a Third
Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled, if it so elects by
written notice to the Indemnified Party, at its own cost, risk and expense,
(a) to take control of the defense and investigation of such Third Party Claim
and (b) to employ and engage attorneys of its own choice that are reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnified Party to handle and defend the same if: (i)
the Indemnifying Party acknowledges its obligation to indemnify the
Indemnified Party for any Damages resulting from such Claim; and (ii) the
Claim does not seek to impose any Liability on the Indemnified Party other
than money damages. If the conditions set forth in the previous sentence are
not satisfied or, if satisfied, the Indemnifying Party fails to so assume the
defense of such Third Party Claim within twenty (20) Business Days after
receipt of the Claim Notice, the Indemnified Party against which such Third
Party Claim has been asserted will (upon delivering notice to such effect to
the Indemnifying Party) have the right to undertake and control, at the
Indemnifying Partys cost and expense, the defense and investigation, of such
Claim. The Indemnified Party shall, with respect to any Third Party Claim,
promptly deliver to the Indemnifying Party, but in any event within twenty
(20) Business Days after the Indemnified Partys receipt thereof, copies of
all notices, court papers and material correspondence received  



 

61  by the Indemnified Party relating to the Third Party Claim. The party that
assumes the defense and investigation of the Third Party Claim in accordance
with this Agreement shall keep the other party reasonably informed of the
progress of any such defense, compromise or settlement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Indemnified Party (or, if the Indemnified Party controls the
defense, the Indemnifying Party) may participate in such defense at its own
expense. If however (i) the Indemnifying Party has failed to assume and
actively conduct the defense of such Claim or to employ counsel with respect
thereto; or (ii) in the reasonable opinion of the Indemnified Party, a
conflict of interest exists between the interests of the Indemnified Party and
the Indemnifying Party that requires representation by separate counsel, then
the Indemnified Party may employ separate counsel and the fees and expenses
of such separate counsel will be paid by the Indemnifying Party. The
Indemnified Party shall provide, at the Indemnifying Partys cost and expense,
such information and documentation that is not subject to the attorney-client
privilege or other applicable privilege or under court seal as the
Indemnifying Party may reasonably request in order to evaluate its
indemnification obligations hereunder in order to determine whether to assume
the defense of such Third Party Claim. If the Indemnifying Party chooses to
defend any Third Party Claim, all the parties hereto shall reasonably
cooperate in the defense or prosecution of such Third Party Claim at the
Indemnifying Partys cost and expense. Such cooperation shall include the
retention and (upon the Indemnifying Partys request) the provision to the
Indemnifying Party of records and information which are reasonably relevant to
such Third Party Claim, and making relevant employees available on a mutually
convenient basis. Whether or not the Indemnifying Party shall have assumed the
defense of a Third Party Claim, no Indemnified Party shall admit any liability
with respect to, consent to the entry of any judgment, or settle, compromise
or discharge, any Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the
Indemnifying Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed in the circumstance where the Indemnifying Party has not elected to
assume (or does not have the right to assume) the defense of such Third Party
Claim); provided, that the Indemnified Party will not be required to obtain
any consent of the Indemnifying Party to any such admission, consent,
settlement, compromise or discharge of such Claim (and will not prejudice its
right to be indemnified with respect to such Claim) if the Indemnifying Party
is disputing its obligation or is asserting that it has no obligation to
indemnify the Indemnified Party in respect of such Claim and is not defending
such Claim.

(e) _Settlement_. If the Indemnifying Party shall control the defense of any
such Claim in accordance with the terms hereof, the Indemnifying Party may
enter into any settlement, compromise or other discharge of such Claim if, (i)
pursuant to or as a result of such settlement, compromise or discharge, no
injunctive, extraordinary or other equitable relief (including a consent
decree or similar order) shall be imposed against the Indemnified Party, (ii)
any monetary Damages imposed on the Indemnified Party are to be paid by the
Indemnifying Party, and (iii) such settlement, compromise or discharge
expressly and unconditionally releases the Indemnified Party from all
Liabilities and obligations with respect to such Claim, without prejudice and
without any admission or finding of obligation, liability, fault or
guilt (criminal or otherwise) with respect to or arising out of the Claim.



 

62 (f) _Indemnification Basket and Cap_.



     | (i) | Any right of a party to indemnification under Section
9.2(a)(ii) or Section 9.2(b)(ii) of this Agreement shall not apply to any
claim until the aggregate of all such claims totals Five Hundred Thousand
Dollars ($500,000) (the " _Basket_ "), in which event such indemnity shall
apply to all such claims, including such initial Five Hundred Thousand Dollars
($500,000). 
---|---|--- 


     | (ii) | In no event shall (A) the total liability of Seller and
Parent for all claims arising under Section 9.2(a)(ii) of this Agreement
exceed Twenty-Three Million Two Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($23,250,000)
(the " _Cap_ ") and (B) the total liability of Purchaser and ICF for all
claims arising under Section 9.2(b)(ii) of this Agreement exceed the Cap. 
---|---|--- 


     | (iii) | Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Basket and Cap referred
to in paragraphs (i) and (ii) above shall not apply to any claims arising
under Section 3.2 (Authorization), Section 3.3 (Due Execution; Binding
Obligations), Section 3.5 (Capital Stock), Section 3.7 (No Conflict or
Violation), Section 3.8 (Consents and Approvals), the first sentence of
Section 3.13 (Properties), Section 3.15 (Receivables), Section 3.17
(Environmental Matters), Section 3.20 (Employee Benefit Plans), Section 3.23
(Brokers), Section 3.24 (Taxes), and Section 3.25 (Seller Services), and shall
not apply to any intentional acts, willful misconduct or fraud of Seller or
Parent with respect to any representation or warranty contained in this
Agreement or any certificates or other documents ancillary hereto. 
---|---|--- 


     | (iv) | For purposes of determining under Section 9.2(a) whether
there has been a breach or default of any representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement, and the amount of any Damages associated therewith, the parties
agree (a) that all references to any materiality, Material Adverse Change and
knowledge qualifier(s) will be disregarded and (b) that the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements are made and given for purposes of
Section 9.2(a) as if those disregarded words were not included. 
---|---|--- 

(g) _No Contribution_. In the event any Purchaser Indemnified Person asserts
an indemnity claim against Parent and/or Seller, Parent and Seller shall not
have any rights of contribution from, or subrogation against, the Company or
its Subsidiaries, with respect to such claim.



 

63 (h) _Duty to Mitigate_. Nothing in this Agreement shall in any way restrict or
limit the general obligation at Law of Purchaser and ICF, on the one hand,
and Parent and Seller, on the other hand, to mitigate any loss or damage which
it may suffer in consequence of any breach by the other parties hereto of the
terms of this Agreement or any fact, matter, event or circumstance giving
rise to a Claim. Each Indemnified Party shall have a duty to use commercially
reasonable efforts to mitigate any damages suffered by such party in
connection with this Agreement.

(i) _Indemnity Escrow_. Except with respect to claims relating to or arising
under Section 3.15 (Receivables), the Purchaser Indemnified Persons shall
satisfy any indemnification claims hereunder first from the Indemnity Escrow
in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreements. Any claims made against
the Indemnity Escrow shall first be satisfied from the TD Escrow Amount
(excluding that portion allocated to the Working Capital Escrow), and no
claims shall be made against the SunTrust Escrow Amount until such time as
claims against the TD Escrow Amount (excluding that portion allocated to the
Working Capital Escrow) exceed the TD Escrow Amount (excluding that portion
allocated to the Working Capital Escrow).

(j) _Exclusive Remedy_. Each of the parties hereto acknowledges and agrees
that, from and after Closing, except with respect to Section 2.4 and Article
10, the foregoing indemnification provisions in this Article 9 shall be the
sole and exclusive remedy of the parties hereto with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that
this exclusive remedy for damages (i) does not preclude any party hereto from
bringing an action for injunctive or other equitable relief as provided
in Section 11.5, (ii) does not preclude any party hereto from bringing an
action for specific performance or other equitable remedy to require any other
parties hereto to perform their obligations under this Agreement, and (iii)
shall not apply to Actions for intentional acts, willful misconduct or fraud.

ARTICLE 10

_TAX MATTERS_

10.1 _Tax Returns_.

(a) Purchaser shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to consent to join,
for all Pre-Closing Periods of the Company and its Subsidiaries for which the
Company and its Subsidiaries are eligible to do so, in any consolidated or
combined federal, state or local Tax Returns of Parent, Seller or their
Affiliates. Seller and Parent will prepare and file, or cause to be prepared
and filed, all of the Tax Returns for the Company and its Subsidiaries for
all taxable years or periods ending on or before the Closing Date (to the
extent they have not already done so). Seller and Parent will pay to the
applicable Tax Authority, or cause the payment to the applicable Tax
Authority of, any Taxes shown as due thereon. Seller and Parent will prepare,
or cause to be prepared, such Tax Returns using the accounting methods and
other practices that are consistent with those used by the Company and
its Subsidiaries in their prior Tax Returns except as otherwise required by
Law. Items to be taken into account in any Tax Return for the short taxable
period ending on the Closing Date will be determined under the "closing-the-
books"  



 

64  method as described in Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-76(b)(2)(i) (or
any similar provision of state, provincial, local or foreign Law). Seller
and Parent will deliver, or cause to be delivered, a draft of each of the Tax
Returns for any of the Company or its Subsidiaries (or portion thereof, solely
as it relates to the Company or its Subsidiaries) that require the signature
of an officer or employee of Purchaser (or one of Purchasers Affiliates) to
Purchaser not less than thirty (30) calendar days prior to the due date (as
may be extended) for filing such Tax Returns, and Purchaser will provide
Seller with its comments on, and proposed changes to, such Tax Returns not
later than fifteen (15) calendar days prior to such due date. If any aspect of
such Tax Returns remains in dispute within ten (10) calendar days prior to the
due date for filing such Tax Returns, the matter in dispute will be submitted
to a mutually acceptable, nationally-recognized firm of certified public
accountants for resolution. The decision of such accounting firm will be final
and binding on the parties, and the fees and expenses of the accounting firm
will be paid one-half by Purchaser and ICF and one-half by Seller and Parent.

(b) Purchaser will prepare and file, or cause to be prepared and filed, all
Tax Returns of the Company and its Subsidiaries for all taxable years or
periods ending after the Closing Date, and Purchaser will pay, or cause to be
paid, all Taxes shown as due thereon; provided, that with respect to any
Straddle Period, Purchaser will be entitled to indemnification as set forth in
Section 10.3.

(c) The parties agree to reasonably cooperate with each other and each
others Affiliates in the preparation and filing of Tax Returns of the Company
and its Subsidiaries for taxable periods ending before the Closing Date and
Straddle Periods. The parties shall be entitled to utilize the services of
the personnel who would have been responsible for preparing such Tax Returns
as they relate to the Company and its Subsidiaries, without charge, to the
extent reasonably necessary in preparing said returns on a timely basis. The
parties shall also provide each other with full reasonable access to
applicable and reasonably relevant records to enable the timely preparation
and filing of said Tax Returns.

10.2 _Apportionment of Taxes_. With respect to any Straddle Period of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, Purchaser, Seller and Parent will, to
the extent permitted by Law, elect to treat the Closing Date as the last day
of the taxable year or period of the Company and its Subsidiaries and will
apportion any Taxes arising out of or relating to a Straddle Period to the
Pre-Closing Period under the "closing-the-books" method as described in
Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-76(b)(2)(i) (or any similar provision of
state, provincial, local or foreign Law). In any case where applicable Law
does not permit the Company and its Subsidiaries to treat the Closing Date as
the last day of the taxable year or period, any Taxes arising out of or
relating to a Straddle Period will be apportioned to the Pre-Closing Period
based on a closing of the books of that entity; provided, however, that
exemptions, allowances or deductions (excluding depreciation, amortization and
depletion deductions) that are calculated on an annualized basis will be
apportioned on a daily pro rata basis. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Taxes
imposed with respect to a time period (e.g., property taxes) shall be
apportioned to the Pre-Closing Period on a daily pro rata basis.



 

65 10.3 _Indemnification by Seller and Parent_. Seller and Parent will, jointly
and severally, indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Purchaser Indemnified
Persons for, and will pay to, or on behalf of, the Purchaser Indemnified
Persons an amount equal to (a) any Taxes of the Company and its Subsidiaries
for the Pre-Closing Period (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any Taxes
of the Company and its Subsidiaries resulting from an election under Section
338(h)(10) of the Code and corresponding or equivalent election under
applicable state, provincial, local or foreign Law) that have not been paid
prior to the Closing Date, except to the extent accrued as a liability on the
Settlement Statement, (b) any Taxes relating to any member of an affiliated
group with which any of the Company and its Subsidiaries has filed a Tax
Return on a consolidated, combined or unitary basis for a Pre-Closing Period,
and (c) any Tax deficiency, and all related, reasonable legal, accounting and
experts fees and expenses, each resulting from any breach of Sellers or
Parents representations in Section 3.24 or Sellers or Parents covenants
contained in this Section 10\.

10.4 _Indemnification by Purchaser and ICF_. Purchaser and ICF will pay, or
cause to be paid, on a timely basis, and shall, jointly and severally,
indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Seller Indemnified Persons for: (a)
any Tax deficiency, and all related, reasonable legal, accounting and
experts fees and expenses, each resulting from any breach of Purchasers
covenants contained in this Section 10, (b) any Liability for Taxes for Tax
periods of the Purchaser and the Company and its Subsidiaries beginning
after, and the portion of the Straddle Period occurring after, the Closing
Date, and (c) any Liability for Taxes attributable to an extraordinary
transaction (other than any deemed asset sale occurring under Section
338(h)(10) or any comparable provision of state, local, provincial or foreign
Law) effected at the direction of Purchaser without Seller or Parents prior
written consent in respect of the Company and its Subsidiaries on or after
the Closing Date.

10.5 _Indemnification Process_. In the event of a third-party claim for Taxes
pursuant to Section 10.3 or 10.4, the indemnification procedures will be in
accordance with Section 9.2; provided, however, that (i) with respect to any
Tax matter involving a Tax Authority that does not treat the Company and its
Subsidiaries as selling their assets to a newly created corporation on the
Closing Date as a result of the Section 338(h)(10) Election, Seller and Parent
shall not settle or compromise any third party claim for Taxes that may
adversely affect Purchaser or ICF in taxable periods ending after the Closing
Date without Purchasers prior written consent (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld); and (ii) Parent and Seller shall control the defense
and investigation, at Parents and Sellers cost and expense, but subject to
Purchasers and ICFs participation and other rights provided for in Section
9.2, of any third-party claim for Taxes, including the matter described on
_Exhibit M_, the resolution of which could impact ICFs, Purchasers or the
Companys post-Closing reporting. Any indemnification payments due under this
Section 10 shall be paid within ten (10) calendar days from the date of a
final determination (as defined in Section 1313(a) of the Code) of the amount
of Tax due.

10.6 _Characterization of Indemnity Payments_. All amounts paid by Purchaser,
ICF, Seller or Parent, as the case may be, by reason of Sections 9.2(a),
9.2(b), 10.3 or 10.4 will be treated to the extent permitted under applicable
Law as adjustments to the Purchase Price for all Tax purposes.



 

66 10.7 _Transfer Taxes_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement,
all Transfer Taxes will be borne by Seller and Parent regardless of which
party is obligated to pay such Tax under applicable Law. Purchaser, ICF,
Seller and Parent will cooperate in timely making and filing all Tax Returns
that may be required to comply with Law relating to such Taxes.

10.8 _Tax Sharing Agreements_. Seller and Parent will cause the Company and
its Subsidiaries to terminate as of the Closing Date any Tax sharing,
indemnity or allocation agreement between them and any other Affiliate of
Seller or Parent.

10.9  _Tax Records_. Seller and Parent will make available to Purchaser and
ICF such records as Purchaser or ICF may reasonably require for the
preparation of any Tax Return or other governmental filing and such records as
Purchaser or ICF may reasonably require for the defense of any Action
concerning such Tax Return or other governmental filing or audit. Purchaser
and ICF will make available to Seller and Parent such records as Seller and
Parent may reasonably require for the preparation of any Tax Return or
governmental filing and such records as Seller and Parent may reasonably
require for the defense of any Action concerning any such Tax Return or
governmental filing or audit.

10.10 _Refunds_. Purchaser and its Affiliates shall pay to Seller or Parent,
as the case may be, within ten (10) calendar days of receipt any refund of
Taxes: (i) that relate to a Pre-Closing Period of the Company and its
Subsidiaries; (ii) that were paid by Seller, Parent or their Affiliates; and
(iii) to the extent that any such refunds were not accrued as an asset on
the Settlement Statement.

10.11 _Survival_. The covenants and agreements of the parties contained in
this Section 10 and the representations and warranties contained in Section
3.24 will survive the Closing and will remain in full force and effect until
six (6) months following the expiration of the applicable underlying statutes
of limitations (including extensions) with respect to any Taxes that would be
indemnifiable by Purchaser, ICF, Seller or Parent under Sections 10.3 and 10.4
of this Agreement.

10.12 _Section 338(h)(10) Election and Purchase Price Allocation_. Seller,
Parent and Purchaser (and any respective Affiliate thereof required by
applicable Law to join in the election to make the election effective) will
join in making an election under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code (and any
corresponding election under state, provincial, local or foreign Tax Law)
(collectively herein a " _Section 338(h)(10) Election_") in order to treat
the sale of the Shares as a sale of all of the assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries for U.S. federal Tax purposes and an election under the statutes
of such states, provinces, locales or foreign jurisdictions as permit
an equivalent election. The parties hereto each agree (and will cause any
applicable Affiliates to agree) to take commercially reasonable action to
comply with all of the requirements and conditions of Section 338(h)(10) of
the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder and all other applicable
Code sections and Treasury Regulations relating thereto, including without
limitation the execution and timely filing of Form 8023 entitled "Elections
Under Section 338 for Corporations Making Qualified Stock Purchases" or any
successor form of similar import, and any forms required to effectuate similar
elections for state, provincial, local and applicable foreign Tax purposes.
The parties shall jointly execute, deliver and exchange at Closing mutually
agreeable and properly completed counterparts of Form 8023 (and of each and
every  



 

67  state, provincial, local and foreign equivalent election form, if any). The
parties agree that Purchaser shall prepare an allocation of the Purchase Price
to the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries in accordance with Code
sections 338 and 1060 and Treasury Regulations thereunder (and any similar
provision of state, provincial, local or foreign Law, as appropriate).
Purchaser shall deliver such allocation (the " _Proposed Final Allocation_ ")
to Seller within 180 calendar days after Closing. If Seller does not object to
the Proposed Final Allocation within 30 calendar days of its receipt, the
Proposed Final Allocation shall become the final allocation of the Purchase
Price (the " _Final Allocation_ "). If Seller objects to the Proposed Final
Allocation within the time period provided in the prior sentence, Purchaser
and Seller shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any disagreements
regarding the Proposed Final Allocation. If agreement cannot be reached within
30 Business Days, then the Final Allocation shall be finally determined by an
appraisal conducted by an appraisal firm mutually acceptable to Purchaser and
Seller, in each case acting reasonably. The fees and expenses of such firm
will be paid one-half by Purchaser and ICF and one-half by Seller and Parent.
Each party covenants to report, act, and file Tax Returns (including, but not
limited to, Form 8883 (Asset Allocation Statement under Section 338) in all
respects and for all purposes consistent with the Final Allocation. No party
hereto shall take any position (whether in audits, Tax returns, or otherwise)
which is inconsistent with the Final Allocation unless required to do so by a
final, non-appealable decision of a court of competent jurisdiction.
Purchaser, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall promptly notify Seller
and Parent (and Seller and Parent will promptly notify Purchaser) in the
event that any Tax Authority challenges or threatens to challenge, such
allocations. Purchaser, the Company and its Subsidiaries, Seller and Parent
shall cooperate after the Closing Date to timely and properly file all
applicable elections required to be filed under this Section and to take all
such commercially reasonable action as is required by Law to give full effect
to the elections for federal, state, provincial, local and foreign Tax
purposes to the greatest extent permitted by Law.

10.13 _Cooperation_. Without limiting the generality of any other provision
of this Agreement, Seller and Parent shall cooperate after the Closing Date
with Purchaser, ICF and the Company with respect to (i) any audit or
investigation by any Governmental Entity, including any Tax audit or incurred
cost audit affecting or relating to actions of the Company or its
Subsidiaries on or prior to the Closing Date, and (ii) any Tax analysis
relating to the Company or its Subsidiaries relating to any Straddle Period or
taxable period ending before the Closing Date, including without limitation
analysis of Tax audits, historical Tax positions and reporting and FIN 48.

10.14 _Tax Elections_. No election with respect to Taxes of the Company or
any Subsidiary will be made after the date of this Agreement, other than any
election required by applicable Law or GAAP, without the prior written consent
of Purchaser; any Tax election required by applicable Law or GAAP will be
made after the date of this Agreement only after prior written notice to
Purchaser.



 

68 ARTICLE 11

_COVENANT NOT TO COMPETE_

11.1 _Non-Compete Covenant_. From the Closing Date until the
fifth anniversary thereof, Seller and Parent shall not, and shall not permit
any Affiliate of Seller or Parent to, within the Restricted Area, either
directly or indirectly without the prior written consent of Purchaser, (i)
engage in; (ii) own or control any interest in (except as a passive investor
of less than five percent (5%) of the capital stock or publicly traded notes
or debentures of a publicly held company) any Person or business enterprise
that is engaged in, directly or indirectly; (iii) act as an officer,
director, partner, member, or joint venturer of any Person or business
enterprise that is engaged in, directly or indirectly; (iv) lend credit or
money for the purpose of establishing or operating any Person or business
enterprise that is engaged in, directly or indirectly; or (v) allow such
entitys name or reputation to be used by any Person or business enterprise
that is engaged in, directly or indirectly, the Restricted Business. In
addition, during such period, Seller and Parent shall not, directly or
indirectly, and shall not permit any Affiliate of Seller or Parent to,
influence or attempt to influence any Person who is a contracting party with
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as of the date of this Agreement or
the Closing Date to terminate or adversely amend any existing written or oral
agreement. Seller and Parent acknowledge that the Company and its Subsidiaries
conduct, and Purchaser and ICF will conduct, the Restricted Business
throughout the Restricted Area and this Section 11.1 therefore shall be
effective with respect to the Restricted Area.

11.2 _Confidential Information_.

(a) Parent and Seller shall not, and shall cause their Affiliates not to, at
any time (i) disclose Confidential Information of Purchaser or ICF to any
Person other than Purchaser or ICF, or (ii) use any Confidential Information
of Purchaser or ICF, whether or not such information is embodied in writing
or other physical form. Upon Purchaser or ICFs written request, Parent and
Seller will promptly return to Purchaser or ICF or will destroy all
Confidential Information of Purchaser or ICF.

(b) After the Closing Date, Parent and Seller shall not, and shall cause their
Affiliates not to, at any time disclose to any Person other than Purchaser or
ICF or use any Intellectual Property or Confidential Information owned,
possessed, licensed or used by or relating to the Company and its
Subsidiaries, whether or not such information is embodied in writing or other
physical form. Each of Parent and Seller recognizes and agrees that all
documents and objects containing any Confidential Information or Intellectual
Property, whether developed by the Company or its Subsidiaries or by someone
else for the Company or its Subsidiaries, will after the Closing Date become
the exclusive property of Purchaser.

(c) At Closing, to the extent commercially practicable, Seller and
Parent shall promptly deliver to Purchaser all documents and other materials
containing all Confidential Information relating to the Company and its
Subsidiaries, to the extent it is in physical form (including, without
limitation, electronic form); provided, however, that Seller and Parent shall
not be obligated to deliver any Confidential Information (other than
Confidential Information of Purchaser or ICF) to Purchaser if and to the
extent that, in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practices, such Confidential Information is included in the Retained Records.



 

69 (d) In the event that Seller or Parent is requested or required (by oral
question or request for information or documents in any legal proceeding,
interrogatory, subpoena, civil investigative demand or similar process) to
disclose any Confidential Information of Purchaser, ICF, the Company or its
Subsidiaries, Seller or Parent will notify Purchaser promptly of the request
or requirement so that Purchaser may seek an appropriate protective order or
waive compliance with the provisions of this Section 11.2. If, in the absence
of a protective order or the receipt of a waiver hereunder, Seller or Parent
is, on the advice of counsel, compelled to disclose any such Confidential
Information, Seller or Parent may disclose the portion of such Confidential
Information legally required to be disclosed; provided, however, that Seller
and Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, at the request
and expense of Purchaser, an order or other assurance that confidential
treatment will be accorded to such portion of such Confidential Information
required to be disclosed as Purchaser shall designate.

11.3 _Non-Solicitation_. From the Closing Date until the fifth anniversary
thereof, Seller and Parent shall not, and shall not permit any of their
Affiliates to, directly or indirectly, employ any person employed by the
Company or its Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date.

11.4 _Reasonableness of Restrictions_. Each of Seller, Parent, ICF and
Purchaser recognizes that the limitations set forth in Sections 11.1, 11.2
and 11.3 are reasonable and not burdensome, and in the event that such
limitations are deemed to be unreasonable by a court of competent
jurisdiction, then Seller, Parent, ICF and Purchaser agree to submit to a
modification or reduction of such limitations as such court shall deem
reasonable.

11.5 _Injunctive Relief_. Seller and Parent each acknowledge that its
expertise in the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries is of a
special, unique, unusual, extraordinary and intellectual character, which
gives such expertise a peculiar value, and that a breach by it of the
covenants contained in this Article 11 may not be reasonably or adequately
compensated in damages in an Action at law and that such breach may cause
Purchaser, ICF and the Company irreparable injury and damage. Seller and
Parent further acknowledge that they possess unique skills, knowledge and
ability and that competition in violation of this Article 11 may be extremely
detrimental to Purchaser, ICF and the Company. By reason thereof, Seller and
Parent, on the one hand, and Purchaser and ICF, on the other hand, agrees that
the other shall be entitled, in addition to any other remedies it may have
under this Agreement or otherwise, to temporary, preliminary and/or permanent
injunctive and other equitable relief to prevent or curtail any breach of this
Article 11, without proof of actual damages that have been or may be caused
to Purchaser, ICF or the Company by such breach or threatened breach.



 

70 ARTICLE 12

_MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS_

12.1 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, together with the
agreements referred to herein and the Exhibits hereto and thereto, constitute
the full and entire agreement and understanding between the parties with
regard to the subject matter of this Agreement. All prior and contemporaneous
agreements, covenants, representations and warranties, express or implied,
oral and written, of the parties with regard to the subject matter of this
Agreement are superseded by this Agreement, the Exhibits to this Agreement,
and the documents referred to or implementing the provisions of this
Agreement.

12.2 _Applicable Law_. This Agreement and the legal relations among the
parties hereto shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws
of the State of Delaware applicable to contracts made and performed in
Delaware.

12.3 _Consent to Jurisdiction_. Seller, Parent, ICF and Purchaser hereby
irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of any United States federal
or Delaware state court located in Wilmington, Delaware with respect to any
Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement, and Seller, Parent, ICF
and Purchaser hereby irrevocably agree that all claims in respect to such
Action shall be heard and determined in any such court and irrevocably waive
any objection it may now or hereafter have as to the venue of any such Action
brought in such court or that such court is an inconvenient forum.

12.4  _Attorneys  Fees_. If any Action is commenced by any party hereto
concerning this Agreement, the prevailing party shall recover from the losing
party reasonable attorneys fees and costs and expenses, including those of
appeal and not limited to taxable costs, incurred by the prevailing party, in
addition to all other remedies to which the prevailing party may be entitled.

12.5 _Interpretation_. The language in all parts of this Agreement shall be in
all cases construed simply according to its fair meaning and not strictly for
or against any party. The captions and headings of the Sections
and Subsections of this Agreement are for convenience only and shall not
affect the construction or interpretation of any of the provisions of this
Agreement.

12.6 _Waiver and Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended, supplemented,
modified and/or rescinded only through an express written instrument signed by
all parties or their respective successors and permitted assigns. Any party
may specifically and expressly waive in writing any portion of this Agreement
or any breach hereof, but only to the extent such provision is for the benefit
of the waiving party, and no such waiver shall constitute a further
or continuing waiver of any preceding or succeeding breach of the same or any
other provision. The consent by one party to any act for which such consent
was required shall not be deemed to imply consent or waiver of the necessity
of obtaining such consent for the same or similar acts in the future, and no
forbearance by a party to seek a remedy for noncompliance or breach by another
party shall be construed as a waiver of any right or remedy with respect to
such noncompliance or breach. 



 

71 12.7 _Assignment_. Except as specifically provided otherwise in this
Agreement, neither this Agreement nor any interest herein shall be assignable
(voluntarily, involuntarily, by judicial process, operation of Law, or
otherwise), in whole or in part, by any party without the prior written
consent of all other parties, except that Purchaser may, without the consent
of Seller or Parent, assign all of its rights under this Agreement to an
Affiliate of Purchaser, provided that Purchaser remains liable for all of its
obligations hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any party may, without
the consent of the other parties hereto, assign all of its rights under this
Agreement in connection with the assignment of a security interest to any
lender of such party, provided that such party remains liable for all of its
obligations hereunder. For the avoidance of doubt, Parent and Seller
acknowledge that Purchaser and ICF have or will collaterally assign all of
their right, title and interest under this Agreement to their senior lender or
bank group, and Parent and Seller agree to promptly execute and deliver to
Purchaser and ICF such documents, instruments and agreements as Purchaser and
ICFs senior lender or bank group may reasonably require to confirm and
acknowledge such collateral assignment and its rights and remedies with
respect thereto.

12.8 _Further Assurances_. Seller and Parent, at any time before or after the
Closing and without further consideration, will execute, acknowledge and
deliver any further deeds, assignments, conveyances and other assurances,
documents and instruments of transfer, reasonably requested by Purchaser or
ICF, and will take any other action consistent with the terms of this
Agreement that may reasonably be requested by Purchaser or ICF, for the
purpose of assigning, transferring, granting, conveying and confirming to
Purchaser or ICF, or reducing to possession, any or all property to be
conveyed and transferred by this Agreement and for the purpose of carrying
out the purposes of this Agreement.

12.9 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, each of
the parties shall pay all costs and expenses incurred by it or on its behalf
in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, fees and
expenses of its own financial consultants, accountants and counsel. For the
avoidance of doubt, Seller and Parent shall be responsible for and pay any
fees, costs or expenses of Seller, Parent, the Company and its Subsidiaries
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the above, Seller and Purchaser shall each pay one-half of all
HSR filing fees.

12.10 _Successors and Assigns_. Each of the terms, provisions, and obligations
of this Agreement shall be binding upon, shall inure to the benefit of, and
shall be enforceable by the parties and their respective legal
representatives, successors and permitted assigns.

Agreement or any provision hereof.
