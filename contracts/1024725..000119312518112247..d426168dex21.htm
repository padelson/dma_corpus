Letters (and a corresponding customarily redacted fee letter relating to the Debt Financing Commitment Letters). The Debt Financing Commitment Letters have not been amended or modified in any manner prior to the date of this Agreement. None of the
Purchaser or its Affiliates has entered into any agreement, side letter or arrangement which could adversely impact the availability of the Debt Financing, including by providing for additional conditions to the availability of the financing of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement relating to the Debt Financing not otherwise contained in the Debt Financing Commitment Letters. The commitments contained in the Debt Financing Commitment Letters have not been withdrawn or rescinded in
any respect. The Debt Financing Commitment Letters represent a valid, binding and enforceable obligation of the Purchaser and, to the knowledge of the Purchaser, each other party thereto, enforceable against such party in accordance with their
terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and similar Laws affecting creditors&#146; rights and remedies generally, and subject, as to enforceability, to general principles of equity, including principles of
