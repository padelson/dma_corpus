conditions hereof, each Seller agrees to sell, transfer and assign

title and interest in and to its Units and the Warrants. Such purchase will
include all rights and claims, if any, which the Seller may have as a holder
of Units or Warrants against Company.

  

## 2.2. _Units Consideration_.

  

### (a) At the Closing (but effective as of the Effective Time), subject in
all events to the provisions of Sections 2.3(a), 2.3(d), 2.6 and 3.2:

  

#### (i) The Purchaser shall purchase from CPC the Class A Unit for cash in
an amount equal to the Class A Preference Amount outstanding at the Effective
Time, plus the accrued and unpaid Class A Return thereon, less the amount, if
any, owing by CPC to Company under Section 3.2 of the Operating Agreement,
all as set forth on _Schedule 2.2(a)(i)_ ;

  



  

2   

     
   

  



  

#### (ii) The Purchaser shall purchase from CPC the Class B Unit for cash in
an amount equal to the Class B Preference Amount outstanding at the Effective
Time, plus the accrued and unpaid Class B Return, all as set forth on
_Schedule 2.2(a)(ii)_.

  

#### (iii) The Purchaser shall purchase from CPC the Class C Unit for cash in

#### (iv) The Purchaser shall purchase from CPC the Class D Unit for cash in
an amount equal to US$11,000,000, plus the accrued and unpaid Class D Return
thereon, as set forth on _Schedule 2.2(a)(iv)_.

  

#### (v) The Purchaser shall purchase from the Cashed Out Class E Unitholders
all of the Cashed Out Class E Units for an aggregate amount equal to the
product of the total number of Cashed Out Class E Units multiplied by the
Cash Purchase Price Per Unit. As among the Cashed Out Class E Unitholders,
the amounts payable under this _Section 2.2(a)(v)_  shall be paid to the
Cashed Out Class E Unitholders as set forth on _Schedule 2.2(a)(v)_ hereto .

  

#### (vi) The Purchaser shall purchase from the Warrantholder the Warrants
for cash in an amount equal to the Cash Purchase Price Per Unit multiplied by
2,220.

  

#### (vii) The Purchaser shall purchase from each Cashed Out Class G
Unitholder all the Cashed Out Class G Units owned by such Person for the
respective amounts set forth on _Schedule 2.2(a)(vii)_ , which aggregates the

partially Deferred Payout Class E Units and partially Cashed Out Class E
Units determined as follows:  First, the aggregate "value" of the Deferred
Payout Class E Units and Deferred Payout Class G Units held by all holders
with either an asterisk or a (#) shall be determined by multiplying the
number of Deferred Payout Class E Units and Deferred Payout Class G Units
held by such persons by the Cash Purchase Price Per Unit. Such
aggregate amount shall be subtracted from $17,000,000 and the difference
shall be divided by the Cash Purchase Price Per Unit. The quotient so derived
shall equal the number of Class E Units held by California KL Holdings Inc.,

### (b) The " **Cash Purchase Price Per Unit** " shall equal (i) the result
obtained by totaling (1) $145,000,000, _plus_ (2) Companys consolidated cash
balance as at the Closing Date (not to exceed $150,000), _minus_ (3) all
sums payable pursuant to _Sections 2.2 (a)(i), (ii), (iii), and (iv)_ hereof,

### (c) If the Net Working Capital is greater than the Target Net Working

increase, on a dollar for dollar basis from first dollar, by an amount equal
to the excess of the Net Working Capital over the Target Net Working Capital.
If the Target Net Working Capital is greater than the Net Working Capital by
more than $500,000, the Cash Purchase Price shall be subject to decrease, on

stating that there has been conducted under the supervision of such Person a

Working Capital) (" **Estimated Cash Purchase Price** "), each as of the
Effective Time. The Estimated Cash Purchase Price _divided by_ 98,000 shall
be the " **Estimated Cash Purchase Price Per Unit**."

  

## 2.4. _Determination of Cash Purchase Price_.

  

### (a) As promptly as practicable following the Closing Date (but not later
than sixty (60) days after the Closing Date), Purchaser shall:

  

#### (i) prepare a consolidated balance sheet of Company as of the Effective
Time (the " **Preliminary Balance Sheet** "), a calculation of the actual
Net Working

#### Capital (" **Preliminary Working Capital Statement** "), which
Preliminary Balance Sheet shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP, except
that it will not have notes attached thereto;

  

#### (ii) determine the Cash Purchase Price in accordance with the provisions
of this Agreement (such Cash Purchase Price as determined by the Purchaser
being referred to as the " **Preliminary Cash Purchase Price** "), except
that in determining the Cash Purchase Price Company shall conclusively be
deemed to have $130,000 in consolidated cash as at the Effective Time.

  

#### (iii) determine whether any Working Capital Adjustment is to be made in
accordance with Section 2.3(c), and, if so, the amount thereof (the "
**Tentative Working Capital Adjustment** "); and

  

#### (iv) deliver to the Unitholders Representatives the Preliminary Balance
Sheet, the Preliminary Working Capital Statement and a certificate setting
forth the Preliminary Cash Purchase Price and the Tentative Working Capital
Adjustment (the " **Preliminary Accounting Report** ").

  

### (b) Promptly following receipt of the Preliminary Accounting Report and
the Preliminary Working Capital Statement, Unitholders Representatives may
review the same and, within thirty (30) days after the date of such receipt
(the " **Review Period** "), may deliver to Purchaser a certificate setting
forth any objections to the Preliminary Balance Sheet, the Preliminary
Working Capital Statement, the Preliminary Cash Purchase Price and/or the
Tentative Working Capital Adjustment as set forth in the Preliminary
Accounting Report and the Preliminary Working Capital Statement, together
with a summary of the reasons therefor and calculations which, in the view of
the Unitholders Representatives, are necessary to eliminate such objections.
 In the event Unitholders Representatives do not so object within the Review
Period, the Preliminary Accounting Report and all of the components thereof
shall be final and binding as the " **Closing Date Balance Sheet** ," the
Cash Purchase Price and the Working Capital Adjustment, respectively,
for purposes of this Agreement, but shall not limit the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of the parties set
forth elsewhere in this Agreement.

  

### (c) In the event the Unitholders Representatives object to the
Preliminary Balance Sheet, the Preliminary Cash Purchase Price, the Tentative
Working Capital Adjustment or any other element of the Preliminary Accounting
Report within the Review Period in writing as described above, Purchaser and
Unitholders Representatives shall use their reasonable efforts to resolve by
written agreement (the " **Agreed Adjustments** ") any differences as to the
Preliminary Accounting Report and, in the event the Unitholders
Representatives and Purchaser so resolve any such differences, the
Preliminary Accounting Report, as adjusted by the Agreed Adjustments, shall
be final and binding and shall determine the Closing Date Balance Sheet and
the Cash Purchase Price, respectively, for purposes of this Agreement, but
shall not limit the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of
the parties set forth elsewhere in this Agreement.

  

### (d) In the event any objections raised by Unitholders Representatives are
not resolved by Agreed Adjustments within the 30-day period next following
such Review Period, then Purchaser and Unitholders Representatives shall
submit the objections that are then unresolved to Ernst and Young LLP (or if
Ernst and Young LLP is unwilling, or unable, to resolve such objections to such
other nationally recognized accounting firm acceptable to both Purchaser and
Unitholders Representatives) and such firm (the " **Agreed Accounting Firm**
") shall be

  

### 

  

5   

     
   

  



  

### directed by Purchaser and Unitholders Representatives to resolve the
unresolved objections (based solely on the presentations by Purchaser and by
Unitholders Representatives as to whether any disputed matter had been
determined in accordance with GAAP, consistently applied with prior periods)
as promptly as reasonably practicable and to deliver written notice to each
of Purchaser and Unitholders Representatives setting forth its resolution of
the disputed matters. The Preliminary Balance Sheet, the Preliminary Cash
Purchase Price and the Tentative Working Capital Adjustment, after giving
effect to any Agreed Adjustments and to the resolution of disputed matters by
the Agreed Accounting Firm, shall be final and binding as the Closing Date
Balance Sheet, the Cash Purchase Price and the Working Capital Adjustment,
respectively, for purposes of this Agreement, but shall not limit the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of the parties
set forth elsewhere in this Agreement.

  

### (e) The parties hereto shall make available to Purchaser, Unitholders
Representatives and, if applicable, the Agreed Accounting Firm, such books,
records and other information (including work papers) as any of the foregoing
may reasonably request to prepare or review the Preliminary Accounting Report
or any matters submitted to the Agreed Accounting Firm. The fees and
expenses of the Agreed Accounting Firm hereunder shall be paid 50% by
Purchaser and 50% by Unitholders Representatives first from the Reserve and
then from the Cashed Out Unitholders (based on their Pro Rata Share) to the
extent of any excess.

  

## 2.5. _Adjustment_. Promptly (but not later than five (5) days) after the
determination of the final, binding Cash Purchase Price pursuant to
_Section 2.4_ :

  

### (a) if the Cash Purchase Price Per Unit is greater than the Estimated
Cash Purchase Price Per Unit, Purchaser shall pay to each Cashed Out
Unitholder an amount equal to the excess of the Cash Purchase Price Per Unit
over the Estimated Cash Purchase Price Per Unit multiplied by the number of
Cashed Out Units held by such Cashed Out Unitholder, plus interest thereon
from the Closing Date at the Agreed Rate. If Net Working Capital is greater
than Target Net Working Capital by more than $500,000, Purchaser shall pay to
each Cashed Out Unitholder an amount equal to the full amount of the
difference between Net Working Capital and Target Net Working Capital (taking
into account any adjustments made in connection with the calculation of the
Estimated Net Working Capital) divided by the number of Cashed Out Units,
multiplied by the number of Cashed Out Units sold by such Person, plus
interest on such amount from the Closing Date to the date of payment thereof
at the Agreed Rate; or

  

### (b) if the Estimated Cash Purchase Price Per Unit exceeds the Cash
Purchase Price Per Unit, Unitholders Representatives shall pay to Purchaser,
first from the Reserve (with the amount of such payment debited on the basis
of the relative number of Cashed Out Units owned) and thereafter from each
Cashed Out Unitholder in an amount equal to the excess of the Estimated Cash
Purchase Price Unit multiplied by the number of Cashed Out Units held by the
Cashed Out Unitholder, plus interest thereon, from the Closing Date to the
date of payment thereof at the Agreed Rate. If the Target Net Working Capital
exceeds Net Working Capital by more than $500,000, Unitholders
Representatives shall pay to Purchaser, first from the Reserve (with the
amount of such payment debited on the basis of the relative number of Cashed
Out Units owned), and from the Cashed Out Unitholders (to the extent of any
excess), an amount equal to (i) the full amount of the difference between
Target Net Working Capital and Net Working Capital (taking into account any
adjustments made in connection with the calculation of

  

6   

     
   

  



  

### Estimated Net Working Capital), plus (ii) interest on such amount from
the Closing Date to the date of payment thereof at the Agreed Rate.

  

### (c) Any payments due from a Person pursuant to _subdivision (a) or (b)_
hereof may be netted against sums due a Person under _subdivision (a) or (b)_
hereof, so that only a net payment shall be made. Any net payments to
a Cashed Out Unitholder shall be made by wire transfer pursuant to
instructions given in writing no later than three (3) days prior to the date
that the final, binding Cash Purchase Price is determined in accordance with
_Section 2.4_. Any net payments due Purchaser shall be made by wire transfer
pursuant to instructions given in writing to Unitholders Representatives no
later than three (3) days prior to the date the final binding Cash Purchase
Price is determined in accordance with _Section 2.4_ hereof.

  

## 2.6. _Earnout Consideration_

  

### (a) As consideration for the purchase of the Deferred Payout Units at the
Closing, Purchaser will pay to the Deferred Payout Sellers 11.724% of the
Agreed Enterprise Value of the Company as of the Measurement Date ("
**Earnout Consideration** "), at the times specified in this Section 2.6.
 The Earnout Consideration shall be allocated among the Deferred
Payout Unitholders based on the relative number of Deferred Payout Units
sold, provided that the maximum amount payable to California KL Holdings,
Inc. with respect to its Deferred Payout Units shall be $13,500,000 (with
the understanding that any amounts in excess thereof shall not be credited to
any other Deferred Payout Seller). Purchaser shall estimate, in good faith,
the Earnout Consideration not later than ten (10) days prior to the third
anniversary of the Closing Date and shall send a copy of its estimate (and
supporting calculations) to each Deferred Payout Unitholder not later than
such date. On the Business Day immediately preceding the third anniversary of
the Closing Date, Purchaser shall pay to each Deferred Payout Seller (to such
accounts specified to Purchaser in writing no later than 3 Business Days
after receipt of Purchasers estimate) an amount equal to such persons
ratable share (based on the relative number of Deferred Payout Units) of an
amount equal to 90% of the estimated Earnout Consideration (" **Estimated
Earnout Payment** "). Such amount shall not be subject to refund or return.
On or prior to the 60th day after the Measurement Date, Purchaser shall
provide to each Deferred Payout Seller a detailed calculation of the Earnout
Consideration together with payment of such persons ratable share of the
excess, if any, of the Earnout Consideration over the Estimated Earnout
Payment. If any Deferred Payout Seller disputes the calculations of the
Earnout Consideration, the procedures set forth in _Sections 2.4(c) and (d)_
hereof shall apply to the resolution of such dispute, provided that, in lieu
of the Unitholders Representatives participating in such procedure (and being
responsible for one-half the fee of the Agreed Accounting Firm), the first
Deferred Payout Seller who sets forth its objection in writing, shall
represent all the Deferred Payout Sellers and shall be responsible for paying
the entirety of the one-half of the fees and costs of the Agreed Accounting
Firm not payable by Purchaser. The " **Agreed Enterprise Value** " shall be
the product of (i) the Companys EBITDA during the twelve (12) months ending
on the Measurement Date and (ii) the applicable multiple determined from 
_Schedule 2.6_ hereto.

  

### (b) Throughout the Measurement Period, Purchaser agrees to (i) operate
the Company, in good faith, in the ordinary course of business and in a
manner which is not intended to frustrate or diminish the amount of the
Earnout Consideration, (ii) maintain the Companys existence as a limited
liability company (or to operate it as a separate division of Purchaser or a

  



  

7   

     
   

  



  

### subsidiary of Purchaser) and (iii) refrain from liquidating, dissolving,
selling assets (other than inventory and surplus equipment sold in the
ordinary course of business), merging, consolidating or reorganizing
Companys business structure (except as permitted by clause (ii) above), or
selling any of the equity interests in Company. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, Purchaser agrees that it will ( _v_ ) only
effect material changes to the Companys business operations, or manner
of conducting business, intended in its good faith judgment to increase
the profitability of the Company during the Measurement Period, ( _w_ )
maintain separate books and records for the Company; ( _x_ ) direct business
opportunities that pertain solely to Companys business to Company, with the
understanding that with respect to business opportunities that pertain to
lines of business conducted by both Purchaser (and/or any subsidiary or
division of Purchaser) and the Company, Purchaser will direct such
opportunities in a manner that it deems appropriate in good faith; ( _y_ )
not transfer or license any material operating assets, rights or properties
from Company to Purchaser or any other subsidiary or division of Purchaser,
and ( _z_ ) not burden the Company with corporate charges, overhead or other
allocated costs, _provided_ , however, that the Company may make a
reasonable allocation (based on relative sales) of shared out-of-pocket
third-party costs, i.e., insurance costs and audit fees, and may charge the
Company with out-of-pocket third party costs incurred for the direct benefit
of Company.

  

### (c) Payment of the Earnout Consideration shall be subject to the terms of
the Subordination Agreement among Ableco Finance LLC as agent for the holders
of Senior Indebtedness (" **Senior Indebtedness Agent** "), CKLH as agent
for the Deferred Payout Sellers (" **Subordinated Debt Agent** "), Purchaser
and others (" **Subordination Agreement** ") and shall be secured by
Encumbrances, junior to the Encumbrances granted to the Senior Indebtedness
Agent, on all of the assets of Purchaser and its Affiliates by which the
Senior Indebtedness is secured.  In the event any payment of the Earnout
Consideration is not paid when due (as set forth in Section 2.6(a) hereof),
whether by virtue of the Subordination Agreement or otherwise, the Earnout
Consideration shall bear interest from and after the date due to be paid, and
until actually paid, at the Agreed Rate.

  

### (d) Each Deferred Payout Seller hereby constitutes and appoints CKLH as
its agent to act on its behalf concerning (i) the Earnout Consideration, (ii)
execution and delivery of the Subordination Agreement and all of the security
documents relating to the Earnout Consideration, and (iii) enforcement of all
rights thereunder.

shall pay all Taxes (including, without limitation, estimated Taxes) due on
such Tax Returns or which are otherwise required to be paid at any time on or
before the Closing Date.

### (b) Purchaser shall cause Company and each Subsidiary to file when due
(taking into account all extensions properly obtained) all Tax Returns (other
than Company Pre-Closing Returns) that are required to be filed by or with
respect to Company and each Subsidiary for any period ending after the
Closing Date and Purchaser shall cause Company to remit or cause to be
remitted any Taxes due in respect of such Tax Returns. With respect to Tax
Returns to be filed by Company and each Subsidiary pursuant to the preceding
sentence that relate to taxable years or periods ending on or before the
Closing Date or to any Straddle Period, (i) such Tax Returns shall be filed
in a manner consistent with past practice and no position shall be taken,
election made or method adopted that is inconsistent with positions taken,
elections made or methods used in prior periods in filing such Tax Returns
(including, without limitation, any position which would have the effect of
accelerating income to such prior periods or Straddle Period or deferring
deductions to subsequent periods) and (ii) such Tax Returns shall be
submitted to Unitholders Representatives not later than 30 days prior to the
due date for filing such Tax Returns (or, if such due date is within 45 days
following the Closing Date, as promptly as practicable following the Closing
Date) for review and approval by Unitholders Representatives, which approval
may not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, but may in all cases be withheld
if such Tax Returns were not prepared in accordance with _clause (i)_ of this
sentence.

  

### (c) Purchaser shall not permit Company or any Subsidiary to amend, refile
or otherwise modify (or grant an extension of any statute of limitation with
respect to) any Tax Return relating in whole or in part to Company or any
Subsidiary with respect to any taxable year or period ending on or before the
Closing Date (or with respect to any Straddle Period) without the prior
written consent of Unitholders Representatives, which consent may not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed.

  

### (d) Purchaser shall promptly notify Unitholders Representatives in
writing upon receipt by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates, of written notice
of any pending or threatened federal, state, local or foreign Tax audits,
examinations or assessments which might affect the Tax liabilities, which may
generate a Loss pursuant to _Section 8.4(e)_ or from any transactions entered
into, or elections made, after the Closing Date by Company, Purchaser or any
Subsidiary, but the failure to do so will not result in Purchasers loss of
its rights to tax indemnification hereunder, except to the extent that
Sellers are materially prejudiced as a result of such failure. Unitholders
Representatives shall have the sole right to represent Companys interests in
any Tax audit or administrative or court proceeding relating to taxable
periods ending on or before the Closing Date or otherwise relating to Taxes
which may give rise to a Loss pursuant to _Section 8.4_ , and Unitholders
Representatives shall have the right to employ counsel of its choice.  In
the case of a Straddle Period, Unitholders Representatives shall be entitled
to participate in any Tax audit or administrative or court
proceeding relating (in whole or in part) to Taxes attributable to the
portion of such Straddle Period ending on and including the Closing Date.
None of Purchaser, any of its Affiliates, Company or any Subsidiary may
settle a Tax claim for any Taxes which may generate a Loss pursuant to
_Section 8.4(d)_ , without the prior written consent of Unitholders
Representatives, which consent may not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

  

### (e) All Tax-sharing agreements or similar arrangements with respect to or
involving Company or any of its Subsidiaries and a third party shall be
terminated with respect to Company and all such Subsidiaries prior to the
Closing Date, and, after the Closing Date, neither the third party, on the
one hand, nor the Company and its Subsidiaries, on the other, shall be

  

## 

  

37   

     
   

  



  

### bound thereby or have any liability thereunder to the other party for
amounts due in respect of such agreements and arrangements.

  

## 8.4. Liability for Taxes.

  

### (a) Subject to _Section 8.4(e)_ , Sellers shall be responsible (either
from the Reserve, or based on their relative Percentage Share) for all Taxes
imposed on Company or any Subsidiary for any taxable year or period that ends
on or before the Closing Date and, with respect to any Straddle Period, the
portion of such Straddle Period ending on and including the Closing Date;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Sellers shall not be responsible for any Taxes
resulting from a sale of Company or any Subsidiary by Purchaser (Taxes
described in this proviso, hereinafter " **Excluded Taxes** ").

  

### (b) As between Sellers and Purchaser, Purchaser shall be responsible for
(i) all Taxes imposed on Company or any Subsidiary, or for which Company or
any Subsidiary may otherwise be liable, for any taxable year or period that
begins after the Closing Date and, with respect to any Straddle Period, the
portion of such Straddle Period beginning after the Closing Date and (ii)
Excluded Taxes.

  

### (c) For purposes of _Sections 8.4(a)_  and _8.4(b)_ , whenever it is
necessary to determine the responsibility for Taxes of Company or a
Subsidiary for a Straddle Period, the determination of the Taxes of Company
or such Subsidiary for the portion of the Straddle Period ending on and
including, and the portion of the Straddle Period beginning after, the
Closing Date shall be determined by assuming that the Straddle Period
consisted of two taxable years or periods, one which ended at the close of
the Closing Date and the other which began at the beginning of the
day following the Closing Date, and items of income, gain, deduction, loss
or credit of Company or such Subsidiary for the Straddle Period shall be
allocated between such two taxable years or periods on a "closing of the
books basis" by assuming that the books of Company or such Subsidiary were
closed at the close of the Closing Date, _provided_ , _however_ , that (i)
transactions occurring on the Closing Date that are properly allocable (based
on, among other relevant factors, factors set forth in Treas. Reg.
§ 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B)) to the portion of the Closing Date after the
Closing shall be allocated to the taxable year or period that is deemed to
begin at the beginning of the day following the Closing Date, and (ii)
exemptions, allowances or deductions that are calculated on an annual basis,
such as the deduction for depreciation, shall be apportioned between such two
taxable years or periods on a daily basis.  Notwithstanding the foregoing
provisions of this _Section 8.4(c)_ , if the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement result in the reassessment of the value of any property owned
by Company or any Subsidiary for property Tax purposes, or the imposition of
any property Taxes at a rate which is different than the rate that would have
been imposed if such transactions had not occurred, then (y) the portion of
such property Taxes for the portion of the Straddle Period ending on and
including the Closing Date shall be determined on a daily basis, using the
assessed value and Tax rate that would have applied had such transactions not
occurred, and (z) the portion of such property Taxes for the portion of such
Straddle Period beginning after the Closing Date shall be the total property
Taxes of the Straddle Period minus the amount described in _clause (y)_ of
this sentence.

  

### (d) The excess of (i) the Taxes for which Sellers are responsible
pursuant to _Section 8.4(a)_ over (ii) the sum of (1) the aggregate net Tax
liability reflected on the Closing Date Balance Sheet  _plus_ (2) the
aggregate amount of any refund of (or credit for) Taxes allocable

  

## 

  

38   

     
   

  



  

### to any taxable year or period that ends on or before the Closing Date or
to the portion of any Straddle Period ending on and including the Closing
Date (other than amounts reflected in the computation of such net Tax
liability) shall constitute a Loss for purposes of _Article IX_ (a " **Tax
Loss** "). In computing any and all Tax Losses, including any Loss
attributable to the breach of a representation or warranty contained in
_Section 5.6_ , no item of Loss, including any interest or penalty, shall be
counted more than once.

  

### (e) The Purchase Price shall be allocated in accordance with the
determination of a reputable valuation firm designated by Purchaser with the
Unitholders Representatives consent, such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed (at Purchasers expense), it being agreed that inventory
and receivables will be valued in an amount equal to their tax book value,
provided that such value conforms to GAAP. After the Closing, the parties
shall make consistent use of the allocation, fair market value and useful
lives specified by such valuation firm for all Tax purposes and in all
filings, declarations and reports with the IRS in respect thereof.  In any
Proceeding related to the determination of any Tax, neither Purchaser nor the
Company nor any Seller shall contend or represent that such allocation is not
a correct allocation.

  

### (f) If, as a result of any action, suit, investigation, audit, claim,
assessment or amended Tax Return, there is any change after the Closing Date
in an item of income, gain, loss, deduction, credit or amount of Tax that
results in an increase in a Tax liability for which Sellers would otherwise
be responsible pursuant to Section 8.4(a), and such change results in or will
result in a decrease in the Tax liability of Company, any wholly-owned
Subsidiary, Purchaser or any Affiliate or successor of any thereof for any
taxable year or period beginning after the Closing Date or for the portion of
any Straddle Period beginning after the Closing Date, Sellers shall not be
responsible pursuant to Section 8.4(a) with respect to such increase to the
extent of the present value (using a discount rate equal to the then "Federal
mid-term rate," as that term is defined in Section 1274(d) of the Code) of
such decrease.

the Special Claim, the first $50,000 of Losses or Expenses, which, for
purposes of this Section 9.2, shall not be subject to indemnification by
Sellers) equals or exceeds US$725,000 (the " **Purchaser Indemnification
Threshold** "), it being understood that at such time, the Purchaser Group
Members shall be entitled to indemnification for all Losses and Expenses
(other than the first $50,000 of Losses or Expenses relating to the Special
Claim) incurred from the first dollar thereof. The limitations set forth in
this _Section 9.2(b)_ shall not apply to any (i) breach by a Seller of its
representations set forth in _Article IV_ or in _Sections 5.1, 5.6, 5.23 or
5.26_ ; (ii) breach by the Company of its representations set forth in
_Section 6.1_ ; (iii) breach by the Sellers of _Section 8.4_ , (iv) Loss or

and Expenses relating to breach of _Article IV_ or an intentional
misrepresentation by a Seller (and not by Company) shall be the sole
responsibility of the Seller making such misrepresentation.

  

### (c) Subject to _Section 9.6_ , each Sellers indemnification obligations
under this _Section 9.2_ , other than a Sellers indemnification obligations
with respect to breaches of its representations set forth in _Article IV_ or
an intentional misrepresentation (for which such Seller will have sole
liability), shall be limited to its Percentage Share of such Losses or
Expenses.

  

### (d) Subject to _Section 9.6_ hereof, the parties hereby agree that the
aggregate amount of Losses or Expenses for which the Purchaser Group Members
shall be entitled to indemnification pursuant to this _Section 9.2_ from all
Sellers shall be limited to $14,500,000, other than (i) a breach of a

5.23, 5.26, 6.1 or 8.4_ or (ii) Losses and Expenses incurred as a result
of Trademark Invalidity (as to which items the aggregate Losses and Expenses
for which a Seller shall be liable shall be limited to the amount of the
Purchase Price paid by Purchaser to such Seller), or (iii) an
intentional misrepresentation by any Seller or the Company in this Agreement
or in any Related Document executed by such Person, as to which there shall
be no limit to the Losses and Expenses to be reimbursed by Sellers. Further,
all rights to indemnification provided for in this

### _Section 9.2_ (other than a claim for breach of _Article IV_ , _Sections
5.1, 5.6, 5.23, 5.26, 6.1 or 8.4_ and claims arising from Trademark
Invalidity, or a breach by a Seller of such Sellers covenants in Section
10.1, for each of which there shall be no time limit) shall terminate on
April 30, 2006; _provided_ that, the obligation to indemnify the Purchaser
Group Members shall continue after April 30, 2006 as to any Loss or Expense
of which any Purchaser Group Member has notified the
Unitholders Representatives in accordance with the requirements of _Section
9.4_ on or prior to April 30, 2006, as to which the obligation to indemnify
such Purchaser Group Member shall continue until the liability owing to such
Purchaser Group Member shall have been determined pursuant to this _Article
IX_ and such Purchaser Group Member shall have been reimbursed for such Loss
and Expense for which it is owed in accordance with this _Article IX_.

  

## 9.3. _Indemnification of Seller Group Members_.

  

### (a) Purchaser shall indemnify and hold harmless each Seller Group Member
from and against, and will reimburse each Seller Group Member for, any and
all Losses and Expenses incurred by such Seller Group Member in connection
with or arising from:

  

#### (i) any breach or failure to perform by Purchaser of any of their
respective agreements, covenants or obligations in this Agreement; or

  

#### (ii) any breach of any warranty or the inaccuracy of any representation

IX_.

  

## 

  

41   

     
   

  



  

## 9.4. _Notice and Determination of Claims_.

  

### (a) If any Seller Group Member (with respect to _Section 9.3_ ) believes
that it has suffered or incurred any Loss or incurred any Expense, and any
applicable dollar limitation specified by  _Section 9.3_ has been exceeded,
such Seller shall notify the Unitholders Representatives describing such Loss
or Expense with enough detail as to allow the Unitholders Representatives to
provide the information required by this _Section 9.4_. The Unitholders
Representatives shall have the sole discretion and authority to determine
whether to seek indemnification with respect to such Loss or Expense.

  

### (b) Other than those claims for indemnification hereunder resulting from
or in connection with any claim, action, suit or legal proceeding by an
unaffiliated third Person (which claims shall be governed by the terms of
_Section 9.5_ ), if (i) any Purchaser Group Member (with respect to _Section
9.2_ ) believes that it has suffered or incurred any Loss or incurred any
Expense, and the Purchaser Indemnification Threshold has been exceeded, such
Purchaser Group Member shall so notify the Unitholders Representatives or
(ii) the Unitholders Representatives have received notice pursuant to
_Section 9.4(a)_ hereof, Unitholders Representatives shall so notify
Purchaser (the party providing such notice is referred to herein as the "
**Requesting Party** " and the party obligated to provide indemnification to
such Requesting Party is referred to herein as the " **Indemnitor** ") (for
purposes of clarity, if the Requesting Party is a Purchaser Group Member, the
Unitholders Representatives shall be deemed the agent of the Indemnitors for
purposes of this _Article IX_ ).  Any notice given pursuant to this _Section
9.4(b)_ shall be in writing and shall describe the applicable Loss or
Expense, the amount thereof, if known, and the method of computation of such
Loss or Expense, all with reasonable particularity and containing a reference
to the provisions of this Agreement, any certificate delivered pursuant
hereto or any Purchaser Ancillary Agreement or Seller Ancillary Agreement, as
the case may be, in respect of which such Loss or Expense shall have occurred
(each, a " **Claim Notice** ");  _provided_ , _however_ , that the omission
by the Requesting Party to give notice as provided herein shall not relieve
any Indemnitor of its indemnification obligation under this _Article IX_ ,
except to the extent that such Indemnitor is materially prejudiced as a
result of such failure to give notice; and _provided_ _further_ that, should
any Claim Notice be given before the applicable dollar limitation(s)
specified by _Sections 9.2_ or _9.3_ have been exceeded, the Loss or Expense
detailed on such Claim Notice shall not be payable until such time as such
dollar limitation has been exceeded. The Requesting Party shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to minimize and mitigate any Loss or Expense
for which indemnification is sought hereunder.

  

### (c) After the giving of any Claim Notice pursuant hereto, the amount of
indemnification to which an Requesting Party shall be entitled under this
_Article IX_ shall be paid within fifteen (15) Business Days of receipt of
the Claim Notice, unless the Indemnitor has given written notice of a
dispute, in which case the claim for indemnification shall be made in
accordance with (i) the dispute resolution procedures of _Section 10.14_ ; or
(ii) by the written agreement between the Requesting Party and the
Indemnitor; or (iii) by a final judgment or decree of any court of competent
jurisdiction (for purposes of this _Section 9.4_ , the judgment or decree of
a court shall be deemed final when the time for appeal, if any, shall have
expired and no appeal shall have been taken or when all appeals taken shall
have been finally determined); or (iv) by any other means to which the
Requesting Party and the Indemnitor shall agree. The Requesting Party shall
have the burden of proof in establishing the amount of

  

## 

  

42   

     
   

  



  

### Loss and Expense suffered by it. If a Purchaser Group Member is the
Requesting Party, the amount of indemnification to which such Purchaser Group
Member is entitled, shall be paid in accordance with _Section 9.6_.

  

### (d) In calculating any Loss or Expense incurred by a Requesting Party,
there shall be deducted any insurance proceeds actually recovered in respect
thereof except to the extent of any retrospective or other related premium
adjustment (and no right of subrogation shall accrue hereunder to any
insurer).

  

### (e) Purchaser shall report each indemnification payment received by a
Purchaser Group Member pursuant to this _Article IX_ as a reduction in the
Purchase Price, unless Purchaser determines in good faith that such reporting
position is incorrect.

  

## 9.5. _Third Person Claims_. In the event of any claim for indemnification
hereunder resulting from or in connection with any claim or legal proceeding
by an unaffiliated third Person, the Requesting Party shall give such notice
thereof to the Indemnitor not later than fifteen (15) days following the date
such Requesting Party has actual knowledge thereof; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the omission by such Requesting Party to give notice as provided herein
shall not relieve the Indemnitor of its indemnification obligation under this
_Article IX_ , except to the extent that such Indemnitor is materially
prejudiced as a result of such failure to give notice. The Indemnitor shall
have the right to conduct and control, through counsel of its choosing (such
counsel to be reasonably satisfactory to the Requesting Party), the defense,
compromise or settlement of any third Person claim, action or suit against
the Requesting Party as to which indemnification is sought by any Requesting
Party from any Indemnitor hereunder (unless the Indemnitor is also a party to
such proceeding and the Requesting Party determines in good faith that joint
representation would cause a material conflict), and in any such case the
Requesting Party shall cooperate reasonably in connection therewith and shall
furnish such records, information and testimony and attend such conferences,
discovery proceedings, hearings, trials and appeals as may be reasonably
requested by the Indemnitor in connection therewith; _provided_ , that the
Requesting Party may participate, through counsel chosen by it and at its own
expense, in the defense of any such claim, action or suit as to which the
Indemnitor has so elected to conduct and control the defense thereof; and
_provided_ , _further_ , that the Indemnitor shall not, without the written
consent of the Requesting Party (which written consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld), compromise or settle any such claim, action or suit,
except for money damages. If the Indemnitor assumes the defense of
a proceeding (i) no compromise or settlement of such claim or proceeding may
be effected by the Indemnitor without the Requesting Partys consent,
which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; and (ii) the
Indemnitor will have no liability with respect to any compromise or
settlement of such claims made without its consent.  Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if a Requesting Party determines in good faith that there is a
reasonable probability that a proceeding may adversely affect it or its
Affiliates other than as a result of monetary damages for which it would be
entitled to indemnification under this Agreement, the Requesting Party may,
by notice to the Indemnitor, assume the exclusive right to defend,
compromise, or settle such proceeding, but the Indemnitor will not be bound
by any determination in any such proceeding so defended or by any compromise
or settlement effected in any proceeding so defended without its consent
(which may not be unreasonably withheld).

  

## 9.6. _Payment of Purchaser Group Member Indemnification_.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, but subject to the remainder
of this _Section 9.6_ , upon the final determination of the amount of
indemnification to which a Purchaser Group Member shall be

  

## 

  

43   

     
   

  



  

## entitled under this _Article IX_ from any Seller, and at such time as the
Purchaser Indemnification Threshold has been satisfied, such amount shall be
paid to such Purchaser Group Member first from the Reserve Amount and
thereafter, on a pro rata basis (as set forth on _Schedule 3.2_ ), by Sellers
up to the maximum amount of such Sellers indemnity obligation.  Unitholders
Representatives shall cause any claim for indemnification for which any
Sellers have liability to Purchaser Group Members under _Section 9.2_ to be
satisfied by payments of cash from the Reserve to the extent there remains
any funds in the Reserve.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this _Article IX_ , any breach of a representation or warranty contained
in _Article IV_ shall be satisfied solely in cash by the Seller whose
representation or warranty was breached, without recourse to the Reserve.
 Each Seller shall have personal liability and shall be subject to
full recourse for any claim for breach of representations contained in
_Article IV_  hereof .

  

## 9.7. _Exclusive Remedy_. Any claim against any party hereto for any
breach of this Agreement or in connection with any of the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby (other than the Employment Agreements) shall,
to the extent permitted by law, be made solely pursuant to this _Article IX_.

  

# **ARTICLE X** 
 GENERAL PROVISIONS

  

## 10.1. _Confidential Nature of Information_. Each party agrees that it
will treat in confidence all documents, materials and other information which
it shall have obtained regarding the other parties during the course of the
negotiations leading to the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby and the preparation of this Agreement and other Related Documents.
Such documents, materials and information shall not be communicated to any
third Person (other than, in the case of Purchaser, to its counsel,
accountants, financial advisors or lenders, and in the case of Company, to
its counsel, accountants or financial advisors). No other party shall use
any confidential information in any manner whatsoever except solely for the
purpose of evaluating the proposed Sale; _provided_ , _however_ , that after
the Closing Date, Purchaser may use or disclose any confidential information
included in the assets of Company as of the Closing Date or otherwise
reasonably related to the assets or business of Company. The obligation of
each party to treat such documents, materials and other information in
confidence shall not apply to any information which (i) is or becomes
available to such party from a source other than such party, (ii) is or
becomes available to the public other than as a result of disclosure by such
party or its agents, (iii) is required to be disclosed under applicable law,
stock exchange regulation or judicial process, but only to the extent it must
be disclosed (as determined by applicable counsel), or (iv) such party
reasonably deems necessary to disclose to obtain any of the consents or
approvals contemplated hereby.

  

## 10.2. _Notices_. All notices or other communications required or permitted
hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed given or delivered when

### (a) _Representatives_. Except as otherwise provided herein, if

of either party, each party will appoint one or two designated
representatives (the " **Representative** ", which, in the case of Sellers,
shall be deemed to be each Unitholders Representatives) to meet for the
purpose of resolving the dispute.  The Representatives will meet at a
mutually agreeable place within ten (10) Business Days after either party
makes a written request to the other for such a meeting. The Representatives
will honor reasonable requests to exchange information related to the dispute
and will make an effort to negotiate a resolution to the dispute.
Negotiations shall continue until the dispute is resolved or until either
party informs the other in writing that negotiations will not result in a
mutually acceptable resolution and an arbitrator should be appointed.

  

### (b) _Arbitration_.

  

#### (i) In the event the dispute is not resolved under _Section 10.14(a)_ ,
the parties agree that the dispute shall be resolved by a private arbitration
conducted by one arbitrator. Within fifteen (15) Business Days after
the termination of negotiations pursuant to _Section 10.14(a)_ , the
parties shall agree upon one (1) arbitrator (the " **Arbitrator**
"), selected from a permanent panel of no fewer than fifteen (15) names
agreed upon by the parties (the " **Permanent Panel** "). If the parties are
unable to agree on the fifteen (15) names for the Permanent Panel, either
party may refer the matter to the office of the American Arbitration
Association (" **AAA** ") for the limited purpose of having AAA provide such
number of names as are not agreed upon by the parties. The parties shall
select the arbitrator from the Permanent Panel by alternately striking names
until only one name remains on the Permanent Panel. A toss of a coin will
determine which party is to strike the first name. Neither party may choose
as its arbitrator the person who was its Representative under
_Section 10.14(a)_ or any person who is an officer, director or employee of
either party or any Affiliate of either party, or a person who has a direct
or indirect personal or financial interest in the outcome of the arbitration.

  

##

#### (ii) The Arbitrator shall set a hearing date for an arbitration (the "
**Hearing** ") within ninety (90) days from the date the Arbitrator is
selected, unless otherwise agreed by the parties, or unless otherwise ordered
by the Arbitrator at the request of either party.

  

#### (iii) Unless otherwise agreed, within fifteen (15) days before the
Hearing, each party shall submit to the Arbitrator with a copy to the other
party a list of all witnesses and exhibits which it intends to present at the
Hearing. At the request of any party the Arbitrator, consistent with the
expedited nature of arbitration, shall have the authority to order such
discovery, by way of deposition, interrogatory, document production, or
otherwise, as the Arbitrator considers necessary to a full and fair
exploration of the issues in dispute.

  

#### (iv) No later than ten (10) days before the scheduled Hearing, each
party shall provide to the Arbitrator a short (not to exceed five (5) single-
spaced pages or such other page limit as the Arbitrator permits) statement of
its position with regard to the dispute.

  

#### (v) At the Hearing, each party shall, unless it waives the opportunity,
make an oral opening statement, and an oral closing statement.

  

#### (vi) When testimony is complete and each party has introduced its
exhibits, subject to the provisions of this Agreement, and each party has
made a closing statement pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement or
waived the opportunity to do so, the Arbitrator shall declare the Hearing
closed; _provided_ , _however_ , the parties may submit post-hearing briefs
pursuant to an agreed upon schedule or one formulated by the Arbitrator.

  

#### (vii) The Hearing shall be held at a location in City of New York agreed
upon by the parties and convenient for the Arbitrator, or if the parties
cannot agree upon a location, at a location in the City of New York
designated by the Arbitrator.

  

#### (viii) The Hearing shall be conducted in private. Attendance at the
Hearing shall be limited to the following: (i) the Arbitrator; (ii)
Representatives or their designated replacements; (iii) each affected partys
attorneys (including in-house counsel) and attorneys assistants or
consultants, if any; (iv) a court reporter if requested by either party; and
(v) any witnesses, including expert witnesses. The Arbitrator may
sequester witnesses upon the motion of a party.

  

#### (ix) Within thirty (30) days of the close of the Hearing or submission
of the post-hearing briefs, the Arbitrator shall issue a written opinion and
award (the " **Award** ") based on evidence, arguments and post-hearing
briefs, if any. The Award shall be a decision of the Arbitrator, shall
resolve the parties dispute, and shall be final and binding on the parties.
The fact that an opinion is issued does not enlarge or restrict the authority
of a court provided in the AAAs Commercial Arbitration Rules to review the
arbitration proceedings or the Award. The Arbitrator shall have the Award
delivered to each party in accordance with _Section 10.2_.

  

#### (x) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, there shall be no ex
parte communication regarding the subject matter of the Hearing between a
party or its attorneys and any Arbitrator from the time the Arbitrator is
appointed until after the parties receive the Award.

  

## 

  

49   

     
   

  



  

#### (xi) The parties may agree to submit the dispute to the Arbitrator
without a Hearing, based upon a joint written statement agreed upon within 75
days after the Arbitrator is selected, in which event the Arbitrator will
render and deliver to the parties a written opinion and Award within thirty
(30) days of being notified that the parties waive the Hearing.

  

#### (xii) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the
Arbitrator shall have no power to delete from, add to, nor modify the terms
of this Agreement, and may not award any remedy which effectively conflicts
directly or indirectly with any provision of this Agreement.

  

#### (xiii) The arbitration shall be governed by AAAs Commercial Rules of
Arbitration, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement.

  

#### (xiv) All expenses, costs and attorneys fees of the arbitration shall be
paid by the nonprevailing party. The arbitrator shall award such expenses
in the arbitration award. All fees of the Arbitrator shall be initially
advanced equally, one-half by the Purchaser and one-half by the Sellers. ##
