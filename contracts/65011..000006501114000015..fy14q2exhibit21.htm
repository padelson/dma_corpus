under this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements.

Section 2.4. Closing Date. The purchase and sale of the Purchased Assets
provided for in Section 2.1 (the "Closing") shall be consummated at 10:00
A.M., local time, three (3) Business Days after the conditions set forth in
Articles VII and VIII are satisfied or, if permissible, waived, at the offices
of Nixon Peabody LLP, Washington, DC (the "Closing Date"). For the avoidance
of doubt, the purchase by Buyer's Qualified Assignee of the Designated Station
Assets shall occur simultaneously with the Purchase by Buyer of the Purchased
Assets and the assumption by Buyer of the Assumed Liabilities.

Section 2.5. Purchase Price.

(a) The purchase price for the Purchased Assets (the "Purchase Price") shall
be determined in accordance with Section 2.7 and shall be equal to:

(i) Two Hundred Thirty Million Five Hundred Sixty Thousand Dollars
($230,560,000.00), plus

(ii) the Closing Date Working Capital Amount, or minus

(iii) the Closing Date Working Capital Deficit.

(b) In determining the Closing Date Working Capital Amount or the Closing Date
Working Capital Deficit, as the case may be, Buyer and Seller shall prorate
all income earned and all expenses incurred in connection with the Business
and operation of the Stations as of close of business on the last business day
prior to the Closing Date (the "Cutoff Time"). Sales commissions earned by
employees of Seller or Option Party prior to the Closing Date and related to
the sale of advertisements broadcast on any Station prior to the Cutoff Time
shall be the responsibility of Seller or Option Party, and sales commissions
related to the sale of advertisements broadcast on any Station after the
Cutoff Time shall be the responsibility of Buyer. It is agreed and understood
by the parties that any payables under Program Rights Agreements that are
contractually due in the month in which the Closing takes place shall be
apportioned on a pro rata basis based upon the number of days in the calendar
month which includes the Closing Date. With respect to trade, barter or
similar agreements for the sale of time for goods or services assumed by Buyer
pursuant to Section 2.1(h)(i), if at the Cutoff Time the Business has an
aggregate negative or positive barter balance (i.e., the amount by which the
value of air time to be provided by the Business after the Cutoff Time
exceeds, or conversely, is less than, the fair market value of corresponding
goods and services), there shall be a proration or adjustment and such excess
or deficiency, as the case may be, shall be treated either as prepaid time
sales or a receivable of Seller or Option Party, and adjusted for as a
proration in Buyer's or Seller's favor, as applicable. In determining barter
balances, the value of air time shall be based upon the fair market value of
the goods and services received by the Business, and corresponding goods and
services shall include those to be received by the Business after the Cutoff
Time plus 

those received by the Business before the Cutoff Time to the extent conveyed
by Seller or Option Party to Buyer as a part of the Purchased Assets. Sections
2.5, 2.6 or 2.7 shall not be interpreted, however, so as to provide a double
payment or double credit to Seller or Buyer for any item in the calculation of
the Closing Date Payment or the Closing Date Balance Sheet. Without limiting
the foregoing, Buyer and Seller agree that:

(i) "Current Assets," as used herein, shall include prepaid expenses
reflecting amounts paid by Seller or Option Party, as applicable, prior to the
Closing Date which represent benefits to be realized on or after the Closing
Date under contracts included in the Purchased Assets or otherwise relating to
any Station to the extent the same do not relate to Excluded Assets; and

(ii) "Current Liabilities," as used herein, shall include accounts payable and
accrued expenses reflecting expenses and costs incurred prior to the Closing
Date which represent benefits realized before the Closing Date under contracts
included in the Purchased Assets or otherwise relating to any Station to the
extent the same do not relate to Excluded Liabilities. For the avoidance of
doubt, Seller or Option Party, as applicable, shall pay at or promptly
following the Closing Date accrued, unused vacation leave or sick leave of the
Affected Employees.

Section 2.6. Determination of Estimated Purchase Price; Payment on Closing
Date.

(a) At least two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall
deliver to Buyer a certificate executed on behalf of Parent by an authorized
officer thereof, dated the date of its delivery, setting forth Parent's good
faith estimate of (i) the Closing Date Working Capital Amount or the Closing
Date Working Capital Deficit, as the case may be, and (ii) the Estimated
Purchase Price. Such certificate shall be based on the then most recently
available monthly financial statements of Sellers and Option Party and shall
reflect Parent's estimate of the prorations contemplated by Section 2.5(b) as
of the Cutoff Time.

(b) On the Closing Date, Buyer shall pay Seller an amount equal to the
Estimated Purchase Price (the "Closing Date Payment"), by bank wire transfer
of immediately available funds to such bank account or accounts designated by
Parent for such purpose not less than two (2) Business Days before the date
such payment is required to be made. For the avoidance of doubt, any exercise
price payable pursuant to the Option Agreement shall be the sole
responsibility of Parent, shall not increase the Purchase Price and shall be
paid by Parent to the Option Party at or prior to Closing.

Section 2.7. Determination of Closing Date Working Capital and Purchase Price.

(a) As promptly as practicable following the Closing Date (but not later than
one hundred eighty (180) days after the Closing Date), Buyer shall: 

(i) prepare, in accordance with the Agreed Accounting Principles, a balance
sheet as of the Cutoff Time with respect to the Purchased Assets and the
Assumed Liabilities (the "Preliminary Closing Date Balance Sheet");

(ii) determine the Purchase Price in accordance with the provisions of this
Agreement (such Purchase Price as determined by Buyer being called the
"Preliminary Purchase Price"); and

(iii) deliver to Parent a certificate executed by Buyer setting forth or
attaching the Preliminary Closing Date Balance Sheet and Buyer's calculation
of the Closing Date Working Capital Amount or the Closing Date Working Capital
Deficit, as the case may be (the "Preliminary Closing Date Working Capital
Calculation") derived therefrom and the Preliminary Purchase Price.

(b) Parent shall have thirty (30) Business Days following receipt of the
certificate referenced in Section 2.7(a) (the "Review Period") in which to
review the Preliminary Closing Date Balance Sheet, the Preliminary Purchase
Price and the Preliminary Closing Date Working Capital Calculation. In the
event Parent does not object to the Preliminary Closing Date Balance Sheet,
the Preliminary Purchase Price or the Preliminary Closing Date Working Capital
Calculation prior to expiration of the Review Period, the Preliminary Closing
Date Balance Sheet, the Preliminary Purchase Price and the Preliminary Closing
Date Working Capital Calculation shall become (i) the "Closing Date Balance
Sheet," (ii) the "Purchase Price" and (iii) the "Closing Date Working Capital
Amount" or the "Closing Date Working Capital Deficit," as the case may be,
respectively, for all purposes of this Agreement, including for purposes of
determining the adjustment payment (if any) specified in Section 2.10. In the
event Parent objects to the Preliminary Closing Date Balance Sheet, the
Preliminary Purchase Price or the Preliminary Closing Date Working Capital
Calculation, Parent shall give a written notice to Buyer specifying its
objections in reasonable detail and the basis therefor, prior to expiration of
the Review Period ("Objection Notice"). During the fifteen (15) Business Day
period following Buyer's receipt of the Objection Notice (the "Resolution
Period"), Buyer and Parent shall attempt to resolve the differences specified
in the Objection Notice and any resolution by them (evidenced in writing) of
such differences (the "Agreed Adjustments") shall be final, binding and
conclusive. In the event Buyer and Parent resolve all disputed items set forth
in the Objection Notice by the Agreed Adjustments, the Preliminary Closing
Date Balance Sheet, the Preliminary Purchase Price and the Preliminary Closing
Date Working Capital Calculation, in each case as adjusted by the Agreed
Adjustments, shall become (x) the "Closing Date Balance Sheet," (y) the
"Purchase Price" and (z) the "Closing Date Working Capital Amount" or the
"Closing Date Working Capital Deficit," as the case may be, respectively, for
all purposes of this Agreement, including for purposes of determining the
adjustment payment (if any) specified in Section 2.10.

(c) If at the conclusion of the Resolution Period any objections raised by
Parent remain unresolved, then the amounts so in dispute (the "Disputed
Items") shall be submitted to a firm of independent public accountants (the
"Arbitrator") mutually selected by Parent and Buyer within ten (10) Business
Days after the expiration of the Resolution Period. The Arbitrator shall
determine and resolve, based solely on presentations by Buyer and Parent, and
not by independent review, the Disputed Items, consistent with the Agreed
Accounting Principles. In resolving the Disputed Items, the Arbitrator's
determination shall be no higher or 

lower than the respective amounts proposed by Buyer and Parent. The
Arbitrator's determination shall be made within thirty (30) Business Days of
its selection, shall be set forth in a written statement delivered to Buyer
and Parent and shall be final, binding and conclusive on the parties hereto.
The Preliminary Closing Date Balance Sheet, the Preliminary Purchase Price and
the Preliminary Closing Date Working Capital Calculation shall be adjusted to
reflect all Agreed Adjustments and the resolution of all Disputed Items by the
Arbitrator and, as so adjusted, shall be (i) the "Closing Date Balance Sheet,"
(ii) the "Purchase Price" and (iii) the "Closing Date Working Capital Amount"
or the "Closing Date Working Capital Deficit," as the case may be,
respectively, for all purposes of this Agreement, including for purposes of
determining the adjustment payment (if any) specified in Section 2.10.

(d) The parties hereto shall make available to Buyer, Parent and, if
applicable, the Arbitrator, such books, records and other information
(including work papers) as any of the foregoing may reasonably request to
prepare or review the Preliminary Closing Date Balance Sheet, the Preliminary
Purchase Price and the Preliminary Closing Date Working Capital Calculation or
any matters submitted to the Arbitrator. The fees and expenses of the
Arbitrator shall be paid proportionately by Buyer and Parent based on the
determination of the Arbitrator of the unresolved objections submitted to it
pursuant to Section 2.7(c). The calculation of such proportionate payments
shall be based on the relative position of the determination of the Arbitrator
in comparison to the positions submitted to it by Buyer and Parent pursuant to
Section 2.7(c).

Section 2.8. Closing Date Deliveries.

(a) On the Merger Closing Date, Parent shall cause each Seller to join in, and
become a party to this Agreement by causing each Seller to execute and deliver
to Buyer a Joinder Agreement, substantially in the form attached hereto as

remedy any defect, Encumbrance (other than Permitted Encumbrances) or other

that may be required by Buyer's title insurance company to insure title to
Owned Real Property at Closing, (v) all of the documents and instruments
required to be delivered by Seller or Option Party pursuant to Article VIII,

and instruments as Buyer has determined to be reasonably necessary to
consummate the Transactions.

(c) On the Closing Date, Buyer shall deliver or shall cause its Qualified
Assignee to deliver to Parent (i) the Closing Date Payment, (ii) all of the
documents and instruments required to be delivered by Buyer pursuant to
Article VII, (iii) assumption agreements duly executed by Buyer relating to
any agreement of Seller listed as an "Assumed Contract" on Schedule 3.17, (iv)
a certificate of good standing of Buyer, issued as of a recent date by the
secretary of state of the state of its incorporation, (vi) the undertaking and

with Treas. Reg. § 1.1445-2(b) and (viii) such other documents and instruments
as Parent has determined to be reasonably necessary to consummate the
Transactions.

Section 2.9. Further Assurances.

(a) On the Closing Date, the appropriate Seller or Option Party shall (i)
deliver to Buyer or its Qualified Assignee, as applicable, such other bills of
sale, deeds, endorsements, assignments and other good and sufficient
instruments of conveyance and transfer as Buyer may reasonably request or as
may be otherwise reasonably necessary to vest in Buyer or its Qualified
Assignee, as applicable, all the right, title and interest of such Seller or
Option Party in, to or under any or all of the Purchased Assets and (ii) take
all steps as may be reasonably necessary to put Buyer or its Qualified
Assignee, as applicable, in actual possession and control of all the Purchased
Assets. From time to time following the Closing, the appropriate Seller or
Option Party shall execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered,
to Buyer such other instruments of conveyance and transfer as Buyer may
reasonably request or as may be otherwise necessary to more effectively convey
and transfer to, and vest in, Buyer or its Qualified Assignee, as applicable,
and put Buyer or its Qualified Assignee, in possession of, any part of the
Purchased Assets, and, in the case of licenses, certificates, approvals,
authorizations, agreements, contracts, leases, easements and other commitments
included in the Purchased Assets which cannot be transferred or assigned
effectively without the consent of third parties, which consent has not been
obtained prior to the Closing, to cooperate with Buyer or its Qualified
Assignee, as applicable, at its reasonable request in endeavoring to obtain
such consent.

(b) Without limiting Section 5.3(f) hereof, to the extent that any Station
Agreement or other agreement included as a Purchased Asset cannot be assigned
without consent and such consent is not obtained prior to the Closing Date,
Parent shall cause each appropriate Seller and Option Party to use all
commercially reasonable efforts to provide Buyer or its Qualified Assignee, as
applicable, the benefits of any such agreement and, to the extent Buyer or its
Qualified Assignee is provided with the benefits of such agreement, Buyer or
its Qualified Assignee, as applicable, shall perform or discharge on behalf of
such Seller or Option Party the obligations and liabilities under such
agreement in accordance with the provisions thereof. In addition to Buyer's
obligation pursuant to the foregoing sentence, as to any Station Agreement or
other agreement included as a Purchased Asset that is not effectively assigned
to Buyer or its 

Qualified Assignee as of the Closing Date but is thereafter effectively
assigned to Buyer or its Qualified Assignee, as applicable, Buyer or its
Qualified Assignee, as applicable, shall, from and after the effective date of
such assignment, assume, and shall thereafter pay, perform and discharge as
and when due, all Assumed Liabilities of any Seller or Option Party arising
under such agreement.

(c) On the Closing Date, Buyer shall deliver to Parent such other undertakings
and assumptions and other good and sufficient instruments of conveyance,
transfer and assumption as Parent may reasonably request or as may be
otherwise reasonably necessary to evidence Buyer's assumption of and
obligation to pay, perform and discharge the Assumed Liabilities. From time to
time following the Closing, Buyer shall execute and deliver, or cause to be
executed and delivered, to Parent such other undertakings and assumptions as
Parent may reasonably request or as may be otherwise necessary to more
effectively evidence Buyer's assumption of and obligation to pay, perform and
discharge the Assumed Liabilities.

Section 2.10. Purchase Price Adjustment. Promptly (but not later than five (5)
Business Days) after the determination of the Purchase Price pursuant to
Section 2.7 that is final and binding as set forth herein:

(i) if the Purchase Price as finally determined pursuant to Section 2.7
exceeds the Estimated Purchase Price, Buyer shall pay to Seller, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to such bank accounts of Seller as
Parent shall designate in writing to Buyer, the difference between the
Purchase Price and the Estimated Purchase Price; or

(ii) if the Purchase Price as finally determined pursuant to Section 2.7 is
less than the Estimated Purchase Price, Parent or Seller shall pay to Buyer,
by wire transfer of immediately available funds to such bank accounts of Buyer
as Buyer shall designate in writing to Parent, the difference between the
Purchase Price and the Estimated Purchase Price.

Section 2.11. Allocation of Purchase Price.

(a) Within sixty (60) days following the determination of the Purchase Price
pursuant to Section 2.7 that is final and binding as set forth therein, Parent
shall deliver to Buyer a schedule (the "Preliminary Allocation Schedule")
allocating the Purchase Price (including, for purposes of this Section 2.11,
any other consideration paid to Seller including the Assumed Liabilities). The
Preliminary Allocation Schedule shall be reasonable, shall be based on
appraisals by a nationally recognized appraisal firm experienced in valuing
television stations, and shall be prepared in accordance with Section 1060 of
the Code and the regulations thereunder. Within fifteen (15) days following
delivery to Buyer of the Preliminary Allocation Schedule, Buyer shall deliver
to Parent written notice of any objections Buyer has with respect to the
Preliminary Allocation Schedule, setting forth in reasonable detail the
reasons for its objections. If Buyer so objects within such 15-day period,
Buyer and Parent shall use their reasonable efforts to resolve such agreements
by written agreement. 

(b) If any objections to the Preliminary Allocation Schedule raised by Buyer
are not resolved within the 10-day period next following such 15-day period,
then Buyer and Parent shall submit such objections to the Arbitrator, which
shall determine the appropriate allocation and so adjust the Preliminary
Allocation Schedule. The fees and expenses of the Arbitrator shall be paid 50%
by Buyer and 50% by Parent.

(c) Buyer and Parent shall jointly make such adjustments, if any, to the
Preliminary Allocation Schedule following the Closing Date to reflect (i) any
agreement of Buyer and Parent resolving objections thereto pursuant to Section
2.11(a) and (ii) any adjustments by the Arbitrator pursuant to Section
2.11(b). The Preliminary Allocation Schedule, as so adjusted, shall be final
and binding on Buyer and Parent as the "Final Allocation Schedule" for all
purposes set forth in Section 2.11(d).

(d) Buyer and Parent each agrees to file IRS Form 8594, or other applicable
IRS forms, and all federal, state and local Tax returns, in accordance with
the Final Allocation Schedule. Buyer and Parent each agrees to provide the
other promptly with any other information required to complete IRS Form 8594
or other applicable IRS forms. If any Governmental Body contests the Final
Allocation Schedule, Buyer or Parent, as the case may be, shall notify the
other party of such contest and no Buyer Group Member or Seller Group Member
shall take a position that is inconsistent with the Final Allocation Schedule
without the prior written consent of Buyer or Parent, as applicable.

Section 2.12. Uncollected Receivables. During the 180-day period that begins
on the Closing Date (the "Collection Period"), Buyer shall collect and receive
payment in the ordinary course of business with respect to the outstanding
accounts receivable which were included on the Closing Date Balance Sheet (the
"Receivables"), and shall pursue collection thereof in accordance with its
usual and customary practices (but shall not be obligated to commence any
litigation to collect any such Receivables). All such payments from each
obligor of a Receivable shall be applied on a "first-in, first-out" basis
during the Collection Period so that each payment from an obligor is applied
first to the oldest outstanding Receivables of such obligor, unless otherwise
directed in writing by the obligor in the event of disputed receivables. If
the cumulative principal amount of the Receivables which remain uncollected as
of the expiration of the Collection Period exceed the reserve for bad debts
included on the Closing Date Balance Sheet (the "Collections Deficiency"),
Parent or Seller shall pay promptly to Buyer an amount equal to the
Collections Deficiency. If the cumulative principal amount of the Receivables
collected during the Collection Period exceeds an amount equal to (i) the
amount of the Receivables minus (ii) the reserve for bad debts included on the
Closing Date Balance Sheet (such excess amount referred to as the "Excess
Collections"), Buyer shall promptly pay to Parent an amount equal to the
Excess Collections. Buyer shall, within five (5) Business Days of the end of
the Collection Period, provide Parent with a complete list of the uncollected
Receivables as of the end of the Collection Period. At the end of the
Collection Period, Buyer shall cease to have any further responsibilities to
Seller or Parent with respect to the Receivables. In the event of payment of
the Collections Deficiency by Parent or Seller to Buyer, Buyer shall assign to
Seller any Receivables that remain uncollected as of the end of the Collection
Period and, subject to providing Buyer with advance notice of Seller's intent
to pursue any such uncollected Receivables, Seller and its Affiliates shall be
permitted to pursue the collection of such uncollected Receivables after the
expiration of the Collection Period, in their discretion. Buyer 

agrees to remit to Parent, promptly following receipt, any amounts received by
Buyer with respect to any uncollected Receivables assigned by Buyer to Seller
pursuant to this Section 2.12.

This Agreement and the Option Exercise Agreement are, and each other Ancillary
Agreement when executed and delivered by Seller, Parent or Option Party and

accordance with its respective terms, except in each case as such
enforceability may be limited 

by bankruptcy, moratorium, insolvency, reorganization or other similar laws
affecting or limiting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and
except as such enforceability is subject to general principles of equity
(regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in
equity or at law).

(c) Except as set forth in Schedule 3.3, none of the execution, delivery and
performance by either Seller or Parent of this Agreement or by Seller, Parent
or Option Party, as applicable, of the Ancillary Agreements, the consummation
by Seller, Parent or Option Party of any of the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby or compliance by Seller, Parent or Option Party with or
fulfillment by Seller, Parent or Option Party of the terms, conditions and
provisions hereof or thereof will:

(i) conflict with, result in a breach of the terms, conditions or provisions
of, or constitute a default, an event of default or an event creating rights

Purchased Assets under, (A) the certificate of incorporation, bylaws or
organizational documents of such Person, (B) any Station Agreement, (C) any
Governmental Permit, (D) any judgment, order, award or decree to which such
Person is a party or any of the Purchased Assets is subject or by which such
Person is bound, (E) any statute, other law or regulatory provision affecting

governmental or regulatory authority or body, except for such of the foregoing
as are necessary pursuant to the HSR Act, applicable antitrust Laws or the
Communications Act and except, in any case, as would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

(d) Pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions of the Merger
Agreement, Belo has agreed to cause Sellers to take all actions required to be
taken by them under this Agreement. Pursuant to the terms of the Option
Exercise Agreement, the Option Party is obligated to take all actions
reasonably necessary or required by it to facilitate the sale and transfer of
the Option Assets to Buyer or Buyer's Qualified Assignee in accordance with
this Agreement. Complete and correct copies of the Option Agreement and the
Option Exercise Agreement, together with all amendments thereto, have
heretofore been delivered or made available to Buyer by Parent.

Section 3.4. Financial Statements. Schedule 3.4 contains (a) the unaudited
balance sheets of the Stations as of December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2012,
respectively, and the related statements of income for the years then ended
and (b) the unaudited balance 

sheets (the "Balance Sheet") of the Stations as of September 30, 2013 (the
"Balance Sheet Date") and the related unaudited monthly statements of income
for 2013 through the Balance Sheet Date. Except as set forth in Schedule 3.4,
each of such balance sheets and statements of income have been prepared in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles consistently applied
and present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position and
results of operations of the Stations as of their respective dates and for the
respective periods covered thereby subject to the absence of notes.

Section 3.5. Operations Since Balance Sheet Date.

(a) Except as set forth in Schedule 3.5(a), since the Balance Sheet Date,
there has been no change in the financial condition or the results of
operations of the Business which has had or would reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect.

(b) Except as set forth in Schedule 3.5(b), since the Balance Sheet Date the
Business has been conducted only in the ordinary course and in conformity with
past practice. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, since the
Balance Sheet Date, except as set forth in Schedule 3.5(b), each Seller and
Option Party has not, in respect of any Station, the Business or the Purchased
Assets:

(i) sold, leased, transferred or otherwise disposed of or mortgaged or
pledged, or imposed or suffered to be imposed any Encumbrance (other than
Permitted Encumbrances) on, any of the Purchased Assets, other than assets
that would not be material, individually or in the aggregate, to the Business
and assets sold or otherwise disposed of for fair value in the ordinary course
of the Business consistent with past practice;

(ii) acquired, or agreed to acquire (A) by merging or consolidating with, or
by purchasing all or a substantial equity or voting interest in any Person, or
(B) any assets that would be material, individually or in the aggregate, to
the Business and, with respect to clause (B), other than in the ordinary
course of the Business consistent with past practice;

(iii) created, incurred, guaranteed or assumed, or agreed to create, incur,
guarantee or assume, any indebtedness for borrowed money (other than money

Affiliates in the ordinary course of the Business consistent with past
practice) or entered into any capitalized leases other than in the ordinary
course of the Business consistent with past practice;

(iv) hired any employee other than in the ordinary course of the Business
consistent with past practice;

(v) terminated or cancelled any insurance coverage maintained by Belo, any
Seller or Option Party with respect to any material assets without replacing
such coverage with a comparable amount of insurance coverage, other than in
the ordinary course of the Business consistent with past practice; 

(vi) granted or instituted any increase in any rate of salary or compensation
or any profit sharing, bonus, incentive, deferred compensation, insurance,
pension, retirement, medical, hospital, disability, welfare or other employee
benefit plan other than in the ordinary course of the Business consistent with
past practices; or

(vii) entered into any agreement or made any commitment to take any action
described in subparagraphs (i) through (vi) above.

Section 3.6. No Undisclosed Liabilities. Except as set forth in Schedule 3.6,
to the Knowledge of Seller, no Seller or Option Party is subject, with respect
to the Business, to any liability (including, without limitation, unasserted
claims, whether known or unknown), whether absolute, contingent, accrued or
otherwise, which is not shown or reserved for in the Balance Sheet, other than
liabilities of the same nature as those set forth in the Balance Sheet and the
notes thereto and incurred in the ordinary course of the Business after the
Balance Sheet Date and those which have not had and would not, individually or
in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect.

Section 3.7. Taxes. Each Seller and Option Party, as applicable, has, in
respect of the Business, either filed or obtained extensions for filings
pursuant to established procedures all material foreign, federal, state,
county or local income, excise, property, sales, use, franchise or other Tax
returns and reports which are required to have been filed by Seller or such
Option Party, as applicable, under applicable law on or prior to the date of
this Agreement and has paid or made provision for the payment of all material
Taxes which have become due pursuant to such returns or pursuant to any
assessments which have become payable and which are not being contested in
good faith by appropriate proceedings. All such Tax returns filed were correct
and complete in all material respects. All material Taxes required to be
withheld by Seller or Option Party, as applicable, from employees of the
Business for income Taxes, social security and other payroll Taxes have been
collected or withheld, and either paid to the respective Governmental Bodies,
set aside in accounts for such purpose, or accrued, reserved against and
entered upon the books of Seller or such Option Party, as applicable. There is
no liability for Taxes arising out of the operation or ownership of the
Stations or the Business prior to Closing that could give rise to an
Encumbrance on the Purchased Assets in the hands of Buyer, excepting any
Permitted Encumbrance and excepting any Encumbrance arising as a result of
actions by Buyer or the failure of Buyer to perform its obligations under this
Agreement. None of the Purchased Assets is properly treated as owned by
Persons other than Seller or Option Party, as applicable, for Tax purposes.
There are no material disputes, claims, proceedings or other actions currently
pending or threatened in writing for the assessment or collection of Taxes
from Seller or Option Party, as applicable, with respect to the Business or
any of the Purchased Assets. Neither Seller nor Option Party, as applicable,
has requested or been granted an extension of time for filing any Tax return
with respect to the Business or the Purchased Assets which has not yet been
filed. Neither Seller nor Option Party, as applicable, has consented to extend
to a date later than the due date of this Agreement the time in which any Tax
attributable to the Business or the Purchased Assets may be assessed or
collected by any Tax authority. No claim has been made, to the Knowledge of
Seller, by a Tax authority in a jurisdiction where Seller or Option Party, as
applicable, does not file Tax returns claiming that such Person is or may be
subject to Taxes assessed by such jurisdiction, where either Seller or Option
Party, as applicable, has located any Purchased Asset, 

has any employee working with respect to the Business, has any sales with
respect to the Business, or otherwise conducts any business with respect to
the Business. Neither Seller nor Option Party is a party to or bound by any
Tax allocation or Tax sharing agreement that includes the Purchased Assets or
the Business. Neither Seller nor Option Party is a foreign person so that
Section 897 of the Code is not applicable to the purchase and sale of the
Purchased Assets.

Section 3.8. Sufficiency of Assets and Legality of Use. Except as set forth in
Schedule 3.8 and except for the Excluded Assets, the Purchased Assets (i)
constitute all the assets and properties whether tangible or intangible,
whether personal, real or mixed, wherever located, that are used primarily in
the operation of the Stations, (ii) are sufficient to conduct the operation of
the Stations in the manner in which the Stations are conducted on the date
hereof, and (iii) are in such good and serviceable condition (subject to
normal wear and tear) as is necessary for the conduct of the Business and the
operations of the Station as presently conducted.

Section 3.9. Governmental Permits; FCC Matters.

(a) As of the date of this Agreement, Seller and, as of the Closing Date,
Option Party, owns, holds or possesses all registrations, licenses, permits,
approvals and regulatory authorizations from a Governmental Body that are
necessary to entitle it to own or lease, operate and use the assets of the
Stations that it owns and to carry on and conduct the Business substantially
as conducted immediately prior to the date of this Agreement (herein
collectively called "Governmental Permits"), except for such Governmental
Permits as to which the failure to so own, hold or possess would not have a
Material Adverse Effect. Schedule 3.9(a) sets forth a list and brief
description of each material Governmental Permit applicable to the Stations,
including the Seller FCC Authorizations, held by Seller as of the date of this
Agreement. The Seller FCC Authorizations constitute all registrations,
licenses, franchises, permits issued by the FCC in respect of the Stations.

(b) Each Seller and Option Party has fulfilled and performed its obligations
under each of the Governmental Permits except, in each case and in the
aggregate, for noncompliance that has not had and could not, individually or
in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.
Each of the Governmental Permits is valid, subsisting and in full force and
effect and has not been revoked, suspended, canceled, rescinded or terminated,
other than those that, individually and in the aggregate, have not had and
could not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect.

(c) Each Station is being operated in all material respects in accordance with
the Seller FCC Authorizations and in compliance in all material respects with
the Communications Act and all other laws and published regulations, federal,
state and local, applicable to such Station. To the Knowledge of Seller, none
of Belo, Seller, Sander or Option Party has received any written notice of any
violation of the Seller FCC Authorizations or the Communications Act. There is
no material action or proceeding, other than actions or proceedings affecting
broadcast television stations generally, by or before the FCC currently
pending or, to the Knowledge of Seller, threatened to revoke, cancel, rescind,
modify or refuse to renew in the ordinary course any of the Seller FCC
Authorizations. There is not (i) pending, or, to the Knowledge of Seller,
threatened, any legal proceeding by or before the FCC to revoke, suspend,
cancel, rescind, terminate or materially adversely modify any Seller FCC
Authorization 

(other than, in the case of modifications, proceedings to amend the FCC rules
of general applicability) or (ii) issued or outstanding, by or before the FCC,
any (A) order to show cause, (B) notice of violation, (C) notice of apparent
liability or (D) order of forfeiture, in each case, against any of the
Stations, Belo, Sander or any Seller or Option Party with respect to any of
the Stations that has resulted or would reasonably be expected to result in
any action described in the foregoing clause (i) with respect to such Seller
FCC Authorizations. The Seller FCC Authorizations have been issued by the FCC
for full terms customarily issued by the FCC for each class of Station, and
with the terms expiring as indicated on Schedule 3.9(a), and the Seller FCC
Authorizations are not subject to any condition except for those conditions
appearing on the face of the Seller FCC Authorizations and conditions
applicable to broadcast licenses generally or otherwise disclosed in Schedule
3.9(a). Each Seller and Option Party has (i) paid or caused to be paid all FCC
regulatory fees due in respect of each Station, and (ii) timely filed all
material registrations and reports required to have been filed with the FCC
relating to the Seller FCC Authorizations.

(d) Except as disclosed in Schedule 3.9(d), to the Knowledge of Seller, there
are no facts or circumstances relating to Parent, Belo, Sander, Sellers or
Option Party, which would reasonably be expected to (i) result in the FCC's
refusal to grant the FCC Consent, (ii) materially delay the obtaining of the
FCC Consent, or (iii) cause the FCC to impose any material condition on its
granting of the FCC Consent. Except as disclosed in Schedule 3.9(d), none of
Parent, Belo, or Seller has any reason to believe that the FCC Applications
might be challenged or might not be granted by the FCC in the ordinary course
due to any fact or circumstance relating to Parent, any Seller, Option Party
or any Seller's or Option Party's operation of any of the Stations. To the
Knowledge of Seller, there are no facts or circumstances that would, under the
Communications Act or any other applicable Law, disqualify Seller or Option
Party, as applicable, as an assignor of the Seller FCC Authorizations with
respect to the Stations or as the owner and operator of the Stations.

This Section 3.9 does not relate to Governmental Permits for environmental,
health and safety, which are the subject solely of Section 3.22.

Section 3.10. Real Property; Real Property Leases.

(a) Schedule 3.10(a) contains a brief description of all real property owned
by Seller (the "Owned Real Property"). Subject to Permitted Encumbrances,
Seller has good and marketable fee simple title (free and clear of any
Encumbrances other than Permitted Encumbrances) to the Owned Real Property.

(b) Schedule 3.10(b) also sets forth a list of each material lease or similar
agreement under which any Seller or Option Party is lessee of, or holds or
operates, any real property owned by any third Person (collectively, the "Real
Property Leases" and the property leased under such Real Property is referred
to herein, together with the Owned Real Property, as the "Real Property").
Seller or Option Party, as applicable, enjoys, in all material respects,
peaceful and undisturbed possession of the leased premises under the Real
Property Leases.

(c) As of the date of this Agreement, neither the whole nor any part of the
Owned Real Property nor, to the Knowledge of Seller, any property leased by
any Seller under 

any Real Property Lease is subject to any pending or threatened suit for
condemnation or other taking by any public authority. Each Seller's or Option
Party's use and occupancy of the Real Property complies, in all material
respects, with all regulations, codes, ordinances and statutes of all
applicable Governmental Bodies.

Section 3.11. Personal Property Leases. Schedule 3.11 contains a list of each
lease or other agreement or right under which Seller or Option Party, as
applicable, is lessee of, or holds or operates, any machinery, equipment,
vehicle or other tangible personal property owned by a third Person and used
in or relating to the Business, except those which are terminable by Seller or
Option Party, as applicable, without penalty on thirty (30) days' notice or
less or which provide for annual rentals less than $50,000.

Section 3.12. Intellectual Property.

(a) Schedule 3.12(a) contains a list of all United States and foreign patents,
pending patent applications, trademark registrations, pending trademark
applications and domain names issued to, assigned to and filed by Seller or
Option Party, as applicable, used to identify any Station or otherwise used by
Seller or Option Party, as applicable, primarily in connection with the
Business.

(b) Except as disclosed in Schedule 3.12(b), to the Knowledge of Seller,
Seller or Option Party, as applicable, either: (i) owns the entire right,
title and interest in and to the items listed in Schedule 3.12(a), free and
clear of Encumbrances except for Permitted Encumbrances; or (ii) has the right
and license to use the same in the conduct of the Business.

(c) Except as disclosed in Schedule 3.12(c), to the Knowledge of Seller: (i)
all patents and registrations identified in Schedule 3.12(a) are in force, and
all applications identified in Schedule 3.12(a) are pending without challenge
(other than office actions that may be pending before the Patent and Trademark
Office or its foreign equivalents); (ii) the Intellectual Property owned by
Seller or Option Party, as applicable, and material to the conduct of the
Business is valid and enforceable; and (iii) Seller or Option Party, as
applicable, has the right to bring actions for infringement or unauthorized
use of the Intellectual Property owned by Seller or Option Party, as
applicable, and material to the conduct of the Business.

(d) Except as disclosed in Schedule 3.12(d), to the Knowledge of Seller: (i)
during the two (2) years prior to the date of this Agreement, no written claim
has been made or asserted that alleges the Intellectual Property owned by
Seller and material to the conduct of the Business infringes the Intellectual
Property of another Person; (ii) no litigation, arbitration or other
proceeding is currently pending with respect to the Intellectual Property
owned by Seller; and (iii) during the two (2) years prior to the date of this
Agreement, no written claim has been made or asserted that challenges the

material to the conduct of the Business.

Section 3.13. Accounts Receivable. All accounts receivable of Seller or Option
Party, as applicable, relating to the Business have arisen from bona fide
transactions in the ordinary course of the Business and, to the Knowledge of
Seller, constitute only valid claims which are not subject to counterclaims or
setoffs. 

Section 3.14. Title to Purchased Assets. Seller or Option Party, as

as to timing and amount with past practices, neither Seller nor Option Party
has, with respect to the Business: (i) increased the compensation payable or

normal annual salary increases consistent with past practice), (ii) increased
the amount payable to any of its employees upon the termination of such

Agreement, neither Parent, Belo, Sander nor any of their Affiliates shall
under any circumstance be obligated to divest any assets or businesses owned

any event within ninety (90) days, implement or cause to be implemented a

other disposition, or any prohibition of, or any limitation on, the
acquisition, ownership, operation, effective control or exercise of full

authority enforcing applicable antitrust, competition, communications or
broadcast Laws, any State Attorney General or other Governmental Body, (y) no
decree, judgment, injunction, temporary restraining order or any other order
in any suit or proceeding, and (z) no other matter relating to any antitrust
or competition Law or any communications or broadcast Law, would preclude
consummation of the Transactions by the Termination Date. If a Divestiture is
required in accordance with the foregoing, Parent shall, pursuant to the
Option Exercise Agreement, cause Sander and Option Party to take the actions
with respect to the Divestiture that they are required to take under this
Section 5.3 with respect to the Transactions and related applications and
filings. 

(e) In connection with the expiration of the Seller FCC Authorizations set
forth on Schedule 3.9(a) applicable to the Stations, Option Party shall file
prior to Closing if required one or more applications (the "Renewal
Applications") with the FCC requesting the renewal of certain Seller FCC
Authorizations pursuant to the Communications Laws. In order to avoid
disruption or delay in the processing of the FCC Applications, Buyer shall,
and shall cause its Affiliates and the Qualified Assignee to, agree (i) as
part of the FCC Applications, to request that the FCC apply its policy of
permitting the assignment of FCC licenses in transactions involving multiple
stations to proceed, notwithstanding the pendency of any application for the
renewal of any such FCC license, and (ii) to make such representations and
undertakings as are necessary or appropriate to invoke such policy, including
undertakings to assume, as between the parties and the FCC, the position of
the applicant before the FCC with respect to any pending Renewal Application
and to assume the corresponding regulatory risks relating to any such Renewal
Application, subject to the indemnification obligation set forth in Section
9.1(v). In addition, Buyer acknowledges that, to the extent reasonably
necessary to obtain the grant by the FCC of any Renewal Application with
respect to either Station and thereby to facilitate the grant of the FCC
Consent with respect to such Station, Option Party shall into a tolling,
assignment, or similar agreements (but shall not be required to enter into an
escrow agreement) with the FCC to extend the statute of limitations for the
FCC to determine or impose a forfeiture penalty against such Station in
connection with (i) any pending complaints that such Station aired programming
that contained obscene, indecent or profane material or (ii) any other
enforcement matters against such Station with respect to which the FCC may
permit Option Party to enter into a tolling, assignment, or similar
agreements. Buyer and Parent shall consult in good faith with each other prior
to Option Party entering into any such tolling agreement under this Section
5.3(e).

(f) Parent and Buyer shall each use reasonable efforts to obtain all consents
and amendments from the parties to the Station Agreements which are required
by the terms thereof or this Agreement for the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided, however, that neither
Parent nor Buyer shall have any obligation to offer or pay any consideration
in order to obtain any such consents or amendments; and provided, further,
that the parties acknowledge and agree that such third party consents are not
conditions to Closing, except for those certain third party consents
applicable to the Stations set forth on Schedule 5.3(f) (the "Required
Consents"). Parent shall not permit either the Option Agreement or the Option
Exercise Agreement to be amended or modified in any manner that would have the
effect of preventing or otherwise delaying the consummation of the
Transactions or would have the effect of modifying the obligations of Parent,
Sander or Option Party thereunder in a manner that would be inconsistent with
the consummation of the Transactions in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, in each such case, without obtaining consent of Buyer, which such
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

Section 5.4. Operations of the Stations Prior to the Closing Date.

(a) Prior to the Closing Date, except as approved by Buyer pursuant to Section
5.4(b), Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to enforce its rights
under the Merger Agreement and Option Exercise Agreement, as the case may be,

commercially reasonable efforts to operate and carry on the Business only in
the ordinary course consistent with past practice, continue to promote and

relations with the Business.

(b) Notwithstanding Section 5.4(a), and except as expressly contemplated by
this Agreement, except as set forth in Schedule 5.4(b) or except with the
express prior written approval of Buyer, Parent shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to enforce its rights under the Merger Agreement and Option
Exercise Agreement, as the case may be, to cause Sellers and Option Party to

Station:

in the aggregate;

(iii) make or authorize any new capital expenditures other than those set
forth in the budget provided to Buyer prior to the date hereof and capital
expenditures in excess of $500,000 in the aggregate;

pledge, or impose or suffer to be imposed any Encumbrance on, any of the

of the Business), except in the ordinary course of the Business;

(vii) guarantee, or otherwise become liable for, any material liability of any
third Person;

(viii) adopt, or institute any increase in, any profit sharing, bonus,
incentive, deferred compensation, insurance, pension, retirement, medical,
hospital, disability, welfare or other employee benefit plan with respect to
its employees, other than in the ordinary course of the Business or as
required by any such plan or Requirements of Law; 

(ix) other than in the ordinary course of Business or except as contemplated
by the Sander Agreement with respect to the Option Party, hire any employee
that would be an Affected Employee;

(x) make or change any material Tax election with respect to the Purchased
Assets, except in the ordinary course of the Business;

(xi) (A) fail to use all commercially reasonable efforts to maintain in full
force and effect in accordance with their respective terms and conditions, any
of the Seller FCC Authorizations, or to not take or fail to take any action
that could reasonably be expected to cause the FCC or any other Governmental
Authority to institute proceedings for the suspension, revocation or adverse
modification of any of the Seller FCC Authorizations in any material respect,
or (B) enter into any FCC consent decree with respect to any Station or any of
the Seller FCC Authorizations if such FCC consent decree would be binding on
the Stations after Closing or involves the payment of more than One Hundred
Thousand Dollars ($100,000);

(xii) enter into any new, or materially modify the terms of any existing,
Collective Bargaining Agreement (other than the renewal of any Collective
Bargaining Agreement in the ordinary course of the Business or any
modifications that would not reasonably be expected to result in a material

ordinary course of the Business;

than changes made in accordance with normal compensation practices and
consistent with past compensation practices; or

(xv) agree or commit to do any of the foregoing.

Section 5.5. Public Announcement. None of Parent, Seller, Option Party, Buyer
or any of their Affiliates shall, without the approval of the other, make any
press release or other public announcement concerning the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, except as and to the extent that any such
party shall be so obligated by law or by the rules, regulations or policies of
any national securities exchange or association, in which case the other party
shall be advised and the parties shall use reasonable efforts to cause a
mutually agreeable release or announcement to be issued.



Section 5.6. Transition of Station Out of Belo Group Agreements. 

(a) Buyer and Seller acknowledge that the agreements set forth in Schedule 5.6
relating to the Stations are Belo agreements that also cover other television
stations of Belo, and cannot be assigned to Buyer (the "Group Agreements"). As
such, to the extent not specifically addressed in the Schedules to this
Agreement, Buyer and Parent agree, and agree to cause their respective
Affiliates to, use commercially reasonable efforts to work together prior to
the Closing Date to arrange with the third parties to the Group Agreements to
(a) remove the Stations from the coverage of the Group Agreements as of the
Closing Date and (b) provide coverage for the Stations under separate
agreements between Buyer (or its Affiliates) or the Qualified Assignee, as
applicable, and such third parties.

(b) Parent, Sellers and Buyer shall cooperate with each other and provide
commercially reasonable assistance to each other, and Parent shall cause
Option Party, pursuant to the Option Exercise Agreement, to cooperate and
provide commercially reasonable assistance, to facilitate the transition of
the Business and operations and facilities of the Stations to Buyer effective
upon the Closing. To the extent necessary to complete the transition after the
Closing, this covenant shall continue after the Closing for up to ninety (90)
days at the request of any of the parties.

ARTICLE VI

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

Section 6.1. Taxes; Sales, Use and Transfer Taxes.

(a) Parent shall be liable for and shall pay all Taxes (whether assessed or
unassessed) applicable to the Business or the Purchased Assets, in each case
attributable to periods (or portions thereof) ending on or prior to the
Closing Date. Buyer shall be liable for and shall pay all Taxes (whether
assessed or unassessed) applicable to the Business or the Purchased Assets, in
each case attributable to periods (or portions thereof) beginning after the
Closing Date. For purposes of this Section 6.1(a), any period beginning before
and ending after the Closing Date (a "Straddle Period") shall be treated as
two partial periods, one ending on the Closing Date and the other beginning
after the Closing Date. Notwithstanding this Section 6.1(a), all real property
Taxes, personal property Taxes and similar ad valorem obligations levied with
respect to the Purchased Assets for any Tax period that includes (but does not
end on) the Closing Date shall be apportioned between Seller and, to the
extent applicable, Option Party, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other
hand, based on the number of days of such Tax period up to and including the
Closing Date and the number of days of such Tax period after the Closing Date,
and Seller shall be liable for the proportionate amount of such Taxes that is
attributable to the portion of the Tax period up to and including the Closing
Date, and Buyer shall be liable for the proportionate amount of such Taxes
that is attributable to the portion of the Tax period beginning after the
Closing Date.

(b) Any sales, use or other transfer Taxes payable by reason of transfer and
conveyance of the Business or the Purchased Assets hereunder and any
documentary stamp or transfer Taxes payable by reason of the real estate or
interests therein included in the Purchased Assets shall be borne by Parent
and Buyer equally. Except as expressly provided otherwise in this Agreement,
all fees relating to any filing with any Governmental Body required for
transfer 

and conveyance of the Purchased Assets hereunder, other than amounts owing to
any Governmental Body as of the date hereof or with respect to events
occurring prior to the date hereof, shall be borne by Parent and Buyer
equally. Seller, Option Party and Buyer shall cooperate in the preparation,
execution and filing of all Tax Returns, questionnaires, applications or other
documents regarding any such sales, use, documentary stamp or transfer Taxes
and any similar Taxes that become payable as a direct result of the
transactions contemplated hereby.

(c) Parent or Buyer, as the case may be, shall provide reimbursement for any
Tax paid by the other party all or a portion of which is the responsibility of
Parent or Buyer, as the case may be, in accordance with the terms of this
Section 6.1. Within a reasonable time prior to the payment of any said Tax,
the party paying such Tax shall give notice to the other party of the Tax
payable and the portion which is the liability of each party, although failure
to do so will not relieve the other party from its liability hereunder. Buyer
shall promptly notify Parent in writing upon receipt by Buyer or any of its
Affiliates of notice of any pending or threatened federal, state, local or
foreign Tax audits, examinations or assessments which may materially affect
the Tax liabilities for which Parent would be required to indemnify any Buyer
Group Member pursuant to this Section 6.1. Parent shall have the sole right to
control any Tax audit or administrative or court proceeding relating to
taxable periods ending on or before the Closing Date, and to employ counsel of
its choice at its expense. In the case of any Straddle Period, Parent shall be
entitled to participate at its expense in any Tax audit or administrative or
court proceeding relating in whole or in part to Taxes attributable to the
portion of such Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date and, with the
written consent of Buyer, and at Parent's sole expense, may assume the entire
control of such audit or proceeding. Neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates
may settle any Tax claim for any taxable year or period ending on or prior to
the Closing Date (or for the portion of any Straddle Period ending on the
Closing Date) which may be the subject of indemnification by Parent under this
Section 6.1 without the prior written consent of Parent, which consent may be
withheld in the sole discretion of Parent.

(d) Buyer acknowledges that each Seller intends that the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement qualify as a part of a tax-deferred, like-kind
exchange under Section 1031 of the Code. Buyer and each Buyer Group Member
acknowledge that each Seller, as it is to receive the cash consideration under
this Agreement as part of the Purchase Price, may wish to transfer a portion
or all of its respective Purchased Assets as part of a tax-deferred, like-kind
exchange as provided under Section 1031 of the Code. Buyer and each Buyer
Group Member agree to permit each Seller or one of their Affiliates to use a
"qualified intermediary" for this transaction as that term is used in Treasury
Regulations Section 1.1031(k)-1(g)(4) and/or an "exchange accommodation
titleholder" under IRS Revenue Procedure 2000-37, and otherwise to cooperate
with each Seller and their respective Affiliates to structure the sale as a
like-kind exchange, provided that none of Buyer or Buyer Group Members will be
required to incur any obligation, liability or expense with respect to any
such exchanges.

Section 6.2. Employees; Employee Benefit Plans.

(a) On the Closing Date, Buyer will offer employment to all of Seller's and
Option Party's employees as of the Closing Date (other than such employees
covered by collective bargaining agreements), including those on leave of
absence, whether short-term, family, maternity, short-term disability, long-
term disability, paid, unpaid or other (collectively, 

the "Affected Employees"), upon substantially the same terms and conditions
(other than benefit plans, as addressed in Section 6.2(c)) and with
substantially the same duties as in effect immediately preceding the Closing,
and by the Closing Date, Seller and Option Party, as applicable, will have
taken all necessary action to terminate the employment of any Affected
Employee. For a period ending no earlier than the first anniversary of the
Closing Date, Buyer shall not reduce the regular wages or salary, commission
rate, or target bonus opportunity of any Affected Employees as in effect on
the Closing Date that are employed by Buyer.

(b) Except as otherwise provided in this Section 6.2, the appropriate Seller
or Option Party or its Affiliates shall pay, discharge, and be responsible for
(i) all salary or wages, bonuses, commissions and other compensation arising
out of or relating to the employment of its employees prior to the Closing
Date and (ii) any employee benefits arising under the Employee Plans prior to
the Closing Date. From and after the Closing Date, Buyer shall pay, discharge
and be responsible for (i) all salary, wages, and benefits (including vacation
pay and sick leave pay) arising out of or relating to the employment of the
Affected Employees by Buyer on and after the Closing Date and (ii) all
severance liabilities for any of the Affected Employees.

(c) Buyer and the appropriate Seller or Option Party shall jointly give notice
to all Affected Employees that all benefits previously provided under Seller's
or Option Party's Employee Benefit Plans are discontinued on the Closing Date
and will be replaced by the benefit plans and other fringe benefits of Buyer
as set forth in Schedule 6.2(c) ("Buyer's Benefit Plans"). In no event shall
any Affected Employee be entitled to accrue any benefits under any employee
benefit plan or arrangement maintained by Belo, Parent, Seller or Option Party
after the Closing.

(d) For a period ending no earlier than the first anniversary of the Closing
Date, Buyer agrees to provide Affected Employees who agree to employment with
Buyer after the Closing Date with full participation in Buyer's Benefit Plans,
which are no less favorable in the aggregate than those currently offered by
Seller or its Affiliates to employees of Seller under the Employee Plans
disclosed on Schedule 3.21 (excluding any defined benefit pension plans). Such
Affected Employees shall be credited for their length of service with Belo,
Seller, Option Party, Buyer and Buyer's Affiliates, for all purposes under
Buyer's Benefit Plans (except for the purposes of benefit accruals under a
defined benefit plan), including but not limited to determining eligibility to
participate in, vesting of, and entitlement to, such benefits. In addition,
Buyer shall ensure that Affected Employees who agree to employment with Buyer
after the Closing Date receive credit for all purposes under Buyer's Benefit
Plans for any deductibles, co-payments or similar payments paid by such
Affected Employees and their dependents for the calendar year in which the
Closing Date occurs under a plan maintained by Belo, Seller, Option Party or
their Affiliates.

(e) [Reserved]

(f) Any preexisting condition clause in any Buyer Benefit Plan shall be waived
for the Affected Employees.

(g) Buyer shall be responsible for providing any employee of Seller or Option
Party whose "qualifying event," within the meaning of Section 4980B(f) of the
Code, occurs prior to, on or after the Closing Date (and such employees'
"qualified beneficiaries" within the 

meaning of Section 4980B(f) of the Code) with the continuation of group health
coverage required by Section 4980B(f) of the Code, and Buyer shall be
responsible for providing such coverage.

(h) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, for the one year period
following the Closing Date, Buyer shall provide to each Affected Employee with
severance benefits in amounts and on terms and conditions consistent with the
Severance Plan set forth in Schedule 6.2(h), with any such severance to be
determined based on the Affected Employee's base salary or regular hourly wage
as in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date (or any higher amount as in
effect thereafter) and taking into account the Affected Employee's continuous
service with Seller or Belo or Option Party (including any current or former
Affiliate of Belo or any predecessor of Belo) prior to the Closing Date and
with Buyer (or any of its Affiliates) after the Closing Date. Buyer shall
assume all liability for severance pay and similar obligations payable to any
Affected Employee who is terminated by Buyer after Closing or who makes any
claim for severance pay or any other severance benefits or rights as a result
of the Closing.

(i) On the Closing Date, Buyer shall assume and become bound by each of the
Collective Bargaining Agreements applicable to employees of the Stations. Each
employee of Seller or Option Party, as applicable, who as of immediately prior
to the Closing Date is covered by a Collective Bargaining Agreement shall be
offered employment and provided with compensation and benefits consistent with
the terms of the applicable Collective Bargaining Agreement in effect.

(j) After the Closing Date, Buyer shall have the liability and obligation for,
and neither Seller, Option Party or any of their Affiliates shall have any
liability or obligation for, short-term disability benefits, long-term
disability benefits or salary continuation for those Affected Employees who
are entitled to such benefits for claims.

(k) Buyer shall be responsible for, and indemnify and hold harmless the Seller
Group Members from, all liabilities or obligations under the Worker Adjustment
and Retraining Notification Act and any state law equivalent statutes
resulting from the Closing or from Buyer's actions following the Closing.

Nothing contained herein, expressed or implied, is intended to confer upon any
Affected Employee any right to continued employment for any period of time by
reason of this Agreement.

Section 6.3. Control of Operations Prior to Closing Date. Notwithstanding
anything contained herein to the contrary, the Closing shall not be
consummated prior to the grant by the FCC of the FCC Consent. Parent and Buyer
acknowledge and agree that at all times commencing on the date hereof and
ending on the Closing Date, neither Buyer, Parent, Seller nor any of their
respective employees, agents or representatives, directly or indirectly,
shall, or have any right to, control, direct or otherwise supervise, or
attempt to control, direct or otherwise supervise any of the management or
operations of any Station. 

Section 6.4. Bulk Transfer Laws. Buyer hereby waives compliance by Seller or
Option Party with the provisions of any so-called bulk sales or bulk transfer
law of any jurisdiction in connection with the sale of the Purchased Assets to
Buyer.

Section 6.5. Use of Names. Seller and Option Party are not conveying ownership
rights or granting Buyer a license to use any of the trade names or trademarks
of Seller, Belo, Parent or any their Affiliates (other than the trademarks
identified in Schedule 3.12(a) which are Purchased Assets) and, after the
Closing, Buyer shall not and shall not permit any of its Affiliates to use in
any manner the names or marks of Seller, Belo, Parent, Option Party or any of
their Affiliates or any word that is similar in sound or appearance to such
names or marks to the extent such names or marks are not Purchased Assets. In
the event Buyer or any Affiliate of Buyer violates any of its obligations
under this Section 6.5, Seller, Belo, Parent, Option Party and their
Affiliates may proceed against it in law or in equity for such damages or
other relief as a court may deem appropriate. Buyer acknowledges that a
violation of this Section 6.5 may cause Seller, Belo, Parent, Option Party and
their Affiliates irreparable harm which may not be adequately compensated for
by money damages. Buyer therefore agrees that in the event of any actual or
threatened violation of this Section 6.5, any of such parties shall be
entitled, in addition to other remedies that they may have, to a temporary
restraining order and to preliminary and final injunctive relief against Buyer
or such Affiliate of Buyer to prevent any violations of this Section 6.5,
without the necessity of posting a bond.

Buyer contained or referred to in this Agreement or any certificate delivered
by or on behalf of Buyer pursuant hereto;

(iii) any material breach by Qualified Assignee of, or any other failure of
Qualified Assignee to perform in any material respect, any of its covenants,
agreements or obligations in, or contemplated to be performed by Qualified
Assignee under, this Agreement or in any Ancillary Agreement (including the
Assignment and Assumption Agreement), or any failure or inability of Buyer in
any material respect to cause Qualified Assignee to take, or not take, any
action contemplated by or referred to in this Agreement or in any Ancillary
Agreement (including the Assignment and Assumption Agreement) to be taken, or
not taken, by Qualified Assignee (whether or not Buyer's covenant hereunder is
qualified by any efforts standard); or

(iv) the failure of Buyer to perform any of the Assumed Liabilities and,
except for claims in respect of which Parent is obligated to indemnify Buyer
pursuant to Section 9.1, Buyer's (or any successor's or assignee's) operation
of the Business and/or the ownership and/or use of the Purchased Assets after
the Closing Date.

provided, however, that Buyer shall not be required to indemnify and hold
harmless pursuant to clause (ii) with respect to Loss and Expense incurred by
Seller Group Members until, and then only to the extent that, the aggregate
amount of all such Loss and Expense exceeds $1,153,000; and, provided,
further, that the aggregate amount that Buyer shall be required to indemnify
and hold harmless pursuant to clause (ii) with respect to Loss and Expense
incurred by Seller Group Members shall not exceed $23,056,000. The
indemnification provided for in this Section 9.2 shall terminate one (1) year
after the Closing Date (and no claims shall be made by any Seller Group Member
under this Section 9.2 thereafter), except that the indemnification by Buyer
shall continue in any event as to:

(A) the representations and warranties in Sections 4.2(a) and 4.2(b), as to
which no time limitation shall apply other than the full period of any
applicable statute of limitations;

(B) the covenants of Buyer set forth in Sections 6.1, 6.2, 11.2 or 11.10, as
to all of which no time limitation shall apply other than the full period of
any applicable statute of limitations;

(C) any Loss or Expense incurred by any Seller Group Member in connection with
or arising out of the failure of Buyer to pay or perform any Assumed
Liabilities, as to which no time limitation shall apply; and 

(D) any Loss or Expense of which any Seller Group Member has notified Buyer in
accordance with the requirements of Section 9.3 on or prior to the date such
indemnification would otherwise terminate in accordance with this Section 9.2,
as to which the obligation of Buyer shall continue until the liability of
Buyer shall have been determined pursuant to this Article IX, and Buyer shall
have reimbursed all Seller Group Members for the full amount of such Loss and
Expense in accordance with this Article IX.

Section 9.3. Notice of Claims; Determination of Amount.

(a) Any Buyer Group Member or Seller Group Member seeking indemnification
hereunder (the "Indemnified Party") shall give promptly to the party obligated
to provide indemnification to such Indemnified Party (the "Indemnitor") a
written notice (a "Claim Notice") describing in reasonable detail the facts
giving rise to the claim for indemnification hereunder and shall include in
such Claim Notice (if then known) the amount or the method of computation of
the amount of such claim, and a reference to the provision of this Agreement
or any other agreement, document or instrument executed hereunder or in
connection herewith upon which such claim is based. The failure of any
Indemnified Party to give the Claim Notice promptly as required by this
Section 9.3 shall not affect such Indemnified Party's rights under this
Article IX except to the extent such failure is actually prejudicial to the
rights and obligations of the Indemnitor.

(b) In calculating any Loss or Expense there shall be deducted any insurance
recovery in respect thereof (and no right of subrogation shall accrue
hereunder to any insurer). Any indemnity payment hereunder with respect to any
Loss or Expense shall be calculated on an "After-Tax Basis," which shall mean
an amount which is sufficient to compensate the Indemnified Party for the
event giving rise to such Loss or Expense (the "Indemnified Event"),
determined after taking into account (1) all increases in federal, state,
local or other Taxes (including estimated Taxes) payable by the Indemnified
Party as a result of the receipt of the indemnity payment (as a result of the
indemnity payment being included in income, resulting in a reduction of tax
basis, or otherwise), provided, however, that the parties hereto agree to
report each payment made in respect of a Loss or Expense as an adjustment to
the Purchase Price for federal income Tax purposes, (2) all increases in
federal, state, local and other Taxes (including estimated Taxes) payable by
the Indemnified Party for all affected taxable years as a result of the
Indemnified Event and (3) all reductions in federal, state, local and foreign
Taxes (including estimated Taxes) payable by the Indemnified Party as a result
of the Indemnified Event. All calculations shall be made using reasonable
assumptions agreed upon by Parent and Buyer and, in the case of any present
value calculations, shall be made using the applicable federal rate in effect
at the time of the Indemnified Event (based on the Federal mid-term rate)
using semi-annual compounding plus two percentage points.

(c) After the giving of any Claim Notice pursuant hereto, the amount of
indemnification to which an Indemnified Party shall be entitled under this
Article IX shall be determined: (i) by the written agreement between the
Indemnified Party and the Indemnitor; (ii) by a final judgment or decree of
any court of competent jurisdiction; or (iii) by any other means to which the
Indemnified Party and the Indemnitor shall agree. The judgment or decree of a
court shall be deemed final when the time for appeal, if any, shall have
expired and no appeal 

shall have been taken or when all appeals taken shall have been finally
determined. The Indemnified Party shall have the burden of proof in
establishing the amount of Losses and Expenses suffered by it.

Section 9.4. Third Person Claims. (a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in Section 9.3, in order for a party to be entitled to any
indemnification provided for under this Agreement in respect of, arising out
of or involving a claim or demand made by any third Person against the
Indemnified Party, such Indemnified Party must notify the Indemnitor in
writing, and in reasonable detail, of the third Person claim within ten (10)
days after receipt by such Indemnified Party of written notice of the third
Person claim. Thereafter, the Indemnified Party shall deliver to the
Indemnitor, within five (5) Business Days after the Indemnified Party's
receipt thereof, copies of all notices and documents (including court papers)
received by the Indemnified Party relating to the third Person claim.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, should a party be physically served with a
complaint with regard to a third Person claim, the Indemnified Party must
notify the Indemnitor with a copy of the complaint within five (5) Business
Days after receipt thereof and shall deliver to the Indemnitor within seven
(7) Business Days after the receipt of such complaint copies of notices and
documents (including court papers) received by the Indemnified Party relating
to the third Person claim.

(a) In the event of the initiation of any legal proceeding against the
Indemnified Party by a third Person, the Indemnitor shall have the sole and
absolute right after the receipt of notice, at its option and at its own
expense, to be represented by counsel of its choice and to control, defend
against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with any proceeding, claim, or
demand which relates to any loss, liability or damage indemnified against
hereunder; provided, however, that the Indemnified Party may participate in
any such proceeding with counsel of its choice and at its expense. The parties
hereto agree to cooperate fully with each other in connection with the
defense, negotiation or settlement of any such legal proceeding, claim or
demand. To the extent the Indemnitor elects not to defend such proceeding,
claim or demand, and the Indemnified Party defends against or otherwise deals
with any such proceeding, claim or demand, the Indemnified Party may retain
counsel, reasonably acceptable to the Indemnitor, at the expense of the
Indemnitor, and control the defense of such proceeding. Neither the Indemnitor
nor the Indemnified Party may settle any such proceeding which settlement
obligates the other party to pay money, to perform obligations or to admit
liability without the consent of the other party, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld. After any final judgment or award shall have been
rendered by a court, arbitration board or administrative agency of competent
jurisdiction and the time in which to appeal therefrom has expired, or a
settlement shall have been consummated, or the Indemnified Party and the
Indemnitor shall arrive at a mutually binding agreement with respect to each
separate matter alleged to be indemnified by the Indemnitor hereunder, the
Indemnified Party shall forward to the Indemnitor notice of any sums due and
owing by it with respect to such matter and the Indemnitor shall pay all of
the sums so owing to the Indemnified Party by wire transfer, certified or bank
cashier's check within thirty (30) days after the date of such notice.

To the extent of any inconsistency between this Section 9.4 and Section
6.1(c), the provisions of Section 6.1(c) shall control.

Section 9.5. Limitations. 

(a) In any case where an Indemnified Party recovers from third Persons any
amount in respect of a matter with respect to which an Indemnitor has
indemnified it pursuant to this Article IX, such Indemnified Party shall
promptly pay over to the Indemnitor the amount so recovered (after deducting
therefrom the full amount of the expenses incurred by it in procuring such
recovery), but not in excess of any amount previously so paid by the
Indemnitor to or on behalf of the Indemnified Party in respect of such matter.

(b) Except for remedies that cannot be waived as a matter of law and
injunctive and provisional relief, if the Closing occurs, this Article IX
shall be the exclusive remedy for breaches of this Agreement (including any
covenant, obligation, representation or warranty contained in this Agreement
or in any certificate delivered pursuant to this Agreement) or any Buyer
Ancillary Agreement or Ancillary Agreement.

Section 9.6. No Special Damages; Mitigation. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, none of the parties hereto shall have
any liability under any provision of this Agreement for any punitive,
incidental, consequential, special or indirect damages, including loss of
future profits, revenue or income, diminution in value or loss of business
reputation or opportunity relating to the breach or alleged breach of this
Agreement, regardless of whether such damages were foreseeable, except to the
extent such damages are payable to a third party. Each of the parties agrees
to take all reasonable steps to mitigate their respective Losses and Expenses
upon and after becoming aware of any event or condition which could reasonably
be expected to give rise to any Losses and Expenses that are indemnifiable
hereunder.

ARTICLE X

TERMINATION

Section 10.1. Termination.

(a) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, this
Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Closing:

(i) by the mutual written consent of Parent and Buyer;

(ii) by Parent in the event of a breach by Buyer of any of its covenants,
agreements, representations or warranties contained in this Agreement or if
any of the representations or warranties of Buyer contained in this Agreement
shall have been inaccurate when made, and the failure of Buyer to cure such
breach within thirty (30) days after receipt of written notice from Parent
requesting such breach to be cured, in each case, except where the failure of
such representations and warranties to be true and correct (without giving
effect to any limitation as to "materiality" set forth in such representations
and warranties), or the failure to perform such covenants and agreements,
individually or in the aggregate, has not had and could not reasonably be
expected to have a Buyer Material Adverse Effect; 

(iii) by Buyer in the event of a breach by Seller or Parent of any of their
respective covenants, agreements, representations or warranties contained in
this Agreement or if any of the representations or warranties of Seller or
Parent contained in this Agreement shall have been inaccurate when made, and
the failure of Seller or Parent to cure such breach within thirty (30) days
after receipt of written notice from Buyer requesting such breach to be cured,
in each case, except where the failure of such representations and warranties
to be true and correct (without giving effect to any limitation as to
"materiality" or "Material Adverse Effect" set forth in such representations
and warranties), or the failure to perform such covenants and agreements,
individually or in the aggregate, has not had and could not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect;

(iv) by Parent or Buyer if any court of competent jurisdiction in the United
States or other United States Governmental Body shall have issued a final and
non-appealable order, decree or ruling permanently restraining, enjoining or
otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby;

(v) by Parent or Buyer, if (i) the Closing shall not have occurred on or
before 5:00 p.m., local New York time, on December 31, 2014 (the "Termination
Date") and (ii) the party seeking to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 10.01(a)(v) shall not have breached or failed to fulfill any of its
obligations under this Agreement which were the cause of, or resulted in, the
failure of the Closing to occur prior to such date; or

(vi) by Parent or Buyer upon the termination or expiration of the Merger
Agreement for any reason.

If the Closing shall not have occurred on or before 5:00 p.m., local New York,
New York time, on December 27, 2013, and if Parent is entitled to extend the
"Outside Date" under the Merger Agreement in accordance with its current
terms, Parent shall exercise its right to extend the "Outside Date" to the
same date as the Termination Date under this Agreement.

(b) In the event that this Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to this
Article X, all further obligations of the parties under this Agreement (other
than Sections 11.2 and 11.10) shall be terminated without further liability of
any party to the other; provided that nothing herein shall relieve any party
from liability for any breach of this Agreement.

Section 10.2. Withdrawal of Certain Filings. All filings, applications and
other submissions relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
as to which termination has occurred shall, to the extent practicable, be
withdrawn from the Governmental Authority or other Person to which made.

ARTICLE XI

GENERAL PROVISIONS

Section 11.1. Survival of Representations, Warranties and Obligations. All
representations, warranties, covenants and obligations contained in this
Agreement shall survive 

the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided,
however, that, except as otherwise provided in Article IX, the representations
and warranties contained in Articles III and IV of this Agreement shall
terminate one (1) year after the Closing Date. Except as otherwise provided
herein, no claim shall be made for the breach of any representation or
warranty contained in Article III or IV after the date on which such
representations and warranties terminate as set forth in this Section 11.1.

Section 11.2. Confidential Nature of Information. Each party agrees that it
will treat in confidence all documents, materials and other information which
it shall have obtained regarding the other party during the course of the
negotiations leading to the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby (whether obtained before or after the date of this Agreement), the
investigation provided for herein and the preparation of this Agreement and
other related documents, and, in the event the transactions contemplated
hereby shall not be consummated, each party will return to the other party all
copies of nonpublic documents and materials which have been furnished in
connection therewith. Without limiting the right of either party to pursue all
other legal and equitable rights available to it for violation of this Section
11.2 by the other party, it is agreed that other remedies cannot fully

that the aggrieved party shall be entitled to injunctive relief to prevent a
violation or continuing violation hereof.

Section 11.5. Successors and Assigns; Third Party Beneficiaries.

(a) This Agreement and all of its terms shall be binding upon and inure to the
benefit of the parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns,
including any successor by a merger or conversion referenced below. Except as
provided in this Section 11.5(a), this Agreement shall not be assigned by any
party hereto. Any party (including, for this purpose, any Seller) may assign
or transfer any of its rights under this Agreement to any of its Affiliates,
provided that no such assignment or transfer shall operate to relieve a party
of any of its liabilities or obligations hereunder. The parties acknowledge
that after the Merger Closing Date, with written notice to Buyer, Parent may
merge one or more of Sellers into Belo or an Affiliate of Belo or convert one
or more of Sellers from a corporation to a limited liability company. Pursuant
to Section 6.1(d), the parties intend that the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement qualify as a part of a tax-deferred, like-kind exchange under
Section 1031 of the Code. Buyer and the Qualified Assignee each acknowledges
that each of Sellers and Option 

Party, in that regard, is permitted to assign its rights, but not its
liabilities or obligations, under this Agreement, to one or more "qualified
intermediaries" for use in this transaction as that term is used in Treasury
Regulations Section 1.1031(k)-1(g)(4), and otherwise to cooperate with Sellers
and Option Party and their respective Affiliates to structure the sale as a
like-kind exchange, provided that Buyer and the Qualified Assignee will not be
required to incur any obligation, liability or expense with respect to any
such exchanges. Buyer shall assign Buyer's right to purchase the Designated
Station Assets (or any portion thereof), along with Buyer's obligation to
assume the Assumed Liabilities corresponding thereto, to the Qualified
Assignee pursuant to the Assignment and Assumption Agreement delivered
concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, which form of
agreement, together with the forms of agreement of any related transaction
documents between Buyer and the Qualified Assignee, shall be in substantially
the same forms as previously provided to Parent. Buyer shall not permit either
the Assignment and Assumption Agreement or any of such related agreements
between Buyer and its Qualified Assignee to be amended or modified in any
manner that would have the effect of preventing or otherwise delaying the
consummation of the Transactions or would have the effect of modifying the
obligations of Buyer or its Qualified Assignee thereunder in a manner that
would be inconsistent with the consummation of the Transactions in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement, in each such case, without obtaining consent
of Parent, which such consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.
Notwithstanding such permitted assignment, Buyer shall remain liable for all
of its obligations hereunder (including those assigned to such assignee),
including the payment of the Closing Date Payment pursuant to Section 2.8.

(b) This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the
parties hereto and their successors and permitted assigns. Except as expressly
provided in Article IX and Section 11.5(a), nothing in this Agreement,
expressed or implied, is intended or shall be construed to confer upon any
Person other than the parties and successors and assigns permitted by this
Section 11.5 any right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement.
For the avoidance of doubt, Belo, Seller and their Affiliates are not third-
party beneficiaries under this Agreement.

Section 11.6. Access to Records after Closing.

(a) For a period of six years after the Closing Date, Seller and its
representatives shall have reasonable access to all of the books and records
of the Business transferred to Buyer hereunder to the extent that such access
may reasonably be required by Seller in connection with matters relating to or
affected by the operations of the Business prior to the Closing Date. Such
access shall be afforded by Buyer upon receipt of reasonable advance notice
and during normal business hours. Seller shall be solely responsible for any
costs or expenses incurred by it pursuant to this Section 11.6(a). If Buyer
shall desire to dispose of any of such books and records prior to the
expiration of such six-year period, it shall, prior to such disposition, give
Seller a reasonable opportunity, at Seller's expense, to segregate and remove
such books and records as the other party may select.

(b) For a period of six years after the Closing Date, Buyer and its
representatives shall have reasonable access to all of the books and records
relating to the Business which Seller, Option Party or any of their Affiliates
may retain after the Closing Date. 

Such access shall be afforded by Seller, Option Party and their Affiliates
upon receipt of reasonable advance notice and during normal business hours.
Buyer shall be solely responsible for any costs and expenses incurred by it
pursuant to this Section 11.6(b). If Seller, Option Party or any of their
Affiliates shall desire to dispose of any of such books and records prior to
the expiration of such six-year period, such party shall, prior to such
disposition, give Buyer a reasonable opportunity, at Buyer's expense, to
segregate and remove such books and records as the other party may select.

Section 11.7. Entire Agreement; Amendments. This Agreement, the Exhibits and
Schedules referred to herein and the other documents delivered pursuant hereto
contain the entire understanding of the parties hereto with regard to the
subject matter contained herein or therein, and supersede all prior
agreements, understandings or intents between or among any of the parties
hereto. The parties hereto, by mutual agreement in writing, may amend, modify
and supplement this Agreement.

Section 11.8. Interpretation. Article titles and headings to Sections herein
are inserted for convenience of reference only and are not intended to be a
part of or to affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. The
Schedules and Exhibits referred to herein shall be construed with and as an
integral part of this Agreement to the same extent as if they were set forth
verbatim herein. For purposes of this Agreement, (i) the words "include,"
"includes" and "including" shall be deemed to be followed by the words
"without limitation," (ii) the word "or" is not exclusive and (iii) the words
"herein", "hereof", "hereby", "hereto" and "hereunder" refer to this Agreement
as a whole. Unless the context otherwise requires, references herein (a) to
Articles, Sections, Exhibits and Schedules mean the Articles and Sections of,
and the Exhibits and Schedules attached to, this Agreement and (b) to an
agreement, instrument or other document means such agreement, instrument or
other document as amended, supplemented and modified from time to time to the
extent permitted by the provisions thereof and by this Agreement. This
Agreement, the Buyer Ancillary Agreements and the Ancillary Agreements shall
be construed without regard to any presumption or rule requiring construction
or interpretation against the party drafting an instrument or causing any
instrument to be drafted. References to a "party hereto" or the "parties
hereto" or similar phrases shall refer to Parent and Buyer unless and until
Seller executes and delivers the Joinder Agreement on the Merger Closing Date.

Section 11.9. Waivers. Any term or provision of this Agreement may be waived,
or the time for its performance may be extended, by the party or parties
entitled to the benefit thereof. The failure of any party hereto to enforce at
any time any provision of this Agreement shall not be construed to be a waiver
of such provision, nor in any way to affect the validity of this Agreement or
any part hereof or the right of any party thereafter to enforce each and every
such provision. No waiver of any breach of this Agreement shall be held to
constitute a waiver of any other or subsequent breach.

Section 11.10. Expenses. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, each
of Seller and Buyer will pay all of its own respective costs and expenses
incident to its negotiation and preparation of this Agreement and to its
performance and compliance with all agreements and conditions contained herein
on its part to be performed or complied with, including the fees, expenses and
disbursements of its counsel and accountants. 

Section 11.11. Partial Invalidity. Wherever possible, each provision hereof
shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under
applicable law, but in case any one or more of the provisions contained herein
shall, for any reason, be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any
respect, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any
other provisions of this Agreement, and this Agreement shall be construed as
if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision or provisions had never
been contained herein.

Section 11.12. Execution in Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in
one or more counterparts, each of which shall be considered an original
instrument, but all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement,
and shall become binding when one or more counterparts have been signed by
each of the parties and delivered to each of Parent and Buyer.

Section 11.13. Disclaimer of Warranties. Neither Seller nor Parent makes any
representations or warranties with respect to any projections, forecasts or
forward-looking information provided to Buyer. There is no assurance that any
projected or forecasted results will be achieved. EXCEPT AS TO THOSE MATTERS
EXPRESSLY COVERED BY THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES IN THIS AGREEMENT AND
THE CERTIFICATES DELIVERED BY SELLER AND PARENT PURSUANT TO SECTION 8.1,
SELLER IS SELLING THE BUSINESS AND THE PURCHASED ASSETS ON AN "AS IS, WHERE
IS" BASIS AND SELLER AND PARENT DISCLAIM ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, REPRESENTATIONS
AND GUARANTIES WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. SELLER AND PARENT MAKE NO
REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY AS TO MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR
PURPOSE AND NO IMPLIED WARRANTIES WHATSOEVER. Buyer acknowledges that none of
Seller, Parent or any of their representatives or Affiliates nor any other
Person has made any representation or warranty, express or implied, as to the
accuracy or completeness of any memoranda, charts, summaries or schedules
heretofore made available by Buyer or its representatives or Affiliates to
Buyer or any other information which is not included in this Agreement or the
Schedules hereto, and none of Seller, Parent or any of their representatives
or Affiliates nor any other Person will have or be subject to any liability to
Buyer, any Affiliate of Buyer or any other Person resulting from the
distribution of any such information to, or use of any such information by,
Buyer, any Affiliate of Buyer or any of their agents, consultants,
accountants, counsel or other representatives.

Section 11.14. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH OF THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT
HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING
OR COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

Section 11.15. Specific Performance. The parties agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event that any provision of this Agreement was not
performed in accordance with its specific terms or was otherwise breached or
the Closing was not consummated, and that money damages would not be an
adequate remedy, even if available. It is accordingly agreed that the parties
shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions, or any other appropriate
form of specific performance or equitable relief, to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof
(including the parties' 

obligations to consummate the Closing) in any court of competent jurisdiction,
this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law
or in equity. Each of the parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting
of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief on the basis
that any other party has an adequate remedy at law or that any award of
specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or in
equity. Any party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of
this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement shall not be required to post any bond or other security in
connection with any such order or injunction.
