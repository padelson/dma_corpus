Bylaws.

the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries and except for any
Dissenting Shares), together with the Company Rights attached thereto or
associated therewith, shall, by virtue of this Agreement and without any
action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into and exchangeable
for the right to receive, at the election of the holder thereof as provided

Stock Consideration or (ii) cash in an amount equal to the Per Share
Consideration (the "Per Share Cash Consideration", and together with the Per

2   

     
   

  



  

Consideration").

  



  

For purposes of this Agreement:

  



  

"Aggregate Consideration" shall mean the sum of (x) the Total Stock
Consideration and (y) the Total Cash Amount.

  



  

"Deemed Stock Amount" shall mean the Total Common Stock Amount; provided,
however, that regardless of the actual number of shares of Company Common
Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, in no event shall
the Deemed Stock Amount exceed the sum of (i) 41,535,088, (ii) the aggregate
number of shares of Company Common Stock, if any, issued by the Company after
the Cut-off Time and prior to the date of this Agreement upon the exercise of
the Company Options outstanding as of the Cut-off Time and disclosed in
Section 3.2(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter in accordance with the terms
of such options and (iii) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common
Stock, if any, issued by the Company after the date of this Agreement and
prior to the Effective Time as permitted by Section 5.1(e).

  



  

"Exchange Ratio" shall mean the quotient, rounded to the nearest ten-
thousandth, obtained by dividing the Per Share Consideration by the Final

closing prices per share of Parent Common Stock as reported on the Nasdaq

"Total Cash Amount" shall mean the product obtained by multiplying (x) $8.15

(b) All of the shares of Company Common Stock, and associated Company
Rights converted into the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Article I
shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall
cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate (each a "Certificate")
previously representing any such shares of Company Common Stock shall

  



  

3   

     
   

  



  

thereafter cease to have any rights with respect to such securities, except
the right to receive (i) the Merger Consideration, (ii) any dividends and
other distributions in accordance with Section 2.1(c), and (iii) any cash to
be paid in lieu of any fractional share of Parent Common Stock in accordance
with Section 2.1(e).

  



  

(c) If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the shares
of Parent Common Stock shall be changed or proposed to be changed into a
different number or class of shares by reason of the occurrence of or record
date with respect to any reclassification, recapitalization, split-up,
combination, exchange of shares or similar readjustment, in any such case
within such period, or a stock dividend thereon shall be declared with a
record date within such period, appropriate adjustments shall be made to the
Per Share Cash Consideration and the Per Share Stock Consideration.

  



  

(d) At the Effective Time, all shares of Company Common Stock that are
owned directly or indirectly by Parent, Purchaser or the Company or any of
their respective Subsidiaries shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist and
no stock of Parent, cash or other consideration shall be delivered in
exchange therefor. All shares of Parent Common Stock that are owned by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall become authorized unissued stock of
Parent.

  



  

(e) Each issued and outstanding share of common stock, par value $0.01 per
share, of Purchaser issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be converted into and become one fully paid and nonassessable
share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving
Corporation.

  



  

(f) The calculations required by Section 1.6(a) shall be prepared by
Parent promptly after the Closing.

  



  

 **Section 1.7** **. Election Procedures.**

  



  

(a) An election form and other appropriate and customary transmittal
materials (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates theretofore representing shares of Company
Common Stock shall pass, only upon proper delivery of such Certificates to
the Exchange Agent) in such form as Parent shall specify and as shall be
reasonably acceptable to the Company (the "Election Form") shall be mailed
together with the Proxy Statement or at such other time as the Company and
Parent may agree (the "Mailing Date") to each holder of record of Company
Common Stock as of the close of business on the record date for notice of the
Company Special Meeting (the "Election Form Record Date").

  



  

(b) Each Election Form shall permit the holder (or the beneficial owner
through appropriate and customary documentation and instructions), other than
any holder of Dissenting Shares, to specify (i) the number of shares of such
holders Company Common Stock with respect to which such holder elects to
receive the Per Share Stock Consideration ("Stock Election Shares"), (ii) the
number of shares of such holders Company Common Stock with respect to which
such holder elects to receive the Per Share Cash Consideration ("Cash
Election Shares"), or (iii) that such holder makes no election with respect
to such holders Company Common Stock ("No Election Shares"). Any Company
Common Stock with respect to which the Exchange Agent has not received an
effective, properly completed Election Form on or before 5:00 p.m., Houston
time, on the 33rd day following the Mailing Date (or such other time and date
as the Company and Parent shall agree) (the "Election Deadline") (other than
any shares of Company Common Stock that constitute Dissenting Shares as of
such time) shall also be deemed to be "No Election Shares."

  



  

4   

     
   

  



  

(c) Parent shall make available one or more Election Forms as may reasonably
be requested from time to time by all Persons who become holders (or
beneficial owners) of Company Common Stock between the Election Form Record
Date and the close of business on the Business Day prior to the Election
Deadline, and the Company shall provide to the Exchange Agent all information
reasonably necessary for it to perform as specified herein.

  



  

(d) Any such election shall have been properly made only if the Exchange
Agent shall have actually received a properly completed Election Form by the
Election Deadline. An Election Form shall be deemed properly completed only
if accompanied by one or more Certificates (or customary affidavits
and indemnification regarding the loss or destruction of such Certificates or
the guaranteed delivery of such Certificates) representing all shares of
Company Common Stock covered by such Election Form, together with duly
executed transmittal materials included in the Election Form. Any Election
Form may be revoked or changed by the Person submitting such Election Form
prior to the Election Deadline. In the event an Election Form is revoked
prior to the Election Deadline, the shares of Company Common Stock
represented by such Election Form shall become No Election Shares and Parent
shall cause the Certificates representing Company Common Stock to be promptly
returned without charge to the Person submitting the Election Form upon
written request to that effect from the holder who submitted the Election
Form, except to the extent (if any) a subsequent election is properly made
with respect to any or all of the applicable shares of Company Common Stock.
Subject to the terms of this Agreement and of the Election Form, the Exchange
Agent shall have reasonable discretion to determine whether any election,
revocation or change has been properly or timely made and to disregard
immaterial defects in the Election Forms, and any good faith decisions of the
Exchange Agent regarding such matters shall be binding and conclusive. None
of Parent, Purchaser or the Exchange Agent shall be under any obligation to
notify any Person of any defect in an Election Form.

  



  

(e) Within ten Business Days after the Election Deadline, unless the
Effective Time has not yet occurred, in which case as soon after the
Effective Time as practicable (and in no event more than ten Business Days
after the Effective Time), Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to effect
the allocation among the holders of Company Common Stock of rights to receive
Parent Common Stock or cash in the Merger in accordance with the Election
Forms as follows:

  



  

(i) Cash Election Shares More Than Total Cash Amount. If the aggregate cash
amount that would be paid upon the conversion of the Cash Election Shares in
the Merger is greater than the Total Cash Amount, then:

  



  

(1) all Stock Election Shares and No Election Shares shall be converted into
the right to receive the Per Share Stock Consideration,

  



  

(2) the Exchange Agent shall then select from among the Cash Election Shares,
by a pro rata selection process, a sufficient number of shares
("Stock Designated Shares") such that the aggregate cash amount that will be
paid in the Merger equals as closely as practicable the Total Cash Amount,
and all Stock Designated Shares shall be converted into the right to receive
the Per Share Stock Consideration, and

  



  

(3) the Cash Election Shares that are not Stock Designated Shares will be
converted into the right to receive the Per Share Cash Consideration.

  



  

(ii) Cash Election Shares Less Than Total Cash Amount. If the aggregate cash

  



  

5   

     
   

  



  

amount that would be paid upon conversion of the Cash Election Shares in the
Merger is less than the Total Cash Amount, then:

  



  

(1) all Cash Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the
Per Share Cash Consideration,

  



  

(2) the Exchange Agent shall then select first from among the No Election
Shares and then (if necessary) from among the Stock Election Shares, by a pro
rata selection process, a sufficient number of shares ("Cash Designated
Shares") such that the aggregate cash amount that will be paid in the Merger
equals as closely as practicable the Total Cash Amount, and all
Cash Designated Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Per
Share Cash Consideration, and

  



  

(3) the Stock Election Shares and the No Election shares that are not Cash
Designated Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Per Share
Stock Consideration.

  



  

(iii) Cash Election Shares Equal to Total Cash Amount. If the aggregate cash
amount that would be paid upon conversion of the Cash Election Shares in the
Merger is equal to the Total Cash Amount, then subparagraphs (i) and
(ii) above shall not apply and all Cash Election Shares shall be converted
into the right to receive the Per Share Cash Consideration and all Stock
Election Shares and No Election Shares shall be converted into the right to
receive the Per Share Stock Consideration.

  



  

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, for purposes of
determining the allocations set forth in this Section 1.7(e), Parent shall
have the right, but not the obligation, to require that any shares of Company
Common Stock that constitute Dissenting Shares as of the Election Deadline be
treated as Cash Election Shares, although no such shares shall be subject to
any of the pro rata selection processes contemplated by this Section 1.7(e).

  



  

#### (f) The pro rata selection process to be used by the Exchange Agent
shall consist of such equitable pro ration processes as shall be mutually
determined by Parent and the Company.

#### **Section 1.8 ****Stock Options.** (a) At the Effective Time, each
option granted by the Company to purchase shares of Company Common Stock
(each a "Company Option") which was granted pursuant to any stock option
plan, program or arrangement of the Company as set forth on Section 3.2 the
Company Disclosure Letter (collectively, the "Company Option Plans"), that is
outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
cease to represent a right to acquire share of Company Common Stock, and
Parent shall assume each such Company Option (hereafter, "Assumed Option")
subject to the terms of the applicable Company Option Plan and the agreement
evidencing the grant thereunder of such Assumed Option; provided, however,
that the (i) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock purchaseable upon
such exercise of such Assumed Option shall be equal to the number of
shares of Company Common Stock that were purchasable under such Company
Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange
Ratio, and rounded to the nearest whole share, and (ii) the per share
exercise price under such Assumed Option shall be adjusted by dividing the
per share exercise price under such Company Option by the Exchange Ratio, and
rounding to the nearest whole cent, and (iii) such Assumed Option shall not
terminate if the holder ceases to be a director, officer or employee or
consultant of the Surviving Corporation or any of its affiliates (including
Parent and its Subsidiaries). In the case of any Assumed Option that is an
"incentive stock

#### option" (as defined in Section 422 of the Code), the exercise price, the
number of shares of Parent Common Stock purchasable pursuant to such Assumed
Option and the terms and conditions of exercise of such option shall be
determined in order to comply, to the fullest extent possible, with Section
424(a) of the Code. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall prepare and
file with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-8 (or other appropriate
form) registering all the shares of Parent Common Stock subject to the
Assumed Options, and such registration statement shall be kept effective (and
the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses required thereby shall
be maintained) as long as any Assumed Option remains outstanding.

 **Section 1.9 ****Dissenting Shares.** Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, with respect to each share of Company Common Stock
as to which the holder thereof shall have properly complied with the
provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL as to appraisal rights (each, a
"Dissenting Share"), if any, such holder shall be entitled to payment, solely
from the Surviving Corporation, of the appraisal value of the Dissenting
Shares to the extent permitted by and in accordance with the provisions of
Section 262 of the DGCL; provided, however, that (i) if any holder of
Dissenting Shares, under the circumstances permitted by and in accordance
with the DGCL, affirmatively withdraws his demand for appraisal of such
Dissenting Shares, (ii) if any holder of Dissenting Shares fails to establish
his entitlement to appraisal rights as provided in the DGCL or (iii) if any
holder of Dissenting Shares takes or fails to take any action the consequence
of which is that such holder is not entitled to payment for his shares under
the DGCL, such holder or holders (as the case may be) shall forfeit the right
to appraisal of such shares of Company Common Stock and such shares of
Company Common Stock shall thereupon cease to constitute Dissenting Shares
and if such forfeiture shall occur following the Election Deadline, each such
share of Company Common Stock shall thereafter be deemed to have
been converted into and to have become, as of the Effective Time, the right
to receive, without interest thereon, the Per Share Stock Consideration;
provided that Parent shall be entitled to convert each such share into the
right to receive the Per Share Cash Consideration or a combination of the Per
Share Cash Consideration and Per Share Stock Consideration if Parent shall
have received an opinion from Thompson and Knight, LLP stating that the Merger
shall not fail to satisfy the continuity of interest requirement under
Section 368 of the Code as a result thereof. The Company shall give Parent
prompt notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of shares
of Company Common Stock, and Parent shall have the right to participate in
all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. The Company
shall not settle, make any payments with respect to, or offer to settle, any
claim with respect to Dissenting Shares without the written consent of
Parent.

  



  

 **ARTICLE II**

  



  

 **EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES**

  



  

 **Section 2.1 ****Exchange of Certificates.**

  



  

(a)  _Exchange Agent._ Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit,
or shall cause to be deposited, with a bank or trust company designated by
Parent and reasonably satisfactory to the Company (the "Exchange Agent"), for
the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock, for exchange
in accordance with this Article II, through the Exchange Agent,
sufficient cash and certificates representing shares of Parent Common Stock
to make pursuant to this Article II all deliveries of cash and Parent Common
Stock as is required by Article I. Parent agrees to make available to
the Exchange Agent, from time to time as needed, cash sufficient to pay any
dividends and other distributions pursuant to Section 2.1(c) and to make
payments in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.1(e). The
Exchange Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable

  



  

7   

     
   

  



  

instructions, deliver the Merger Consideration contemplated to be paid for
shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement out of the Exchange
Fund. Except as contemplated by Sections 2.1(c) and 2.1(e), the Exchange Fund
shall not be used for any other purpose. Any cash and certificates
representing Parent Common Stock deposited with the Exchange Agent (including
as payment for fractional shares in accordance with Section 2.1(e) and any
dividends or other distributions in accordance with Section 2.1(c)) shall
hereinafter be referred to as the "Exchange Fund."

  



  

(b)  _Exchange Procedures._ Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent
shall instruct the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of a
Certificate or Certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (i) a letter of
transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of
the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in customary form and
subject to the reasonable approval of the Company prior to the Effective
Time) and (ii) instructions for its use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration payable in respect of
the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificates. Upon
surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent together
with such letter of transmittal, properly completed and duly executed, and
such other documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the
holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor
(A) one or more shares of Parent Common Stock (which shall be in
uncertificated book-entry form unless a physical certificate is requested)
representing, in the aggregate, the whole number of shares of Parent Common
Stock, if any, that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section
1.6 (after taking into account all shares of Company Common Stock previously
represented by all Certificates then held by such holder) and (B) a check in
the amount equal to the cash portion of the Merger Consideration, if any,
that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 1.6 and this
Article II, including cash payable in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.1(e) and dividends and other distributions
pursuant to Section 2.1(c). No interest shall be paid or accrued on any
Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of fractional shares or on any unpaid
dividends and distributions payable to holders of Certificates. In the event
of a transfer of ownership of shares of Company Common Stock which is not
registered in the transfer records of the Company, the Merger Consideration
payable in respect of such shares of Company Common Stock may be paid to a
transferee if the Certificate representing such shares of Company Common
Stock is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents
required to evidence and effect such transfer and the Person requesting such
exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent in advance any transfer or
other Taxes required by reason of the delivery of the Merger Consideration in
any name other than that of the registered holder of the Certificate
surrendered, or required for any other reason, or shall establish to the
satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not
payable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.1, each
Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent
only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration
payable in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such
Certificate, cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to
which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.1(e) and any dividends or
other distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section
2.1(c).

  



  

(c)  _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares of Parent Common
Stock._  No dividends or other distributions declared or made with respect to
shares of Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time
shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to
the shares of Parent Common Stock that such holder would be entitled to
receive upon surrender of such Certificate and no cash payment in lieu of
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be paid to any such holder
until such holder shall surrender such

  



  

8   

     
   

  



  

Certificate in accordance with this Section 2.1. Following surrender of any
such Certificate, there shall be paid to such holder of shares of Parent
Common Stock issuable in exchange therefor, without interest, (a) promptly
after the time of such surrender, the amount of dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid
with respect to such shares of Parent Common Stock, and (b) at the
appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with
a record date after the Effective Time but prior to such surrender and a
payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such shares
of Parent Common Stock. For purposes of dividends or other distributions in
respect of shares of Parent Common Stock, all shares of Parent Common Stock
to be issued pursuant to the Merger shall be entitled to dividends pursuant
to the immediately preceding sentence as if such shares of Parent Common
Stock were issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time.

  



  

(d)  _Further Rights in Company Common Stock._ The Merger Consideration
issued upon conversion of a share of Company Common Stock in accordance with
the terms hereof (including any payments made pursuant to Section 2.1(c) or
Section 2.1(e)) shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of
all rights pertaining to such share of Company Common Stock.

  



  

(e)  _Fractional Shares._ No certificates or scrip or shares of Parent
Common Stock representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock or book-
entry credit of the same shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange
of Certificates, and such fractional share interests will not entitle the
owner thereof to vote or to have any rights as a holder of any shares of
Parent Common Stock.

  



  

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of shares
of Company Common Stock exchanged pursuant to the Merger who would otherwise
have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock
(after taking into account all Certificates delivered by such holder) shall
receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without interest) in an amount equal to the
product of (i) the average of the closing sale prices of Parent Common Stock
on Nasdaq as reported by The Wall Street Journal for the five trading days
immediately preceding the date on which the Effective Time shall occur and
(ii) the fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock which such holder would
otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to Section 1.6. As promptly as
practicable after the determination of the amount of cash, if any, to be paid
to holders of fractional interests, the Exchange Agent shall so notify
Parent, and Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
deposit such amount with the Exchange Agent and shall cause the Exchange
Agent to forward payments to such holders of fractional interests subject to
and in accordance with the terms hereof. The parties acknowledge that payment
of cash consideration in lieu of issuing fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock was not separately bargained for consideration but merely represents a
mechanical rounding off for purposes of simplifying the corporate and
accounting problems that would otherwise be caused by the issuance of
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock.

  



  

(f)  _Termination of Exchange Fund._ Any portion of the Exchange Fund
which remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock for six
months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent upon demand and,
from and after such delivery to Parent, any holders of Company Common Stock
who have not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look
only to Parent, as a general creditor thereof, for the Merger Consideration
payable in respect of such shares of Company Common Stock, any cash in lieu
of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which they are entitled
pursuant to Section 2.1(e) and any dividends or other distributions with
respect to Parent Common Stock to which they are entitled pursuant to Section
2.1(c), in each case, without any interest thereon.

  



  

9   

     
   

  



  

(g)  _No Liability._ Neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall
be liable to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any such shares
of Parent Common Stock (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto)
or cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to
any abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

  



  

(h)  _Lost Certificates._ If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen
or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as
Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it
with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall pay in exchange
for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration
payable in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such
Certificate, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to
which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to Section 2.1(e) and any
dividends or other distributions to which the holders thereof are entitled
pursuant to Section 2.1(c), in each case, without any interest thereon.

  



  

(i)  _Withholding._ Each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the
Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of
Company Common Stock such amounts as Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the
Exchange Agent is required to deduct and withhold under the Code or any
provision of state, local, or foreign Tax Law, with respect to the making of
such payment. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder
of Company Common Stock in respect of whom such deduction and withholding was
made by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent, as the case
may be.

  



  

 **Section 2.2 ****Stock Transfer Books.** At the Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be
no further registration of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock
theretofore outstanding on the records of the Company. From and after the
Effective Time, any Certificates presented to the Exchange Agent or Parent
for any reason shall be converted into the Merger Consideration payable in
respect of the shares of Company Common Stock previously represented by such
Certificates, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to
which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to Section 2.1(e) and any
dividends or other distributions to which the holders thereof are entitled
pursuant to Section 2.1(c), without any interest thereon.

  



  

 **ARTICLE III**

  



  

 **REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY**

  



  

Except as set forth in the disclosure letter delivered by the Company to
Parent at or prior to the execution and delivery of this Agreement (the
"Company Disclosure Letter") (each section of which qualifies the
correspondingly numbered representation, warranty or covenant to the extent
specified therein and such other representations, warranties or covenants to
the extent a matter in such section is disclosed in such a way as to make its
relevance to such other representation, warranty or covenant reasonably
apparent), the Company represents and warrants to Parent and Purchaser as
follows:

  



  

 **Section 3.1 ****Organization.**

  



  

(a) Each of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries is a corporation or
other entity duly

properties and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted.

  



  

(b) Each of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries is duly qualified or
licensed to do business as a foreign corporation and is in good standing in
each jurisdiction in which such qualification or licensing is required,
except where the failure to be so qualified or licensed individually or in
the aggregate has not had, and would not be reasonably likely to have or
result in, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

  



  

(c) The Company has previously delivered to Parent a complete and correct
copy of each of its certificate of incorporation and bylaws in each case as
amended (if so amended) to the date of this Agreement, and has made available
the certificate of incorporation, bylaws or other organizational documents of
each of its Subsidiaries, in each case as amended (if so amended) to the date

limiting or otherwise restricting the ability of the Company to control its
Subsidiaries in any material respect.

  



  

 **Section 3.2 ****Capitalization.**

  



  

(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 60,000,000 shares
of the common stock of the Company, par value $.01 per share (the "Company
Common Stock") and 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $.01 per
share (the "Company Preferred Stock"). As of the close of business on March
31, 2005 (the "Cut-off Time"), (i) 41,535,088 shares of Company Common Stock
were issued and outstanding, and (ii) 5,832,715 shares of Company Common
Stock were reserved for issuance upon the exercise of outstanding Company
Options. From the Cut-off Time to the date of this Agreement, no additional
shares of Company Common Stock have been issued (other than pursuant to
Company Options which were outstanding as of the Cut-off Time and are
disclosed in Section 3.2(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter as contemplated
below), no additional Company Options have been issued or granted, and there
has been no increase in the number of shares of Company Common Stock issuable
upon exercise of the Company Options from those issuable under such Company
Options as of the Cut-off Time. As of the date of this Agreement, (i) 389,323
shares of Company Common Stock are held in the treasury of the Company, and
(ii) there are no shares of Company Preferred Stock issued and outstanding or

exchangeable for securities having the right to vote) on any matters on which
stockholders of the Company may vote are issued or outstanding. All issued
and outstanding shares of the Companys capital stock are, and all shares
that may be issued or granted pursuant to the exercise of Company Options
will be, when issued or granted in accordance with the respective terms
thereof, duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable and
free of preemptive rights, with no personal liability attaching to the
ownership thereof. Except for the Company Options and the Company Series A
Preferred Stock purchase rights (the "Company Rights") issued pursuant to the
Rights Agreement, dated as of September

12, 1997, between the Company and American Stock Transfer and Trust Company, as
amended to date (the "Company Rights Agreement"), there are no outstanding or
authorized (x) options, warrants, preemptive rights, subscriptions, calls or
other rights, convertible securities, agreements, stock appreciation rights,
phantom equity or other claims or commitments of any character (including

equity interest in the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or securities
convertible into or exchangeable for such shares or equity interests, (y)
contractual obligations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to

Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party with respect to the voting of
the capital stock of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Section 3.2(a)

respect to each Company Option outstanding as of the Cut-off Time: (i) name
of the holder; (ii) number of shares of Company Common Stock issuable upon
exercise thereof; (iii) exercise price; (iv) issue date; (v) termination
date; and (vi) whether such option contains any put, redemption or similar
feature. At the Effective Time, there will not be any outstanding
subscriptions, options, warrants, calls, preemptive rights, subscriptions, or
other rights, convertible or exchangeable securities, agreements, claims or
commitments of any character by which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
will be bound calling for the purchase or issuance of any shares of the
capital stock of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or securities
convertible into or exchangeable for such shares or any other such securities
or agreements. No additional shares shall be issued and all necessary action
has been take to render the Company Rights inapplicable to the Merger.

  



  

(b) (i) All of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock (or
equivalent equity interests of entities other than corporations) of each of
the Companys Subsidiaries are owned, directly or indirectly, by the Company
free and clear of any Liens, other than statutory Liens for Taxes not yet due
and payable and such other restrictions as may exist under applicable Law,
and all such shares or other ownership interests have been duly authorized,
validly issued and are fully paid and non-assessable and free of preemptive
rights, with no personal liability attaching to the ownership thereof, and
(ii) neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries owns any shares of
capital stock or other securities of, or interest in, any other Person,
except for (A) shares of capital stock or other securities of non-affiliates
that (x) do not constitute more than a 5% interest in such non-affiliates or
(y) have an aggregate value (per issuer) that does not exceed $100,000 and
(B) the securities of the Subsidiaries of the Company. Neither the Company
nor any Subsidiary of the Company is obligated to make any capital
contribution to or other investment in any other Person.

  



  

(c) No material indebtedness of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
contains any restriction upon (i) the prepayment of any indebtedness of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) the incurrence of indebtedness by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or (iii) the ability of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries to grant any Lien on the properties or assets of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

Purchaser, is a valid and binding obligation of the Company enforceable
against the Company in accordance with its terms, except as such enforcement
may be subject to or limited by (i) bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar
Laws, now or hereafter in effect, affecting creditors rights generally and
(ii) the effect of general principles of equity (regardless of whether
enforceability is considered in a proceeding at law or in equity).

  



  

(b) The Company Board has adopted such resolutions as are necessary so that
the provisions of Section 203 of the DGCL are inapplicable to the Merger
or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Except for
Section 203 of the DGCL (which has been rendered inapplicable), to the
knowledge of the Company, no "moratorium," "control share," "fair price" or
other antitakeover Laws are applicable to the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

 **Section 3.4 ****No Violations; Consents and Approvals.**

  



  

(a) Neither the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by
the Company nor the consummation by the Company of the Merger or any

default) under, result in the termination of or a right of termination,
cancellation or amendment under, accelerate the performance required by, or
result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the respective properties or
assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under, or result in the
acceleration or trigger of any payment, time of payment, vesting or increase
in the amount of any compensation or benefit payable pursuant to, any of the
terms, conditions or provisions of any note, bond, mortgage, indenture,
guarantee, other evidence of indebtedness, lease, license, contract,
collective bargaining agreement, agreement or other legally binding
instrument or obligation to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a
party or by which any of them or any of their respective assets or properties
may be bound, or (iii) conflict with or violate any federal, state, local or
foreign order, writ, injunction, judgment, settlement, award, decree,
statute, law, rule or regulation (collectively, "Laws") applicable to the
Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or
assets; except in the case of clause (iii), for such conflicts, violations,
breaches, defaults or Liens which individually or in the aggregate have not
had, and would not be reasonably likely to have or result in, a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company.

  



  

(b) No material filing or registration with, declaration or notification to,
or order, authorization, consent or approval of, any federal, state, local
or foreign court, arbitral, legislative, executive or regulatory authority
or agency (a "Governmental Entity") or any other Person is required in
connection with the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by

transactions contemplated hereby, except for (i) the filing with the SEC of
the Proxy Statement in definitive form relating to the meetings of the
Companys and Parents stockholders to be held in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, and the filing and
declaration of effectiveness of the registration statement on Form S-4 (the
"S-4") in which the Proxy Statement

  



  

13   

     
   

  



  

will be included as a prospectus, (ii) the adoption of this Agreement and the
approval of the Merger by the Company Required Vote, (iii) such filings,
authorizations or approvals as may be required under (A) the Hart-Scott-
Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and the rules and
regulations thereunder ("HSR Act") or (B) any other Competition Laws, rules
or regulations, (iv) the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the
Secretary of State and (v) such consents, approvals, orders, authorizations,
notifications, registrations, declarations and filings (x) as are customarily
made or obtained in connection with the transfer of interests in or change of
control of ownership of oil and gas properties and (y) the failure of which
to be obtained or made, individually or in the aggregate, has not had, and
would not be reasonably likely to have or result in, a Material Adverse
Effect on the Company or materially impair the ability of the Company to
perform its obligations under this Agreement.

  



  

 **Section 3.5 ****SEC Reports and Financial Statements.**

  



  

(a) The Company has timely filed with the SEC all forms and other
documents (including exhibits and other information incorporated therein)
required to be filed by it since January 1, 2002 (such documents, the

financial statements and schedules provided therein or incorporated by
reference therein, (x) did not contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading and (y) complied in
all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities

the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and the rules and regulations promulgated

(b) The December 31, 2004 consolidated balance sheet of the Company and
the related consolidated statements of income, changes in stockholders

that term is defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA or (iii) benefits, the full
direct cost of which is borne by the current or former employee (or

payments due thereunder have been properly and timely paid and there is no
existing

default (or event that, with notice or lapse of time or both, would become a
default) under any of such oil and gas leases or other agreements, except, in
each case, as individually or in the aggregate has not had, and would not be

deferred compensation, incentive compensation, stock purchase, stock option,
stock appreciation right or other equity-based incentive, severance,
termination, change in control, retention, employment, hospitalization or

35   

     
   

  



  

compensation or benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement, sponsored,
maintained or contributed to by Parent, any of its Subsidiaries or by any
trade or business, whether or not incorporated (a "Parent ERISA Affiliate"),
that together with Parent or any of its Subsidiaries would be deemed a
"single employer" within the meaning of Section 4001(b) of ERISA, or to which
Parent or a Parent ERISA Affiliate is party, whether written or oral, for the
benefit of any current or former officer, employee or director of Parent, any
of its Subsidiaries or any Parent ERISA Affiliate (the "Parent Plans"). In
this Section 4.9, "80%" shall be substituted for "50%" in the definition of
"Subsidiary" set forth in Section 8.5. Section 4.9(a) of the Parent
Disclosure Letter contains the name of the Parents ERISA Affiiates.

  



  

(b) With respect to each Parent Plan, Parent has heretofore delivered to
the Company complete and correct copies of each of the following
documents (including all amendments to such documents), as applicable:

  



  

(i) the Parent Plan or a written description of any Parent Plan not
in writing;

  



  

(ii) a copy of the most recent annual report or Internal Revenue Service Form
5500 Series, including all related reports required therewith;

  



  

(iii) a copy of the most recent Summary Parent Plan Description
("Parent SPD"), together with all Summaries of Material Modification issued
with respect to such Parent SPD and all other material employee
communications relating to each Parent Plan distributed by Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries from December 31, 2004 to the date of this Agreement;

  



  

(iv) if the Parent Plan or any obligations thereunder are funded through a
trust or any other funding vehicle or through insurance, the trust or other
funding agreement and the latest financial statements thereof or evidence of
insurance coverage thereof;

  



  

(v) all contracts relating to the Parent Plan with respect to which Parent or
any Parent ERISA Affiliate may have any material liability,
including insurance contracts, investment management agreements, subscription
and participation agreements and record keeping agreements;

  



  

(vi) if the Parent Plan is intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the
Code, the most recent determination letter received from the Internal Revenue

(vii) all material communications between Parent or any Parent
ERISA Affiliate and any Governmental Entity.

  



  

(c) No Parent Plan in effect as of the date hereof is subject to Title IV or
Section 302 of ERISA. No liability under Title IV or Section 302 of ERISA
has been incurred by Parent or any Parent ERISA Affiliate that has not been
satisfied in full, and no condition exists that would be reasonably likely to
result in Parent or any Parent ERISA Affiliate incurring any such liability.
Insofar as the representation made in this Section 4.9(c) applies to Sections
4064, 4069 or 4204 of Title IV of ERISA, such representation is made with
respect to any employee benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement

ending on the last day of the most recent plan year ended prior to the
Closing Date.

  



  

(d) None of Parent, any Parent ERISA Affiliate, any of the Parent Plans, any
trust created

  



  

36   

     
   

  



  

thereunder and, to the knowledge of Parent, any trustee or administrator
thereof has engaged in a transaction or has taken or failed to take any
action with respect to a Parent Plan in connection with which Parent, any of
its Subsidiaries or any Parent ERISA Affiliate would be reasonably likely to
be subject to a material civil penalty assessed pursuant to Section 409 or
502(i) of ERISA or a Tax imposed pursuant to Section 4975(a) or (b), 4976 or
4980B of the Code.

  



  

(e) All contributions required to be made by Parent and its ERISA Affiliates
with respect to any Parent Plan on or prior to the Closing Date have been
timely made or are reflected on the consolidated balance sheet of Parent
dated as of December 31, 2004 contained in the Specified Parent SEC
Documents. Since December 31, 2004, there has been no amendment to, written
interpretation of or announcement (whether or not written) by Parent or any
Parent ERISA Affiliate relating to, or change in the terms of employee
participation or coverage under, any Parent Plan that would increase
materially the expense of maintaining such Parent Plan above the level of
expense incurred in respect thereof for the most recent fiscal year
ended prior to the date hereof.

  



  

(f) Each of the Parent Plans has been operated and administered by Parent and
its ERISA Affiliates in all material respects in accordance with applicable
Laws, including ERISA and the Code.

  



  

(g) With respect to each of the Parent Plans that is intended to be
"qualified" within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code, Parent has
received a currently effective determination letter from the IRS stating that
it is so qualified, such letter has not been revoked, and, to the knowledge
of Parent, no event has occurred that would be reasonably likely to affect
such qualified status. No fund established under a Parent Plan is intended
to satisfy the requirements of Section 501(c)(9) of the Code.

  



  

(h) No amounts payable under the Parent Plans as a result of the
transactions contemplated hereby will fail to be deductible for federal
income Tax purposes by virtue of Sections 280G or 162(m) of the Code.

  



  

(i) No Parent Plan provides death, medical, hospitalization or similar
benefits (whether or not insured) with respect to any current or former
employee of Parent, its Subsidiaries or any Parent ERISA Affiliate after
retirement or other termination of service, other than (i) coverage mandated
by applicable Law, (ii) death benefits under any "employee pension plan," as
that term is defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA or (iii) benefits, the full
direct cost of which is borne by the current or former employee (or
beneficiary thereof).

  



  

(j) The consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will
not, either alone or in combination with any other event, (i) entitle any
current or former employee, officer or director of Parent, any of its
Subsidiaries or any Parent ERISA Affiliate to severance pay, unemployment
compensation or any other similar termination payment under any Parent Plan,
or (ii) accelerate the time of payment or vesting of, increase the amount of
or otherwise enhance any benefit due any such employee, officer or director
under any Parent Plan.

  



  

(k) To the knowledge of Parent, neither Parent nor any Subsidiary has
contributed to a nonconforming group health plan (as defined in Section
5000(c) of the Code) and no Parent ERISA Affiliate or any of its Subsidiaries
has incurred a Tax under Section 5000(a) of the Code which is or could become
a liability of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries.

  



  

(l) There is no pending or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened
material Litigation by,

  



  

37   

     
   

  



  

on behalf of or against any Parent Plan by any participant (or beneficiary
thereof) in such Parent Plan or otherwise involving such Parent Plan (other
than routine claims for benefits).

  



  

 **Section 4.10** **Litigation; Compliance with Law.**

  



  

(a) Except as disclosed in the Specified Parent SEC Documents, (i) there is
no Litigation pending or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened in
writing against, relating to or naming as a party thereto Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries, any of their respective properties or assets or any of
Parents officers or directors (in their capacities as such), (ii) there is
no agreement, order, judgment, decree, injunction or award of any
Governmental Entity against and/or binding upon Parent, any of its
Subsidiaries or any of Parents officers or directors (in their capacities as
such) that, in the case of either clause (i) or (ii), individually or in the
aggregate has had, or would be reasonably likely to have or result in, a
Material Adverse Effect on Parent, and (iii) there is no Litigation that
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries has pending against other parties, where
such Litigation is intended to enforce or preserve material rights of Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries.

  



  

(b) Each of Parent and its Subsidiaries has complied, and is in compliance,
in all material respects with all Laws and Permits which affect the
respective businesses of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, the Parent Real
Property and/or the Parent Assets, and Parent and its Subsidiaries have not
been and are not in violation in any material respect of any such Law or
Permit; nor has any notice, charge, claim or action has been received by
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or been filed, commenced, or to the
knowledge of Parent, threatened against Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
alleging any violation of the foregoing.

  



  

(c) Parent and its Subsidiaries hold all Permits necessary for the
ownership, leasing, operation, occupancy and use of the Parent Real Property,
the Parent Assets and the conduct of their respective businesses as currently
conducted ("Parent Permits"), except where the failure to hold such Parent
Permits individually or in the aggregate has not had, and would not be
reasonably likely to have or result in, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.
Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has received notice that any
Parent Permit will be terminated or modified or cannot be renewed in the
ordinary course of business, and Parent has no knowledge of any reasonable
basis for any such termination, modification or nonrenewal, in each case
except for any such terminations, modifications or nonrenewals
that individually or in the aggregate have not had, and would not be
reasonably likely to have or result in, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.
The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the
consummation of the Merger or any other transactions contemplated hereby do
not and will not violate any Parent Permit, or result in any termination,
modification or nonrenewal thereof, except in each case for any such
violations, terminations, modifications or nonrenewals that individually or
in the aggregate have not had, and would not be reasonably likely to have or
result in, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

  



  

(d) This Section 4.10 does not relate to matters with respect to (i)
Parent Plans, ERISA and other employee benefit matters (which are the subject
of Section 4.9), (ii) Tax Laws and other Tax matters (which are the subject
of Section 4.13), (iii) Environmental Laws and other environmental matters

its Subsidiaries does not infringe, conflict with or otherwise violate in
any material respect any Intellectual Property of any Person, and none of
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries has received notice or has knowledge of any
such material infringement, conflict or other violation.

Parent SEC Documents, to the extent that it is reasonably apparent that the
disclosure in the Specified Parent SEC Documents is responsive to the matters

the making or submission of any proposal that constitutes, or could

recommend, adopt or approve, any Acquisition Proposal (any action described
in this clause (i) being referred to as a "Company Adverse Recommendation
Change") nor (ii) shall the Company or any of its Subsidiaries execute or
enter into an Acquisition Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any
time prior to obtaining the Company Required Vote, and subject to the
Companys compliance at all times with the provisions of this Section 5.3 and
Section 5.6, in response to a Superior Proposal, the Company Board may make a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change and enter into an
Acquisition Agreement; provided, however, that the Company shall not be
entitled to exercise its right to make a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change and enter into an Acquisition Agreement in response to a Superior
Proposal (X) until four Business Days after the Company provides written
notice to Parent (a "Company Notice") advising Parent that the Company Board
or a committee thereof has received a Superior Proposal, specifying the
material

  



  

55   

     
   

  



  

terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal, and identifying the Person or
group making such Superior Proposal and (Y) if during such four Business Day
period, Parent proposes any alternative transaction (including any
modifications to the terms of this Agreement), unless the Company Board
determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisors and
outside legal counsel, and taking into account all financial, legal, and
regulatory terms and conditions of such alternative transaction proposal)
that such alternative transaction proposal is not at least as favorable to
the Company and its stockholders from a financial point of view as the
Superior Proposal (it being understood that any change in the financial or
other material terms of a Superior Proposal shall require a new Company
Notice and a new four Business Day period under this Section 5.3(b)).

  



  

(c) Neither the Parent Board nor any committee thereof shall directly or
indirectly withdraw (or amend or modify in a manner adverse to the Company),
or publicly propose to withdraw (or amend or modify in a manner adverse to
the Company), the approval, recommendation or declaration of advisability by
the Parent Board or any such committee thereof of this Agreement, the Merger,
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Parent Proposal.

Parent set forth in paragraphs (a) through (c) of this Section 5.3, as
promptly as practicable after receipt thereof, the Company shall advise
Parent in writing of any request for information or any Acquisition Proposal
received from any Person, or any inquiry, discussions or negotiations with
respect to any Acquisition Proposal, and the terms and conditions of such
request, Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, discussions or negotiations, and the
Company shall promptly provide to Parent copies of any written materials
received by the Company in connection with any of the foregoing, and the
identity of the Person or group making any such request, Acquisition Proposal
or inquiry or with whom any discussions or negotiations are taking place. The
Company agrees that it shall simultaneously provide to Parent any non-public
information concerning itself or its Subsidiaries provided to any other
Person or group in connection with any Acquisition Proposal which was not
previously provided to the Parent. The Company shall keep Parent fully
informed of the status of any Acquisition Proposals (including the identity
of the parties and price involved and any changes to any material terms and
conditions thereof). The Company agrees not to release any third party from,
or waive any provisions of, any confidentiality or standstill agreement to
which it is a party.

or indirect acquisition or purchase of 10% or more of any class of equity
securities or capital stock of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries whose

consolidation, restructuring, transfer of assets or other business
combination, sale of shares of capital stock, tender offer, exchange offer,

Subsidiaries whose business constitutes 10% or more of the net revenues, net
income or assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, other

Proposal" shall mean any bona fide written Acquisition Proposal made by a
third party to acquire, directly or indirectly, pursuant to a tender offer,

or more of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
or (B) 50% or more of the equity securities of the Company, in each case on
terms which a majority of the board of directors of the Company determines in
good faith (after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal
counsel, and taking into account all financial, legal and regulatory terms
and conditions of the Acquisition Proposal and this Agreement, including any
alternative transaction (including any modifications to the terms of this
Agreement) proposed by any other party in response to such Superior Proposal,
including any conditions to and expected timing of consummation, and any
risks of non-consummation, of such Acquisition Proposal) to be superior to
such party and its stockholders (in their capacity as stockholders) from a
financial point of view as compared to the transactions contemplated hereby
and to any alternative transaction (including any modifications to the terms
of this Agreement) proposed by the Parent pursuant to this Section 5.3.

Company will, and will cause its Subsidiaries and their respective officers,
directors, employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants and other
agents to, cease and terminate any existing activities, discussions or
negotiations with any parties conducted heretofore with respect to any
possible Acquisition Proposal. The Company agrees that it shall (i) take
the necessary steps to promptly inform its officers, directors, investments
bankers, attorneys, accountants, financial advisors, agents or other
representatives involved in the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement of the obligations undertaken in this Section 5.3 and (ii) request
each Person who has heretofore executed a confidentiality agreement in
connection with such Persons consideration of acquiring the Company or any
portion thereof to return or destroy (which destruction shall be certified in
writing by an executive officer of such Person) all confidential information
heretofore furnished to such Person by or on its behalf.

  



  

 **Section 5.4** **Access to Information and Properties.**

  



  

(a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable Laws relating to the
exchange of information, each of the Company and Parent shall, and shall
cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford to the authorized representatives
of the other party, including officers, employees, accountants, counsel and
other representatives of the other party, reasonable access, during normal
business hours during the period prior to the Effective Time, to all of its
properties, contracts, books, commitments, records, data and books and
personnel and, during such period, it shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries
to, make available to the other parties all information concerning its
business, properties and personnel as the other parties may reasonably
request. No party nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to provide
access to or to disclose information where such access or disclosure would
violate or prejudice the rights of its customers, jeopardize any attorney-
client privilege or contravene any Law or binding agreement entered into
prior to the date of this Agreement. The Company and Parent will make
appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which
the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply.

  



  

(b) From the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, each party and
its authorized representatives, including engineers, advisors and
consultants, lenders and financing sources, upon reasonable notice and in a
manner that does not unreasonably interfere with the business of the
applicable party or any of its Subsidiaries, may enter into and upon all or
any portion of the real property owned or leased by the other party in order
to investigate and assess, as such party reasonably deems necessary or
appropriate, the environmental condition of such real property and the other
assets or the businesses of such other party or any of its Subsidiaries (an
"Investigation"). An Investigation may include a Phase I environmental site
assessment, or similar investigation; provided, however, that an
Investigation shall not include any sampling or

  



  

57   

     
   

  



  

testing of soil and/or ground or surface waters at, on or under any real
property. Each party hereto shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries
to, cooperate with the other parties in conducting any such Investigation,
facilitating further testing or evaluation as may be reasonably prudent with
respect to matters identified in the investigation, allow any other party
reasonable access to such partys and its Subsidiaries respective
businesses, real property and other assets, together with full permission to
conduct any such Investigation, and provide to any other party all plans,
soil or surface or ground water tests or reports, any environmental
investigation results, reports or assessments previously or contemporaneously
conducted or prepared by or on behalf of such party, its Subsidiaries, or any
of their predecessors that are in the possession of such party or any of its
Subsidiaries, and all information relating to environmental matters regarding
such partys and its Subsidiaries respective businesses, real property and
other assets that are in the possession of such party or any of its
Subsidiaries.

  



  

(c) Parent and the Company will hold any information contemplated under
Sections 5.4(a) and/or (b) above in accordance with the provisions of
the confidentiality agreements between the Company and Parent, dated as of
March 9, 2005 and March 21, 2005, respectively (together, the
"Confidentiality Agreement").

  



  

(d) No investigation by Parent or the Company or their respective
representatives shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements of the other set forth in this Agreement.

  



  

 **Section 5.5** **Further Action; Reasonable Best Efforts.**

  



  

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions herein provided, each of
the parties hereto agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all action and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws to consummate and make
effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including using
reasonable best efforts to satisfy the conditions precedent to the
obligations of any of the parties hereto, to obtain all necessary
authorizations, consents and approvals, and to effect all necessary
registrations and filings, and to assist Parent and Purchaser in obtaining
any financing it may arrange in connection with the merger. Each of the
parties hereto will furnish to the other parties such necessary information
and reasonable assistance as such other parties may reasonably request in
connection with the foregoing and will provide the other parties with copies
of all filings made by such party with any Governmental Entity or any other
information supplied by such party to a Governmental Entity in connection
with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

  



  

(b) Each of Parent, Purchaser and the Company shall use their respective
reasonable best efforts to resolve such objections, if any, as may be
asserted with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby under any
applicable Law. Without limiting the foregoing, the Company and Parent
shall, as soon as practicable, file any required Notification and Report
Forms under the HSR Act with the Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC") and the
Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (the "Antitrust Division")
and shall use reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as practicable
to all inquiries received from the FTC or the Antitrust Division for
additional information or documentation.

  



  

(c) Each party shall (i) take all actions necessary to ensure that no
state takeover Law or similar Law is or becomes applicable to this Agreement,
the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and (ii) if any state takeover Law or similar Law becomes applicable to this
Agreement, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated

  



  

58   

     
   

  



  

by this Agreement, take all action necessary to ensure that the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and
otherwise to minimize the effect of such Law on this Agreement, the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided, however,
that notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall not be required to take any
action to exempt any stockholder of the Company from any such Law.

  



  

(d) In case at any time after the Effective Time any further action is
necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, the
proper officers and/or directors of the Surviving Corporation shall take or
cause to be taken all such necessary action.

  



  

(e) Each of the parties hereto shall use reasonable best efforts to prevent
the entry of, and to cause to be discharged or vacated, any order or
injunction of a Governmental Entity precluding, restraining, enjoining or
prohibiting consummation of the Merger.

  



  

(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 5.5,
neither Parent nor Purchaser shall be required to accept, as a condition to
obtaining any required approval or resolving any objection of any
Governmental Entity, any requirement to divest or hold separate or in trust
(or the imposition of any other condition or restriction with respect to) any
of the respective businesses of Parent, Purchaser, the Company or any of
their respective Subsidiaries, the Company Assets, the Parent Assets, the
Company Real Property or the Parent Real Property.

  



  

 **Section 5.6** **Proxy Statement; Form S-4; Stockholders  Meeting.**

  



  

(a) As promptly as practicable after the execution of this Agreement, the
Company and Parent shall cooperate in preparing and each shall cause to be
filed with the SEC, in connection with the Merger, a joint proxy statement in
preliminary form (together with any amendments or supplements thereto, the
"Proxy Statement") and Parent shall promptly prepare and file with the SEC
the S-4, in which the Proxy Statement will be included as a prospectus, and
the parties shall file, if necessary, any other statement or schedule
relating to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. Each of
the Company, Parent and Purchaser shall use their respective reasonable best
efforts to furnish the information required respectively concerning them and
to be included by the SEC in the Proxy Statement, the S-4 and any such
statement or schedule. Each of the Company and Parent shall use
its reasonable best efforts to have the S-4 declared effective under the
Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such filing, and each of the
Company and Parent shall as promptly as practicable thereafter mail the Proxy
Statement to its stockholders. Parent shall also use reasonable best
efforts to obtain all necessary state securities Law or "Blue Sky" permits
and approvals required to carry out the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

  



  

(b) If at any time prior to the Effective Time, any event or circumstance
relating to the Company or Parent and Purchaser or any of their respective
affiliates, or its or their respective officers or directors, should be
discovered by the Company, Parent or Purchaser that should be set forth in an
amendment to the S-4 or a supplement to the Proxy Statement, the Company,
Parent or Purchaser shall promptly inform the other parties hereto thereof in
writing. All documents that the Company or Parent is responsible for filing
with the SEC in connection with the transactions contemplated herein will
comply as to form in all material respects with applicable requirements of
the Securities Act and the Exchange Act. The parties shall notify each other
promptly of the time when the S-4 has become effective, of the issuance of
any stop order or suspension of the qualification of the Parent Common Stock
issuable in connection with the Merger for offering or sale in any
jurisdiction, or of the receipt of any comments from the SEC or the staff of
the SEC

  



  

59   

     
   

  



  

and of any request by the SEC or the staff of the SEC for amendments or
supplements to the Proxy Statement or the S-4 or for additional information
and shall supply each other with copies of (i) all correspondence between it
or any of its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or the staff of
the SEC, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement, the S-4 or
the Merger and (ii) all orders of the SEC relating to the S-4.

  



  

(c) The Company, acting through the Company Board, shall, in accordance with
its certificate of incorporation and bylaws and with applicable Law, promptly
and duly call, give notice of, convene and hold, as soon as practicable
following the date upon which the S-4 becomes effective for the purposes of
voting upon the adoption of this Agreement and the approval of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
the Merger, a special meeting of its stockholders for the sole purpose of
considering and taking action upon this Agreement (such meeting, including
any postponement or adjournment thereof, the "Company Special Meeting"), and
shall use its reasonable best efforts to hold the Company Special Meeting as
soon a practical but no later than 45 days after such date. Except as
otherwise provided in Section 5.3(b), the Company, acting through the Company
Board, shall (i) recommend adoption of this Agreement and include in the
Proxy Statement such recommendation and (ii) use its reasonable best efforts
to solicit and obtain such adoption. Notwithstanding any Company
Adverse Recommendation Change or the commencement, public proposal, public
disclosure or communication to the Company of any Acquisition Proposal with
respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any other fact or
circumstance, unless this Agreement has been terminated by the Company in
accordance with Section 7.1(d) below, this Agreement shall be submitted to
the stockholders of the Company at the Company Special Meeting for the
purpose of adopting this Agreement, with such disclosures as shall be
required by applicable Law. At any such Company Special Meeting
following any such withdrawal, amendment or modification of the Company
Boards recommendation of this Agreement, the Company may submit this
Agreement to its stockholders without a recommendation or with a negative
recommendation (although the approval of this Agreement by the Company Board
may not be rescinded or amended), in which event the Company Board may
communicate the basis for its lack of a recommendation or negative
recommendation to its stockholders in the Proxy Statement or an appropriate
amendment or supplement thereto.

  



  

(d) Parent, acting through the Parent Board, shall, in accordance with
its certificate of incorporation and bylaws and with applicable Law, promptly
and duly call, give notice of, convene and hold, as soon as practicable
following the date upon which the S-4 becomes effective for the purposes of
voting upon the Parent Proposal a special meeting of its stockholders (such
meeting, including any postponements or adjournments thereof, the "Parent
Stockholders Meeting"), and shall use its reasonable best efforts to hold
the Parent Stockholders Meeting as soon as practical but no later than 45
days after such date. Parent, acting through the Parent Board, shall (i)
recommend approval of the Parent Proposal and include in the Proxy Statement
such recommendation and (ii) use its reasonable best efforts to solicit and
obtain such approval.

  



  

 **Section 5.7** **Notification of Certain Matters.**

  



  

(a) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of any fact, event
or circumstance as to which the Company obtains knowledge that would be
reasonably likely to result in a failure of a condition set forth in Section
6.3(a) or 6.3(b). Parent and Purchaser shall give prompt notice to the
Company of any fact, event or circumstance as to which Parent or Purchaser
obtains knowledge that would be reasonably likely to result in a failure of a
condition set forth in Section 6.2(a) or 6.2(b).

  



  

60   



  

      
  

  



  

(b) Immediately prior to Closing, the Company shall provide Parent with a
complete list of the number of employee terminations (other than voluntary
resignations and terminations for cause) for the 90-day period prior to
Closing, by facility or geographic site of employment.

  



  

 **Section 5.8 Directors and Officers Insurance and Indemnification.**

  



  

(a) After the Effective Time, Parent shall (i) indemnify, defend and hold
harmless the present and former officers, directors, employees and agents of
the Company and any of its Subsidiaries in such capacities ("Indemnified
Parties") to the fullest extent that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
would have been required to do so in accordance with the provisions of each
indemnification or similar agreement between the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and any Indemnified Party, in each case against any losses,
damages, expenses or liabilities resulting from any claim, liability, loss,
damage, cost or expense, asserted against, or incurred by, an Indemnified
Party that is based on the fact that such Indemnified Party is or was a
director, officer, employee or agent of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and arising out of actions or omissions or alleged actions or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time and (ii) take all
necessary actions to ensure that Parents directors and officers liability
insurance continues to cover each Company Director and each officer and
director of the Company, in each case so long as they remain employed or
retained by Parent or any affiliate of Parent (including the Surviving
Corporation) as an officer or director.

  



  

(b) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall purchase, and after the Effective
Time the Surviving Corporation shall maintain, directors and officers
liability insurance covering, for a period of six years after the Effective
Time, the directors and officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries who are
currently covered by the Companys existing directors and officers
liability insurance with respect to claims arising from facts or events that
occurred before the Effective Time, on terms and conditions substantially
similar to such directors and officers than those in effect on the date of
this Agreement; provided, however, that the aggregate annual premiums for
such insurance at any time during such period shall not exceed 250% of the
per annum rate of premium currently paid by the Company and its Subsidiaries
for such insurance on the date of this Agreement.

  



  

 **Section 5.9 Publicity** **.** Neither the Company, Parent, Purchaser nor
any of their respective affiliates shall issue or cause the publication of
any press release or other announcement with respect to the Merger, this
Agreement or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement without
the prior consultation of the other party, except as may be required by Law
or by any listing agreement with a Nasdaq if all reasonable best efforts have
been made to consult with the other party. In addition, the Company agrees to
consult with Parent before issuing any press release or other announcement
with respect to its business, except as may be required by Law or by any
listing agreement with Nasdaq if all reasonable best efforts have been made
to consult with Parent.

  



  

 **Section 5.10 ****Stock Exchange Listing.** Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the shares of Parent Common Stock to be
issued in the Merger to be approved for listing on Nasdaq subject to official
notice of issuance, as of the Effective Time.

  



  

 **Section 5.11 Employee Benefits.**

  



  

(a) Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as requiring Parent or any
of its affiliates to employ any employee of the Company for any length of
time following the Closing Date. Except as specifically provided in this
Agreement, nothing in this Agreement, express or

  



  

61   

     
   

  



  

implied, shall be construed to prevent Parent or its affiliates from (i)
terminating, or modifying the terms of employment of, any Company employee
following the Closing Date or (ii) terminating or modifying to any extent any
Company Plan or any other employee benefit plan, program, agreement or
arrangement that Parent or its affiliates may establish or maintain.

  



  

(b) Schedule 5.11 (b) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth, with
respect to each senior officer of the Company, the cash severance payments
that would be due to such senior officer under each senior officers
employment agreement upon a Change of Control (as defined therein). At
the Effective Time, the Surviving Company shall pay to each of the senior
officers, pursuant to the employment agreements of such officers, the amount
of severance set forth on Schedule 5.11(b) and a bonus and vacation amount
calculated by multiplying (i) the number of days between January 1, 2005 to
the Effective Date, by (ii) the applicable daily rate of bonus and vacation
set forth opposite each senior officers name on Schedule 5.11(b) provided,
however, in no event will the bonus amount be less than one-half of such
officers then current annual salary. At the Effective Time, (i) each of the
employment agreements of the senior officers will be terminated and any
nonsolicitation provisions therein will also be terminated and will not
survive the Effective Time, (ii) all of the payments, benefits and other
actions and obligations of the Company to be taken or made under
the employment agreements in the event of a Change of Control (as defined
therein) and the termination of the senior officer without Cause (as defined
therein) shall be taken or made by the Company, the Parent or the Surviving
Corporation as appropriate, (iii) as provided in the employment agreements,
all options held by the senior officers will be vested in full at the
Effective Time and will be exercisable as provided in Section 5(f)(i) of the
employment agreements and (iv) Parent and Surviving Corporation shall
reimburse each senior officer for any out of pocket expenses incurred to
continue coverage (for himself and his family) under the group health plan
for the applicable period under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget
Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended ("COBRA"), but only if the senior
officer elects such COBRA continuation in accordance with the time limits and
in the applicable COBRA regulations.

  



  

(c) The Company shall use its best efforts to cause the senior officers of
the Company set forth on Schedule 5.11(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter
(other than Robert L. Cavnar) to agree to continue working for the Surviving
Corporation for up to sixty (60) days after the Effective Time. During the
portion of such sixty (60) day period which Parent requests a senior officer
to continue working for the Surviving Corporation and such senior officer
works for the Surviving Corporation, such senior officer shall be entitled to
receive (i) the applicable portion of his 2005 base salary, (ii) a bonus
and vacation payment calculated based upon the number of days he is employed
after the Effective Time divided by 365 then multiplied by the applicable
daily bonus and vacation amount as set forth on Schedule 5.11(b), and (iii)
employee benefits consistent with the Surviving Corporations existing
benefit plans. Parent shall determine and notify each of such senior officer
of the date of termination of such senior officers employment with Surviving
Corporation, which shall not extend beyond sixty (60) days after the
Effective Time unless mutually agreed between Parent and such senior officer,
by giving such senior officers at least two (2) weeks prior notice of such
termination.

  



  

(d) The Company shall cause the Companys Severance Benefit Plan (Non-
Officer Employees) and Severance Benefit Plan (Non-Contract Officers)
(collectively, the "Severance Benefit Plans") to be modified so that if
Parent offers a Company employee (other than those senior officers set forth
on Section 5.11(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter) employment with
Surviving Corporation, Parent or their affiliates in a comparable position
located in Houston, Texas, with comparable pay and Surviving Corporations or
Parents normal benefits, such person will not be entitled to receive any
severance pay pursuant to the Severance Benefit Plans

  



  

62   

     
   

  



  

unless he or she is terminated without cause by Parent, Surviving Corporation
or their affiliates within one (1) year of the Effective Date, and in such
event, his or her severance pay pursuant to the applicable Severance Benefit
Plan shall be due upon termination. In the event a Company employee is not
offered employment with Parent, the Surviving Corporation or their affiliates
in a comparable position located in Houston, Texas, with comparable pay and
Surviving Corporations or Parents normal benefits, such person will be
entitled to severance pay in accordance with the terms of the applicable
Severance Benefit Plan, as modified pursuant to the above. The Severance
Benefit Plan shall not be terminated until 13 months after the Effective
Time.

  



  

(e) The parties hereby agree and acknowledge that Section 5.11(e) of the
Company Disclosure Letter sets forth, with respect to each noncontract
officer of the Company, the cash severance payments and vacation payments
that would be due to such officer under the Companys various agreements or
programs the Company has with each officer and/or under the Companys
Severance Benefit Plan (Non-Contract Officers).

  



  

(f) The Companys Retention and Incentive Plan (Non-Officer Employees) shall
remain in full force and effect past the Effective Time until all payments
thereunder have been satisfied. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company, or
the appropriate committee of the Company Board, will make the decisions
necessary to allocate the payments under this plan subject to the terms of
the plan and the limits set forth therein on aggregate payments thereunder.

  



  

(g) To the extent allowed by law and the terms of Parents plan, for
purposes of determining years of service, eligibility, vesting and benefit
levels with Parent, the Surviving Corporation or its affiliates with regard
to employee benefits offered by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or its
affiliates, years of service in which a Company employee has been employed by
the Company or its predecessors shall be counted. To the extent allowed by law
and the terms of Parents plans, following the Effective Time, for purposes
of each Parent plan in which any continuing employee or his or her eligible
dependents is eligible to participate after the Effective Time, Parent shall,
or shall cause its Subsidiaries to, (i) waive any pre-existing condition,
exclusion, actively-at-work requirement or waiting period to the extent such
condition, exclusion, requirement or waiting period was satisfied or waived
under the comparable Company plan as of the Effective Time (or, if later, any
applicable plan transaction date) and (ii) provide full credit for any co-
payments, deductibles or similar payments made or incurred prior to the
Effective Time for the plan year in which the Effective Time (or such
transition date) occurs. In order to implement the intent of Section5.11(g),
Parent all reasonable actions to amend the Parents plans.

  



  

(h) At the Effective Time, each Company Option shall become fully vested in
accordance with Company Plans. If the holder of a Company Option ceases to be
a director, officer or employee or consultant of the Surviving Corporation or
any of its affiliates (including Parent and its Subsidiaries), such
option shall remain exercisable, as an Assumed Option in accordance with
Section 1.8, for a period of 120 days thereafter (except for Company Options
held by senior officers which are governed by Section 5.11(b) above).

  



  

 **Section 5.12 ****Appointment of Directors.**  Parent shall take all
necessary corporate action to increase the size of the Board of Directors of
Parent by two members and to appoint the Company Designated Directors
immediately following the Effective Time to fill the vacancies on the Board
of Directors of Parent created by such increase. Parent, through the Parent
Board and subject to the Parent Boards fiduciary duties to the stockholders
of Parent, shall take all

  



  

63   

     
   

  



  

necessary action to recommend that the Company Designated Directors be
elected to the Parent Board in the proxy statement relating to the first
annual meeting of the stockholders of Parent following the Closing.

  



  

 **Section 5.13 ****Rights Agreement.** The Company Board shall take such
action as is necessary to render the Company Rights inapplicable to the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

 **Section 5.14 Certain Tax Matters.**

  



  

(a) Parent and the Company shall each use its reasonable best efforts to
cause the Merger to qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code, and before or after the Effective Time, neither
Parent nor the Company shall knowingly take any action, cause any action to
be taken, fail to take any action or cause any action to fail to be taken
which action or failure to act could cause the Merger to fail to qualify as a
reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code, unless otherwise required to
properly comply with Laws or generally accepted accounting principles
applicable to Parent or the Company.

  



  

(b) Parent and the Company shall comply with the record keeping and
information reporting requirements set forth in Treasury Regulation Section
1.368-3.

  



  

(c) Parent and the Company shall each use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain the Tax opinions set forth in Sections 6.2(d) and 6.3(d). This
Agreement is intended to constitute a "plan of reorganization" within the
meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-2(g).

  



  

(d) Officers of Parent, Purchaser and the Company shall execute and deliver
to Porter and Hedges, L.L.P., Tax counsel for the Company, and Thompson and
Knight, LLP, Tax counsel for Parent, certificates substantially in the form
agreed to by the parties and such law firms at such time or times as may
reasonably be requested by such law firms, including prior to the time the
S-4 is declared effective by the SEC and the Effective Time, in connection
with such Tax counsels respective delivery of opinions pursuant to Sections
6.2(d) and 6.3(d). Each of Parent, Purchaser and the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts not to take or cause to be taken any action that
would cause to be untrue (or fail to take or cause not to be taken any action
which would cause to be untrue) any of the certifications and representations
included in the certificates described in this Section 5.14(b). Company shall
identify in a letter to Parent all Persons who are, on the date hereof,
"affiliates" of Company, as such term is used in Rule 145 under the
Securities Act.  Company shall use all reasonable efforts to cause its
respective affiliates to deliver to Parent not later than 10 days prior to
the date of the Parent Special Meeting, a written agreement in a form
reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Company and shall use all reasonable
efforts to cause Persons who become "affiliates" after such date but prior to
Closing to execute and deliver agreements at least 5 days prior to the
Closing Date.

  



  

(e) The Company and Parent shall cooperate in the preparation, execution and
filing of all Tax Returns, questionnaires, applications or other documents
regarding any real property transfer or gains, sales, use, transfer, value
added, stock transfer and stamp Taxes, and transfer, recording, registration
and other fees and similar Taxes which become payable in connection with the
Merger that are required or permitted to be filed on or before the Effective
Time. Each of Purchaser and the Company shall pay, without deduction from any
amount payable to holders of Company Common Stock and without reimbursement
from the other party, any such Taxes or fees imposed on it by any
Governmental Entity, which becomes payable in connection with the Merger.

has been

  



  

69   

     
   

  



  

proposed by any Person (other than Parent and Purchaser or any of their
respective affiliates) or any Person has publicly announced its intention
(whether or not conditional) to make such Acquisition Proposal or such

immediately available funds.

  



  

(d) For purposes of clause (iii) of Section 8.1(c) only, the term

Company if such amendment alters or changes (i) the Merger Consideration,

no way impair the rights of the party granting such waiver in any other
respect or at any other time. Neither the waiver by any of the parties hereto
of a breach of or a default under any of the provisions of this Agreement,
nor the failure by any of the parties, on one or more occasions, to enforce
