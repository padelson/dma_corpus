with _Section 2.2(b)_) to file the Schedule 14D-9 on the same date as the
Purchaser commences the Offer and (iii) none of the events set forth in
clauses (i) through (vii) of _Annex I_ shall have occurred or be continuing,
as promptly as practicable (and in any event within seven (7) Business Days)
after the date hereof, the Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause the
Purchaser to) commence, within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 (the " _Exchange Act_ "), the Offer to purchase all the
outstanding Shares at the Offer Price, subject to: (i) the condition that
there being validly tendered in the Offer and not properly withdrawn prior to
the Expiration Date that number of Shares which, together with the number of
Shares (if any) then beneficially owned by Parent or the Purchaser or with
respect to which Parent or the Purchaser otherwise has, directly or
indirectly, sole voting power, represents at least a majority of the Shares
then outstanding (determined on a fully diluted basis as of immediately
following the Acceptance Time (excluding from the number of tendered Shares,
but not from the outstanding Shares, Shares tendered pursuant to guaranteed
delivery procedures that have not yet been delivered in settlement or
satisfaction of such guarantee)) and entitled to vote in the election of
directors or (if a greater majority) on the adoption of this Agreement
(collectively, the " _Minimum Condition_ "); and (ii) the satisfaction, or
written waiver (where permitted by applicable Law) by Parent or the Purchaser,
of the other conditions and requirements set forth in _Annex I_.

 

(b) Subject to the satisfaction of the Minimum Condition and the satisfaction,
or written waiver (where permitted by applicable Law) by Parent or the
Purchaser, of the other conditions and requirements set forth in _Annex I_ ,
the Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause and enable the Purchaser to)
accept for payment and pay for all Shares validly tendered and not
properly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer promptly after the Purchaser is
legally permitted to do so under applicable Law in accordance with the
Exchange Act. The Offer Price

 



12  payable in respect of each Share validly tendered and not properly withdrawn
pursuant to the Offer shall be paid net to the seller in cash, without
interest, subject to any withholding of Taxes required by applicable Law in
accordance with _Section 3.2(f)_.

(c) The Offer shall be made by means of an offer to purchase (the " _Offer to
Purchase_ ") that describes the terms and conditions of the Offer in
accordance with this Agreement, including the Minimum Condition and the other
conditions and requirements set forth in _Annex I_. Parent and the Purchaser
expressly reserve the right to waive (where permitted by applicable Law), in
their sole discretion, in whole or in part, any of the conditions set forth on
_Annex I_ , to increase the Offer Price or to make any other changes in the
terms and conditions of the Offer; _provided_ , _however_ , that unless
otherwise contemplated by this Agreement or as previously approved by the
Company in writing, the Purchaser shall not (i) decrease the Offer
Price, (ii) change the form of consideration payable in the Offer, (iii)
reduce the maximum number of Shares to be purchased in the Offer, (iv) amend
or waive the Minimum Condition, (v) amend any of the other conditions and
requirements to the Offer set forth in _Annex I_ in a manner adverse to the
holders of Shares or (vi) extend the Expiration Date in a manner other than in
accordance with this Agreement.

 

(d) Unless extended in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the Offer
shall expire at 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the date that is twenty-one
(21) Business Days following the commencement of the Offer (the " _Initial
Expiration Date_ ") or, if the Initial Expiration Date has been extended in
accordance with this Agreement, the date on which the Offer has been so
extended (the Initial Expiration Date, or such later date to which the Initial
Expiration Date has been extended in accordance with this Agreement, the "
_Expiration Date_ ").

 

(e) If on or prior to any then scheduled Expiration Date, all of the
conditions to the Offer (including the Minimum Condition and the other
conditions and requirements set forth in _Annex I_ ) have not been satisfied
or, where permitted by applicable Law, waived in writing by Parent or the
Purchaser, the Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause the Purchaser to)
extend the Offer on one or more occasions, for successive periods of up to
twenty (20) Business Days each, in order to permit the satisfaction of such
conditions. In addition, the Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause the
Purchaser to) extend the Offer for any period or periods required by
applicable Law or applicable rules, regulations, interpretations or positions
of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") or its staff.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Purchaser shall not be required to extend
the Offer for any reason beyond September 17, 2011 (the " _Outside Date_ ").

(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if necessary to obtain sufficient Shares to
reach the Short Form Threshold, the Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause
the Purchaser to), provide for a "subsequent offering period" (and one or
more extensions thereof) in accordance with Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act
of not more than twenty (20) Business Days in the aggregate; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if the Purchaser exercises the Top Up Option pursuant to
_Section 2.4_, it shall not be required to provide for a "subsequent offering
period." Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Offer,
the Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause the Purchaser to) immediately
accept for payment, and pay for, all Shares that are validly tendered pursuant
to the Offer during any such "subsequent offering period". The

 



13  Offer Documents will provide for the possibility of a "subsequent offering
period" in a manner consistent with the terms of this _Section 2.1(f)_.

 

(g) The Purchaser shall not terminate the Offer prior to any scheduled
Expiration Date without the prior written consent of the Company, except if
this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Article VIII_. If this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to _Article VIII_ , the Purchaser shall (and Parent shall
cause the Purchaser to) promptly (and in any event within twenty four (24)
hours of such termination), irrevocably and unconditionally terminate the
Offer. If the Offer is terminated or withdrawn by the Purchaser, or this
Agreement is terminated prior to the purchase of Shares in the Offer, the
Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause the Purchaser to) promptly return,
and shall cause any depositary acting on behalf of the Purchaser to return, in
accordance with applicable Law, all tendered Shares to the registered holders
thereof.

 

(h) As promptly as practicable on the date of the commencement of the Offer,
Parent and the Purchaser shall file with the SEC, in accordance with Rule
14d-3 under the Exchange Act, a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with
respect to the Offer (together with all amendments, supplements and exhibits
thereto, the " _Schedule TO_ "). The Schedule TO shall include, as exhibits,
the Offer to Purchase, a form of letter of transmittal, a form of summary
advertisement and other ancillary Offer documents and instruments, if any, in
respect of the Offer (collectively, together with any amendments and
supplements thereto and the Schedule TO, the " _Offer Documents_ "). Parent
and the Purchaser agree to cause the Offer Documents to be disseminated to
holders of Shares, as and to the extent required by the Exchange Act. Parent
and the Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, agree
to promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the Offer
Documents, if and to the extent that it shall have become false or misleading
in any material respect or as otherwise required by applicable Law, and
Parent and the Purchaser agree to cause the Offer Documents, as so corrected,
to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case
as and to the extent required by the Exchange Act. The Company and its
counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review the Schedule TO and
the Offer Documents before they are filed with the SEC, and Parent and the
Purchaser shall give due consideration to the additions, deletions or changes
suggested thereto by the Company and its counsel. In addition, Parent and the
Purchaser shall provide the Company with (i) a copy of any written comments or
telephonic notice of any oral comments that may be received from the SEC or
its staff with respect to the Offer Documents promptly after receipt thereof
and prior to responding thereto and (ii) a reasonable opportunity to provide
comments on that response (to which due consideration shall be given) and to
participate in such response, including by participating in any discussions
with the SEC.

(i) Parent shall provide or cause to be provided to the Purchaser on a timely
basis the funds necessary to pay for any Shares that the Purchaser becomes
obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer.

and _Section 6.4(d)_. 

(b) On the date the Schedule TO is filed with the SEC, the Company shall, in a
manner that complies with Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act, file with the
SEC a Tender Offer Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9

exhibits thereto, the " _Schedule 14D-9_ ") that shall reflect the terms and
conditions of this Agreement and, subject to _Section 6.4(c)_ and _Section
6.4(d)_, contain the Company Board Recommendation. The Company agrees to cause
the Schedule 14D-9 to be disseminated to holders of Shares, as and to the
extent required by the Exchange Act. The Company shall use all reasonable
efforts to obtain the consent of the Company Financial Advisor to permit the
Company to include in the Schedule 14D-9, in its entirety, the
fairness opinion referred to in _Section 4.23_, together with a summary
thereof (which summary shall comply with the provisions of Item 1015(b) of
Regulation M-A promulgated by the SEC). The Company also hereby consents to
the inclusion in the Offer Documents of a description of the Company Board
actions described in _Section 4.3(a)_ and, to the extent that no Company
Adverse Recommendation Change shall have occurred in accordance with _Section
6.4(c)_ and  _Section 6.4(d)_, the Company consents to the inclusion of the
Company Board Recommendation in the Offer Documents. The Company, on the one
hand, and Parent and the Purchaser, on the other hand, agree to promptly
correct any information provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9, if and
to the extent that it shall have become false or misleading in any material
respect or as otherwise required by applicable Law, and the Company agrees to
cause the Schedule 14D-9, as so corrected, to be filed with the SEC and
disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent required
by the Exchange Act. Parent, the Purchaser and their counsel shall be given a
reasonable opportunity to review the Schedule 14D-9 before it is filed with
the SEC, and the Company shall give due consideration to the additions,
deletions or changes suggested thereto by Parent, the Purchaser and their
counsel. In addition, the Company shall provide Parent, the Purchaser and
their counsel with (i) a copy of any written comments or telephonic notice of
any oral comments that may be received from the SEC or its staff with respect
to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after receipt thereof and prior to responding
thereto and (ii) a reasonable opportunity to provide comments on that
response (to which due consideration shall be given) and to participate in
such response, including by participating in any discussions with the SEC.

 

(c) In connection with the Offer, the Company shall promptly furnish or cause
to be furnished to the Purchaser mailing labels, security position listings,
non-objecting beneficial owner lists and any other listings or computer files
containing the names, addresses and security positions of the record or
beneficial holders of the Shares as of the most recent practicable date
and shall promptly furnish the Purchaser with such other information
(including updated lists of holders of the Shares and their addresses, mailing
labels, security position listings and non-objecting beneficial owner lists)
and such other assistance as the Purchaser or its agents may reasonably
request in communicating with the record and beneficial holders of Shares.

(d) Subject to the requirements of applicable Laws, and except for such steps
as are necessary to disseminate the Offer Documents to consummate the Offer as
contemplated hereby and any other documents necessary to consummate the Merger
as 

 



15  contemplated hereby, Parent and the Purchaser shall, and Parent and the
Purchaser shall require their Representatives to, keep confidential any
information provided by or on behalf of Company pursuant to this _Section
2.2 _and use all such information only in connection with the Offer, the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated herein and, should the Offer
terminate or if this Agreement shall be terminated, will, in accordance with
the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, promptly deliver and will require
their Representatives to deliver, to the Company all copies, summaries and
extracts of such information then in their possession or control.

 

2.3 _Directors_.

(a) Subject to compliance with applicable Laws, promptly upon acceptance for
payment of such number of Shares as represents at least a majority of the
then-outstanding Shares (determined on a fully diluted basis as of
immediately following the Acceptance Time) pursuant to the Offer (the "
_Acceptance Time_ ") and from time to time thereafter, Parent shall be
entitled to elect or designate such number of directors, rounded up to the
next whole number, on the Company Board as is equal to the product of the
total number of directors on the Company Board (giving effect to the directors
elected or designated by Parent pursuant to this sentence) multiplied by the
percentage that the aggregate number of Shares beneficially owned by Parent,
the Purchaser or any of their respective Affiliates bears to the total number
of Shares then outstanding; _provided_ , _however_ , Parent shall be entitled
to designate at least a majority of the directors on the Company Board (as
long as Parent, the Purchaser and their Affiliates beneficially own a majority
of the outstanding Shares); _provided_ , _further_ , that prior to the
Effective Time, the Company Board shall always have at least two (2) members
who are not officers, directors, employees or designees of Parent or the
Purchaser or any of their Affiliates (" _Purchaser Insiders_ "). If the number
of directors who are not Purchaser Insiders is reduced below two (2) prior to
the Effective Time, the remaining director who is not a Purchaser Insider
shall be entitled to designate a Person to fill such vacancy who is not a
Purchaser Insider and who shall be a director not deemed to be a Purchaser
Insider for all purposes of this Agreement, and the Company shall cause such
designee to be appointed to the Company Board. If, notwithstanding compliance
with the foregoing provisions, the number of directors who are not Purchaser
Insiders is reduced to zero, then the other directors on the Company Board
shall designate and appoint to the Company Board two (2) directors who are not
officers, directors, employees or otherwise affiliated with the Purchaser
or Parent (other than as a result of such designation). After the Acceptance
Time, the Company shall take all actions as are necessary to enable Parents
designees to be so elected or designated to the Company Board (including, if
necessary, seeking the resignations of one or more existing directors or
increasing the size of the Company Board or both) in compliance with
applicable Law. The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
cause Persons designated by Parent to constitute the same percentage as
Persons designated by Parent on the Company Board of (i) each committee of the
Company Board, (ii) each board of directors (or other similar body) of each
Company Subsidiary and (iii) each committee of each such board, in each case
only to the extent permitted by applicable Law.

(b) The Companys obligations to appoint Parents designees to the Company
Board shall be subject to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1
promulgated thereunder. The Company shall promptly take all actions required
pursuant to Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 in order to fulfill its obligations
under this _Section 2.3_ and shall

 



16  include any information required to be disclosed under Section 14(f) and
Rule 14f-1 in the Schedule 14D-9. Parent shall supply or cause to be supplied
to the Company any information with respect to Parent, the Purchaser, their
respective officers, directors and affiliates and proposed designees to the
Company Board required by Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1.

 

(c) Following the election or appointment of Parents designees pursuant to
this _Section 2.3_ and prior to the Effective Time, (i) any amendment or
termination of this Agreement by the Company, (ii) any extension by the
Company of the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other
acts of Parent or the Purchaser hereunder and (iii) any waiver or enforcement
of any of the Companys rights or any of the obligations of Parent or the
Purchaser hereunder will require the consent of, or be taken at the direction
of, a majority of the directors of the Company then in office who are not
Purchaser Insiders (or the approval or direction of the sole director if there
shall only be one (1) director then in office who is not a Purchaser Insider).
Following the election or appointment of Parents designees pursuant to this 
_Section 2.3_ and prior to the Effective Time, any actions with respect to
the enforcement of this Agreement by the Company shall be effected only by the
action of a majority of the directors of the Company then in office who are
not Purchaser Insiders (or the action of the sole director if there shall
only be one (1) director then in office who is not a Purchaser Insider), and
such authorization shall constitute the authorization of the Company Board,
and no other action on the part of the Company, including any action by any
other director of Company, shall be required to authorize any such action.

(d) After the Acceptance Time, the Company shall also, upon Parents request,
take all action necessary to elect to be treated as a "controlled company" as
defined by Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 5615(c) and make all necessary filings and
disclosures associated with such status.

2.4 _Top Up Option_. 

(a) The Company hereby grants to the Purchaser an irrevocable option (the "
_Top Up Option_ "), exercisable only after acceptance by the Purchaser of,
and payment for, Shares tendered in the Offer and thereafter upon the terms
and conditions set forth in this _Section 2.4_, to purchase, for
consideration per Top Up Option Share equal to the Offer Price, up to that
number of newly issued Shares (the " _Top Up Option Shares_ ") equal to the
number of Shares that, when added to the number of Shares owned by Parent and
the Purchaser immediately following the consummation of the Offer, shall
constitute one share more than 90% of the Shares then outstanding on a fully
diluted basis (after giving effect to the issuance of the Top Up Option Shares
but excluding from Purchasers ownership, but not from the
outstanding Shares, Shares tendered pursuant to guaranteed delivery
procedures that have not yet been delivered in settlement or satisfaction of
such guarantee); _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) that the Top-Up Option
shall not be exercisable unless, immediately after such exercise and the
issuance of Shares pursuant thereto, the Short Form Threshold would be reached
(assuming the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares) and (ii) in no event shall
the Top Up Option be exercisable to the extent the number of Shares issuable
upon the exercise of the Top Up Option would exceed the number of the
Companys then authorized and unissued Shares (including Shares held in the
treasury of the Company).

 



17 (b) In the event that the Purchaser wishes to exercise the Top Up Option,
Parent shall give the Company three (3) Business Days prior written notice
specifying the number of Shares that are owned by Parent and the Purchaser
immediately following consummation of the Offer and specifying a place and a
time for the closing of the purchase. The Company shall, as soon as
practicable following receipt of such notice, deliver written notice to the
Purchaser specifying the number of Top Up Option Shares. At the closing of the
purchase of the Top Up Option Shares, Parent or the Purchaser shall pay to
the Company an aggregate purchase price equal to the product of (i) the number
of Top Up Option Shares, multiplied by (ii) the Offer Price as follows: (A)
the portion of the aggregate purchase price equal to the par value of the Top
Up Option Shares shall be paid in cash and (B) the balance of the remaining
aggregate purchase price may be paid (1) in cash or (2) by executing and
delivering to the Company a promissory note having a principal amount equal
to the balance of the remaining aggregate purchase price, or some combination
thereof. Any such promissory note shall be on terms as provided by Parent or
Purchaser to the Company, which terms shall include the following: (w)
the principal amount and accrued interest under the promissory note shall be
payable upon five (5) Business Days following the demand of the Company
therefor, (x) the unpaid principal amount of the promissory note will accrue
simple interest at a per annum rate equal to the short-term applicable
federal rate at the time such promissory note is executed and delivered, (y)
the promissory note may be prepaid in whole or in part at any time, without
penalty or prior notice and (z) the unpaid principal amount and accrued
interest under the promissory note shall immediately become due and payable in
the event that there is a failure to pay interest on the promissory note as
provided therein and such failure continues for a period of 30 days after
written notice from the Company. The Company, Parent and Purchaser acknowledge
and agree that, in any appraisal proceeding related to this Agreement, the
fair value of the Shares subject to the appraisal proceeding shall be
determined in accordance with the DGCL without regard to the exercise by
Purchaser of the Top Up Option, any Shares issued upon exercise of the Top Up
Option or the promissory note referred to in this _Section 2.4(b)_.

 

(c) Parent and the Purchaser acknowledge that the Top Up Option Shares that
the Purchaser may acquire upon exercise of the Top Up Option will not be
registered under the Securities Act and will be issued in reliance upon an
exemption thereunder for transactions not involving a public offering. Parent
and the Purchaser represent and warrant to the Company that the Purchaser is,
or will be upon the purchase of the Top Up Option Shares, an "Accredited
Investor," as defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D under the Securities Act.
The Purchaser agrees that the Top Up Option and the Top Up Option Shares to be
acquired upon exercise of the Top Up Option are being and will be acquired by
the Purchaser for the purpose of investment and not with a view to, or for
resale in connection with, any distribution thereof in violation of the
Securities Act.

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the satisfaction or written waiver (where
permitted by applicable Law) of the conditions set forth in _Article VII_ ,

in the form set forth as _Exhibit B_ hereto, until thereafter changed or

(c) The directors of the Purchaser immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall, from and after the Effective Time, be the initial directors of the
Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with the certificate
of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until their
respective successors shall have been duly elected, designated or qualified,

their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the certificate
of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.

(d) If at any time after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
determine, in its sole discretion, or shall be advised, that any deeds, bills
of sale, instruments of conveyance, assignments, assurances or any other
actions or things are necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm of
record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation its right, title or interest
in, to or under any of the rights, properties or assets of either of the
Company or the Purchaser acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving
Corporation as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger or otherwise to
carry out this Agreement, then the officers and directors of the Surviving
Corporation shall be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on
behalf of either the Company or the Purchaser, all such deeds, bills of sale,
instruments of conveyance, assignments and assurances and to take and do, in
the name and on behalf of each of such corporations or otherwise, all such
other actions and things as may be necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or
confirm any and all right, title or interest in, to and under such rights,
properties or assets in the Surviving Corporation or otherwise to carry out
this Agreement.

to be specified by the parties (the " _Closing Date_ "), such date to be no

Merger, such date and time hereinafter referred to as the " _Effective Time_
".

2.7 _Meeting of Stockholders to Approve the Merger_.

 

(a) If, following the Acceptance Time, the adoption of this Agreement by the
stockholders of the Company is required by applicable Law in order to
consummate the Merger, the Company, acting through the Company Board shall, in
accordance with and subject to the requirements of applicable Law, the Company
Certificate and the Company Bylaws:

 

(i) prepare a preliminary proxy statement for the Special Meeting (together
with any amendments and supplements thereto and any other required proxy
materials, the " _Proxy Statement_ ") relating to the Merger and this
Agreement. The Company shall, with the assistance and approval of Parent, file
the Proxy Statement with the SEC under the Exchange Act, and shall use all
reasonable efforts to respond to any comments of the SEC as promptly as
practicable. Parent, the Purchaser and their counsel shall be given a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the preliminary Proxy
Statement before it is filed with the SEC, and the Company shall give due
consideration to the reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested
thereto by Parent, the Purchaser and their counsel. The Company shall (A)
notify Parent of the receipt of any comments of the SEC with respect to the
Proxy Statement and of any requests by the SEC for any amendment or supplement
thereto or for additional information, (B) provide to Parent promptly copies
of all written correspondence or telephonic notice of oral communications
between the Company or any Company Representative and the SEC with respect
thereto and (C) give Parent and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review
and comment on all responses to requests for additional information
and replies to comments prior to their being filed with, or sent to, the SEC.
Each of the Company, Parent and the Purchaser agrees to use its commercially
reasonable efforts, after consultation with the other Parties, to respond
promptly to all such comments of, and requests by, the SEC. The Company, on
the one hand, and Parent and the Purchaser, on the other hand, agree to
promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the Proxy
Statement, if and to the extent that it shall have become false or misleading
in any material respect or as otherwise required by applicable Law, and the
Company agrees to promptly cause the Proxy Statement, as so corrected, to be
filed with the SEC and, if any such correction is made following the mailing
of the Proxy Statement, mailed to holders of Shares, in each case as and to
the extent required by the Exchange Act;

 

(ii) duly set a record date for, call, give notice of, convene and hold a
special meeting of its stockholders (the " _Special Meeting_ ") as promptly
as

 



20  practicable following consummation of the Offer for the purpose of
considering and taking action upon this Agreement;

(iii) cause the definitive Proxy Statement to be printed and mailed to the
stockholders of the Company; and

(iv) subject to _Section 6.4_ of this Agreement, include in the Proxy
Statement the Company Board Recommendation.

(b) At the Special Meeting or any postponement or adjournment thereof, Parent
shall vote, or cause to be voted, all of the Shares then beneficially owned by
Parent or the Purchaser or with respect to which Parent or the Purchaser
otherwise has, directly or indirectly, sole voting power in favor of the
adoption of this Agreement and to deliver or provide, in its capacity as a
stockholder of the Company, any other approvals that are required
by applicable Law to effect the Merger.

2.8 _Merger Without Meeting of Stockholders_. Notwithstanding the terms of 
_Section 2.7_, if after the Acceptance Time and, if applicable, the
expiration of any "subsequent offering period" provided by the Purchaser in
accordance with this Agreement or the exercise of the Top Up Option, Parent
and the Purchaser shall then hold of record, in the aggregate, at least 90%
of the outstanding Shares (excluding from Purchasers ownership, but not from
the outstanding Shares, Shares tendered pursuant to guaranteed delivery
procedures that have not yet been delivered in settlement or satisfaction of
such guarantee) (the " _Short Form Threshold_ "), the Parties agree to take
all necessary and appropriate action to cause the Merger to become effective
as promptly as practicable without a meeting of stockholders of the Company
in accordance with Section 253 of the DGCL.

ARTICLE III 

CONVERSION OF SECURITIES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

 

3.1 _Conversion of Securities_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of Parent, the Purchaser, the Company or
the holders of any of the following securities:

(a) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Each Share issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (including Shares issuable upon
settlement of Company Stock-Based Awards under _Section 3.4_), other than
Shares to be cancelled in accordance with  _Section 3.1(b) _and other than
Dissenting Shares, shall be converted into the right to receive the Offer
Price (the " _Merger Consideration_ "), payable net to the holder in cash,
without interest, subject to any withholding of Taxes required by applicable
Law in accordance with _Section 3.2(f)_. All Shares that have been converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in this
_Section 3.1 _shall as of the Effective Time no longer be outstanding and
shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and
each certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
Shares (each, a " _Certificate_ ") and each non-certificated Share
represented by book-entry prior to the Effective Time (each, a " _Book-Entry
Share_ ") shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration therefor. Certificates and Book-Entry Shares
previously representing Shares

 



21  (other than any Shares to be cancelled pursuant to _Section 3.1(b)_) shall
be exchanged for the Merger Consideration, without interest, upon the
surrender of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with the
provisions of _Section 3.2_.

(b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock_. All Shares that
are held in the treasury of the Company or owned of record by any Company
Subsidiary, and all Shares owned of record by Parent, the Purchaser or any of
their respective direct or indirect Subsidiaries, including pursuant to the
Top Up Option, shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, with
no payment being made with respect thereto.

(c) _Purchaser Common Stock_. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per
share, of the Purchaser issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into and become one (1) newly and validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01
per share, of the Surviving Corporation. From and after the Effective Time,
all certificates representing the common stock of the Purchaser shall be
deemed for all purposes to represent the number of shares of common stock of
the Surviving Corporation into which they were converted in accordance with
the immediately preceding sentence.

 

(d) _Change in Shares_. If between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time, the outstanding Shares, or securities convertible or
exchangeable into or exercisable for Shares, shall have been changed into a
different number of shares or a different class, by reason of any stock
dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, reverse
split, combination, exchange of shares or any other similar transaction, the
Merger Consideration shall be correspondingly adjusted to reflect such stock
dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, reverse
split, combination, exchange of shares or other similar transaction.

3.2 _Payment for Securities; Surrender of Certificates_

 

(a) _Paying Agent_. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate
a reputable bank or trust company, reasonably acceptable to the Company, to
act as the paying agent for purposes of effecting the payment of the Merger
Consideration in connection with the Merger (the " _Paying Agent_ "). At or
promptly after the Effective Time, Parent or the Purchaser shall deposit, or
cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent the aggregate Merger
Consideration to which holders of Shares shall be entitled at the Effective
Time pursuant to this Agreement, with the exception of the aggregate
Option Payments which Option Payments shall be made in accordance with
_Section 3.4_ below, (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the "
_Exchange Fund_ "). The Exchange Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent as
directed by Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such investment or
losses thereon shall affect the Merger Consideration payable to the holders of
Company Common Stock and following any losses Parent shall promptly provide
additional funds to the Paying Agent for the benefit of the holders of the
shares of the Company Common Stock in the amount of any such losses. Any net
profit resulting from, or interest or income produced by, such investments
shall be payable to the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as Parent directs.
The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose.

 



22 (b) _Procedures for Surrender_. As promptly as practicable after the Effective
Time, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of
Shares which were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
at the Effective Time pursuant to this Agreement: (i) a letter of transmittal,
which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall pass, only upon delivery
of the Certificates or transfer of the Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent,
and shall otherwise be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent
or the Paying Agent may reasonably specify, and (ii) instructions for
effecting the surrender of the Certificates or transfer of Book-Entry Shares
in exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration. Upon (A) surrender of
Certificates for cancellation to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or
agents as may be appointed by Parent, and upon delivery of a letter of
transmittal, duly executed and in proper form, or (B) receipt by the Paying
Agent of an "agents message" in the case of Book-Entry Shares, and, in each
case, such other documents as may be required by the instructions, the holder
of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive the
Merger Consideration for each Share formerly represented by such Certificates
or Book-Entry Shares, payable net to the holder in cash, without interest,
subject to any withholding of Taxes required by applicable Law in accordance
with _Section 3.2(f)_. Any Certificates and Book-Entry Shares so surrendered
shall forthwith be cancelled. If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be
made to a Person other than the Person in whose name any
surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition precedent of
payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or
shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer, and the Person requesting such
payment shall have paid any transfer and other similar Taxes required by
reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the
registered holder of the Certificate so surrendered and shall have established
to the reasonable satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Taxes
either have been paid or are not required to be paid. Payment of the Merger
Consideration with respect to Book-Entry Shares shall only be made to the
Person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares are registered. Until surrendered
as contemplated hereby, each Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be deemed
at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive
upon such surrender, the Merger Consideration in cash as contemplated by
this Agreement, without interest thereon.

(c) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Shares_. At the
Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and
thereafter, there shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares on
the records of the Company. The applicable Merger Consideration paid in
respect of Shares upon surrender of a Certificate or transfer of a Book-Entry
Share in accordance with this _Article III_ shall be deemed to have been paid
in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Shares formerly
represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share. From and after the
Effective Time, the holders of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with
respect to such Shares except as otherwise provided for herein or
by applicable Law. Subject to _Section 3.2(d)_, if after the Effective Time,
Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they
shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Agreement.

 

(d) _Termination of Fund; Abandoned Property; No Liability_. At any time
following six (6) months after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds
(including any net profits, interest

 



23  or income received with respect thereto) made available to the Paying Agent
and not disbursed to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, and
thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look only to the Surviving
Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws)
only as general creditors thereof with respect to the Merger Consideration
payable upon due surrender of their Certificates or transfer of Book-Entry
Shares in compliance with the procedures in _Section 3.2(b)_, without
interest and subject to any withholding of Taxes required by applicable Law in
accordance with _Section 3.2(f)_. If, prior to six (6) years after the
Effective Time (or otherwise immediately prior to such time on which any
payment in respect hereof would escheat to or become the property of any
Governmental Entity pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Laws), any holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares has not
complied with the procedures in _Section 3.2(b)_ to receive payment of the
Merger Consideration to which such holder would otherwise be entitled, the
payment in respect of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving
Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously
entitled thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder of a
Certificate or Book-Entry Shares for Merger Consideration delivered to a
public official in accordance with any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Law.

(e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent
shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such
Certificates to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Merger Consideration
payable in respect of the Shares formerly represented by such Certificates
pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)_ hereof, without interest and subject to any
withholding of Taxes required by applicable Law in accordance with  _Section
3.2(f)_; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent may, in its discretion and as a
condition precedent to the payment of such Merger Consideration, require the
Person claiming such Certificates to be lost, stolen or destroyed to deliver
a bond in such sum as it may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim
that may be made against Parent, the Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or
the Paying Agent with respect to the Certificates alleged to have been lost,
stolen or destroyed.

(f) _Withholding Rights_. Parent, the Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation and
the Paying Agent, as the case may be, shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the relevant Offer Price, Merger Consideration or Option Payment
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Shares or
Company Options, as applicable, such amounts that Parent, the Purchaser, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent is required to deduct and withhold
with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder or any provision of applicable
state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld
by Parent, the Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent
(provided that such amounts are timely remitted to the appropriate
Governmental Entity), such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Shares or Company Options, as
applicable, in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by
Parent, the Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent.

 



24 3.3 _Dissenters  Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and
held by a holder who did not vote in favor of the Merger (or consent thereto
in writing) and who is entitled to demand and has properly demanded appraisal
for such Shares in accordance with, and who complies in all respects with,
Section 262 of the DGCL (such Shares, the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not
be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, and shall
instead represent the right to receive payment of the fair value of such
Dissenting Shares in accordance with and to the extent provided by Section 262
of the DGCL. From and after the Effective Time, a holder of Dissenting Shares
shall not be entitled to exercise any of the voting rights or other rights of
an owner of an Equity Interest of the Surviving Corporation or of a
stockholder of Parent. If any such holder fails to perfect or otherwise
waives, withdraws or loses his right to appraisal under Section 262 of the
DGCL or other applicable Law, then the right of such holder to be paid the
fair value of such Dissenting Shares shall cease and such Dissenting Shares
shall be deemed to have been converted, as of the Effective Time, into
and shall be exchangeable solely for the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, without interest and subject to any withholding of Taxes
required by applicable Law in accordance with _Section 3.2(f)_. The Company
shall give Parent (a) prompt notice of any demands received by the Company
for appraisal of Shares, attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other
instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company relating
to rights to be paid the fair value of Dissenting Shares and (b) the
opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands
for appraisal under the DGCL. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with
respect to, or settle or compromise or offer to make any payment with respect
to, or offer to settle or compromise, any such demands, or approve any
withdrawal of any such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing. 

3.4 _Company Options and Stock-Based Awards_.

(a) At the Acceptance Time: (i) each outstanding, unexpired and unexercised
option to purchase Shares (the " _Company Options_ ") granted under the stock
plans of the Company, including the Company 2008 Stock Incentive Plan and any
other plan, agreement or arrangement (the " _Company Stock Plans_ "), shall
vest and become exercisable; and (ii) each right of any kind, contingent or
accrued, to receive shares of Company Common Stock or benefits measured by
the value of a number of Shares, and each award of any kind consisting of
Shares, granted under Company Stock Plans (including restricted stock,
restricted stock units, and performance share awards), other than Company
Options (each, a " _Company Stock-Based Award_ "), shall vest and the Company
shall deliver shares of Company Common Stock in settlement thereof. Any
outstanding performance share awards that are outstanding at the Acceptance
Time shall be settled at target performance levels.

(b) To the extent not exercised prior to the Effective Time, then upon the
Effective Time, each Company Option shall be deemed to be exercised and
cancelled and each former holder of any such cancelled Company Option shall
become entitled to receive, at the Effective Time or as soon as practicable
thereafter, in consideration of the deemed exercise and cancellation of such
Company Option, a payment in cash (subject to any applicable withholding or
other Taxes required to be withheld by applicable Law in accordance with
Section 3.2(f)), without interest, in an amount equal to the product of (x)
the total number of Shares subject to such Company Option and (y) the excess,
if any, of the Merger Consideration

 



25  over the exercise price per Share subject to such Company Option (such
amounts payable hereunder being referred to as the " _Option Payments_ "),
which Option Payments may, at the option of Parent, be made by or on behalf
of Parent through the payroll system or pursuant to the payroll procedures of
the Company or the Surviving Corporation.

(c) The provisions of this _Section 3.4_ shall survive the consummation of
the Merger.

ARTICLE IV

Purchaser, enforceable against each of them in accordance with its terms,
subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exceptions.

do not, and the performance of this Agreement by Parent and the Purchaser,

or assets or otherwise) the Company or any Company Subsidiary, to return (or
if permitted by the applicable confidentiality agreement, destroy) all
information required to be returned (or, if applicable, destroyed) by such
Person under the terms of the applicable confidentiality agreement and, if
requested by Parent, to enforce such Persons obligation to do so.

(b) Notwithstanding any provisions of this _Section 6.4_, at any time prior
to the Acceptance Time, the Company may (i) provide access to its properties,
Contracts, personnel, books and records and furnish information and data with
respect to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to, and (ii)
participate in discussions or negotiations with, a Person making a Takeover
Proposal that did not arise or result from a violation of this _Section 6.4_
if, prior to providing such access, furnishing such information and entering
into such discussions or negotiations, the Company Board has (A) determined
in its good faith judgment (after having received the advice of its outside
legal counsel and financial advisors of internationally recognized reputation)
that (1) such Takeover Proposal constitutes, or could reasonably be expected
to lead to, a Superior Proposal and (2) the failure to furnish such
information to, or enter into such discussions with, the Person who made such
Takeover Proposal would be reasonably expected to be inconsistent with the
Company Boards fiduciary obligations to the Company and its stockholders
under applicable Law, (B) provided written notice to Parent of its intent to
furnish information or enter into discussions with such Person at least
twenty-four (24) hours prior to taking any such action, and (C) obtained from
such Person an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement (it being understood that
(1) the Company may enter into an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement
without a "standstill" or similar provision or with a "standstill" or similar
provision less restrictive with respect to such Person than the terms of any
"standstill" or similar provision in the Confidentiality Agreement if it
waives or similarly modifies the "standstill" or similar provision in the
Confidentiality Agreement and (2) an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement and
any related agreements shall not include any provision granting such Person
exclusive rights to negotiate with the Company or having the effect of
prohibiting the Company from satisfying its obligations under this Agreement)
and, concurrently with the notice provided in clause (ii)(B), delivered to
Parent a copy of such Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement (for informational
purposes only).

(c) Except as set forth in this _Section 6.4(c)_ or _Section 6.4(d)_,
neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof may (i) withdraw (or not
continue to make), modify, qualify or amend, or publicly propose to withdraw
(or not continue to make), modify, qualify or amend, the Company Board
Recommendation, (ii) make any public statement or take any action inconsistent
with the Company Board Recommendation or (iii) approve, recommend or adopt, or
publicly propose to approve, recommend or adopt, any other transaction of the
type described in the definition of "Takeover Proposal" (any action described
in the foregoing clauses

 



56  (i) - (iii), a " _Company Adverse Recommendation Change_ "). Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if at any time prior to the Acceptance Time and in response to
the receipt of a Superior Proposal that did not arise or result from any
breach of this _Section 6.4(c)_, the Company Board determines in its good
faith judgment (after having received the advice of its outside legal
counsel), that the failure by the Company Board to (A) make a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change, (B) terminate this Agreement or (C) approve, endorse,
adopt, recommend or enter into any Takeover Proposal Agreement with respect to
such Superior Proposal, in each case, would be inconsistent with the Company
Boards fiduciary obligations to the Company and its stockholders under
applicable Law, the Company Board may, with respect to such Superior Proposal,
take any of the actions set forth in the foregoing clauses (A), (B) and (C);
_provided_ , that the Company Board shall not be entitled to exercise its
right to take any of the actions set forth in the foregoing clauses (A), (B)
or (C) pursuant to this _Section 6.4(c)_ unless: 

(1) the Company has provided written notice to Parent (a " _Notice of Superior
Proposal_ ") advising Parent that the Company Board has received a Superior
Proposal promptly after the Company Board determines it has received a
Superior Proposal, stating that the Company Board intends to take any of the
actions set forth in the foregoing clauses (A), (B) and (C) and the manner in
which it intends to do so, specifying the information required to be included
in any notice required to be delivered to Parent under _Section 6.4(e)_;

 

(2) Parent does not, within three (3) Business Days of receipt of the Notice
of Superior Proposal (the " _Notice Period_ "), make a written offer or
proposal to revise the terms of this Agreement in a manner that the Company
Board determines in its good faith judgment, after having received the advice
of a financial advisor of internationally recognized reputation and outside
legal counsel, to be at least as favorable to the Companys stockholders as
such Superior Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that during the Notice Period
the Company shall negotiate in good faith with Parent (to the extent Parent
desires to negotiate) to make such revisions to the terms of this Agreement;
_provided_ , _further_ , that any amendment to the terms of such Superior
Proposal during the Notice Period shall require a new written notice of the
terms of such amended Superior Proposal from the Company and an additional
Notice Period that satisfies this _Section 6.4(c)(2)_; and

 

(3) in the event of a termination of this Agreement pursuant to the foregoing
clause (B), the Company pays the Company Termination Fee pursuant to _Section
8.4(a)_ to Parent prior to or concurrently with such termination.

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to the Acceptance Time,
in response to an Intervening Event, the Company Board may make a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change if the Company Board determines in its good
faith judgment (after having received the advice of a financial advisor of
internationally recognized reputation and outside legal counsel) that, in
light of such Intervening Event, the failure of the Company Board to make a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with the
fiduciary duties of the members of the Company Board to the Company and its
stockholders under applicable Law; _provided_ , that the Company shall not be
entitled to exercise its right to make a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change pursuant to this _Section 6.4(d)_ unless:

 



57 (i) the Company has provided written notice to Parent (a " _Notice of
Intervening Event_ ") advising Parent that an Intervening Event has occurred,
describing the applicable material fact, event, change, development or set of
circumstances giving rise to the Intervening Event, indicating that the
Company Board intends to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change and the
manner in which it intends (or may intend) to do so and including written
evidence of the determination of the Company Board that the applicable
material fact, event, change, development or set of circumstances constitutes
an Intervening Event; and

(ii) Parent does not, within three (3) Business Days of receipt of the Notice
of Intervening Event, make an offer or proposal to revise the terms of this
Agreement, including an increase in, or modification of, the Offer Price, in a
manner that the Company Board determines in its good faith judgment, after
having received the advice of a financial advisor of internationally
recognized reputation and outside legal counsel, is on such terms and
conditions that the failure of the Company Board to make a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change would no longer be inconsistent with the Company
Boards fiduciary duties to the Company and its stockholders under applicable
Law.

(e) The Company shall promptly (and in any event within one (1) Business Day
after the Company attains knowledge thereof) advise Parent in writing of
receipt by the Company, any Company Subsidiary or any Company Representative
of any proposal, inquiry, offer or request (or any amendment thereto)
relating to, that constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead to, a
Takeover Proposal, including any request for discussions or negotiations and,
any request for information relating to the Company or any Company Subsidiary
or for access to the business, properties, assets, books or records of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary. Such notice shall indicate the identity of
the Person making such proposal, inquiry, offer or request and a description
of such proposal, inquiry, offer or request, including the material terms and
conditions (if any) of such proposed Takeover Proposal, and the Company shall
promptly (and in any event within one (1) Business Day after receipt by the
Company) provide to Parent copies of any written materials received by the
Company in connection with any of the foregoing. The Company agrees that it
shall keep Parent informed of the general status and material details of
(including discussions with respect to or amendments or proposed amendments
to) (i) any such proposal, inquiry, offer or request and (ii) any information
requested of or provided by the Company pursuant to _Section 6.4(b)_. The
Company agrees that it shall simultaneously provide to Parent any nonpublic
information concerning the Company that may be made available pursuant to
_Section 6.4(b_) to any other Person in response to any such proposal,
inquiry, offer or request (or any amendment thereto).

(f) Nothing in this _Section 6.4 _shall prohibit or restrict the Company or
the Company Board from taking and/or disclosing to the stockholders of the
Company a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2 promulgated under
the Exchange Act; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall this 
_Section 6.4(f) _affect the obligations of the Company specified in _Section
6.4(c)_ and _Section 6.4(d)_; _provided_ , _further_ , that neither the
Company Board nor any committee thereof shall make a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change in connection with such disclosure (it being understood
that any "stop, look and listen" communication by or on behalf of the Company
pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) shall not be considered a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change). Any Company Adverse

 



58  Recommendation Change shall not change the approval of the Company Board for
purposes of causing any state takeover statute or other state Law to be
inapplicable to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

6.5 _Further Action; Reasonable Best Efforts_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including _Section
6.4_, each Party shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to

advisable under applicable Laws to consummate and make effective the Offer,
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, including using

by applicable Law to be filed in order to consummate the Offer, the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated hereby and the taking of such actions
as are reasonably necessary to obtain any requisite approvals, consents,

party challenging or affecting this Agreement or the consummation of the
Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby; and (iv)

undertaking or condition, to enter into any consent decree, to make any
divestiture, to accept any operational restriction, or take any other
action that, in the reasonable judgment of Parent or the Purchaser, could be
expected to limit the right of Parent or the Purchaser to own or operate all
or any portion of their respective businesses, product lines or assets or
limit Parents freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to retain,
the businesses, product lines or assets of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries or any portion thereof or any of Parents or its Subsidiaries or
its Affiliates other businesses, product lines or assets. With regard to any
Governmental Entity, neither the Company nor any of its Affiliates shall,
without Parents written consent, which may be withheld in Parents sole
discretion, discuss or commit to any divestiture transaction, or discuss or
commit to alter their businesses, product lines or commercial practices in any
way, or otherwise take or commit to take any action that limits Parents
freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to retain any of the
businesses, product lines or assets of, the Company or any Company Subsidiary
or otherwise receive the full benefits of this Agreement.

 



59 (c) Each Party shall furnish all information required to be included in any
application or other filing to be made pursuant to the rules and regulations
of any Governmental Entity in connection with the Offer, the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby. Subject to applicable Law, Parent and
the Company shall have the right to review in advance, and, to the extent
reasonably practicable, each will consult the other on, all the information
relating to the other and each of their respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates
that appears in any filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any

investigation or litigation by, or negotiations with, any Governmental Entity

gives the other Parties the opportunity to attend and participate thereat and
(iii) furnish the other Parties with copies of all correspondence, filings

Agreement, the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby shall be a joint release mutually agreed upon by the Company and

consent of (a) the Company, in the event the disclosing party is Parent, the
Purchaser, any other member of the Parent Group, if applicable, or any Parent
Representative, or (b) Parent, in the event the disclosing party is the
Company, any Company Subsidiary or any Company Representative, in each case,
with such consent not to be unreasonably conditioned, delayed or withheld;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if a Party determines, based upon advice of
counsel, that a press release or public announcement is required by
applicable Law or the rules or regulations of any applicable stock exchange,
such Party may make such press release or public announcement, in which case
the disclosing Party shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to provide
the other Parties reasonable time to comment on such release or announcement
in advance of such issuance; _provided_ , _further_ , that this _Section 6.6_
shall terminate upon a Company Adverse Recommendation Change; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that each of Parent and the Company may make public statements in
response to specific questions by the press, analysts, investors or those
attending industry conferences or financial analyst conference calls, so long
as any such statements are not materially inconsistent with previous press
releases, public disclosures or public statements made jointly by Parent and
the Company and do not reveal material, nonpublic information regarding the
other Parties, the Offer, the Merger or the transactions contemplated hereby.

6.7 _Employee Matters_. 

(a) Parent hereby agrees that, for the period immediately following the
Effective Time through and including the eighteen (18) month anniversary of
the Effective Time, it shall, or it shall cause the Surviving Corporation and
its Subsidiaries to, provide (x) a level of base salary and wages to each
Person who is employed by the Company or any Company Subsidiary as of the
Effective Time (including Persons on disability or leave of absence, whether
paid or unpaid) (each such Person, a " _Continuing Employee_ ") and (y)
Benefit Plans for the benefit or welfare of any Continuing Employee, whether
maintained by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries
(each such plan, a " _Surviving Corporation Benefit Plan_ "), that are
substantially similar in the aggregate to the base salary, wages and benefits
(except with respect to equity-based compensation) provided to the Continuing
Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that Parent shall be permitted to (i) change or modify benefit levels prior
to such date if necessary or reasonably advisable in connection with changes
in applicable Law and (ii) take any and all actions that may be necessary to
migrate Continuing Employees to the employee benefit plans, policies,
and arrangements of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary.

(b) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, or it shall cause
the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, honor in accordance with
their terms, all Contracts, agreements, arrangements, programs, policies,
plans and commitments of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time that are applicable to any
current employees of the Company or any Company Subsidiary,

 



61  including the Executive Change in Control Plan and Corporate Change in
Control Plan and all severance plans (to the extent such Contracts,
agreements, arrangements, programs, policies, commitments and severance plans
are listed in _Section 6.7(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule_).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this _Section 6.7(b)_ shall
prohibit Parent, or the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries, from
amending or terminating any such Contract, agreement, arrangement, program,
policy, plan or commitment of the Company or any Company Subsidiaries at any
time after the Effective Time in accordance with its terms.

 

(c) Nothing herein shall be deemed to be a guarantee of employment for any
Continuing Employee, or to restrict the right of the Surviving Corporation or
its Subsidiaries to terminate any Continuing Employee. The provisions of this
_Section 6.7 _are solely for the benefit of the parties to this Agreement,
and no employee or former employee or any other individual associated
therewith or any employee benefit plan or trustee thereof shall be regarded
for any purpose as a third party beneficiary of this Agreement, and nothing
herein shall be construed as an amendment to any employee benefit plan for
any purpose. In addition, nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to
limit the right of Parent or any of its Affiliates (including the Surviving
Corporation) to amend or terminate any employee benefit plan in accordance
with the terms thereof. 

(d) With respect to any Surviving Corporation Benefit Plan that is a welfare
benefit plan, program or arrangement (a " _Purchaser Welfare Benefit Plan_ ")
and in which a Continuing Employee may be eligible to participate on or after
the Effective Time, Parent shall, or it shall cause the Surviving Corporation
and its Subsidiaries to, (i) waive, or use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause its insurance carrier to waive, all limitations as to pre-existing,
waiting period or actively-at-work conditions, if any, with respect to
participation and coverage requirements applicable to each Continuing
Employee under such Purchaser Welfare Benefit Plan to the same extent waived
under a comparable Company Benefit Plan and (ii) provide credit to each
Continuing Employee (and such Continuing Employees beneficiaries) for
any co-payments, deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses paid by such
Continuing Employee (and such Continuing Employees beneficiaries) under the
comparable Company Benefit Plan during the relevant plan year, up to and
including the Effective Time. 

6.8 _Indemnification of Directors and Officers_.

 

(a) The certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation
and the comparable organizational or governing documents of its Subsidiaries
shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification,
advancement of expenses and exculpation of former or present directors,
officers, employees and agents than are set forth in the Company Certificate
and the Company Bylaws (or the equivalent organizational or governing
documents of the relevant Company Subsidiary, as applicable) as in effect on
the date hereof, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise
modified for a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time in any manner
that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any such Persons, unless
such modification is required by Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the
event any claim is asserted against any Person entitled to the protections of
such provisions within such six (6) year period, such provisions shall not be
modified with respect to such Person until the final disposition of any such
claim.

 



62 (b) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Law, and, without limiting the foregoing, as
required pursuant to any indemnity agreements of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary, each present and former director, officer, employee and agent of
the Company and each Company Subsidiary (collectively, the " _Indemnified
Parties_ ") against any costs or expenses (including attorneys fees and
expenses), judgments, inquiries, fines, losses, claims, settlements, damages
or liabilities incurred in connection with any actual or threatened claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to (i) the fact
that the Indemnified Party is or was an officer, director, employee, fiduciary
or agent of the Company or any Company Subsidiary and (ii) any and all matters
pending, existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including
this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby), whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time.
Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall advance expenses (including
reasonable legal fees and expenses) incurred in the defense of any Action
with respect to matters subject to indemnification pursuant to this Section
6.8 in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Company Certificate,
the Company Bylaws, the certificate of incorporation and bylaws, or
equivalent organizational or governing documents, of each Company Subsidiary,
and indemnification agreements, if any, in existence on the date of this
Agreement.

 

(c) For a period of six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall cause to be maintained in effect the current
policies of directors and officers liability insurance maintained by the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries (the " _D andO Insurance_") or provide
substitute policies or purchase a "tail policy," in all cases, of at least
the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions and from
carriers with comparable credit ratings which are no less advantageous to the
insureds with respect to claims arising from facts or events, actions or
omissions on or before the Effective Time, except that in no event shall the
Surviving Corporation be required to pay with respect to the DandO Insurance in
respect of any one policy year more than two hundred percent (200%) of the
last annual premium paid prior to the date of this Agreement (which amount is
set forth in _Section 6.8(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule_) (the "
_Maximum Amount_ "), and if the Surviving Corporation is unable to obtain the
insurance required by this _Section 6.8_ it shall obtain as much comparable
insurance as possible for the years within such six-year period for an annual
premium equal to the Maximum Amount, in respect of each policy year within
such period. The Company may in lieu of the foregoing insurance coverage,
following consultation with Parent, purchase, prior to the Effective Time, a
six-year prepaid "tail policy" on terms and conditions (in both amount
and scope) providing substantially equivalent benefits, and from a carrier or
carriers with comparable credit ratings, as the current DandO Insurance with
respect to matters arising on or before the Effective Time, covering, without
limitation, the transactions contemplated hereby.

(d) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns shall (i) consolidate with or merge into any other
Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfer all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, in each such case, proper
provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation (or acquirer of such assets), as the case may be, shall
assume all of the obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation set
forth in this _Section 6.8_.

 



63 (e) The rights of each Indemnified Party under this _Section 6.8 _shall be
in addition to any right such Person might have under the Company Certificate
and the Company Bylaws, the Certificate of Incorporation and the Bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation or any comparable organizational or governing documents
of their respective Subsidiaries, or under any agreement of any Indemnified
Party with the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
Subsidiaries. The provisions of this _Section 6.8 _shall survive the
consummation of the Merger and are intended to be for the benefit of, and
shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties and their respective
heirs and representatives.

6.9 _State Takeover Statutes_. If any "control share acquisition", "fair
price", "business combination" or other anti-takeover Laws becomes or is
deemed to be applicable to the Company, Parent or the Purchaser, the Offer or
the Merger, including the acquisition of Shares pursuant thereto, or any other
transaction contemplated by this Agreement, each of Parent, the Purchaser, the
Company and their respective boards of directors shall take all reasonable
action necessary so that such transactions may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated hereby or otherwise act to eliminate or
minimize the effect of such statute or regulation on this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby.

6.10 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
and shall be permitted to, take all such steps as may reasonably be necessary
to cause the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any
dispositions of Shares (including any derivative securities with respect to
such Shares) by each Person who is or will be subject to the reporting
requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company,
to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 

6.11 _Rule 14d-10(d) Matters_. Prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company
(acting through the Compensation Committee of the Company Board) will take
all such steps as may be required to cause each agreement, arrangement or
understanding entered into by the Company or the Company Subsidiaries on or
after the date hereof with any of its officers, directors or employees
pursuant to which consideration is paid to such officer, director or employee
to be approved as an "employment compensation, severance or other employee
benefit arrangement" within the meaning of Rule 14d-10(d)(1) under the
Exchange Act and to satisfy the requirements of the non-exclusive safe harbor
set forth in Rule 14d-10(d) under the Exchange Act.

6.12 _Parent Agreement Concerning Purchaser_. Parent agrees to cause and
enable the Purchaser to comply with its obligations under this Agreement.

6.13 _Notification of Certain Matters_.

(a) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give
prompt notice to the Company, of (i) the occurrence, or non-occurrence, of any
event which could reasonably be expected to cause any of their respective
representations or warranties contained in this Agreement to become untrue or
inaccurate in any material respect and (ii) any failure of the Company, Parent
or the Purchaser, as the case may be, to materially comply with or materially
satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied

Subsidiaries which relates to the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

this _Section 6.13_ shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies
available hereunder to the Party receiving such notice and (ii) the failure to
comply with this _Section 6.13_ will not constitute the failure of any
condition set forth in _Article VII_ or _Annex I_ to be satisfied unless the
underlying event would independently result in the failure of a such condition
to be so satisfied.

 

6.14 _Tax Matters_. Prior to commencement of the Offer by the Purchaser, the
Company shall deliver to Parent a correct, complete and duly executed IRS
Form W-9.

whose breach of this Agreement has been the primary cause or primarily
resulted in the failure of the Acceptance Time to have occurred on or before
the Outside Date;

(ii) if the Offer (as it may have been extended pursuant to _Section 2.1_)

to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(b)(ii) _shall not

(iii) if any Restraint restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting (A)
prior to the Acceptance Time, the acceptance for payment of, or payment for,

right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(b)(iii)_

(c) by the Company prior to the Acceptance Time:

(i) if Parent or the Purchaser fails to commence (within the meaning of Rule

any of its covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement;

 

(ii) if (A) the Company Board has received a Superior Proposal, (B) the

Company has complied in all material respects with _Section 6.4_, and (D)
prior to or concurrent with such termination, the Company pays the Company

there is no Parent Material Adverse Effect;

(d) by Parent prior to the Acceptance Time:

(B) Parent shall have delivered to the Company written notice of such breach
or failure to perform and (C) either such breach or failure to perform is not

I_ would be satisfied.

8.2 _Effect of Termination_. Except as otherwise set forth in this _Section
8.2_, in the event of a valid termination of this Agreement by either the
Company or Parent as provided in  _Section 8.1_, this Agreement shall
forthwith become void and there shall be no liability or obligation on the
part of Parent, the Purchaser or the Company hereunder; _provided_ , _however_
, that the provisions of this  _Section 8.2_, _Section 6.3(b)_, _Section
8.3_, _Section 8.4_ and _Article IX_ shall remain in full force and effect
and survive any termination of this Agreement; _provided_ , _further_ , that,
except as set forth in _Section 8.4(b)_, no Party shall be relieved or
released from any liabilities or damages arising out of fraud or its material
and intentional breach of any provision of this Agreement.

 

8.3 _Fees and Expenses_. Except as otherwise expressly set forth in this
Agreement, all fees and expenses incurred in connection herewith and the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the Party incurring, or
required to incur, such fees and expenses, whether or not the Offer or the
Merger is consummated.

 

8.4 _Company Termination Fee_.

(a) If this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to _Section
8.1(c)(ii)_ or by Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)(i)_, then the Company
shall pay to Parent (or as directed by Parent), by wire transfer of same day
funds, $23,450,000 (the " _Company Termination Fee_ ") prior to or
concurrently with such termination. If this Agreement is terminated by either
the Company or Parent pursuant to  _Section 8.1(b)(i)_ or _Section
8.1(b)(ii)_ or by Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)(ii)_, then, in the event
that, (i) prior to the

 



67  occurrence of the action or event that gave rise to the Companys or
Parents right to terminate pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)(i)_, _Section
8.1(b)(ii)_ or  _Section 8.1(d)(ii)_, as applicable, any Third Party shall
have publicly made, proposed, communicated or disclosed an intention to make a
Takeover Proposal, which Takeover Proposal was not retracted or rescinded
prior to the occurrence of the action or event that gave rise to the
Companys or Parents right to terminate pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)(i)_,
_Section 8.1(b)(ii)_ or _Section 8.1(d)(ii)_, as applicable and (ii) within
twelve (12) months of the termination of this Agreement, the Company enters
into a definitive agreement with respect to a Takeover Proposal or any
Takeover Proposal is consummated (whether or not the applicable Takeover
Proposal is the same as the original Takeover Proposal publically made,
proposed, communicated or disclosed), then the Company shall pay, or cause to
be paid, to Parent, on the earlier of the date the Company enters into a
Takeover Proposal Agreement or the date a Takeover Proposal is consummated,
by wire transfer of same day funds, the Company Termination Fee. For purposes
of this _Section 8.4(a)_, each reference in the definition of Takeover
Proposal to "fifteen percent (15%)" will be deemed to be references to "fifty
percent (50%)."

(b) If paid, the Company Termination Fee shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy of Parent, the Purchaser and their Affiliates against the
Company, any Company Subsidiary and any Company Representative for any loss or
damage suffered as a result of the breach of any representation, warranty or
covenant contained in this Agreement by the Company, any Company Subsidiary
or any Company Representative and the failure of the Offer or the Merger to be
consummated and, upon payment of the Company Termination Fee in accordance
with _Section 8.4(a)_, none of the Company, any Company Subsidiary or any
Company Representative shall have further liability or obligation to Parent,
the Purchaser or any other Person relating to or arising out of this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;  _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the provisions of this _Section 8.4(b)_ shall be disregarded and
_Section 8.2_ shall apply if the Company, any Company Subsidiary or any
Company Representative shall have breached any provision of _Section 6.4_.
For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the Company be obligated to pay,
or cause to be paid, the Company Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

 

(c) The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this _Section
8.4_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
In the event that the Company shall fail to pay the Company Termination Fee
when due, the Company shall also be liable for the costs and expenses actually
incurred or accrued by Parent and the Purchaser (including fees and expenses
of counsel) in connection with the collection under and enforcement of this
_Section 8.4_.

8.5  _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, Parent,
the Purchaser or the Company may, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
(a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations of any other
Party under this Agreement, (b) waive any breach or inaccuracy in the
representations and warranties of any other Party contained herein or in any
instrument delivered pursuant hereto or (c) waive compliance with any of the
covenants or agreements of any other Party or any condition to the
obligations of the waiving Party contained herein; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that after the Company Stockholder Approval has been obtained, no extension or
waiver that, by Law or in accordance with the rules of any relevant stock
exchange, requires further approval by the stockholders of the Company may be

 



68  made without such stockholder approval. Any such extension or waiver shall
be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed by the Party or
Parties to be bound thereby. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the failure or
delay of any Party to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or
otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of those rights, nor shall any single
or partial exercise of any right under this Agreement preclude any other or
further exercise of any rights hereunder.

8.6 _Amendment_. Subject to _Section 2.3(c)_, at any time prior to the
Effective Time, this Agreement may be amended by the Parties by action taken
by or on behalf of their respective Boards of Directors; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, after the Company Stockholder Approval has been obtained,
no amendment that, by Law or in accordance with the rules of any relevant
stock exchange, requires further approval by the stockholders of the Company
may be made without such stockholder approval; _provided_ , _further_ , that
after the Acceptance Time, Section 2.4 shall not be amended in a manner that
adversely affects the rights of the stockholders of the Company other than
Parent, Purchaser or their respective wholly owned Subsidiaries. This
Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed by
Parent, the Purchaser and the Company.

shall be null and void, except that Parent and the Purchaser may assign all or
any of their rights and obligations hereunder to any Affiliate of Parent
organized and incorporated in the United States (but no such assignment shall
relieve Parent or the Purchaser, as the case may be, of its obligations
hereunder). No assignment by any Party shall relieve such Party of any of

property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such court or from any
legal process commenced in such courts (whether through service of notice,
attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of
judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise) and (iii) to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law, any claim that (A) the Action in such court is
brought in an inconvenient forum, (B) the venue of such Action is improper

taken by any Governmental Entity, other than the application to the Offer or
the Merger of applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act, that (x) is, in
the reasonable judgment of Parent and the Purchaser, likely, individually or
in the aggregate, to result, directly or indirectly, in any of the
consequences referred to in clauses (A) through (D) of paragraph (i) above, or
(y) has the effect of making the Offer, the Merger or any other transaction

shall not have been cured;

deemed a waiver of any such right and each such right shall be deemed an
ongoing right which may be asserted at any time and from time to time.

The capitalized terms used in this _Annex I_ and not defined in this _Annex I_
shall have the meanings set forth in the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "
_Merger Agreement")_ , dated as of March 17, 2011, by and among Parent, the

2\. Each person who was or is made a party or is threatened to be made a party
to or is involved in any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, crimina1,
administrative or investigative (hereinafter a "proceeding"), by reason of the
fact that he or she, or a person for whom he or she is the legal
representative, is or was a director or officer of the Corporation or is or
was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer,
employee, agent or manager of another corporation or of a partnership, limited
liability company, joint venture, trust, nonprofit entity, or other
enterprise, including service with respect to employee benefit plans, whether
the basis of such proceeding is alleged action either in an official capacity
as a director or officer or in any other capacity while serving as a director
or officer, shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Corporation to the
fullest extent authorized by the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of
any such amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the
Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than said law permitted
the Corporation to provide prior to such amendment), against all expenses,
liability and loss (including attorneys fees, judgments, fines, excise
taxes pursuant to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as
amended, or penalties and amounts paid or to be paid in settlement) reasonably
incurred or suffered by such person in connection therewith and such
indemnification shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director
or officer and shall inure to the benefit of his or her estate, heirs,
executors, administrators, legatees, distributees, and personal and legal
representatives; provided, however, that the Corporation shall indemnify any
such person seeking indemnification in connection with a proceeding (or part
thereof) initiated by such person only if such proceeding (or part thereof)
was authorized by the Board of Directors of the Corporation. The right to
be indemnified conferred in this Article Eighth shall be a contract right and
shall include the right to be paid by the Corporation the expenses incurred in
defending any such proceeding in advance of its final Disposition; provided,
however, that the payment of such expenses incurred by the director or
officer in his or her capacity as a director or officer (and not in any other
capacity in which service was or is to be rendered by such person while a
director or officer, including, without limitation, service to an employee
benefit plan), in advance of the final disposition of proceeding, shall be
made only upon delivery to the Corporation of an undertaking, by or on behalf
of such director or officer, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall
ultimately be determined that such director or officer is not entitled to be
indemnified under this Article Eighth or otherwise. The Corporation may also
provide indemnification to employees and agents of the Corporation with the
same scope and effect as the foregoing indemnification of directors and
officers.

 



A-2  3\. The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by this Article
Eighth shall not limit or exclude any rights, indemnities or limitations of
liability to which any person may be entitled, whether as a matter of law,
under the By-Laws of the Corporation, by agreement, vote of the stockholders
or disinterested directors of the Corporation or otherwise.

4\. The Corporation may maintain insurance, at its expense, to protect itself
and any director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation or another
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any
such expense, liability or loss, whether or not the Corporation would have the
power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability or loss under
the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.

5\. Any amendment, repeal or modification of any of the provisions of this
Article Eighth, including the adoption of any provision of the certificate of
incorporation of the Corporation inconsistent with this Article Eighth, shall
not adversely affect any right or protection hereunder of any director,
officer or other person in respect of any proceeding (regardless of when such
proceeding is first threatened, commenced or completed) arising out of, or
related to, any act or omission occurring, or any state of facts existing, at
or prior to the time of such amendment, repeal or modification. The rights to
indemnification and to the advancement of expenses provided by, or granted
pursuant to, this Article Eighth shall continue notwithstanding that the
person has ceased to be a director or officer of the Corporation and shall
inure to the benefit of the estate, heirs, executors, administrators, legatees
and distributes of such person.

NINTH:

1\. From time to time any of the provisions of this Certificate
of Incorporation may be amended, altered or repealed in accordance with the
laws of the State of Delaware. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, this Certificate of Incorporation may be amended from time
to time to increase the authorized number of shares of Common Stock set forth
above, without the separate vote by the Common Stock voting as a class.

 

2\. The Board of Directors shall have the power to adopt, amend or repeal the
Bylaws.

the Board of Directors shall not be required to be given. The Board of
Directors from time to time may provide by resolution for the holding of
regular meetings and fix the time and place (which may be within or outside
the state of incorporation) thereof. Notice of such regular meetings need not
be given; provided, however, that in case the Board of Directors shall fix or

in person at such meeting.

 

Section 2.07 _Quorum and Vote_. At all meetings of the Board of Directors, the
presence of a majority of the total authorized number of Directors under
Section 2.02 hereof shall be necessary and sufficient to constitute a quorum

the vote of a majority of the total number of Directors present and acting at
a meeting at which a quorum is present shall be the act of the Board of
Directors. In the absence of a quorum, a majority of the Directors present may
adjourn the meeting from time to time, until a quorum shall be present.

 

Section 2.08 _Action Without a Meeting_. Any action required or permitted to
be taken at any meeting of the Board of Directors or any meeting of a
Committee of the Board of Directors may be taken without a meeting, if written
consents thereto are signed by all members of the Board or Committee and such

either for or without cause, upon the affirmative vote of the holders of a
majority of the outstanding shares of stock of the Corporation entitled to
vote for the election of such Director, given at a special meeting of such
stockholders called for the purpose. Any vacancy in the Board of Directors
caused by any such removal may be filled at such meeting by a vote of the
stockholders entitled to vote for the election of the Directors so

 



B-3   removed. If such stockholders do not fill such vacancy at such meeting, such
vacancy may be filled in the manner provided in Section 2.12 hereof.

 

Section 2.12 _Vacancies and Newly Created Directorships_. If any vacancies
shall occur in the Board of Directors, by reason of death, resignation,
removal or otherwise, or if the authorized number of Directors shall be
increased, the Directors then in office shall continue to act, and such
vacancies may be filled by a majority of the Directors then in office, though
less than a quorum, and the Directors so chosen shall hold office until the
next annual election and until their successors are duly elected and
qualified, unless sooner displaced. Any such vacancies or newly created
Directorships may also be filled by a vote of the stockholders entitled to
vote for the election of Directors.

of any committee designated by the Board of Directors, in the performance of
his or her duties, shall be fully protected in relying in good faith on the

any personal liability to the Corporation or its stockholders for monetary
damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, provided that this
provision shall not eliminate or limit the liability of a director (i) for any
breach of the directors duty of loyalty to the Corporation or its
stockholders, (ii) for acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve
intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law, (iii) under Section 174
of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (or any
comparable provisions of the law of the state of incorporation), or (iv) for
any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit.

(b) Each person who was or is made a party or is threatened to be made a party
to or is involved in any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative (hereinafter a "proceeding"), by reason of
the fact that he or she, or a person for whom he or she is the legal
representative, is or was a director or officer of the Corporation or is or
was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer,
employee, agent or manager of another corporation or of a partnership, limited
liability

 



B-8   company, joint venture, trust, nonprofit entity, or other enterprise,
including service with respect to employee benefit plans, whether the basis of
such proceeding is alleged action either in an official capacity as a
director or officer or in any other capacity while serving as a director or
officer, shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Corporation to the
fullest extent authorized by the laws of the state of incorporation, as
the same exists or may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such
amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the Corporation to
provide broader indemnification rights than said law permitted the Corporation
to provide prior to such amendment), against all expenses, liability and loss
(including attorneys fees, judgments, fines, excise taxes pursuant to the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, or penalties and
amounts paid or to be paid in settlement) reasonably incurred or suffered by
such person in connection therewith and such indemnification shall continue as
to a person who has ceased to be a director or officer and shall inure to the
benefit of his or her estate, heirs, executors, administrators, legatees,
distributees, and personal and legal representatives; provided, however, that,
the Corporation shall indemnify any such person seeking indemnification in
connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person only
if such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the Board of Directors
of the Corporation. The right to be indemnified conferred in this Section 7.01
shall be a contract right and shall include the right to be paid by the
Corporation the expenses incurred in defending any such proceeding in advance
of its final disposition; provided, however, that, the payment of such
expenses incurred by the director or officer in his or her capacity as a
director or officer (and not in any other capacity in which service was or is
to be rendered by such person while a director or officer, including, without
limitation, service to an employee benefit plan), in advance of the final
disposition of proceeding, shall be made only upon delivery to the
Corporation of an undertaking, by or on behalf of such director or officer, to
repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined that such
director or officer is not entitled to be indemnified under this Article or
otherwise. The Corporation may provide indemnification to employees and agents
of the Corporation with the same scope and effect as the foregoing
indemnification of directors and officers.

 

(c) The indemnification provided by this Section 7.01 shall not limit or
exclude any rights, indemnities or limitations of liability to which any
person may be entitled, whether as a matter of law, under the Certificate of
Incorporation of the Corporation, these Bylaws, by agreement, vote of the
stockholders or disinterested directors of the Corporation or otherwise.

 

(d) If a claim under paragraph (b) of this Section 7.01 is not paid in full by
the Corporation within thirty (30) days after a written claim has been
received by the Corporation, the claimant may at any time thereafter bring
suit against the Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim and, if
successful in whole or in part, the claimant shall be entitled to be paid
also the expense of prosecuting such claim. In any such action, the
Corporation shall have the burden of proving that the claimant is not entitled
to the requested indemnification and/or advancement of expenses under
this Section 7.01(d).

 



B-9  (e) The Corporation may maintain insurance, at its expense, to protect itself
and any director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation or another
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any
such expense, liability or loss, whether or not the Corporation would have the
power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability or loss under
the laws of the state of incorporation.

(f) The provisions of this Article VII shall constitute a contract between
the Corporation, on the one hand, and, on the other hand, each individual who
serves or has served as a director or officer of the Corporation (whether
before or after the adoption of this Article VII), in consideration of such
persons past or current and any future performance of services for the
Corporation and pursuant to this Article VII the Corporation intends to be
legally bound to each such current or former director or officer of the
Corporation. With respect to current and former directors or officers of the
Corporation, the rights conferred under this Article VII are present
contractual rights, and such rights are fully vested, and shall be deemed to
have vested fully, immediately upon adoption of this bylaw. With respect to
any directors or officers of the Corporation who commence service following
adoption of this bylaw, the rights conferred under this provisions shall be
present contractual rights, and such rights shall fully vest, and be deemed
to have vested fully, immediately upon such director or officer commencing
service as a director or officer of the Corporation. Neither amendment nor
repeal nor modification of any provision of this Article VII nor the adoption
of any provision of the Certificate of Incorporation inconsistent with this
Article VII shall eliminate or reduce the effect of this Article VII in
respect of any act or omission occurring, or any cause of action or claim
that accrues or arises or any state of facts existing, at the time of or
before such amendment, repeal, modification or adoption of an inconsistent
provision (even in the case of a proceeding based on such a state of facts
that is commenced after such time). The rights to indemnification and to
advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to, this Article VII
shall continue notwithstanding that the person has ceased to be a director or
officer of the Corporation and shall inure to the benefit of the estate,
heirs, executors, administrators, legatees and distributes of such person. For
purposes of this Section (f), "director of officer of the Corporation"
includes any person who, while as a director or officer of the Corporation,
is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer,
employee, agent or manager of another corporation or of a partnership, limited
liability company, joint venture, trust, enterprise or nonprofit
entity, including service with respect to employee benefit plans.
