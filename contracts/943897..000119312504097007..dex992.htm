9 ARTICLE II



_SALE AND PURCHASE OF THE SHARES_



2.1. _Sale and Purchase of the Shares_. Subject to the terms and conditions
hereof, the Seller will sell the Shares to the Buyer, free and clear of all
Liens, and the Buyer will purchase the Shares from the Seller, for an
aggregate purchase price of $210,000,000, _minus_ the Reduction Amount, _plus_
the amount, if any, by which Closing Working Capital exceeds Target Working
Capital, or _minus_ the amount, if any, by which Target Working Capital
exceeds Closing Working Capital (the " _Purchase Price_ ").



2.2. _Estimate Certificate_. Two business days prior to the Closing Date, the
Seller shall deliver a certificate (the " _Estimate Certificate_ ") setting
forth a reasonable estimate of the Purchase Price and each element thereof,
based on all available information (including, without limitation, payoff
letters and other closing documentation relevant to the computation of the
Reduction Amount) together with reasonable supporting documentation for such
calculation. The estimate of the Purchase Price shall include an estimate of
Closing Working Capital, which estimate of Closing Working Capital shall be
determined in accordance with Section 3.1. The Buyer shall be given
reasonable access to such books and records and other information relevant to,
and the opportunity to consult responsible personnel for purposes of,
confirming or disputing the computation of the Purchase Price set forth in
the Estimate Certificate; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Reduction Amount
shall be adjusted as necessary on the Closing Date to reflect actual payments
to be made pursuant to Sections 7.7 and 7.8 (the " _Estimated Purchase Price_
"). Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no position taken or
agreement made by the Buyer or the Seller with respect to the Estimated
Purchase Price shall prejudice the rights of the parties with respect to the
post-Closing adjustment provided in Article III or shall in any way delay or
extend the Closing Date.



2.3. _Closing Date Distribution_. On the day prior to the Closing, the Company
shall have the option of making a cash distribution (the " _Closing Date
Distribution_ ") to Seller in an aggregate amount equal to the amount of all
or a portion of all cash on hand as of the close of business on the business
day immediately preceding the Closing Date, provided the amount of such
Closing Date Distribution has been reflected in the computation of Closing
Working Capital set forth in the Estimate Certificate.



2.4. _Closing_. The closing of the sale and purchase of the Shares (the "
_Closing_ ") shall take place at 10:00 a.m. (EST) in the offices of Debevoise
and Plimpton LLP, at 919 Third Avenue, New York, New York, 10022 on the second
business day after the waiver or satisfaction of all conditions to Closing
(other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied
at Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions), or
on such other date as the Buyer and the Seller may mutually agree in writing
(the " _Closing Date_ "). At the Closing:



 

10 (a) The Seller will deliver to the Buyer ( _i_ ) one or more certificates
representing all of the Shares of the Company owned by the Seller, duly
endorsed in blank or accompanied by stock powers or other instruments of
transfer duly executed in blank, and bearing or accompanied by all requisite
stock transfer stamps, ( _ii_ ) two executed counterparts of this Agreement,
( _iii_ ) two executed counterparts of all documents and certificates required
by this Agreement, and ( _iv_ ) such other documents as the Buyer shall
reasonably request to effectuate this Agreement on the terms contemplated
hereby; and



(b) The Buyer will deliver to the Seller ( _i_ ) the Estimated Purchase Price
(which amount shall be subject to post-Closing review and adjustment as
provided in Article III) by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
the account or accounts designated by the Seller at least two business days
prior to the Closing Date, ( _ii_ ) two executed counterparts of this
Agreement, ( _iii_ ) two executed counterparts of all documents and
certificates required by this Agreement, and ( _iv_ ) such other documents as

ARTICLE III



_PURCHASE PRICE ADJUSTMENT_



3.1. _Delivery and Review of Closing_. As promptly as practicable, but no
later than 45 days after the Closing Date, the Buyer in good faith shall
prepare and deliver to the Seller a statement (the " _Closing Working Capital
Statement_ ") of ( _i_ ) the Working Capital of the Company as of the opening
of business on the Closing Date, computed _pro forma_ for any Closing Date
Distribution and calculated in the manner set forth below (the " _Closing
Working Capital_ "), and ( _ii_ ) the Purchase Price (computed based upon the
amount of Closing Working Capital set forth in such statement and the final
Reduction Amount), together with supporting calculations. The computation of
each element of Closing Working Capital under this Agreement (including,
without limitation, for purposes of Section 2.2) shall be prepared in
accordance with the Accounting Principles, it being agreed that
such calculation shall reflect the exclusions from Current Assets and Current
Liabilities set forth in each such defined term. The parties acknowledge that
Section 3.1 of the Seller Disclosure Letter sets forth adjustments necessary
to calculate Closing Working Capital as if the Closing had occurred on
certain specified dates prior to the date hereof (it being understood that the
forgoing acknowledgement shall not limit any representation of the Seller
herein). The Seller shall have 30 days from the date on which the Closing
Working Capital Statement is delivered to it to review such documents relating
to the Buyers computation as the Seller may reasonably request (the " _Review
Period_ "). During the Review Period, the Seller and its representatives will
have reasonable access to all books and records of the Company Group
reasonably requested by Seller related to the computation of Closing Working
Capital (it being understood that access to any work papers of any third
party accountants,



 

11 which the Buyer will use reasonable commercial efforts to obtain, shall
require the execution of a customary access letter by the Seller). If the
Seller believes the computation of Closing Working Capital ( _i_ ) has not
been prepared in accordance with the Accounting Principles or this Section 3.1
or ( _ii_ ) is not mathematically correct, the Seller may, on or prior to the
last day of the Review Period, deliver a notice to the Buyer to such effect,
setting forth, in reasonable detail, each disputed item, the amount disputed
and the basis for the Sellers disagreement therewith, together
with supporting calculations and the Sellers position as to the proper
calculation of Closing Working Capital (the " _Dispute Notice_ "). If no
Dispute Notice is received by the Buyer on or prior to the last day of the
Review Period, the Closing Working Capital Statement and the computation of
the Purchase Price set forth therein shall be deemed accepted by the Seller.



3.2. _The Accountant_. Within 15 days after the Buyers receipt of any Dispute
Notice (if the parties, acting in good faith, fail to resolve the dispute
during such period), the Buyer and the Seller shall jointly contact the New
York office of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (it being agreed that if the New
York office of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP does not accept such engagement,
then the New York office of KPMG LLP shall be contacted) (the " _Accountant_
") and shall retain such firm to resolve the issues set forth in the Dispute
Notice. The Accountant shall determine, based solely on written presentations
by the Buyer and the Seller and their respective representatives, and not by
independent review, only those issues in dispute specifically set forth in the
Dispute Notice that have not previously been resolved between the Buyer and
the Seller. Such written presentations shall be made to the Accountant within
30 days of the engagement of the Accountant. In resolving any disputed item,
the Accountant: ( _i_ ) shall be bound by the principles set forth in Section
3.1 and the definitions of Working Capital, Current Assets and Current
Liabilities, ( _ii_ ) shall limit its review to matters specifically set forth
in the Dispute Notice, and ( _iii_ ) shall further limit its review solely to
whether the determination of Closing Working Capital set forth in the Closing
Working Capital Statement is mathematically accurate and has been prepared in
accordance with Section 3.1. The determination of the Accountant in respect of
any disputed item in the Dispute Notice cannot, however, be in excess of, nor
less than, the greatest or lowest value, respectively, claimed for that
particular item in the Buyers Closing Working Capital Statement or in the
Sellers Dispute Notice.



3.3. _The Adjustment Report_. The Accountant shall, as promptly
as practicable and in no event later than 45 days following the date of its
retention, deliver to the Seller and the Buyer a report (the " _Adjustment
Report_ "), in which the Accountant shall, after considering all matters set
forth in the Dispute Notice, determine in accordance with Section 3.2 what
adjustments, if any, should be made to the Closing Working Capital. The
Adjustment Report shall set forth, in reasonable detail, the Accountants
determination with respect to each of the disputed items or amounts specified
in the Dispute Notice, and the revisions, if any, to be made to the Closing
Working Capital Statement, the Closing Working Capital and/or the Purchase
Price, together with supporting calculations. The determination of the
Accountant will be final and binding on the parties hereto and



 

12 judgment may be entered upon the determination of the Accountant in any court
having jurisdiction over the party against which such determination is to be
enforced. The fees, costs and expenses of the Accountant ( _i_ ) shall be
borne by the Seller in the proportion that the aggregate dollar amount of all
such disputed items so submitted that are unsuccessfully disputed by the
Seller (as finally determined by the Accountant) bears to the aggregate dollar
amount of such items so submitted and ( _ii_ ) shall be borne by the Buyer in
the proportion that the aggregate dollar amount of such disputed items
so submitted that are successfully disputed by the Seller (as finally
determined by the Accountant) bears to the aggregate dollar amount of all such
items so submitted. The Accountant shall make such determination and shall
have the discretion to award either party all of its fees, costs and expenses
in connection with the dispute, including the Accountants fees, or any
portion thereof, if the Accountant determines that a partys position was not
presented in good faith.



3.4. _Adjustment and Payment_. Effective upon the end of the Review Period
(if a timely Dispute Notice is not delivered), or upon the resolution of all
matters set forth in the Dispute Notice by agreement of the parties or by the
issuance of the Adjustment Report (if a timely Dispute Notice is delivered)
(the amount of the Purchase Price as of the end of the Review Period or as of
the resolution of all matters, as the case may be, reflecting any adjustment
to the amount of Closing Working Capital resulting therefrom, the " _Final
Purchase Price_ "; and all references herein to the Purchase Price shall be
deemed to refer to the Final Purchase Price from and after such time), the
Purchase Price payable as provided in Section 2.1 shall be reduced by the
amount, if any, by which the Final Purchase Price is less than the Estimated
Purchase Price, or increased by the amount, if any, by which the Final
Purchase Price is greater than the Estimated Purchase Price. Any adjustment to
the Purchase Price pursuant to this Section 3.4 shall be paid by the Buyer or
the Seller, as the case may be, on the fifth business day following the end of
the Review Period (if a timely Dispute Notice is not delivered), or on the
fifth business day following either the date on which the Adjustment Report
has been received by the Seller and the Buyer (if a timely Dispute Notice is
delivered) or the date on which the parties otherwise resolve all matters in
respect of a Dispute Notice. Any such payment shall be made by wire transfer
of immediately available funds to the account or accounts of the Seller or
the Buyer, as the case may be, designated at least two business days prior to
the date on which such payment is scheduled to be made, in each case together
with interest thereon calculated at the prime rate published in the Wall
Street Journal on the Closing Date plus 3.50 per annum from the Closing Date.



3.5. _Indemnification Rights_. The rights to indemnification pursuant to
Article X (and any limitations on such rights) shall not be deemed to
limit, supersede or otherwise affect the right to a full adjustment of the
Purchase Price pursuant to this Article III, _provided_ that no party shall be
entitled to be compensated more than once for the same Loss.

creation of any Lien or loss of any rights with respect to the Business
pursuant to any of the terms, conditions or provisions of or under, any

lease, contract, agreement, or other instrument binding upon any member of the
Company Group, or to which any member of the Company Group or any Assets are
subject where such default, termination, cancellation or acceleration would
be likely to have a Material Adverse Effect.



 

19 4.10. _Real Property_.



(a) _Owned Real Property_. Section 4.10(a) of the Seller Disclosure Letter
contains a complete and correct list of all real property owned by the
Company Group (which real property, together with all improvements and
fixtures located thereon or attached or appurtenant thereto, and all
easements, licenses, rights and appurtenances relating to the
foregoing, constitutes the " _Owned Real Property_ "). The Company Group has
good, valid and marketable fee simple title to the Owned Real Property, free
and clear of any Liens other than Permitted Liens and items appearing on the
preliminary title report referenced in Section 4.10(a) of the Seller
Disclosure Letter (but mortgages or deeds of trust shall not constitute
acceptable Liens).



(b) _Leased Real Property_. Section 4.10(b) of the Seller Disclosure Letter
contains a complete and correct list of all of the real property leased by
the Company Group (the " _Leases_ ", and all interests leased pursuant to the
Leases, the " _Leased Real Property_ "), which list sets forth the address,
landlord and tenant for each Lease. The Seller has delivered to the Buyer
correct and complete copies of each Lease. No member of the Company Group is a
sublessor or grantor under any sublease or other instrument granting to
another Person any right to the possession, lease, occupancy or enjoyment of
the Leased Real Property. Except as set forth in Section 4.10(b) of the
Seller Disclosure Letter, to the Knowledge of the Seller each member of the
Company Group enjoys peaceful and undisturbed possession under its respective
Leases.



(c) _No Proceedings_. There are no proceedings in eminent domain or other
similar proceedings pending or, to the Knowledge of the Seller, threatened
against any portion of the Real Property. There exists no writ, injunction,
decree, order or judgment outstanding, nor any Litigation, pending or, to the
Knowledge of the Seller, threatened, relating to the ownership, lease, use,
occupancy or operation by any Person of any Real Property.



(d) _Current Use_. The use and operation of the Real Property in the conduct
of the Business do not violate in any material respect any Applicable Laws,
covenant, condition, restriction, easement, license, permit or agreement or
order of any Governmental Authority. No material improvements constituting a
part of the Real Property encroach on real property not owned or leased by the
Company Group to the extent that removal of such encroachment would
materially impair the manner and extent of the current use, occupancy and
operation of such improvements. No damage or destruction has occurred with
respect to any of the Real Property that, individually or in the aggregate,
would reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.



(e) _Real Property Taxes_. Each parcel included in the Owned Real Property is
assessed for real estate tax purposes as a wholly independent tax
lot, separate from any adjoining land or improvements not constituting a part
of that parcel.



 

20 4.11. _Personal Property; Assets_.



Except as set forth in Section 4.11 of the Seller Disclosure Letter, the
Company Group is the owner of and has good and marketable title to, or has
legally sufficient rights to use, all of the Assets, free and clear of all
Liens. The Assets include, without limitation, all assets, properties and
rights (whether real, personal, or mixed, tangible or intangible) of

benefits payable to or in respect of any Employee. The Closing Working Capital
Statement will properly to the extent required by Accounting Principles
consistently applied and in accordance with Section 3.1 of this Agreement,

or management employee is not, and has not been an employee of the Company or
the Buyer for a period of six months, the Seller and its Affiliates may
solicit the employment of and hire such Key Employee, officer or management
employee.



9.6. _Releases_.



(a) Effective on the Closing Date, except for post-Closing performance
obligations pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, any Ancillary Agreement
or any Affiliate Agreement which is not terminated pursuant to the terms
hereof, the Seller hereby irrevocably waives and releases the Company Group,
and any present and former directors, officers, agents and Employees of any
such foregoing entities, from any and all actions, claims, causes of action or
liabilities of any nature, in law or equity, known or unknown,

 



 

44 and whether or not heretofore asserted, which such Person ever had, now has or
hereafter can, shall or may have against any of the foregoing for, upon or by
reason of any matter, cause or thing whatsoever since the formation of the
first member of the Company Group to be formed to the Closing Date.



(b) Effective on the Closing Date, the Seller, on behalf of itself and its
Affiliates, releases any claim to any Asset other than any Asset set forth in
Section 6.7 of the Seller Disclosure Letter, and each such Person acknowledges
that between itself and the Company Group, the Company Group shall have the
sole right of ownership, possession and use of each such Asset. 



(c) Effective on the Closing Date, the Seller and the Buyer, on behalf of
their respective Affiliates, releases, and will take steps necessary to cause
the Company to release the Members from all liability with respect to any and
all actions which such individuals may have taken or failed to take at any
time prior to the Closing, except for any actions of such individual that
constitute fraud, gross negligence or intentional misconduct. Such releases
shall be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Seller, the
Buyer and the Members. Additionally, from and until the fifth anniversary of
the Closing Date, the Buyer shall not cause or permit the Company (or any
member of the Company Group) to amend, repeal or modify any provision in such
entitys articles of incorporation or bylaws relating to the exculpation or
indemnification of the officers and directors who held office prior to the
Closing Date (including, but not limited to the Members), it being the intent
of the parties that the officers and directors who held office prior to the
Closing Date (including, but not limited to the Members) shall continue to be
entitled to the benefit of such exculpation and indemnification provisions
with respect to the pre-Closing period to the fullest extent permitted
by Applicable Law.



9.7. _Employees; Employment Terms_. 



(a) Effective as of the Closing and continuing until December 31, 2004, the
Buyer shall, or shall cause the Company Group to continue to provide to those
persons who, immediately prior to the Closing, were employees of the Company
Group (the " _Company Group Employees_ ") with employee benefits that are
substantially comparable in the aggregate to the employee benefits provided to
the Company Group Employees before Closing (excluding for all purposes each
Plan and any equity-based or long-term incentive plan or arrangement), 
_provided_ , that after the Closing, the Buyer expressly reserves the right
to, and to cause the Company Group to, amend, modify or terminate any Plan in
accordance with the terms thereof and Applicable Law. Nothing contained in
this Agreement is intended to confer upon any Company Group Employee any
right to continued employment.



(b) Except to the extent necessary to avoid duplication of benefits, the Buyer
will, or will cause the Company Group to, give Company Group Employees full
credit for such Company Group Employees service with the Company Group to
the same extent

of participation, eligibility and vesting under any Plan or any "employee
benefit plan", as such term is defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, in which
employees of the Buyer participate and is maintained or sponsored by the Buyer
after the Closing, in which such Company Group Employees are eligible to
participate after the Closing.



9.8.  _Taxes_.



(a) _Payments to Taxing Authorities_. 



(i) _Seller s Responsibility_. The Seller shall pay, cause to be paid or
assume the liability to pay to the applicable Taxing Authority all ( _A_ )
Taxes of each member of the Company Group for all Pre-Closing Tax Periods, (
_B_ ) Taxes of each member of the Company Group for the portion of any
Straddle Period ending on or before the Closing Date, and ( _C_ ) Taxes of any
other Person relating to any taxable period (or portion thereof) ending on or
before the Closing Date and imposed on or payable by any member of
the Company Group as a transferee or successor, by contract or otherwise in
connection with a transaction consummated on or prior to the Closing Date,
including, without limitation, any Taxes imposed on Southcorp for which any
member of the Company Group is liable pursuant to the Southcorp Purchase
Agreement, in each case to the extent not included in the calculation of
Closing Working Capital.



(ii) _Buyer s Responsibility_. Buyer shall pay or cause to be paid to the
applicable Taxing Authority all Taxes payable with respect to each member of
the Company Group to the extent such Taxes are not described as being the
responsibility of Seller in Section 9.8(a)(i).



(iii) _Straddle Periods; Certain Pre-Closing Tax Periods_. In the case of any
Straddle Period, the amount of any Income Taxes of a member of the Company
Group for the portion of such period ending on the Closing Date will be
determined based on an interim closing of the books as of the close of
business on the Closing Date. The amount of Taxes other than Income Taxes, to
the extent not accounted for by accruals reflected in the calculation of
Closing Working Capital, that are attributable to the portion of a Straddle
Period ending on the Closing Date will be deemed to be the amount of such Tax
for the entire Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of
which is the number of days in the portion of such Straddle Period ending on
the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the total number of days in
such Straddle Period. If the Buyer is responsible pursuant to Section
9.8(b)(ii) for filing a Tax Return with respect to a member of the Company
Group for a Straddle Period or a Pre-Closing Tax Period, such Tax Return shall
be prepared in a manner consistent with the past practices and calculations
of such member and shall not include any elections which prejudice Seller, and
the Buyer shall deliver to the Seller for Sellers review and (it being agreed
that any comments



 

46 timely made by the Seller following such review will be considered by the
Buyer in good faith), no later than 15 days prior to the due date (including
any extension thereof) for the filing of such Tax Return, a copy of such Tax
Return and a statement certifying the amount of Tax allocable to the Seller.
Within 10 days following such delivery, the Seller shall pay to the Buyer an
amount equal to the portion of such Tax certified as allocable to the Seller.



(b) _Return Filing_.



(i) _Seller s Responsibility_. The Seller shall prepare or cause to be
prepared and file or cause to be filed all income Tax Returns of, and all
other Tax Returns relating to the business, assets or capital stock of, any
member of the Company Group required to be filed on or prior to the Closing
Date.



(ii) _Buyer s Responsibility_. Except as may otherwise be provided in Section
9.8(c), ( _A_ ) the Buyer shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or
cause to be filed all Tax Returns with respect to each member of the Company
Group other than those for which the Seller is responsible pursuant to Section
9.8(b)(i); and ( _B_ ) the income, gains, deductions, losses, credits and
recapture of credits, and each item thereof, of each member of the Company
Group, other than those required to be included in the Tax Returns described
in Section 9.8(b)(i), shall be included in the Tax Returns described in
clause (A), including but not limited to all items for periods after the
Closing Date.



(c) _Contests_.



(i) The Seller shall have the right to represent the interests of each member
of the Company Group in any Tax audit or administrative or court proceeding
(a " _Tax Contest_ ") to the extent relating to Taxes that are described as
being the responsibility of Seller in Section 9.8(a)(i).



(ii) The Buyer shall have the right to represent the interests of each of the
Company Group in any Tax Contest not described in Section 9.8(c)(i).



(iii) If either party hereto receives any written communication proposing any
Tax adjustment with respect to the assets or activities of any member of the
Company Group prior to the Closing Date or which could otherwise give rise to
a claim for indemnification hereunder, such party shall, within 10 days
following such receipt, provide the other party with notice of such proposed
Tax adjustment together with copies of any documentation relating thereto;
_provided_ that the failure to provide such notice shall not affect any right
to indemnification hereunder except to the extent that such failure results in
a failure of actual notice and the party not receiving notice is materially
damaged as a result thereof. If the resolution of any Tax Contest (or portion
thereof) would be grounds for indemnification hereunder by



 

47 the party (the " _Non-Controlling Party_ ") not in control of the conduct of
such Tax Contest (or portion thereof) or otherwise adversely affect the Tax
liability of the Non-Controlling Party, ( _A_ ) the party (the " _Controlling
Party_ ") in control of such Tax Contest (or portion thereof) shall keep
the Non-Controlling Party fully informed of any proceedings, events and
developments relating to or in connection with such Tax Contest (or portion
thereof); ( _B_ ) the Non-Controlling Party shall be entitled to receive
copies of all correspondence and documents relating to such Tax Contest (or
portion thereof); and ( _C_ ) at its own cost and expense, the Non-Controlling
Party shall have the right to participate in (but not control) the conduct of
such Tax Contest (or portion thereof). Notwithstanding any such control ( _1_
) the Buyer shall not, and shall not permit any member of the Company Group
to, enter into any settlement or admit any fault or liability with respect to
any Tax Contest (or portion thereof) that could give rise to a claim for
indemnification hereunder without the Sellers express written prior consent
and ( _2_ ) the Seller shall not enter into any settlement or admit any fault
or liability that purports to be binding on any member of the Company Group
with respect to any taxable period or portion thereof beginning after the
Closing Date without the Buyers express written prior consent, which consent
(in either case) shall not be unreasonably withheld.



(d) _Refunds_.



(i) The Seller shall be entitled to retain, or receive immediate payment from
Buyer or the applicable member of the Company Group of, any refund or credit
with respect to Taxes, plus any interest received with respect thereto from
the applicable Taxing Authorities, relating to any member of the
Company Group, which Taxes are described as being the responsibility of the
Seller in Section 9.8(a)(i).



(ii) The Buyer or any member of the Company Group, as applicable, shall be
entitled to retain, or the Buyer shall be entitled to receive immediate
payment from the Seller of, any refund or credit with respect to Taxes, plus
any interest received with respect thereto from the applicable Taxing
Authorities, in each case received after the Closing Date, relating to any
member of the Company Group, which Taxes are described as being the
responsibility of the Buyer in Section 9.8(a)(ii).



(e) _Cooperation on Tax Matters_. The Seller, the members of the Company Group
and the Buyer shall reasonably cooperate, and shall cause their respective
Affiliates, officers, employees, agents, auditors and representatives
reasonably to cooperate, in preparing and filing all Tax Returns (including
amended Tax Returns), handling any Tax audits and making any claims for Tax
refunds, in each case relating to the business, assets or capital stock of
the members of the Company Group for all Pre-Closing Tax Periods and Straddle
Periods, including maintaining and making available to each other all records
necessary in connection with such Taxes and in resolving all disputes with
respect to all



 

48 such taxable periods, _provided_ that the foregoing shall be done in a manner
so as not to interfere unreasonably with the conduct of the business of the
parties.



(f) _Tax Indemnification_.



(i) _Indemnification by Seller_. The Seller covenants and agrees to defend,
indemnify and hold harmless the Buyer Indemnitees from and against, and pay or
reimburse the Buyer Indemnitees for any and all Taxes payable by Seller under
Section 9.8(a)(i) and Losses arising from the fulfillment of any other
obligation in respect thereof, reasonable attorneys and accountants fees and
expenses incurred in connection therewith. The Seller shall not have any
liability under any provision of this Agreement for any such Taxes to the
extent that any such Taxes shall have been caused or contributed to by any
action or omission of Buyer or its Affiliates or any member of the Company
Group after the Closing Date.



(ii) _Indemnification by Buyer_. The Buyer covenants and agrees, from and
after the Closing Date, to defend, indemnify and hold harmless the Seller and
the Members from and against, and pay or reimburse the Seller or the Members
for any and all Taxes payable by the Buyer under Section 9.8(a)(ii) and any
Losses arising from the fulfillment of any other obligation in respect thereof
and reasonable attorneys and accountants fees and expenses incurred in
connection therewith. The Buyer shall not have any liability under any
provision of this Agreement for any such Taxes to the extent that any such
Taxes shall have been caused or contributed to by any action or omission of
the Seller or any of its Affiliates after the Closing Date.



9.9. _Seller Net Worth_. From and after the Closing, the Seller will maintain
a minimum net worth of (a) $40 million until the first anniversary of the
Closing, and (b) $14 million until the sixth anniversary of the Closing;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if any of the events described in Section 9.9 of
the Seller Disclosure Letter occurs, then the foregoing minimum net worth
requirements will be reduced as provided in such Section 9.9 of the Seller
Disclosure Letter; _provided_ , _further_ , _however_ , if the Buyer makes
an indemnification claim against the Seller pursuant to Article X hereof,
then notwithstanding the permitted reduction in such minimum net worth set
forth above following the first or sixth anniversary dates of the Closing, as
applicable, such reduction shall not occur to the extent the pending
indemnification claim would exceed the minimum net worth following such
reduction and such reduction shall only occur when such claim has been fully
resolved to the Buyers reasonable satisfaction. " _Minimum net worth_ " is
defined as all assets owned by the Seller which are free and clear of any
liens, claims, or other encumbrances minus all liabilities of the Seller,
determined in accordance with GAAP. The Seller shall provide to the Buyer, on
a quarterly basis, a balance sheet prepared in accordance with GAAP setting
forth the Sellers fair market value certified by a manager of the Seller or
an independent accounting firm.

the limitations set forth herein, the Seller covenants and agrees to defend,
indemnify and hold harmless, the Buyer, its Affiliates (including, without
limitation, the Company Group following the Closing) and the officers,

(collectively, the " _Buyer Indemnitees_ ") from and against, and pay or
reimburse each such Person for, any and all claims, liabilities, obligations,

accountants fees incurred in the investigation or defense of any of the same
or in asserting any of their respective rights hereunder (collectively, "

Agreement or in any certificate or document, delivered in connection

thereto (whether or not such shares or other securities are outstanding as of
the Closing). 

---|--- 



10.2. _Indemnification by the Buyer_. From and after the Closing, subject to
the limitations set forth herein, the Buyer covenants and agrees to defend,
indemnify and hold harmless the Seller, its Affiliates (including, without
limitation, the Members), and the officers, directors, employees, agents,
advisers, representatives, members and managers of each such Person
(collectively, the " _Seller Indemnitees_ "), from and against, and pay or
reimburse the Seller Indemnitees for, any and all Losses resulting from or
arising out of or in connection with:



(a) Any breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty of the Buyer
under this Agreement or in any certificate or document delivered in connection
herewith (without taking into account any qualification as to materiality or
material adverse effect contained in such representation or warranty); or



(b) Any breach of any covenant or agreement made by or on behalf of the Buyer
under this Agreement or in any certificate or document delivered in

(c) Costs and expenses, from dollar one (net of applicable DandO insurance and
indemnification), incurred by the Seller and the Members in connection with
the defense of any frivolous third party action relating to or arising from
the operations of the Company or the Company Group (excluding any matter for
which the Seller is obligated to indemnify the Buyer Indemnitees under Section
10.1).



10.3. _Limitation on Indemnity Obligation_.



(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Article X to the contrary, to the extent
indemnification is sought under Section 10.1(a) or 10.2(a), the Seller or the
Buyer, as the case may be, shall be required to provide indemnification only
at such time as the aggregate amount of Losses arising under Section 10.1(a)
or 10.2(a), as the case may be, exceeds $2,000,000, in which event the
Indemnifying Party (as the case may be) shall only indemnify for the amount
of Losses in excess of such minimum amount of Losses. Notwithstanding anything
in Section 10.1 or 10.2 to the contrary, the cumulative indemnification
obligation of the Seller, on the one hand, and the Buyer, on the other, in
respect of any and all claims arising under Sections 10.1(a) or Section
10.2(a), as the case may be, shall not exceed $30,000,000. The limitations on
indemnification set forth in this Section 10.3(a) shall in no event apply to
any claim in respect of Losses arising from or related to any breach of any
representation or warranty in Sections 4.4, 4.11 or 4.16.



(b) To the extent any Indemnified Party is seeking indemnification for Losses
in respect of the breach of any representation or warranty, such
Indemnified Party shall be



 

51 entitled to indemnity only for those Losses as to which such Indemnified Party
has given written notice thereof to the Indemnifying Party prior to the
termination of the applicable survival period for such representation or
warranty applicable to such Loss pursuant to Section 9.1. Such Indemnified
Party may at its option give notice under this Article X as soon as it has
become aware of a potential claim in respect of any breach of such
representation or warranty, regardless of whether any Losses have been
suffered, so long as such Indemnified Party shall in good faith determine that
such potential claim is not frivolous or that such Indemnified Party may be
liable or otherwise incur Losses as a result of such claim or otherwise. Any
written notice delivered by such Indemnified Party pursuant to this Section
10.3(b) shall set forth with reasonable specificity the basis of the claim
for Losses and, if practicable, an estimate of the amount thereof.



10.4. _Third-Party Claims_. In the case of any claim (a " _Claim_ ") asserted
by a third party against a party entitled to indemnification under this
Agreement (the " _Indemnified Party_ "), notice shall be given by the
Indemnified Party to the party required to provide indemnification (the "
_Indemnifying Party_ ") promptly after such Indemnified Party has actual
knowledge of any claim as to which indemnity may be sought, and the
Indemnified Party shall permit the Indemnifying Party (at the expense of such
Indemnifying Party) to assume the defense of any claim or any
Litigation resulting therefrom, provided that ( _i_ ) the counsel for the
Indemnifying Party who shall conduct the defense of such claim or Litigation
shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, ( _ii_ ) the
Indemnified Party may participate in such defense at such Indemnified Partys
expense, ( _iii_ ) the failure by any Indemnified Party to give notice as
provided herein shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its
indemnification obligation under this Agreement except to the extent that
such omission results in a failure of actual notice to the Indemnifying Party
and such Indemnifying Party is materially damaged or prejudiced as a result of
such failure to give notice and ( _iv_ ) the Indemnifying Party shall not
have the right to assume the defense of any Claim in the event ( _A_ ) such
Claim is primarily for injunctive relief or criminal penalty of the
Indemnified Party, or ( _B_ ) the Indemnified Party in good faith determines
that the conduct of the defense of any claim subject to indemnification
hereunder or any proposed settlement of any such claim by the Indemnifying
Party would reasonably be expected to affect adversely in any material respect
the Indemnified Partys Tax liability or the ability of the Buyer to conduct
the business of the Company Group, taken as a whole, as conducted at such
time, or that the Indemnified Party may have available to it one or more
defenses or counterclaims that are inconsistent with one or more of those
that may be available to the Indemnifying Party in respect of such claim or
any Litigation relating thereto, in which case the Indemnified Party shall
have the right at all times to take over and assume control over the
defense, settlement, negotiations or Litigation relating to any such claim at
the sole reasonable cost of the Indemnifying Party, provided that if the
Indemnified Party does so take over and assume control, the Indemnified Party
shall not settle such claim or Litigation without the written consent of the
Indemnifying Party, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed.
Except with the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, no Indemnifying Party, in the
 



 

52  defense of any claim or Litigation, shall consent to entry of any judgment
or order, interim or otherwise, or enter into any settlement that ( _i_ )
would lead to liability or create any financial or other obligation on the
part of the Indemnified Party, ( _ii_ ) does not contain, as an unconditional
term thereof, the release of the Indemnified Party from all liability in
respect of such Claim or such Claim is not dismissed against the Indemnified
Party with prejudice and without the imposition of any financial or other
obligation on the Indemnified Party or ( _iii_ ) admits the liability or fault
of the Indemnified Party.



10.5. _Exclusivity of Remedies_. Indemnification pursuant to the provisions
of this Article X shall be the exclusive remedy of the parties from and after
the Closing for any misrepresentation or breach of warranty hereunder. The
only legal action which may be asserted by any party with respect to any
matter which is the subject of the preceding sentence, other than a claim of
fraud or intentional misrepresentation, shall be a contract action to enforce,
or to recover damages for the breach of, this Agreement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, nothing herein shall limit the remedies available to any party for
fraud or intentional misrepresentation or misconduct.



10.6. _Calculation of Losses_.



(a) _Purchase Price Adjustments_. The Buyer shall not be entitled to
indemnification from the Seller for any Losses to the extent that such
Losses have been reflected in any adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant
to Article III.



(b) _Tax Adjustments_.



(i) The Buyer and the Seller agree that any payments made under this Article X
shall be treated by the parties hereto for federal, state and local income Tax
purposes (whether foreign or domestic) as a non-taxable reimbursement or
Purchase Price adjustment, except to the extent that contrary treatment is
required by any Applicable Law.



(ii) The amount of any Loss subject to indemnification hereunder shall be
reduced to take into account any Tax benefit actually realized by the
indemnified party as a result of the Loss and increased by the amount of any
Tax detriment actually realized by the indemnified party as a result of the
receipt of the corresponding indemnification payment or the disallowance of
any Tax benefit previously taken into account for purposes of this paragraph.
The parties shall make payments as necessary after an indemnification payment
is made to take into account any such Tax benefit or Tax detriment realized
after the taxable period in which the indemnification payment is made. The
amount of any Tax benefit or Tax detriments described above (i) shall be based
on the assumption that the items giving rise to such Tax benefit or Tax
detriment are utilized by the indemnified party only after all other relevant
Tax items have been taken into account and (ii) shall be determined by the
indemnified party and certified to by such partys tax accountants  



 

53  or auditors, which determination, in the absence of manifest error, shall be
binding on the parties. __



(c) _Insurance_. The amount of any Losses subject to
indemnification hereunder shall be calculated net of any insurance actually
received from third party insurance carriers by the Buyer or the Buyer Group
with respect to such Losses (it being understood and agreed that Buyer shall
pursue any such available insurance coverage to the extent it is commercially
reasonable to do so), but adjusted for any increase in insurance premiums as a
result of making an insurance claim for such Losses. In the event the Seller
or any Person acting on behalf of the Seller makes any payment hereunder with
respect to any Losses, the Buyer shall assign to such payor (without recourse
to the Buyer) its rights, if any, against any third party insurance carrier
providing coverage with respect to such Losses, provided that the Seller
agrees to indemnify the Buyer for any increase in insurance premiums as a
result of the Seller pursuing such rights against such insurance carrier.



ARTICLE XI



_TERMINATION_



11.1. _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the
Closing Date:



(a) By mutual consent of the Buyer and the Seller;



(b) By either the Buyer or the Seller if the Closing shall not have occurred
on or before July 12, 2004 (the " _Outside Date_ ") or prior to such date if
any condition to such partys obligation to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby (as set forth in Article VII or Article VIII) shall have
become incapable of being satisfied;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the right
to terminate this Agreement shall not be available to any party whose breach
of any term of this Agreement has been a cause of, or resulted in, the failure
of the Closing to have occurred on or before the aforesaid date;



(c) By the Buyer, if the Seller shall have materially breached any of its
respective covenants herein or if the Seller shall have made a material
misrepresentation herein in each case where such breach or misrepresentation
is incapable of being cured in a timely manner; 



(d) By the Seller, if the Buyer shall have materially breached any of its
covenants herein or if the Buyer shall have made a material misrepresentation
herein in each case where such breach or misrepresentation is incapable of
being cured in a timely manner; or



 

54 (e) By either the Buyer or the Seller, if any court of competent jurisdiction
or other governmental agency of competent jurisdiction shall have issued an
order, decree or ruling or taken any other action restraining, enjoining or
otherwise prohibiting the transactions contemplated hereby, and such order,
decree, ruling or other action shall have become final and non-appealable.



11.2. _Procedure and Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination by
the Buyer or the Seller pursuant to Section 11.1, notice thereof shall
promptly be given to the Seller or the Buyer, as the case may be, and this
Agreement shall terminate, without further action by any of the parties
hereto. If this Agreement is terminated as provided herein, no party hereto
shall have any liability or further obligation to any other party to this
Agreement except that any termination shall be without prejudice to the
rights of either party hereto arising out of a breach by the other party of
any term of agreement contained in this Agreement, and except that the
provisions of Section 6.4, 9.2, 11.2, 11.3 and Article XII shall survive
such termination.



11.3. _Termination Payment_. In the event that the Closing does not occur
because the condition set forth in Section 7.5 has not been satisfied as of
the Outside Date, then the Buyer will pay the Seller $3,000,000 within 20
business days of the Outside Date, _provided_ that ( _i_ ) all of the other
conditions set forth in Article VII shall have been satisfied as of the
Outside Date (or, with respect to any condition that is contingent upon the
receipt of the financing referred to in Section 7.5 (including, without
limitation, Section 7.6) shall have been demonstrated to be capable of
immediate satisfaction as of such date contingent only upon receipt of the
financing pursuant to Section 7.5), and ( _ii_ ) the sole reason why the
condition set forth in Section 7.5 was not satisfied was because of either (
_x_ ) the failure to satisfy the condition set forth in clause (x) of
subsection (vii) of Section A (Conditions Precedentto the Initial Loans) in
the debt Financing Commitment or ( _y_ ) the failure of Kelso and Company to
provide or to cause to be provided the funds contemplated by the equity
Commitment Letter upon satisfaction of the conditions set forth therein.

mailed, shall be effective upon the earlier of ( _i_ ) actual receipt by the
addressee, ( _ii_ ) the date shown on the return receipt of such mailing, or (
_iii_ ) three days after deposit in the mail. All such notices, demands, and
communications, if not mailed, shall be effective upon the earlier of ( _i_ )
actual receipt by the addressee, ( _ii_ ) with respect to facsimile and
similar electronic transmission, the earlier of ( _A_ ) the time that
electronic confirmation of a successful transmission is received, or ( _B_ )
the date of transmission, if a confirming copy of the transmission is also
mailed as described



 

56  above on the date of transmission, and ( _iii_ ) with respect to delivery by
overnight courier service, the day after deposit with the courier service,
if delivery on such day by such courier is confirmed with the courier or the
recipient orally or in writing.



12.2. _Parties in Interest_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and shall
inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors,
assigns, heirs and legal representatives.



12.3.  _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except as provided in Article X with
respect to the indemnification of the Buyer Indemnitees and the Seller
Indemnitees hereunder, nothing in this Agreement shall confer any rights upon
any person or entity other than the parties hereto and their respective
heirs, successors and permitted assigns.



12.4. _Governing Law; Choice of Jurisdiction_. This Agreement shall be
governed in all respects, including as to validity, interpretation and effect,
by the internal laws of the state of Delaware, without giving effect to the
conflict of laws rules thereof. Each party to this agreement hereby ( _i_ )
irrevocably and unconditionally consents and submits, for itself or himself
and its or his property, to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the state
and federal courts of the State of Delaware, ( _ii_ ) waives any objection
which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit, action,
or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement in the
aforementioned courts, and ( _iii_ ) agrees that a final judgment in any such
suit, action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided for by
law.



12.5. _Amendment; Waivers, etc._ No amendment, modification or discharge of
this Agreement, and no waiver hereunder, shall be valid or binding unless set
forth in writing and duly executed by the party against whom enforcement of
the amendment, modification, discharge or waiver is sought. Any such waiver
shall constitute a waiver only with respect to the specific matter described
in such writing and shall in no way impair the rights of the party granting
such waiver in any other respect or at any other time. Neither the waiver by
any of the parties hereto of a breach of or a default under any of the
provisions of this Agreement, nor the failure by any of the parties, on one or
more occasions, to enforce any of the provisions of this Agreement or to
exercise any right or privilege hereunder, shall be construed as a waiver of
any other breach or default of a similar nature, or as a waiver of any of such
provisions, rights or privileges hereunder. Except as provided in Section
10.5, the rights and remedies herein provided are cumulative and none is
exclusive of any other, or of any rights or remedies that any party may
otherwise have at law or in equity. The rights and remedies of any party based
upon, arising out of or otherwise in respect of any inaccuracy or breach of
any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement or failure to fulfill any
condition shall in no way be limited by the fact that the act, omission,
occurrence or other state of facts upon which any claim of any such inaccuracy
or breach is based may also be the subject matter of any other
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement as to which there is no
inaccuracy or breach. The representations and warranties of the Seller on the
one hand, and the Buyer, on the other hand, that are contained in
this Agreement (as  



 

57  brought down on the Closing Date) shall not be affected or deemed waived by
reason of any investigation made by or on behalf of the Buyer or the Seller,
as the case may be, (including but not limited to by any of their advisors,
consultants or representatives) or by reason of the fact that the Buyer or the
Seller, as the case may be, or any of their respective advisors, consultants
or representatives knew or should have known that any such representation or
warranty is or might be inaccurate.



12.6. _Further Assurances_. From time to time after the Closing Date and at
the expense of the requesting party and without further consideration, the
Seller and its Affiliates, on the one hand, and the Buyer on the other hand
will, upon the request of the Buyer or the Seller, as the case may be, execute
and deliver such instruments and documents as such other party reasonably may
request in order to carry out the purposes and intent of this
Agreement, including without limitation, in the case of a request by the
Buyer, further evidence of the releases contained in Section 9.6.



12.7. _Severability_. If any provision, including any phrase, sentence,
clause, section or subsection, of this Agreement is invalid, inoperative
or unenforceable for any reason, such circumstances shall not have the effect
of rendering such provision in question invalid, inoperative or unenforceable
in any other case or circumstance, or of rendering any other provision herein
contained invalid, inoperative, or unenforceable to any extent whatsoever.



12.8.  _Headings_. The headings contained in this Agreement are for purposes
of convenience only and shall not affect the meaning or interpretation of this
Agreement.



12.9. _Entire Agreement_. The Disclosure Letters and the exhibits and
schedules hereto are hereby incorporated in and form an integral part of this
Agreement. All understandings, covenants and agreements between the parties
are merged into this Agreement, which fully and completely expresses their
agreement and supersedes any prior agreement or understanding relating to the
subject matter hereof.



12.10.  _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in several
counterparts, all of which taken together shall constitute one instrument. A
signature of a party delivered by telecopy or other electronic communication
shall constitute an original signature of such party.



12.11. _Disclosure Generally_. If and to the extent any information required
to be furnished in the Seller Disclosure Letter is contained in any section of
the Seller Disclosure Letter, such information shall be deemed to be included
in all sections of the Seller Disclosure Letter in which such information may
have been included; _provided_ , _however_ , the inclusion of any information
in any section of the Seller Disclosure Letter shall not be deemed to be an
admission or acknowledgement by Seller that such information is material to
or outside of the Companys ordinary course of business; and _provided_
_further_ , that matters disclosed in one section of the Seller Disclosure
Letter shall be deemed disclosed  



 

58  with respect to any other section thereof only where it is reasonably
apparent that the facts so disclosed are applicable to such other sections.
