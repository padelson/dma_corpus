for the Financing Purposes (as defined below). A true and complete copy of the Commitment Letter, including all amendments, supplements and modifications thereto, has been previously provided to the Seller. The Purchaser has fully paid any and all
commitment fees or other fees required by the Commitment Letter to be paid on or before the date hereof. As of the date hereof, the Commitment Letter is a legal, valid and binding obligation of Purchaser, and, to the knowledge of the Purchaser, each
other party thereto, except as such enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy or other similar Laws affecting the rights and remedies of creditors generally, as well as by general principles of equity (regardless of whether such
enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law), and is in full force and effect. As of the date hereof, the Commitment Letter has not been amended, supplemented or otherwise modified, and the respective commitments contained in
the Commitment Letter have not been withdrawn, terminated or rescinded in any respect. As of the date hereof, no event has occurred which (with or without notice, lapse of time or both) would constitute a breach or default under the Commitment
Letter on the part of the Purchaser. Assuming the conditions set forth in <U>Sections 7.1</U> and <U>7.3</U> are satisfied at Closing, the aggregate net proceeds contemplated by the Commitment Letter together with cash on hand, when funded in
accordance with the Commitment Letter on the Closing Date, will be sufficient for the Purchaser to pay on and after the Closing Date (y)&nbsp;the Purchase Price and (z)&nbsp;any and all fees and expenses required to be paid by Purchaser in
connection with this Agreement and the Financing (collectively, the &#147;<B><I>Financing Purposes</I></B>&#148;). There are no side letters or other agreements, contracts, arrangements or understandings to which the Purchaser or its Affiliates is a
party related to the funding or investing, as applicable, of the Financing other than as expressly set forth in the Commitment Letter (except for the fee letter and any engagement letters or fee discount letters related to the Financing), and as of
the date hereof, there are no agreements, contracts, arrangements or understandings to which the Purchaser or its Affiliates is a party related to any Purchaser Financing (other than the Financing). The Financing is subject to no conditions to the
obligations of the parties under the Commitment Letters to make the full amount of the Financing available to the Purchaser, as applicable, at the Closing other than those set forth in the Commitment Letter. As of the date hereof, subject to the
satisfaction of the conditions set forth in <U>Sections 7.1</U> and <U>7.3</U> hereof, the Purchaser has no reason to believe that any of the conditions to the Financing will fail to be satisfied on a timely basis (taking into account the expected
timing of the Marketing Period) or that the full amount of the Financing will not be available to the Purchaser on the Closing Date. Taking into account the funds available under the Commitment Letter, the Purchaser&#146;s credit facility and other
sources of immediately available funds, Purchaser has and will have sufficient funds to enable it to pay the Estimated Cash Purchase Price as of the Closing Date. </P>
