                          AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER


          AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of October 8, 2006 (this
"AGREEMENT"), by and between Mercantile Bankshares Corporation, a Maryland
corporation ("MERCANTILE BANKSHARES"), and The PNC Financial Services Group,
Inc., a Pennsylvania corporation ("PNC").

                              W I T N E S S E T H:

          WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of Mercantile Bankshares and PNC have
determined that it is in the best interests of their respective companies and
their stockholders to consummate the strategic business combination transaction
provided for in this Agreement in which Mercantile Bankshares will, on the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, merge with and into
PNC (the "MERGER"), so that PNC is the surviving corporation in the Merger
(sometimes referred to in such capacity as the "SURVIVING CORPORATION");

          WHEREAS, for federal income Tax purposes, it is intended that the
Merger shall qualify as a reorganization under the provisions of Section 368(a)
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "CODE"), and this
Agreement is intended to be and is adopted as a "plan of reorganization" for
purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the Code;

          WHEREAS, the parties desire to make certain representations,
warranties and agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe
certain conditions to the Merger.

          NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants,
representations, warranties and agreements contained in this Agreement, and
other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are
hereby acknowledged, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties agree
as follows:



                                    ARTICLE I


                                   THE MERGER

          1.1 THE MERGER. (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, in accordance with the Business Corporation Law of the Commonwealth
of Pennsylvania (the "PBCL") and the Maryland General Corporation Law (the
"MGCL"), at the Effective Time Mercantile Bankshares shall merge with and into

corporate existence under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. As of
the Effective Time, the separate corporate existence of Mercantile Bankshares
shall cease.

          (b) PNC may at any time change the method of effecting the combination
(including by providing for the merger of Mercantile Bankshares and a wholly
owned subsidiary of PNC) if and to the extent requested by PNC and consented to
by Mercantile Bankshares (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or
delayed); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that no such change shall (i) alter or change the
amount or kind of the Merger Consideration provided for in this


                                       1

Department of Assessments and Taxation on the Closing Date. The term "EFFECTIVE
TIME" shall be the date and time when the Merger becomes effective as set forth
in the Certificate of Merger and the Articles of Merger.

          1.3 EFFECTS OF THE MERGER. At and after the Effective Time, the Merger

Mercantile Bankshares or PNC in respect of a debt previously contracted (any
such shares, "DPC COMMON SHARES")) shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist
and no stock of PNC or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange
therefor.

          (c) Subject to Section 1.4(e), each share of the Mercantile Bankshares

Mercantile Bankshares Common Stock represented by such Certificate have been
converted pursuant to this Section 1.4 and Section 2.3(f), as well as any
dividends to which holders of Mercantile Bankshares Common Stock become entitled

and (y) the excess, if any, of (i) the All Cash Consideration over (ii) the
exercise price per share of such Mercantile Bankshares Option; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that PNC shall be entitled to deduct and withhold such amounts as may

<PAGE>

accordance with Section 2.3(f) upon surrender of such Certificate and any
dividends or distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section
2.3(c).

          (b) Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of its Certificate or
Certificates, accompanied by a properly completed Letter of Transmittal, a
holder of Mercantile Bankshares Common Stock will be entitled to receive
promptly after the Effective Time the Merger Consideration (with the aggregate
Cash Consideration paid to each such holder rounded to the nearest whole cent)
and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of PNC Common Stock to be issued or
paid in consideration therefor in respect of the shares of Mercantile Bankshares
Common Stock represented by its Certificate or Certificates. Until so
surrendered, each such Certificate shall represent after the Effective Time, for
all purposes, only the right to receive the Merger Consideration and any cash in
lieu of fractional shares of PNC Common Stock to be issued or paid in
consideration therefor upon surrender of such Certificate in accordance with,
and any dividends or distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to,
this Article II.

          (c) No dividends or other distributions with respect to PNC Common
Stock shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect
to the shares of PNC Common Stock represented thereby, in each case until the
surrender of such Certificate in accordance with this Article II. Subject to the
effect of applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws, following
surrender of any such Certificate in accordance with this Article II, the record
holder thereof shall be entitled to receive, without interest, (i) the amount of
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
theretofore payable with respect to the whole shares of PNC Common Stock
represented by such Certificate and not paid and/or (ii) at the appropriate
payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions payable with

respect to such Certificate.

          (d) In the event of a transfer of ownership of a Certificate
representing Mercantile Bankshares Common Stock that is not registered in the
stock transfer records of Mercantile Bankshares, the proper amount of cash
and/or shares of PNC Common Stock shall be paid or issued in exchange therefor
to a person other than the person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered
is registered if the Certificate formerly representing such Mercantile
Bankshares Common Stock shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper
form for transfer and the person requesting such payment or issuance shall pay
any transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of the payment or
issuance to a person other than the registered holder of the Certificate or
establish to the satisfaction of PNC that the Tax has been paid or is not
applicable.

          (e) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of Mercantile Bankshares of the shares of Mercantile Bankshares
Common Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time other than to settle transfers of Mercantile Bankshares Common Stock that
occurred prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates

          (f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, no certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of PNC Common
Stock shall be issued upon the surrender of Certificates for exchange, no
dividend or distribution with respect to PNC Common Stock shall be payable on or
with respect to any fractional share, and such fractional share interests shall
not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a stockholder of
PNC. In lieu of the issuance of any such fractional share, PNC shall pay to each
former stockholder of Mercantile Bankshares who otherwise would be entitled to
receive such fractional share an amount in cash (rounded to the nearest cent)
determined by multiplying (i) the PNC Closing Price by (ii) the fraction of a
share (after taking into account all shares of Mercantile Bankshares Common
Stock held by such holder at the Effective Time and rounded to the nearest
thousandth when expressed in decimal form) of PNC Common Stock to which such
holder would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to Section 1.4.

          (g) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the
stockholders of Mercantile Bankshares as of the first anniversary of the
Effective Time may, to the extent permitted by applicable law, be paid to PNC.
In such event, any former stockholders of Mercantile Bankshares who have not
theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to PNC with
respect to the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of any fractional shares
and any unpaid dividends and distributions on the PNC Common Stock deliverable
in respect of each share of Mercantile Bankshares Common Stock such stockholder
holds as determined pursuant to this Agreement, in each case, without any
interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of PNC, Mercantile
Bankshares, the Exchange Agent or any other person shall be liable to any former
holder of shares of Mercantile Bankshares Common Stock for any amount delivered
in good faith to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar laws.

          (h) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably required by
PNC or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such person of a bond in such amount
as PNC may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim that
may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will
issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger
Consideration deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

          2.4 WITHHOLDING RIGHTS. The Exchange Agent (or, subsequent to the
first anniversary of the Effective Time, PNC) shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the cash portion of the Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu
of fractional shares of PNC Common Stock otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any holder of Mercantile Bankshares Common Stock or Mercantile
Bankshares RSUs such amounts as the Exchange Agent or PNC, as the case may be,
is required to deduct and withhold under the Code, or any provision of state,
local or foreign Tax law, with respect to the making of such payment. To the
extent the amounts are so withheld by the Exchange Agent or PNC, as the case may
be, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the holder of shares of Mercantile Bankshares Common Stock
in respect of whom such deduction and withholding was made by the Exchange Agent
or PNC, as the case may be.

prior to the date of this Agreement (the "MERCANTILE BANKSHARES SEC REPORTS")
and (ii) communication mailed by Mercantile Bankshares to its stockholders since
January 1, 2005 and prior to the date of this Agreement. No such Mercantile
Bankshares SEC Report or communication, at the time filed, furnished or
communicated (and, in the case of registration statements and proxy statements,
on the dates of effectiveness and the dates of the relevant meetings,
respectively), contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances in which they
were made, not misleading. As of their respective dates, all Mercantile
Bankshares SEC Reports complied as to form in all material respects with the
published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto.

          3.6 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. (a) The financial statements of Mercantile
Bankshares and its Subsidiaries included (or incorporated by reference) in the

applicable) (i) have been prepared from, and are in accordance with, the books
and records of Mercantile Bankshares and its Subsidiaries, (ii) fairly present
in all material respects the consolidated results of operations, cash flows,
changes in shareholders' equity and consolidated financial position of

(iii) complied as to form, as of their respective dates


                                       13

of filing with the SEC, in all material respects with applicable accounting
requirements and with the published rules and regulations of the SEC with
respect thereto, and (iv) have been prepared in accordance with GAAP
consistently applied during the periods involved, except, in each case, as
indicated in such statements or in the notes thereto. The books and records of
Mercantile Bankshares and its Subsidiaries have been, and are being, maintained
in all material respects in accordance with GAAP and any other applicable legal
and accounting requirements and reflect only actual transactions. Ernst & Young
LLP has not resigned or been dismissed as independent public accountants of
Mercantile Bankshares as a result of or in connection with any disagreements
with Mercantile Bankshares on a matter of accounting principles or practices,
financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure.

          (b) Neither Mercantile Bankshares nor any of its Subsidiaries has any
material liability of any nature whatsoever (whether absolute, accrued,
contingent or otherwise and whether due or to become due), except for those
liabilities that are reflected or reserved against on the consolidated balance
sheet of Mercantile Bankshares included in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for
the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2006 (including any notes thereto) and for
liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice since June 30, 2006 or in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby.

          (c) The records, systems, controls, data and information of Mercantile
Bankshares and its Subsidiaries are recorded, stored, maintained and operated
under means (including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process,
whether computerized or not) that are under the exclusive ownership and direct
control of Mercantile Bankshares or its Subsidiaries or accountants (including
all means of access thereto and therefrom), except for any non-exclusive
ownership and non-direct control that would not reasonably be expected to have a
material adverse effect on Mercantile Bankshares. Mercantile Bankshares (x) has
implemented and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule
13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to ensure that material information relating to
Mercantile Bankshares, including its consolidated Subsidiaries, is made known to
the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer of Mercantile
Bankshares by others within those entities, and (y) has disclosed, based on its
most recent evaluation prior to the date hereof, to Mercantile Bankshares's
outside auditors and the audit committee of Mercantile Bankshares's Board of
Directors (i) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design
or operation of internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule
13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) which are reasonably likely to adversely affect
Mercantile Bankshares's ability to record, process, summarize and report
financial information, and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that
involves management or other employees who have a significant role in Mercantile
Bankshares's internal controls over financial reporting. These disclosures were
made in writing by management to Mercantile Bankshares's auditors and audit
committee and a copy has previously been made available to PNC. As of the date
hereof, there is no reason to believe that its outside auditors and its chief
executive officer and chief financial officer will not be able to give the
certifications and attestations required pursuant to the rules and regulations
adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the
"SARBANES-OXLEY ACT"), without qualification, when next due.

          (d) Since December 31, 2005, (i) through the date hereof, neither

<PAGE>

accounting or auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or methods of
Mercantile Bankshares or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective internal
accounting controls, including any material complaint, allegation, assertion or
claim that Mercantile Bankshares or any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in
questionable accounting or auditing practices, and (ii) no attorney representing
Mercantile Bankshares or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by
Mercantile Bankshares or any of its Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a
material violation of securities laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar
violation by Mercantile Bankshares or any of its officers, directors, employees

thereof or to any director or officer of Mercantile Bankshares.

agreements, true, complete and correct copies of which have been previously
delivered to PNC.

          3.8 ABSENCE OF CERTAIN CHANGES OR EVENTS. (a) Since December 31, 2005,
no event or events have occurred that have had or are reasonably likely to have,
either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Mercantile

with respect to PNC, Mercantile Bankshares or the Surviving Corporation, as the

administer, any such Plan. No Mercantile Bankshares Benefit Plan is a
multiemployer plan or multiple employer plan within the meaning of Sections
4001(a)(3) or 4063/4064 of

Bankshares Benefit Plans and no event, transaction or condition has occurred or
exists that could reasonably be expected to result in any such liability to
Mercantile Bankshares or any of its Subsidiaries. There does not now exist, nor

          4.5 REPORTS; REGULATORY MATTERS. (a) PNC and each of its Subsidiaries
have timely filed all reports, registrations and statements, together with any
amendments required to be made with respect thereto, that they were required to
file since January 1, 2005 with the Regulatory Agencies and each other
applicable Governmental Entity, and all other reports and statements required to
be filed by them since January 1, 2005, including any report or statement
required to be filed pursuant to the laws, rules or regulations of the United
States, any state, any


                                       30
<PAGE>

foreign entity, or any Regulatory Agency, and have paid all fees and assessments
due and payable in connection therewith. Except for normal examinations
conducted by a Regulatory Agency or Governmental Entity in the ordinary course
of the business of PNC and its Subsidiaries, no Regulatory Agency or
Governmental Entity has initiated since January 1, 2005 or has pending any
proceeding, enforcement action or, to the knowledge of PNC, investigation into
the business, disclosures or operations of PNC or any of its Subsidiaries. Since
January 1, 2005, no Regulatory Agency or Governmental Entity has resolved any
proceeding, enforcement action or, to the knowledge of PNC, investigation into
the business, disclosures or operations of PNC or any of its Subsidiaries. There
is no unresolved violation, criticism, or exception by any Regulatory Agency or
Governmental Entity with respect to any report or statement relating to any
examinations or inspections of PNC or any of its Subsidiaries. Since January 1,
2005, there has been no formal or, with respect to the Federal Reserve Board,
FDIC, the OCC, the SEC, the NASD and state banking regulators only, informal
inquiries by, or disagreements or disputes with, any Regulatory Agency or
Governmental Entity with respect to the business, operations, policies or
procedures of PNC or any of its Subsidiaries (other than normal examinations
conducted by a Regulatory Agency or Governmental Entity in PNC's ordinary course
of business).

          (b) Neither PNC nor any of its Subsidiaries is subject to any
cease-and-desist or other order or enforcement action issued by, or is a party
to any written agreement, consent agreement or memorandum of understanding with,
or is a party to any commitment letter or similar undertaking to, or is subject
to any order or directive by, or has been since January 1, 2005 a recipient of
any supervisory letter from, or has been ordered to pay any civil money penalty
by, or since January 1, 2005 has adopted any policies, procedures or board
resolutions at the request or suggestion of, any Regulatory Agency or other
Governmental Entity that currently restricts in any material respect the conduct
of its business or that in any material manner relates to its capital adequacy,
its ability to pay dividends, its credit, risk management or compliance
policies, its internal controls, its management or its business, other than
those of general application that apply to bank holding companies or their
Subsidiaries (each, a "PNC REGULATORY AGREEMENT"), nor has PNC or any of its
Subsidiaries been advised since January 1, 2005 by any Regulatory Agency or
other Governmental Entity that it is considering issuing, initiating, ordering
or requesting any such PNC Regulatory Agreement. Each of the PNC Bank
Subsidiaries is and, to the knowledge of PNC there has not been any event or
occurrence since January 1, 2005 that could reasonably be expected to result in
a determination that any PNC Bank Subsidiary is not, "well capitalized" and
"well managed" as a matter of U.S. federal banking law. Each of the PNC Bank
Subsidiaries has at least a "satisfactory" rating under the U.S. Community
Reinvestment Act.

          (c) PNC has previously made available to Mercantile Bankshares an
accurate and complete copy of each (i) final registration statement, prospectus,
report, schedule and definitive proxy statement filed with or furnished to the
SEC by PNC since January 1, 2005 pursuant to the Securities Act or the Exchange
Act and prior to the date of this Agreement (the "PNC SEC REPORTS") and (ii)
communication mailed by PNC to its stockholders since January 1, 2005 and prior
to the date of this Agreement. No such PNC SEC Report or communication, at the
time filed, furnished or communicated (and, in the case of registration
statements and proxy statements, on the dates of effectiveness and the dates of
the relevant meetings, respectively), contained any untrue statement of a
material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to


                                       31
<PAGE>

be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in
light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading. As of their
respective dates, all PNC SEC Reports complied as to form in all material
respects with the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect
thereto.

          4.6 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. (a) The financial statements of PNC and its
Subsidiaries included (or incorporated by reference) in the PNC SEC Reports
(including the related notes, where applicable) (i) have been prepared from, and
are in accordance with, the books and records of PNC and its Subsidiaries; (ii)
fairly present in all material respects the consolidated results of operations,
cash flows, changes in stockholders' equity and consolidated financial position
of PNC and its Subsidiaries for the respective fiscal periods or as of the
respective dates therein set forth (subject in the case of unaudited statements
to recurring year-end audit adjustments normal in nature and amount); (iii)
complied as to form, as of their respective dates of filing with the SEC, in all
material respects with applicable accounting requirements and with the published
rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto; and (iv) have been
prepared in accordance with GAAP consistently applied during the periods
involved, except, in each case, as indicated in such statements or in the notes
thereto. The books and records of PNC and its Subsidiaries have been, and are
being, maintained in all material respects in accordance with GAAP and any other
applicable legal and accounting requirements and reflect only actual
transactions. Deloitte & Touche LLP has not resigned or been dismissed as
independent public accountants of PNC as a result of or in connection with any
disagreements with PNC on a matter of accounting principles or practices,
financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure.

          (b) Neither PNC nor any of its Subsidiaries has any material liability
of any nature whatsoever (whether absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise and
whether due or to become due), except for those liabilities that are reflected
or reserved against on the consolidated balance sheet of PNC included in its
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2006
(including any notes thereto) and for liabilities incurred in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice since June 30, 2006 or in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

          (c) The records, systems, controls, data and information of PNC and
its Subsidiaries are recorded, stored, maintained and operated under means
(including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether
computerized or not) that are under the exclusive ownership and direct control
of PNC or its Subsidiaries or accountants (including all means of access thereto
and therefrom), except for any non-exclusive ownership and non-direct control
that would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on PNC.
PNC (x) has implemented and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as
defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to ensure that material
information relating to PNC, including its consolidated Subsidiaries, is made
known to the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer of PNC by
others within those entities, and (y) has disclosed, based on its most recent
evaluation prior to the date hereof, to PNC's outside auditors and the audit
committee of PNC's Board of Directors (i) any significant deficiencies and
material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over
financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) which are
reasonably likely to adversely affect PNC's ability to record, process,
summarize and report financial information and (ii) any fraud, whether or not
material, that


                                       32
<PAGE>

involves management or other employees who have a significant role in PNC's
internal controls over financial reporting. These disclosures were made in
writing by management to PNC's auditors and audit committee and a copy has
previously been made available to Mercantile Bankshares. As of the date hereof,
there is no reason to believe that its outside auditors and its chief executive
officer and chief financial officer will not be able to give the certifications
and attestations required pursuant to the rules and regulations adopted pursuant
to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without qualification, when next due.

          (d) Since December 31, 2005, (x) through the date hereof, neither PNC
nor any of its Subsidiaries has received or otherwise had or obtained knowledge
of any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim, whether written or
oral, regarding the accounting or auditing practices, procedures, methodologies
or methods of PNC or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective internal
accounting controls, including any material complaint, allegation, assertion or
claim that PNC or any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in questionable accounting
or auditing practices, and (y) no attorney representing PNC or any of its
Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by PNC or any of its Subsidiaries, has
reported evidence of a material violation of securities laws, breach of
fiduciary duty or similar violation by PNC or any of its officers, directors,
employees or agents to the Board of Directors of PNC or any committee thereof or
to any director or officer of PNC.

          4.7 BROKER'S FEES. Neither PNC nor any PNC Subsidiary nor any of their
respective officers or directors has employed any broker or finder or incurred
any liability for any broker's fees, commissions or finder's fees in connection
with the Merger or related transactions contemplated by this Agreement, other
than as set forth on Section 4.7 of the PNC Disclosure Schedule.

          4.8 ABSENCE OF CERTAIN CHANGES OR EVENTS. (a) Since December 31, 2005,
no event or events have occurred that have had or are reasonably likely to have,
individually, or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on PNC.

          (b) Since December 31, 2005 through and including the date of this
Agreement, PNC and its Subsidiaries have carried on their respective businesses
in all material respects in the ordinary course of business consistent with
their past practice.

          (c) Since June 30, 2006 through and including the date of this
Agreement, neither PNC nor any of its Subsidiaries has changed any accounting
methods, principles or practices of PNC or its Subsidiaries affecting its
assets, liabilities or businesses, including any reserving, renewal or residual
method, practice or policy, except as required by applicable law or GAAP.

          4.9 LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. (a) None of PNC or any of its Subsidiaries is a
party to any, and there are no pending or, to the best of PNC's knowledge,
threatened, material legal, administrative, arbitral or other material
proceedings, claims, actions or governmental or regulatory investigations of any
nature against PNC or any of its Subsidiaries.

          (b) There is no Injunction, judgment, or regulatory restriction (other
than those of general application that apply to similarly situated bank holding
companies or their


                                       33
<PAGE>

Subsidiaries) imposed upon PNC, any of its Subsidiaries or the assets of PNC or
any of its Subsidiaries.

          4.10 TAXES AND TAX RETURNS. Each of PNC and its Subsidiaries has duly
and timely filed (including all applicable extensions) all material Tax Returns
required to be filed by it on or prior to the date of this Agreement (all such
Tax Returns being accurate and complete in all material respects), has timely
paid all Taxes shown thereon as arising and has duly and timely paid all
material Taxes that are due and payable or claimed to be due from it by federal,
state, foreign or local taxing authorities other than Taxes that are being
contested in good faith, which have not been finally determined, and have been
adequately reserved against in accordance with GAAP on PNC's most recent
consolidated financial statements. There are no material disputes, audits,
examinations or proceedings pending, or claims asserted, for Taxes or
assessments upon PNC or any of its Subsidiaries for which PNC does not have
reserves that are adequate under GAAP.

          4.11 COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAW. (a) PNC and each of its
Subsidiaries hold all material licenses, franchises, permits and authorizations
necessary for the lawful conduct of their respective businesses under and

default in any material respect under any, applicable law, statute, order, rule,
regulation, policy or guideline of any Governmental Entity relating to PNC or
any of its Subsidiaries.

          (b) Since the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, PNC has been and is
in compliance in all material respects with (i) the applicable provisions of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act and (ii) the applicable listing and corporate governance
rules and regulations of the NYSE.

          4.12 RISK MANAGEMENT INSTRUMENTS. All Derivative Transactions
outstanding as of the date hereof (which for the avoidance of doubt shall not
include any PNC stock option), whether entered into for the account of PNC or
any PNC Subsidiary or for the account of a customer of PNC or any PNC
Subsidiary, were duly authorized and entered into in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice and in accordance with prudent banking
practice and applicable laws, rules, regulations and policies of any Regulatory
Authority and in accordance with the investment, securities, commodities, risk
management and other policies, practices and procedures employed by PNC or any
PNC Subsidiary, and with counterparties believed at the time to be financially
responsible and able to understand (either alone or in consultation with their
advisers) and to bear the risks of such Derivative Transactions. All of such
Derivative Transactions are legal, valid and binding obligations of PNC or a PNC
Subsidiary enforceable against it in accordance with their terms (except as may
be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, reorganization or similar laws
affecting the rights of creditors generally and subject to general principles of
equity), and are in full force and effect. PNC and each applicable PNC
Subsidiary have duly performed their obligations under the Derivative
Transactions to the extent that such obligations to perform have accrued and, to
PNC's knowledge, there are no breaches, violations or defaults or allegations or
assertions of such by any party thereunder.

          4.13 PROPERTY. PNC or a PNC Subsidiary (a) has good and marketable
title to all the properties and assets reflected in the latest audited balance
sheet included in the PNC SEC

<PAGE>

Reports as being owned by PNC or a PNC Subsidiary or acquired after the date
thereof (except properties sold or otherwise disposed of since the date thereof
in the ordinary course of business) (the "PNC OWNED PROPERTIES"), free and clear
of all Liens of any nature whatsoever, except Permitted Encumbrances, and (b) is
the lessee of all leasehold estates reflected in the latest audited financial
statements included in such PNC SEC Reports or acquired after the date thereof
(except for leases that have expired by their terms since the date thereof) (the
"PNC LEASED PROPERTIES" and, collectively with the PNC Owned Properties, the
"PNC REAL PROPERTY"), free and clear of all Liens of any nature whatsoever,
except for Permitted Encumbrances, and is in possession of the properties
purported to be leased thereunder, and each such lease is valid without default
thereunder by the lessee or, to the PNC knowledge, the lessor. There are no
pending or, to the knowledge of PNC, threatened condemnation proceedings against
the PNC Real Property. PNC and its Subsidiaries are in compliance with all
applicable health and safety related requirements for the PNC Real Property,
including those under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and the
Occupational Health and Safety Act of 1970.

          4.14 ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITY. There are no legal, administrative,
arbitral or other proceedings, claims, actions, causes of action or notices with

result in, any liability or obligation of PNC or any of its Subsidiaries arising
under common law or under any local, state or federal environmental, health or
safety statute, regulation or ordinance, including the Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended,
pending or threatened against PNC or any of its Subsidiaries. To the knowledge
of PNC, there is no reasonable basis for, or circumstances that are reasonably
likely to give rise to, any such proceeding, claim, action, investigation or
remediation by any Governmental Entity or any third party that would give rise
to any liability or obligation on the part of PNC or any of its Subsidiaries.
Neither PNC nor any of its Subsidiaries is subject to any agreement, order,
judgment, decree, letter or memorandum by or with any Governmental Entity or
third party imposing any liability or obligation with respect to any of the
foregoing.

          4.15 REORGANIZATION; APPROVALS. As of the date of this Agreement, PNC
(a) is not aware of any fact or circumstance that could reasonably be expected
to prevent the Merger from qualifying as a "reorganization" within the meaning
of Section 368(a) of the Code, and (b) knows of no reason why all regulatory
approvals from any Governmental Entity required for the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement should not be obtained on a timely
basis.

Closing have available to it sufficient funds to deliver the aggregate Cash
Consideration.

          4.17 PNC INFORMATION. The information relating to PNC and its
Subsidiaries that is provided by PNC or its representatives for inclusion in the
Proxy Statement and the Form S-4, or in any application, notification or other
document filed with any other Regulatory Agency or other Governmental Entity in

contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which
they are


                                       35

good title to all securities owned by it (except those sold under repurchase
agreements or held in any fiduciary or agency capacity), free and clear of any
Liens, except to the extent such securities are pledged in the ordinary course
of business to secure obligations of PNC or its Subsidiaries. Such securities
are valued on the books of PNC in accordance with GAAP in all material respects.

          (b) PNC and its Subsidiaries and their respective businesses employ
investment, securities, commodities, risk management and other policies,
practices and procedures (the "POLICIES, PRACTICES AND PROCEDURES") which PNC
believes are prudent and reasonable in the context of such businesses.

September 30, 2006, of all Loans payable to PNC or its Subsidiaries, other than
"non-accrual" Loans, and (ii) the aggregate outstanding principal amount, as of

of indebtedness which are true, genuine and what they purport to be, (ii) to the
extent secured, has been secured by valid liens and security interests which

affecting the rights of creditors generally and subject to general principles of
equity). All Loans originated by PNC or its Subsidiaries, and all such Loans

Closing Date will be, free and clear of any Lien, and PNC or its Subsidiaries
has complied in all material respects, and on the Closing Date will have
complied in all material respects, with all laws and regulations relating to
such Loans.

                                   ARTICLE VI


                              ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

          6.1 REGULATORY MATTERS. (a) PNC and Mercantile Bankshares shall
promptly prepare and file with the SEC the Form S-4, in which the Proxy
Statement will be included as a prospectus. Each of PNC and Mercantile
Bankshares shall use its reasonable best efforts to have the Form S-4 declared
effective under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such filing,
and Mercantile Bankshares shall thereafter mail or deliver the Proxy Statement
to its stockholders. PNC shall also use its reasonable best efforts to obtain
all necessary state securities law or "Blue Sky" permits and approvals required
to carry out the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and Mercantile
Bankshares shall furnish all information concerning Mercantile Bankshares and
the holders of Mercantile Bankshares Common Stock as may be reasonably requested
in connection with any such action.

          (b) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the parties
shall use their reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable under applicable law to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the parties
shall cooperate with each other and use their respective reasonable best efforts
to promptly prepare and file all necessary documentation, to effect all
applications, notices, petitions and filings, to obtain as promptly as
practicable all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third
parties and Governmental Entities that are necessary or advisable to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Merger), and to
comply with the terms and conditions of all such permits, consents, approvals
and authorizations of all such third parties or Governmental Entities
(including, subject to the penultimate sentence of this Section 6.1(b), agreeing
to and complying with any actions, conditions or restrictions required or
imposed in connection with obtaining the foregoing permits, consents, approvals
and authorizations of third parties and Governmental Entities). Mercantile
Bankshares and PNC shall have the right to review in advance, and, to the extent
practicable, each will consult the other on, in each case subject to applicable
laws relating to the confidentiality of information, all the information
relating to Mercantile Bankshares or PNC, as the case may be, and any of their
respective Subsidiaries, which appear in any filing made with, or written
materials submitted to, any third party or any Governmental Entity in connection
with the transactions contemplated by


                                       40
<PAGE>

this Agreement. In exercising the foregoing right, each of the parties shall act
reasonably and as promptly as practicable. The parties shall consult with each
other with respect to the obtaining of all permits, consents, approvals and
authorizations of all third parties and Governmental Entities necessary or
advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and each
party will keep the other apprised of the status of matters relating to
completion of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, nothing contained herein shall be deemed to require PNC to take
any action, or commit to take any action, or agree to any condition or
restriction, in connection with obtaining the foregoing permits, consents,
approvals and authorizations of third parties or Governmental Entities, that
would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect (measured on a
scale relative to Mercantile Bankshares and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole)
on either PNC or Mercantile Bankshares (a "MATERIALLY BURDENSOME REGULATORY
CONDITION"). In addition, Mercantile Bankshares agrees to cooperate and use its
reasonable best efforts to assist PNC in preparing and filing such petitions and
filings, and in obtaining such permits, consents, approvals and authorizations
of third parties and Governmental Entities, that may be necessary or advisable
to effect any mergers and/or consolidations of Subsidiaries of Mercantile
Bankshares and PNC following consummation of the Merger.

          (c) Each of PNC and Mercantile Bankshares shall, upon request, furnish
to the other all information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors,
officers and stockholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary
or advisable in connection with the Proxy Statement, the Form S-4 or any other
statement, filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of PNC, Mercantile
Bankshares or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any Governmental Entity in
connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

          (d) Each of PNC and Mercantile Bankshares shall promptly advise the
other upon receiving any communication from any Governmental Entity the consent
or approval of which is required for consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement that causes such party to believe that there is a
reasonable likelihood that any PNC Requisite Regulatory Approval will not be
obtained or that the receipt of any such approval may be materially delayed.

          6.2 ACCESS TO INFORMATION. (a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to
applicable laws relating to the confidentiality of information, each of
Mercantile Bankshares and PNC shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries
to, afford to the officers, employees, accountants, counsel, advisors, agents
and other representatives of the other party, reasonable access, during normal
business hours during the period prior to the Effective Time, to all its
properties, books, contracts, commitments and records, and, during such period,
such party shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, make available to the
other party (i) a copy of each report, schedule, registration statement and
other document filed or received by it during such period pursuant to the
requirements of federal securities laws or federal or state banking or insurance
laws (other than reports or documents that such party is not permitted to
disclose under applicable law) and (ii) all other information concerning its
business, properties and personnel as the other party may reasonably request.
Neither Mercantile Bankshares nor PNC, nor any of their Subsidiaries, shall be
required to provide access to or to disclose information where such access or
disclosure would jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of such party or its


                                       41
<PAGE>

Subsidiaries or contravene any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment, decree,
fiduciary duty or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of this
Agreement. The parties shall make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements
under circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply.

          (b) All information and materials provided pursuant to this Agreement
shall be subject to the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement entered into
between the parties as of September 29, 2006 (the "CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT").

          (c) No investigation by a party hereto or its representatives shall
affect the representations and warranties of the other party set forth in this
Agreement.

          6.3 STOCKHOLDER APPROVAL. Mercantile Bankshares shall call a special
meeting of its stockholders to be held as soon as reasonably practicable for the
purpose of obtaining the requisite stockholder approval required in connection
with the Merger, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause such meeting
to occur as soon as reasonably practicable. The board of directors of Mercantile
Bankshares has adopted resolutions recommending to the stockholders of
Mercantile Bankshares the adoption of this Agreement, and the board of directors
of Mercantile Bankshares shall recommend to the stockholders of Mercantile
Bankshares the approval and adoption of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the board of directors of Mercantile Bankshares may withdraw, modify,
condition or refuse to recommend the adoption of this Agreement if the board of
directors of Mercantile Bankshares determines, in good faith after consultation
with its outside financial and legal advisors, that the failure to take such
action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations under applicable
law. Notwithstanding any such withdrawal, modification, condition or refusal to
recommend, this Agreement and such other matters shall be submitted to the
stockholders for the purpose of approving the Agreement and such other matters,
and nothing contained herein shall be deemed to relieve Mercantile Bankshares of
such obligation, PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if the Board of Directors of Mercantile
Bankshares shall have withdrawn, modified, conditioned or refused to recommend
the adoption of this Agreement and such other matters in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement, then in submitting this Agreement to the stockholders
of the Mercantile Bankshares, the board of directors of Mercantile Bankshares
may submit this Agreement to the stockholders of Mercantile Bankshares without
recommendation (although the resolutions approving and adopting this Agreement
as of the date hereof may not be rescinded or amended), in which event the board
of directors of Mercantile Bankshares may communicate the basis for its lack of
a recommendation to the stockholders of Mercantile Bankshares in the Proxy
Statement or an appropriate amendment or supplement thereto to the extent
required by law.

          6.4 AFFILIATES. Mercantile Bankshares shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause each director, executive officer and other person who is an
"affiliate" (for purposes of Rule 145 under the Securities Act) of Mercantile
Bankshares to deliver to PNC, as soon as practicable after the date of this
Agreement, and prior to the date of the meeting of the Mercantile Bankshares
stockholders to be held pursuant to Section 6.3, a written agreement, in the
form of Exhibit A.


                                       42
<PAGE>

          6.5 NYSE LISTING. PNC shall cause the shares of PNC Common Stock to be
issued in the Merger to be approved for listing on the NYSE, subject to official
notice of issuance, prior to the Effective Time.

          6.6 EMPLOYEE MATTERS. (a) PNC shall, or shall cause its applicable
Subsidiaries to, provide to those individuals actively employed by Mercantile
Bankshares or one of its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time (collectively,
the "COVERED EMPLOYEES") with (i) employee benefits, rates of base salary or
hourly wage and annual bonus opportunities that are either (x) substantially
similar, in the aggregate, to the aggregate rates of base salary or hourly wage
provided to such Covered Employees and the aggregate employee benefits and
annual bonus opportunities provided to such Covered Employees under the
Mercantile Bankshares Benefit Plans as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time or (y) no less favorable, in the aggregate, than the compensation
and benefit arrangements that are provided to similarly situated employees of
PNC (provided that PNC will continue Mercantile Bankshares compensation and
benefits until Mercantile Bankshares employees are converted to PNC's payroll
system); and (ii) severance protection for any Covered Employee (other than for
those Covered Employees covered by change of control or severance plans or
agreements) who is terminated without cause during the one-year period following
the Effective Time in amounts set forth on Section 6.6(a) of the Mercantile
Bankshares Disclosure Schedule and otherwise on terms and conditions applicable
to similarly situated employees of PNC; PROVIDED that nothing herein shall limit
the right of PNC or any of its Subsidiaries to terminate the employment of any
Covered Employee at any time.

          (b) To the extent that a Covered Employee becomes eligible to
participate in an employee benefit plan maintained by PNC or any of its
Subsidiaries, other than Mercantile Bankshares or its Subsidiaries, PNC shall
cause such employee benefit plan to (i) recognize the service of such Covered
Employee with Mercantile Bankshares or its Subsidiaries for purposes of
eligibility and vesting and, except under defined benefit pension plans, benefit
accrual under such employee benefit plan of PNC or any of its Subsidiaries to
the same extent such service was recognized immediately prior to the Effective
Time under a comparable Mercantile Bankshares Benefit Plan in which such Covered
Employee was a participant immediately prior to the Effective Time; PROVIDED
that for purposes of determining the level of credit based on service after the
Effective Time under any cash balance pension plan in which Covered Employees
participate after the Effective Time, PNC will provide credit for prior service
of Covered Employees with Mercantile Bankshares or its Subsidiaries; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that the recognition of service under this clause (i) shall not operate
to duplicate any benefits with respect to the Covered Employee, and (ii) with
respect to any health, dental or vision plan of PNC or any of its Subsidiaries
(other than Mercantile Bankshares and its Subsidiaries) in which any Covered
Employee is eligible to participate in the plan year that includes the year in
which such Covered Employee is eligible to participate, (x) cause any
pre-existing condition limitations under such PNC or Subsidiary plan to be
waived with respect to such Covered Employee to the extent such limitation would
have been waived or satisfied under the Mercantile Bankshares Benefit Plan in
which such Covered Employee participated immediately prior to the Effective
Time, and (y) recognize any medical or other health expenses incurred by such
Covered Employee in the year that includes the Closing Date for purposes of any
applicable deductible and annual out-of-pocket expense requirements under any
such health, dental or vision plan of PNC or any of its Subsidiaries.


                                       43
<PAGE>

          (c) From and after the Effective Time, PNC shall, or shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, honor, in accordance with the terms thereof as in effect as of
the date hereof or as may be amended after the date hereof but prior to the
Effective Time with the prior written consent of PNC, each employment agreement
and change in control agreement of Mercantile Bankshares and its Subsidiaries
and the obligations of Mercantile Bankshares and its Subsidiaries as of the
Effective Time under each deferred compensation plan or agreement.

          (d) Without limiting the generality of the final sentence of Section
9.10, nothing in this Section 6.6, express or implied is intended to or shall
confer upon any other person including without limitation any Covered Employee,
any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this
Agreement and no provision of this Section 6.6 shall constitute an amendment of
any Mercantile Bankshares Benefit Plan.

          6.7 INDEMNIFICATION; DIRECTORS' AND OFFICERS' INSURANCE. (a) In the
event of any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal or administrative (a "CLAIM"), including
any such Claim in which any individual who is now, or has been at any time prior
to the date of this Agreement, or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a
director or officer of Mercantile Bankshares or any of its Subsidiaries or who
is or was serving at the request of Mercantile Bankshares or any of its
Subsidiaries as a director or officer of another person (the "INDEMNIFIED
PARTIES"), is, or is threatened to be, made a party based in whole or in part
on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to (i) the fact that he
is or was a director or officer of Mercantile Bankshares or any of its
Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time or (ii) this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, whether asserted or arising before
or after the Effective Time, the parties shall cooperate and use their best
efforts to defend against and respond thereto. All rights to indemnification and
exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time now existing in favor of any Indemnified Party as provided in the
respective certificates or articles of incorporation or by-laws (or comparable
organizational documents) of each party and/or its respective Subsidiaries, and
any existing indemnification agreements, including those set forth in Section
6.7 of the Mercantile Bankshares Disclosure Schedule, shall survive the Merger
and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms, and
shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified after the Effective Time,
except for those set forth in certificates or articles of incorporation or
bylaws (or comparable organizational documents), which shall not be amended,
repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six years after the Effective
Time, it being understood that nothing in this sentence shall require any
amendment to the certificate of incorporation or by-laws of the Surviving
Corporation.

          (b) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, indemnify, defend and
hold harmless, and provide advancement of expenses to, each Indemnified Party
against all losses, claims, damages, costs, expenses (including fees and
expenses of counsel), fines, penalties, liabilities or judgments or amounts that
are paid in settlement of or in connection with any Claim based in whole or in
part on or arising in whole or in part out of the fact that such person is or
was a director or officer of Mercantile Bankshares or any Subsidiary of
Mercantile Bankshares, and pertaining to any matter existing or occurring, or
any acts or omissions occurring, at or prior to the Effective Time, whether
asserted or claimed prior to, or at or after, the Effective Time (including
matters, acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this
Agreement and the consummation of


                                       44
<PAGE>

the transactions contemplated hereby) or taken at the request of PNC pursuant to
Section 6.8 hereof.

          (c) PNC shall cause the individuals serving as officers and directors
of Mercantile Bankshares or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the
Effective Time to be covered for a period of six years from the Effective Time
by the directors' and officers' liability insurance policy maintained by
Mercantile Bankshares (PROVIDED that PNC may substitute therefor policies of at
least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions that are not
less advantageous than such policy) with respect to acts or omissions occurring
prior to the Effective Time that were committed by such officers and directors
in their capacity as such; PROVIDED that in no event shall PNC be required to
expend annually in the aggregate an amount in excess of 250% of the annual
premiums currently paid by Mercantile Bankshares (which current amount is set
forth in Section 6.7 of the Mercantile Bankshares Disclosure Schedule) for such
insurance (the "INSURANCE AMOUNT"), and PROVIDED FURTHER that if PNC is unable
to maintain such policy (or such substitute policy) as a result of the preceding
proviso, PNC shall obtain as much comparable insurance as is available for the
Insurance Amount.

          (d) The provisions of this Section 6.7 shall survive the Effective
Time and are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by,
each Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives.

          6.8 ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS. In case at any time after the Effective
Time any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of
this Agreement (including any merger between a Subsidiary of PNC, on the one
hand, and a Subsidiary of Mercantile Bankshares, on the other) or to vest the
Surviving Corporation with full title to all properties, assets, rights,
approvals, immunities and franchises of either party to the Merger, the proper
officers and directors of each party and their respective Subsidiaries shall, at
PNC's sole expense, take all such necessary action as may be reasonably
requested by PNC.

          6.9 ADVICE OF CHANGES. Each of PNC and Mercantile Bankshares shall
promptly advise the other of any change or event (i) having or reasonably likely
to have a Material Adverse Effect on it or (ii) that it believes would or would
be reasonably likely to cause or constitute a material breach of any of its
representations, warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that no such notification shall affect the representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements of the parties (or remedies with respect thereto) or the
conditions to the obligations of the parties under this Agreement; and PROVIDED
FURTHER that a failure to comply with this Section 6.9 shall not constitute a
breach of this Agreement or the failure of any condition set forth in Article
VII to be satisfied unless the underlying Material Adverse Effect or material
breach would independently result in the failure of a condition set forth in
Article VII to be satisfied.

          6.10 EXEMPTION FROM LIABILITY UNDER SECTION 16(B). Prior to the
Effective Time, PNC and Mercantile Bankshares shall each take all such steps as
may be necessary or appropriate to cause any disposition of shares of Mercantile
Bankshares Common Stock or conversion of any derivative securities in respect of
such shares of Mercantile Bankshares Common Stock in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be exempt
under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act, including any


                                       45
<PAGE>

such actions specified in the No-Action Letter dated January 12, 1999, issued by
the SEC to Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, LLP.

          6.11 NO SOLICITATION. (a) None of Mercantile Bankshares, its
Subsidiaries or any or its or their officers, directors or employees shall,
directly or indirectly, and they shall use their best efforts to cause any
investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other retained
representative or agent not to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate,
encourage, facilitate (including by way of furnishing information) or take any
other action designed to facilitate any inquiries or proposals regarding any
merger, share exchange, consolidation, sale of assets, sale of shares of capital
stock (including by way of a tender offer) or similar transactions involving
Mercantile Bankshares or any of its Subsidiaries that, if consummated, would
constitute an Alternative Transaction (any of the foregoing inquiries or
proposals being referred to herein as an "ALTERNATIVE PROPOSAL"), (ii)
participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding an Alternative
Transaction or (iii) enter into any agreement regarding any Alternative
Transaction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board of Directors of Mercantile
Bankshares shall be permitted, prior to the meeting of Mercantile Bankshares
stockholders to be held pursuant to Section 6.3, and subject to compliance with
the other terms of this Section 6.11 and to first entering into a
confidentiality agreement with the person proposing such Alternative Proposal on
terms substantially similar to, and no less favorable to Mercantile Bankshares
than, those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement (it being understood that
the standstill provision contained therein may permit such person to convey
confidentially an Alternative Proposal to the Mercantile Bankshares board of
directors under circumstances in which Mercantile Bankshares is permitted to
discuss an Alternative Proposal hereunder), consider and participate in
discussions and negotiations with respect to a bona fide Alternative Proposal
received by Mercantile Bankshares, if and only to the extent that the Board of
Directors of Mercantile Bankshares reasonably determines in good faith (after
consultation with outside legal counsel) that failure to do so would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties.

          As used in this Agreement, "ALTERNATIVE TRANSACTION" means any of (i)
a transaction pursuant to which any person (or group of persons) (other than PNC
or its affiliates), directly or indirectly, acquires or would acquire more than
25% of the outstanding shares of Mercantile Bankshares Common Stock or
outstanding voting power or of any new series or new class of preferred stock
that would be entitled to a class or series vote with respect to the Merger,
whether from Mercantile Bankshares or pursuant to a tender offer or exchange
offer or otherwise, (ii) a merger, share exchange, consolidation or other
business combination involving Mercantile Bankshares (other than the Merger),
(iii) any transaction pursuant to which any person (or group of persons) (other
than PNC or its affiliates) acquires or would acquire control of assets
(including for this purpose the outstanding equity securities of subsidiaries of
Mercantile Bankshares and securities of the entity surviving any merger or
business combination including any of Mercantile Bankshares's Subsidiaries) of
Mercantile Bankshares, or any of its Subsidiaries representing more than 25% of
the fair market value of all the assets, net revenues or net income of
Mercantile Bankshares and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, immediately prior
to such transaction, or (iv) any other consolidation, business combination,
recapitalization or similar transaction involving Mercantile Bankshares or any
of its Subsidiaries, other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
as a result of which the holders of shares of Mercantile Bankshares immediately
prior to such transactions do not, in the aggregate, own at least 75% of the
outstanding shares of common stock and the outstanding voting power of the


                                       46
<PAGE>

surviving or resulting entity in such transaction immediately after the
consummation thereof in substantially the same proportion as such holders held
the shares of Mercantile Bankshares Common Stock immediately prior to the
consummation thereof.

          (b) Mercantile Bankshares shall notify PNC promptly (but in no event
later than 24 hours) after receipt of any Alternative Proposal, or any material
modification of or material amendment to any Alternative Proposal, or any
request for nonpublic information relating to Mercantile Bankshares or any of
its Subsidiaries or for access to the properties, books or records of Mercantile
Bankshares or any Subsidiary by any Person or entity that informs the Board of
Directors of Mercantile Bankshares or any Subsidiary that it is considering
making, or has made, an Alternative Proposal. Such notice to PNC shall be made
orally and in writing, and shall indicate the identity of the Person making the
Alternative Proposal or intending to make or considering making an Alternative
Proposal or requesting non-public information or access to the books and records
of Mercantile Bankshares or any Subsidiary, and the material terms of any such
Alternative Proposal or modification or amendment to an Alternative Proposal.
Mercantile Bankshares shall keep PNC fully informed, on a current basis, of any
material changes in the status and any material changes or modifications in the
terms of any such Alternative Proposal, indication or request. Mercantile
Bankshares shall also promptly, and in any event within 24 hours, notify PNC,
orally and in writing, if it enters into discussions or negotiations concerning
any Alternative Proposal in accordance with Section 6.11(a).

          (c) Mercantile Bankshares and its Subsidiaries shall immediately cease
and cause to be terminated any existing discussions or negotiations with any
Persons (other than PNC) conducted heretofore with respect to any of the
foregoing, and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause all Persons other than

          (c) by either Mercantile Bankshares or PNC, if the Merger shall not

                                       50

and may include to the extent proven the benefit of the bargain lost by a
party's shareholders (taking into consideration relevant matters, including
other combination opportunities and the time value of money), which shall be
deemed in such event to be damages of such party) arising out of its willful
breach of any provision of this Agreement.

          8.3 FEES AND EXPENSES. Except with respect to costs and expenses of
printing and mailing the Proxy Statement and all filing and other fees paid to

Mercantile Bankshares shall, on the date an Alternative Transaction is
consummated, pay PNC a fee equal to $225 million by wire transfer of same day
funds, or (B) (1) prior to the date that is twelve (12) months after the date of

Mercantile Bankshares shall, on the date of entry into such Acquisition
Agreement, pay PNC a fee equal to $75 million by wire transfer of same day

paid pursuant to the preceding clause (B)(1).

          (b) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by PNC pursuant to

have been made known to Mercantile Bankshares or any of its Subsidiaries or has
been made directly to its stockholders generally or any person shall have
publicly announced an intention (whether or not conditional) to make an
Alternative Proposal (the term Alternative Transaction, as used in the
definition of Alternative Proposal for purposes of this Section 8.4, and as used
in this Section 8.4, shall have the same meaning set forth in Section 6.11
except that the references to "more than 25%" and "at least 75%" shall be deemed
to be references to "50% or more" and "a majority," respectively);

          (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the maximum
aggregate amount of fees payable under this Section 8.4 shall be $225 million.

          (e) Mercantile Bankshares acknowledges that the agreements contained
in this Section 8.4 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by

this Agreement; accordingly, if Mercantile Bankshares fails promptly to pay the
amount due pursuant to this Section 8.4, and, in order to obtain such payment,
PNC commences a suit which results in a judgment against Mercantile Bankshares
for the fee set forth in this Section 8.4, Mercantile Bankshares shall pay to
PNC its costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees and expenses) in
connection with such suit.

          8.5 AMENDMENT. This Agreement may be amended by the parties, by action
taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors, at any time before
or after approval


                                       52
<PAGE>

of the matters presented in connection with Merger by the stockholders of
Mercantile Bankshares; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that after any approval of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement by the stockholders of Mercantile

amendment of this Agreement that (a) alters or changes the amount or the form of
the consideration to be delivered under this Agreement to the holders of
Mercantile Bankshares Common Stock, (b) alters or changes any term of the
certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation or (c) alters or
changes any of the terms and conditions of this Agreement if such alteration or
change would adversely affect the holders of any securities of Mercantile
Bankshares, in each case other than as contemplated by this Agreement. This
Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf
of each of the parties.

any of the obligations or other acts of the other party, (b) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement
or (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained in
this Agreement. Any agreement on the part of a party to any such extension or
waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf
of such party, but such extension or waiver or failure to insist on strict
compliance with an obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not
operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other
failure.

events inconsistent with any representations or warranties contained in Article
III, in the case of Mercantile Bankshares, or Article IV, in the case of PNC,

                            Form of Affiliate Letter


The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
One PNC Plaza
249 Fifth Avenue
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15222

Ladies and Gentlemen:

          I have been advised that as of the date hereof I may be deemed to be
an "affiliate" of Mercantile Bankshares Corporation, a Maryland corporation
("MERCANTILE BANKSHARES"), as the term "affiliate" is defined for purposes of
paragraphs (c) and (d) of Rule 145 of the rules and regulations (the "RULES AND
REGULATIONS") of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "COMMISSION") under
the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "ACT"). I have been further advised
that pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of
October 8, 2006 (the "MERGER AGREEMENT"), by and between The PNC Financial
Services Group, Inc., a Pennsylvania corporation ("PNC"), and Mercantile
Bankshares shall be merged with and into PNC (the "MERGER"). All terms used in
this letter but not defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed thereto in
the Merger Agreement.

          I represent, warrant and covenant to PNC that in the event I receive
any PNC Common Stock as a result of the Merger:

          (a) I shall not make any sale, transfer or other disposition of PNC
Common Stock in violation of the Act or the Rules and Regulations.

          (b) I have carefully read this letter and the Merger Agreement and
discussed its requirements and other applicable limitations upon my ability to
sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of PNC Common Stock to the extent I believed
necessary with my counsel or counsel for Mercantile Bankshares.

          (c) I have been advised that the issuance of PNC Common Stock to me
pursuant to the Merger will be registered with the Commission under the Act on a
Registration Statement on Form S-4. However, I have also been advised that,
since at the time the Merger will be submitted for a vote of the stockholders of
Mercantile Bankshares I may be deemed to have been an affiliate of Mercantile
Bankshares and the distribution by me of PNC Common Stock has not been
registered under the Act, I may not sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of PNC
Common Stock issued to me in the Merger unless (i) such sale, transfer or other
disposition has been registered under the Act, (ii) such sale, transfer or other
disposition is made in conformity with the volume and other limitations of Rule
145 promulgated by the Commission under the Act, or (iii) in the opinion of
counsel reasonably acceptable to PNC, such sale, transfer or other disposition
is otherwise exempt from registration under the Act.

          (d) I understand that PNC is under no obligation to register the sale,
transfer or other disposition of PNC Common Stock by me or on my behalf under
the Act or to take any other action necessary in order to make compliance with
an exemption from such registration available.


                                      A-1
<PAGE>
          (e) I also understand that stop transfer instructions will be given to
PNC's transfer agents with respect to PNC Common Stock and that there will be
placed on the certificates for PNC Common Stock issued to me, or any
substitutions therefor, a legend stating in substance:

          "The securities represented by this certificate have been issued in a
          transaction to which Rule 145 promulgated under the Securities Act of
          1933 applies and may only be sold or otherwise transferred in
          compliance with the requirements of Rule 145 or pursuant to a
          registration statement under said act or an exemption from such
          registration."

          (f) I also understand that unless the transfer by me of my PNC Common
Stock has been registered under the Act or is a sale made in conformity with the
provisions of Rule 145, PNC reserves the right to put the following legend on
the certificates issued to my transferee:

          "The shares represented by this certificate have not been registered
          under the Securities Act of 1933 and were acquired from a person who
          received such shares in a transaction to which Rule 145 promulgated
          under the Securities Act of 1933 applies. The shares have been
          acquired by the holder not with a view to, or for resale in connection
          with, any distribution thereof within the meaning of the Securities
          Act of 1933 and may not be sold, pledged or otherwise transferred
          except in accordance with an exemption from the registration
          requirements of the Securities Act of 1933."

          It is understood and agreed that the legends set forth above shall be
removed by delivery of substitute certificates without such legend, and/or the
issuance of a letter to PNC's transfer agent removing such stop transfer
instructions, and the above restrictions on sale will cease to apply, if (A) one
year (or such other period as may be required by Rule 145(d)(2) under the
Securities Act or any successor thereto) shall have elapsed from the Closing
Date and the provisions of such Rule are then available to me; or (B) if two
years (or such other period as may be required by Rule 145(d)(3) under the
Securities Act or any successor thereto) shall have elapsed from the Effective
Date and the provisions of such Rule are then available to me; or (C) I shall
have delivered to PNC (i) a copy of a letter from the staff of the Commission,
or an opinion of counsel in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to PNC,
or other evidence reasonably satisfactory to PNC, to the effect that such legend
and/or stop transfer instructions are not required for purposes of the
Securities Act or (ii) reasonably satisfactory evidence or representations that
the securities represented by such certificates are being or have been
transferred in a transaction made in conformity with the provisions of Rule 145
under the Securities Act or pursuant to an effective registration under the
Securities Act.

            I recognize and agree that the foregoing provisions also apply to
(i) my spouse,  (ii) any relative of mine or my spouse  occupying my home, (iii)
any trust or estate in which I, my spouse or any such relative owns at least 10%
beneficial interest or of which any of us serves as trustee,  executor or in any
similar capacity and (iv) any corporate or other organization in which

                                      A-2
<PAGE>


I, my  spouse  or any such  relative  owns at least  10% of any  class of equity
securities or of the equity interest.

          By its acceptance hereof, PNC agrees, for a period of two years after
the Effective Time that it, as the Surviving Corporation, will file on a timely
basis all reports required to be filed by it pursuant to Section 13 of the
Exchange Act, so that the public information provisions of Rule 144(c) under the
Securities Act are satisfied and the resale provisions of Rules 145(d)(1) and
(2) under the Securities Act are therefore available to the undersigned in the
event the undersigned desires to transfer any PNC Common Stock issued to the
undersigned in the Merger.

          It is understood and agreed that this Letter Agreement shall terminate
and be of no further force and effect if the Merger Agreement is terminated in
accordance with its terms.

          Execution of this letter should not be construed as an admission on
my part that I am an "affiliate" of Mercantile Bankshares as described in the
first paragraph of this letter or as a waiver of any rights I may have to object
to any claim that I am such an affiliate on or after the date of this letter.

                                          Very truly yours,

                                          By:  _________________________
