Certificate.

be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered
Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment that (i)
either such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in
proper form for transfer and (ii) the Person requesting such payment shall pay

books of the Surviving Corporation. If, after the Effective Time, any
Certificate is presented to the Surviving Corporation or Parent for transfer,

necessary to permit such holder to receive the Merger Consideration to which

only to the Surviving Corporation as a general creditor thereof for payment of
the Merger Consideration.

Section 2.08 Dissenting Shares.

Notwithstanding Section 2.06 or any other provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time and held by a holder who is entitled to appraisal and who has properly
exercised and perfected appraisal rights for such Shares in accordance with
Section 262 of the DGCL ("Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into a
right to receive the Merger Consideration but instead shall be entitled only
to such rights as are granted by the DGCL to a holder of Dissenting Shares;
provided, however, that if, after the Effective Time, such holder fails to
timely perfect, effectively withdraws or loses such holder's right to
appraisal, pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL or if a court of competent
jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not entitled to the relief
provided by Section 262 of the DGCL, such Shares shall immediately cease to be
Dissenting Shares and shall be treated as if they had been Shares converted as
of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in
accordance with Section 2.06(a) (less any payments made by the Surviving
Corporation with respect to such Shares before entry of judgment in accordance
with Section 262(h) of the DGCL) without interest thereon, upon surrender of
such Certificate formerly representing such Share, together with a duly
completed and validly executed letter of transmittal and such other documents
as may be reasonably requested by the Paying Agent or Parent. The Company
shall provide Parent prompt written notice of any demands received by the
Company for appraisal of Shares, any withdrawal of any such demand and any
other demand, notice or instrument delivered to the Company prior to the
Effective Time pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL that relate to such demand,
and Parent shall have the opportunity and right to participate in and control
all negotiations and Proceedings with respect to such demands. Except with the

respect to, settle or offer to settle, or otherwise negotiate any such
demands. Section 2.09 Company Stock Awards and the Company Warrant.

(a) Company Options. No outstanding Company Options shall be assumed by Parent
or the Surviving Corporation. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, any Company Option with an applicable per share exercise price
that exceeds or is equal to the Merger Consideration shall, without any action
on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holder thereof, be
immediately canceled at the Effective Time for no consideration.

(i) Vested Company Options. At the Effective Time, each Vested Company Option
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, without any action
on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holder thereof, be
canceled and converted into, and shall become a right to receive, an amount in
cash, without interest, equal to the product of (A) the excess of (x) the
Merger Consideration over (y) the exercise price per Share of such Vested
Company Option, multiplied by (B) the total number of Shares issuable upon the
exercise in full of such Vested Company Option (the "Vested Option
Consideration"). As soon as practicable following the Closing, and in no event
later than the second (2nd) regular payroll cycle following the Closing Date
(subject to local requirements), Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
or its designee (including the Paying Agent) to pay to each holder of a Vested

Option held by an individual who is providing services to the Company or its

of (A) the excess of (x) the Merger Consideration over (y) the exercise price
per Share of such Unvested Company Option, multiplied by (B) the total number
of Shares issuable upon the exercise in full of such Unvested Company Option
(the "Unvested Option Consideration"), with such Unvested Option Consideration
vesting in accordance with the vesting schedule applicable to such Unvested
Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, subject to such holder
remaining employed by or otherwise in service to Parent on each applicable
vesting date. The vesting and payment of the Unvested Option Consideration
shall also be subject to the terms and conditions of the Unvested Payment
Plan. In the event that such holder does not execute and deliver an Unvested

Plan Agreement, such holder shall forfeit any and all rights with respect to
the Unvested Company Options, including any right to payments with respect to
such Unvested Company Options pursuant to the Unvested Payment Plan.

(iii) Company Options Held by Non-Employee Directors. At the Effective Time,
each Company Option (whether vested or unvested) held by a non-employee
director of the Company Board outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall, without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company
or the holder thereof, be canceled and converted into, and shall become a right to
receive, an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product of (A) the
excess of (x) the Merger Consideration over (y) the exercise price per Share
of such Company Option, multiplied by (B) the total number of Shares issuable
upon the exercise in full of such Company Option. As soon as practicable, and
in no event later than two Business Days, following the Closing Date, Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation or its designee (including the Paying
Agent) to pay to each non-employee director the amounts set forth in this

Corporation or its designee (including the Paying Agent) to pay to each holder
of a Vested Company RSU, the Vested RSU Consideration, less any applicable
Taxes, in accordance with Applicable Law.

(ii) At the Effective Time, each Unvested Company RSU held by an individual
who is providing services to the Company or its Subsidiaries immediately prior
to the Effective Time which is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be canceled and exchanged for the right to receive an amount in
cash, without interest, equal to the product of (A) the Merger Consideration

Consideration vesting in accordance with the vesting schedule applicable to
such Unvested Company RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time, subject to
such holder remaining employed by or otherwise in service to Parent on each
applicable vesting date. The vesting and payment of the Unvested RSU
Consideration shall also be subject to the terms and conditions of the
Unvested Payment Plan. In the event that such holder does not execute and
deliver an Unvested Payment Plan Agreement within the timeframe set forth in
such Unvested Payment Plan Agreement, such holder shall forfeit any and all
rights with respect to the Unvested Company RSUs, including any right to
payments with respect to such Unvested Company RSUs pursuant to the Unvested

award of Unvested Company RSUs. As soon as practicable, and in no event later than two (2) Business Days,
following the Closing Date, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation or
its designee (including the Paying Agent) to pay to each non-employee director
the amounts set forth in this Section 2.09(b)(iii).

consideration.

unvested) shall be assumed by Parent or the Surviving Corporation.

vesting requirement has been satisfied at or prior to the Effective Time which
is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, a "Vested
Company PSU") shall, without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company or the holder thereof, be canceled and converted into, and shall
become a right to receive, an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the
product of (A) the Merger Consideration multiplied by (B) the total number of
Shares subject to the Vested Company PSU based on the deemed achievement of
all relevant performance goals at target level (the "Vested PSU
Consideration"). As soon as practicable following the Closing, and in no event

the Effective Time, subject to such holder remaining employed by or otherwise
in service to Parent on each applicable vesting date. The vesting and payment
of the Unvested PSU Consideration shall also be subject to the terms and
conditions of the Unvested Payment Plan. For the avoidance of doubt, any
Unvested PSU Consideration payable pursuant to this Section 2.09(c)(ii) shall
not be subject to any performance-based vesting requirements and shall be
subject solely to the service-based vesting requirements applicable to the
applicable Unvested Company PSU as of immediately prior to the Effective Time.
In the event that such holder does not execute and deliver an Unvested Payment
Plan Agreement within the timeframe set forth in such Unvested Payment Plan

Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as are

any applicable Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted and
withheld by Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the
Paying Agent, as the case may be, such amounts shall be treated for all

which Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying

None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the

any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Applicable Law. If any

previously entitled thereto.

Parent or the Paying Agent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may
be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will
issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger
Consideration to be paid in respect of the Shares formerly represented by such
Certificate, as contemplated under this Article 2.

Section 4.04 Reports and Financial Statements.

(a) Since January 1, 2017, the Company and each of its Subsidiaries has timely
filed or furnished all Company SEC Documents required to be filed or furnished
prior to the date hereof and has timely paid all fees due in connection
therewith. As of their respective dates or, if amended, as of the date of the
last such amendment (and, in the case of registration statements and proxy
statements, as of the dates of effectiveness and the dates of the relevant
meetings, respectively), the Company SEC Documents complied in all material
respects with the requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as the case may be, and the applicable rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder, and none of the Company SEC Documents
contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. No Subsidiary of the Company is, or at any time since January
1, 2017 has been, required to file any forms, reports or other documents with
the SEC. No executive officer of the Company has failed to make the
certifications required of him or her under Section 302 or 906 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act. There are no outstanding or unresolved comments in any
comment letters of the staff of the SEC received by the Company relating to
the Company SEC Documents. None of the Company SEC Documents is, to the
Company's Knowledge, the subject of ongoing SEC review.

(b) The consolidated financial statements (including all related notes and
schedules) of the Company included in or incorporated by reference into the
Company SEC Documents (the "Company Financial Statements") (i) fairly present
in all material respects the consolidated financial position of the Company
and its consolidated Subsidiaries, as at the respective dates thereof, and the
consolidated results of their operations, their consolidated incomes, their
consolidated changes in stockholders' equity and their consolidated cash flows
for the respective periods then ended, (ii) were prepared in conformity with
GAAP in effect as of the respective dates thereof (except, in the case of the
unaudited statements, subject to normal year-end audit adjustments none of
which are material individually or in the aggregate, and the absence of
footnotes, none of which, if presented, would materially differ from those in
the most recent audited financial statements) applied on a consistent basis
during the periods involved (except as may be indicated therein or in the
notes thereto), (iii) have been prepared from, and are in accordance with, the
books and records of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries and (iv)
comply in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements
and with the rules and regulations of the SEC, the Exchange Act and the
Securities Act in effect as of the respective dates thereof. The books and
records of the Company and its Subsidiaries have been, and are being,
maintained in all material respects in accordance with GAAP and any other
applicable legal and accounting requirements and in all material respects
reflect only actual transactions, except as has not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect. The Company has identified all uncertain tax positions contained in all Tax Returns filed by the Company or its
Subsidiaries and has established adequate reserves and made any appropriate
disclosures in the Company Financial Statements in accordance with the
requirements of ASC 740-10 (formerly Financial Interpretation No. 48 of FASB
Statement No. 109, Accounting for Uncertain Tax Positions). As of the date
hereof, Grant Thornton LLP has not resigned (or informed the Company that it
intends to resign) or been dismissed as the independent public accountants of
the Company. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP was not dismissed as the previous
independent public accountants of the Company as a result of or in connection
with any disagreements with the Company on a matter of accounting principles
or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure.

(c) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, nor does it
have any commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet
partnership or any similar Contract (including any Contract relating to any
transaction or relationship between or among the Company or one of its
Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated Affiliate, including any
structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or Person, on
the other hand) or any "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item
303(a) of Regulation S‑K promulgated by the SEC).

Section 4.05 Internal Controls and Procedures.

(a) The Company has established and maintains disclosure controls and
procedures and internal control over financial reporting (as such terms are
defined in paragraphs (e) and (f), respectively, of Rule 13a-15 under the
Exchange Act) that ensure that all material information required to be
disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or furnishes under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such
material information is accumulated and communicated to the Company's
management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure and to make the certifications required pursuant to Sections 302
and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The Company's management has completed an
assessment of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over
financial reporting in compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the year ended December 31, 2018, and such assessment
concluded that internal control was effective. Based on its most recent
evaluation of its internal control over financial reporting prior to the date
hereof, management of the Company has disclosed to the Company's auditors and
the audit committee of the Company Board (i) any significant deficiencies and
material weaknesses in the design or operation of its internal control over
financial reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely affect in any
material respect the Company's ability to report financial information and
(ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
current or former Company Employees who have a significant role in the
Company's internal control over financial reporting, and each such deficiency,
weakness and fraud so disclosed to auditors, if any, has been Made Available
to Parent. The Company has remediated any and all significant deficiencies and
all material weaknesses in the design or operations of its internal control
over financial reporting that were reasonably likely to adversely affect in
any material respect the Company's ability to report financial information and
were identified in the Company's most recent evaluation of its internal control over financial reporting. To the Company's Knowledge, no events, facts
or circumstances have occurred such that the Company's outside auditors and
its chief executive officer and chief financial officer will not be able to
give the certifications and attestations required pursuant to the rules and
regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without
additional qualification, when next due. The records, systems, controls, data
and information of the Company and its Subsidiaries are recorded, stored,
maintained and operated under means (including any electronic, mechanical or
photographic processes, whether computerized or not) that are under the
exclusive ownership and direct control of the Company, its Subsidiaries or
accountants (including all means of access thereto and therefrom), except for
any non-exclusive ownership and non-direct control that has not had and would
not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

(b) Since January 1, 2017, (i) neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
nor, to the Company's Knowledge, any current or former Company Employee or
Representative of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has received or
otherwise had or obtained knowledge of any material complaint, allegation,
assertion or claim, whether written or oral, regarding the accounting or
auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or methods of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries or their respective internal accounting controls,
including any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim that the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in questionable accounting or
auditing practices and (ii) to the Company's Knowledge no attorney
representing the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not employed
by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a material
violation of Applicable Law, breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation by
the Company or any current or former Company Employee or Representative to the
Company Board or any committee thereof or to any director or officer of the
Company.

(ii) Liabilities incurred in connection with this Agreement and the

January 1, 2017, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received
any written notice or, to the Company's Knowledge, other communication from

Materials by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or to the Company's
Knowledge, as a result of any operations or activities of the Company or any

date hereof organized by jurisdiction, excluding offer letters or employment
agreements (i) entered into in the ordinary course of business that are
materially consistent with the form agreements Made Available to Parent and
(ii) that are terminable (x) at-will without severance obligations or (y) with
severance obligations no greater than those required by Applicable Law;
provided the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to set forth
International Company Employee Plans on Section 4.09(a) of the Company
Disclosure Schedules as of the date hereof, and within thirty (30) days of the
date hereof will provide Parent with an updated Section 4.09(a) of the Company

to the extent applicable, true, correct and complete copies of the following
have been Made Available to Parent by the Company: (i) the plan document or
agreement (including a written summary of any U.S. Company Employee Plan not

connection with a termination of employment or a "change in control." No
individual equity award agreement provides acceleration of vesting or
adjustment of exercisability in connection with a termination of employment or
a "change in control."

(b) Each Company Employee Plan has been established, registered (where
required), approved (where required), qualified (where required), maintained,
operated, funded and administered in all material respects in accordance with
its terms and the requirements of ERISA, the Code and any other Applicable
Law. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has taken any corrective
action or made a filing under any voluntary correction program of the IRS, the
DOL or any other U.S. or relevant foreign Governmental Entity with respect to
any Company Employee Plan, and to the Company's Knowledge neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries has any Knowledge of any plan defect that would
qualify for correction under any such program. Except as has not resulted in
and would not reasonably be expected to result in, individually or in the
aggregate, any material Liability to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
all contributions required to be made to any Company Employee Plan pursuant to
Applicable Law or by any plan document or other contractual undertaking, and
all premiums due or payable with respect to insurance policies funding any
Company Employee Plan, have, in each case, been timely made or paid in full
or, to the extent not required to be made or paid on or before the date
hereof, have been fully reflected on the books and records of Company.

(c) Section 4.09(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedules identifies each
Company Employee Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of
the Code or any Applicable Law or regulation of any foreign jurisdiction or
Governmental Entity (each, a "Qualified Plan"). Each Qualified Plan (i) may
rely on a prototype opinion letter or has received a favorable determination
letter from the IRS to such effect and nothing has occurred or exists since
the date of such determination or opinion letter that would reasonably be
expected to materially and adversely affect the qualified status of any such
Qualified Plan or (ii) has a period of time remaining under applicable
Treasury Regulations or IRS pronouncements in which to apply for such a letter
and to make any amendments necessary to obtain a favorable determination as to
the "qualified" status of each such Qualified Plan. No trust funding any U.S.
Company Employee Plan is intended to meet the requirements of Code Section
501(c)(9). (d) At no time has the Company or any of its Subsidiaries had any obligation
to contribute to or incurred any withdrawal liability (within the meaning of
Section 4201 of ERISA) with respect to any "multiemployer plan" (as defined in
Section 3(37) of ERISA). No Company Employee Plan is (i) a "defined benefit
plan" (as defined in Section 414 of the Code), (ii) a "multiemployer plan",
(iii) a "multiple employer" plan (as defined in Section 4063 or 4064 of ERISA)
(in each case under clause (i), (ii) or (iii) whether or not subject to
ERISA), or (iv) subject to Section 302 of ERISA, Section 412 of the Code or
Title IV of ERISA.

(e) With respect to each Company Employee Plan that is a "welfare plan" (as
defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA) (whether or not subject to ERISA), neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any material Liability with
respect to an obligation to provide welfare benefits, including death or
medical benefits (whether or not insured) with respect to any Person beyond
such Person's retirement or other termination of service, other than (i)
coverage or benefits mandated by Section 4980B of the Code or any other
Applicable Law the full cost of which is borne by the employee or former
employee (or any of their beneficiaries) or (ii) disability benefits under any
Company Employee Plan that are fully insured.

(f) There are no pending or, to the Company's Knowledge, threatened claims
(other than claims for benefits in the ordinary course of business), actions,
suits or Proceedings which have been asserted, instituted or threatened, and,
to the Company's Knowledge, no set of circumstances exists which may
reasonably give rise to a Proceeding against the Company, the Company Employee
Plans, any fiduciaries thereof with respect to their duties to the Company
Employee Plans or the assets of any of the trusts under any of the Company
Employee Plans which could, individually or in the aggregate, result in any
material Liability of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective ERISA Affiliates or any Company Employee Plan to the Pension
Benefit Guaranty Corporation (the "PBGC"), the Department of the Treasury, the
DOL, any multiemployer plan, any multiple employer plan, any participant in a
Company Employee Plan, or any other party. None of the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their ERISA Affiliates has incurred or, to the
Company's Knowledge, reasonably expects to incur (either directly or
indirectly, including as a result of any indemnification obligation) any
material Liability under or pursuant to Title I or IV of ERISA or the penalty,
excise Tax or joint and several Liability provisions of the Code or any
foreign Applicable Law or regulation relating to employee benefit plans, or
under any Contract, statute, rule or legal requirement pursuant to or under
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any Company Employee Plan has
agreed to indemnify or is required to indemnify any Person against Liability
incurred under, or for a violation or failure to satisfy the requirements of,
any such legal requirement, and to the Company's Knowledge, no event,
transaction or condition has occurred or exists that could result in any such
material Liability to the Company, any of its Subsidiaries, any of their ERISA
Affiliates or, after the Effective Time, Parent or any of its Affiliates.

(g) With respect to Company Employee Plans maintained for the benefit of any
employee or service provider (or former employee or service provider) who
performs services outside of the U.S. (each, an "International Employee
Plan"), and except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be expected to result in any material Liability to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, (i) all required filings and reports have been made in a timely
manner with all Governmental Entities, and no event has occurred since the
date of the most recent approval or application therefor relating to any such
International Employee Plan that could reasonably be expected to affect any such approval relating
thereto, (ii) all obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries to or under
the International Employee Plans (whether pursuant to the terms thereof or any
Applicable Laws) which have become due have been satisfied, and there are no
outstanding defaults or violations thereunder by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, (iii) no Taxes, penalties or fees are owing or assessable under
any such International Employee Plan, (iv) no event has occurred with respect
to any registered International Employee Plan which would result in the
revocation of the registration of such International Employee Plan, or which
would entitle any Person (without the consent of the sponsor of such
International Employee Plan) to wind up or terminate any such International
Employee Plan, in whole or in part, or could otherwise reasonably be expected
to have an adverse effect on the tax status of any such International Employee
Plan, (v) no contribution holidays have been taken under any of the
International Employee Plans, and there have been no withdrawals of assets or
transfers from any International Employee Plan, except in accordance with
Applicable Laws, and (vi) neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
incurred any Liability in connection with the termination of, or withdrawal
from, any International Employee Plan that is a defined benefit pension plan.
The Company and its Subsidiaries are not and at no time has the Company or any
Subsidiary ever been an employer in relation to any occupational pension
scheme (as defined in section 1 of the U.K. Pension Schemes Act 1993, as
amended) other than a money purchase scheme (as defined in section 181 of the
UK Pension Schemes Act 1993, as amended). No Person with which the Company or
any Subsidiary is connected or of which the Company or any Subsidiary is an
associate participates, or has participated, as an employer in an occupational
pension scheme other than a money purchase scheme (each as defined in the
preceding sentence) and no circumstances exist that may result in the issue of
a "financial support direction" or a "contribution notice" (each as defined
for the purposes of Part 1 of the U.K. Pensions Act 2004) to or in respect of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in relation to any such pension scheme.
For the purposes of this section, "connected" and "associate" are to be
interpreted in accordance with sections 249 and 435 respectively of the U.K.
Insolvency Act 1986. No debt has arisen under Section 75 of the U.K. Pension
Act 1995 in connection with any International Employee Plan, nor will any such
debt become due as a result of the consummation of the Transactions. With
respect to each material International Employee Plan, to the extent
applicable, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure
true, correct and complete copies of the plan document or agreement (including
a written summary of any International Employee Plan not in writing) have been
Made Available to Parent by the Company as of the date hereof, and to the
extent such International Employee Plans have not been Made Available as of
the date hereof, they will be Made Available within thirty (30) days following
the date of this Agreement. With respect to each material International
Employee Plan, to the extent applicable, true, correct and complete copies of
the following will be Made Available within thirty (30) days following the
date of this Agreement, to Parent by the Company: (A) the most recent annual
report or similar compliance documents required to be filed with any
Governmental Entity with respect to such plan, (B) the trust agreement,
insurance contract or other funding instrument, (C) the summary plan
description, (D) any material written communication to or from any
Governmental Entity, (E) all material amendments, modifications or supplements
to any such documents, (F) any document comparable to the determination letter
or opinion letter referenced under clause (v) of Section 4.09(a) above issued
by a Governmental Entity relating to the satisfaction of Applicable Law
necessary to obtain the most favorable tax treatment and (G) all other material Contracts relating to each International
Employee Plan, including administrative service agreements.

(h) Each Company Employee Plan that is or was a nonqualified deferred
compensation plan subject to Section 409A of the Code (a "Nonqualified
Deferred Compensation Plan") has, in all material respects, been maintained
and operated since January 1, 2005 in good faith compliance with Section 409A
of the Code and applicable IRS guidance promulgated thereunder and since
January 1, 2009 has been in documentary and operational compliance with
Section 409A of the Code and all applicable IRS guidance promulgated
thereunder and has not been "materially modified" (within the meaning of IRS
Notice 2005-1) at any time after October 3, 2004 or has been amended in a
manner that conforms with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code The
Company is not party to, or otherwise obligated under, any Contract that
provides for the gross-up of Taxes imposed by Section 409A(a)(1)(B) of the
Code.

(i) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation
of the Transactions will, either alone or in combination with another event
(whether contingent or otherwise) under any Company Employee Plan, (i) entitle
any Company Employee to severance pay, unemployment compensation or accrued
pension benefit or any other payment or benefit, (ii) materially increase the
amount or value of compensation or benefits due to any such Company Employee,
(iii) accelerate the time of payment, vesting, or funding or increase the
amount of compensation due any such Company Employee, or (iv) trigger any
funding or other obligation as to any material amount under any Company
Employee Plan or impose any restrictions or limitations on the Company's
rights to administer, amend or terminate any Company Employee Plan or transfer
the assets of any Company Employee Plan.

(j) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation
of the Transactions will, except as otherwise contemplated by this Agreement,
either alone or in combination with another event (whether contingent or
otherwise) result in any payment under any Company Employee Plan (whether in
cash or property or the vesting of property) to any "disqualified individual"

(a) Except as expressly permitted by this Section 6.02, during the Pre-Closing
Period, the Company shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates and its and
their respective Representatives not to, directly or indirectly (i) initiate,
solicit, authorize or knowingly encourage, or knowingly facilitate the
submission or making of, any Acquisition Proposal, or any inquiry, expression
of interest, proposal, offer or request for information that would reasonably
be expected to lead to or result in an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) other than
informing Third Parties of the existence of the provisions contained in this
Section 6.02, conduct, continue, participate or engage in negotiations or
discussions with, or furnish any information concerning the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries to, any Third Party relating to an Acquisition Proposal or
any inquiry, expression of interest, proposal, offer or request for
information that would reasonably be expected to lead to or result in an
Acquisition Proposal (other than requesting the clarification of the terms and
conditions thereof so as to determine whether the Acquisition Proposal is, or
could reasonably be expected to result in, a Superior Proposal), (iii) enter
into any Contract (written or oral, binding or non-binding, preliminary or
definitive) relating to an Acquisition Proposal or (iv) resolve or agree to do
any of the foregoing. From and after the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, the Company shall, and shall cause its Affiliates and its and their
respective Representatives to, (A) immediately cease and cause to be
terminated all discussions or negotiations with any Person existing on the
date hereof with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, or any inquiry,
expression of interest, proposal, offer or request for information that would
reasonably be expected to lead to or result in an Acquisition Proposal, (B)
terminate access by any Third Party to any physical or electronic data room or
other access to data or information of the Company, in each case relating to or in connection with, any Acquisition Proposal or any potential
Acquisition Transaction, (C) request the prompt return or destruction of all

immediately preceding the date of this Agreement in connection with any
inquiry, expression of interest, proposal, offer or request for information

Proposal or a proposed Acquisition Transaction, and (D) enforce, and not waive
or modify, the provisions of any binding confidentiality or non-disclosure
agreement entered into with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or any
potential Acquisition Transaction, including any standstill provisions
contained therein. It is agreed that any violation of the restrictions set
forth in this Section 6.02 by any Representative (other than then-current non-
officer employees, consultants, agents and other representatives (in each case
other than the Company's directors and officers) and advisors, in each case
that provide services to the Company in the ordinary course of business and
are not engaged in merger and acquisition advisory or similar services;
provided that such individuals are not acting, directly or indirectly, at the
direction of any other Representative that is not excluded by operation of
this parenthetical) of the Company or any of its Affiliates shall constitute a
breach of this Section 6.02 by the Company.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if,
at any time prior to the receipt of the Requisite Company Stockholder
Approval, the Company receives an unsolicited, written bona fide Acquisition
Proposal (which Acquisition Proposal was made after the date of this Agreement
and did not result from a breach of this Section 6.02), the Company, the
Company Board and its Representatives may, subject to compliance with this
Section 6.02(b), engage in negotiations or discussions with, or furnish any
information and reasonable access to, any Third Party making such Acquisition
Proposal and its Representatives if, and only if, the Company Board determines
in good faith, after consultation with the Company's outside legal counsel and
outside independent financial advisors, that such Acquisition Proposal
constitutes a Superior Proposal or would reasonably be expected to lead to or
result in a Superior Proposal and failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with the Company Board's fiduciary duties to the stockholders of
the Company under Applicable Law; provided that (i) prior to providing access
to or furnishing any such information, the Company (A) receives from such
Third Party an executed Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement or (B) if such
Third Party is already party with the Company to a valid and existing
confidentiality agreement as of the date of this Agreement, if necessary,
amends such existing agreement so that it is an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement, (ii) any such information or access so furnished has been
previously provided to Parent or is provided (including through the Data Room)
to Parent concurrently with it being so furnished to such Third Party and
(iii) the Company shall give Parent written notice of such determination
promptly after the Company Board makes such determination (and in no event
later than the earlier to occur of (x) thirty-six (36) hours and (y) one (1)
Business Day after such determination) and in any event prior to furnishing
any such information or engaging in such negotiations or discussions.

(c) Except as otherwise provided in Section 6.02(d) and the last sentence of
this Section 6.02(c), during the Pre-Closing Period, neither the Company Board
nor any committee thereof shall (i) (A) withdraw (or qualify or modify in any
manner adverse to Parent), or publicly propose to withdraw (or so qualify or
modify), the Company Recommendation, (B) fail to include the Company
Recommendation in the Proxy Statement, (C) take any action to exempt any
Person (other than Parent and its Affiliates) from the provisions of Section
203 of the DGCL or any other "moratorium," "control share acquisition," "business
combination," "fair price" or other form of anti-takeover law or regulation,
(D) fail to publicly reaffirm the Company Recommendation within five (5)
Business Days after Parent so requests in writing (provided that Parent makes
such request only after a material development has occurred that Parent
believes, in good faith, has created uncertainty as to the position of the
Company Board or whether the Requisite Company Stockholder Approval will be
obtained and that Parent may only make such request once with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal that has not been amended with respect to financial or
other material terms), (E) fail to recommend, in a Solicitation/Recommendation
Statement on Schedule 14D-9, against any Acquisition Proposal subject to
Regulation 14D under the Exchange Act within ten (10) Business Days after the
commencement of such Acquisition Proposal or any material amendment of such
Acquisition Proposal, or (F) approve, adopt or recommend any Acquisition
Proposal, or propose publicly to approve, adopt or recommend, any Acquisition
Proposal (any action described in this clause (i) is referred to herein as a
"Change in Recommendation") or (ii) approve, adopt or recommend, or propose
publicly to approve, adopt or recommend, or allow the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to execute or enter into any Contract (written or oral, binding
or non-binding, preliminary or definitive), other than an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement to the extent expressly permitted by Section 6.02(b)
with any Third Party constituting or relating to, or that is intended to or
would reasonably be expected to lead to or result in, any Acquisition Proposal
or Acquisition Transaction, or requiring, or reasonably expected to cause, the
Company to abandon, terminate, delay or fail to consummate, or that would
otherwise impede, interfere with or be inconsistent with this Agreement, the
Merger or any of the other Transactions, or requiring, or reasonably expected
to cause, the Company to fail to comply with this Agreement (any such
Contract, an "Alternative Acquisition Agreement"). Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in this Agreement, at any time prior to the receipt of
the Requisite Company Stockholder Approval, in the event a material
development or material change in circumstances (other than relating to or in
connection with an Acquisition Proposal, Acquisition Transaction or Superior
Proposal) occurs or arises after the date of this Agreement that was not known
and not reasonably foreseeable by the Company Board as of the date of this
Agreement, the Company Board may make a Change in Recommendation (under clause
(A), (B) or (D) of the definition thereof) if and only if the Company Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with the Company's outside legal
counsel and outside independent financial advisors, that the failure to effect
such Change in Recommendation would be inconsistent with the Company Board's
fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company under Applicable Law;
provided that the Company shall have provided Parent four (4) Business Days'
prior written notice advising Parent that it intends to take such action and
specifying, in reasonable detail, the reasons for such action and:

(i) during such four (4) Business Day period, if requested by Parent, the
Company shall have engaged in good faith negotiations with Parent (and the
Company shall have caused its Affiliates and Representatives, including its
outside legal counsel and outside independent financial advisors, to have
engaged in good faith negotiations with Parent and its Representatives)
regarding changes to the terms of this Agreement; and

(ii) the Company shall have considered any adjustments to this Agreement
(including a change to the price terms hereof) and any other agreements that
may be irrevocably committed to in writing by Parent (the "Proposed Changed
Terms") no later than 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on the fourth (4th) Business Day
of such four (4) Business Day period and shall have determined in good faith
(after consultation with its outside legal counsel and outside independent
financial advisors) that the failure to make a Change in Recommendation would
be inconsistent with the Company Board's fiduciary duties to the stockholders
of the Company under Applicable Law.

(d) At any time prior to receipt of the Requisite Company Stockholder
Approval, if, in response to an unsolicited, written bona fide Acquisition
Proposal made after the date of this Agreement that did not result from a
breach of this Section 6.02, the Company Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and outside independent financial
advisors) that (i) such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal
and (ii) the failure to approve or recommend such Superior Proposal would be
inconsistent with the Company Board's fiduciary duties to the stockholders of
the Company under Applicable Law, the Company may terminate this Agreement in
accordance with Section 8.01(d)(i) and this Section 6.02(d); provided,
however, that the Company shall not terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 8.01(d)(i) and this Section 6.02(d) unless the Company (x) has
complied in all material respects with and not materially breached its
obligations under this Section 6.02, including its obligations set forth in
Section 6.02(e), (y) pays, or causes to be paid, to Parent the Company
Termination Fee payable pursuant to Section 8.03(a)(i) prior to or
concurrently with such termination and (z) concurrently with such termination,
enters into a definitive written Alternative Acquisition Agreement that
documents the terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal.

(e) (i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
the Company shall not be entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 6.02(d) or Section 8.01(d)(i), unless:

(A) the Company shall have provided to Parent four (4) Business Days' prior
written notice (the "Superior Proposal Notice") advising Parent that the
Company intends to take such action (and specifying, in reasonable detail, the
reasons for such action and the terms and conditions of any such Superior
Proposal, including the identity of the Third Party who has made such Superior
Proposal) and provided Parent a copy of the relevant proposed transaction
agreement or the latest draft thereof (including any related financing
commitments, fee letters (subject to customary redactions), and all other
material transaction documents) or, to the extent such agreement or draft and
other documents do not exist, a written summary of the material terms and
conditions of such Superior Proposal, and any other related available material
documentation and material correspondence relating to such Superior Proposal
(including any related financing commitments and fee letters (subject to
customary redactions)); and

(B) (1) during such four (4) Business Day period, if requested by Parent, the
Company shall have engaged in good faith negotiations with Parent (and the
Company shall have caused its Affiliates and Representatives, including its
outside legal counsel and outside independent financial advisors, to have
engaged in good faith negotiations with Parent and its Representatives)
regarding changes to the terms of this Agreement intended to cause such Acquisition
Proposal to no longer constitute a Superior Proposal; and (2) the Company
shall have considered any Proposed Changed Terms irrevocably committed to by
Parent no later than 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on the fourth (4th)
Business Day of such four (4) Business Day period and shall have determined in
good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel and outside
independent financial advisors) that the Superior Proposal would continue to
constitute a Superior Proposal if such Proposed Changed Terms were to be given
effect.

(ii) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that (A) if Parent, within four
(4) Business Days following its receipt of a Superior Proposal Notice, makes
an irrevocable proposal that, as determined in good faith by the Company Board
(after consultation with its outside counsel and outside independent financial
advisors), results in the applicable Acquisition Proposal no longer being a
Superior Proposal, then the Company shall have no right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 6.02(d) or Section 8.01(d)(i) as a result of
such Acquisition Proposal, and (B) any (1) revisions to the financial terms or
any other material terms of a Superior Proposal or (2) revisions to the
financial terms or any other material terms to an Acquisition Proposal that
the Company Board had determined no longer constitutes a Superior Proposal,
shall constitute a new Acquisition Proposal and shall in each case require the
Company to deliver to Parent a new Superior Proposal Notice and a new two (2)
Business Day period shall commence thereafter. The Company shall have no right
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(d)(i) unless it has
complied with the procedures set forth in Section 6.02(d) and this Section
6.02(e).

(f) From and after the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Company
shall promptly (and in any event within the earlier to occur of (x) thirty-six
(36) hours and (y) one (1) Business Day following the time of receipt) advise
Parent in writing in the event that the Company or any of its Representatives
receives any Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry, expression of interest,
proposal, offer or request for information that would reasonably be expected
to lead to or result in an Acquisition Proposal, and in connection with such
notice, provide to Parent the material terms and conditions (including the
identity of the Third Party making any such Acquisition Proposal, copies of
any material documentation, including copies of any related financing
commitments, fee letters (subject to customary redactions) and other material
transaction documents, and a written summary of any oral proposals) of any
such Acquisition Proposal. From and after the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, the Company shall keep Parent promptly informed in writing on a
reasonably current basis of any material changes to, the terms of any such
Acquisition Proposal (including providing Parent a notification in writing
within the earlier to occur of (x) thirty-six (36) hours and (y) one (1)
Business Day following any determination by the Company Board pursuant to
Section 6.02(b) or any material change to the terms of any such Acquisition
Proposal) and any material discussions and negotiations concerning the
material terms and conditions thereof and (ii) provide to Parent as soon as
practicable (and in any event within the earlier to occur of (x) thirty-six
(36) hours and (y) one (1) Business Day following the time of receipt) after
receipt thereof of any written indication of interest (or amendment thereto)
or any written material received in connection therewith (or amendment
thereto) including copies of any proposed Alternative Acquisition Agreement
(including any drafts thereof) and any proposed financing commitments, fee
letters (subject to customary redactions) and other transaction documents related
thereto (including drafts thereof).

(g) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the
Company Board, directly or indirectly through their respective
Representatives, from (i) taking and disclosing any position or disclosing any
information reasonably required under Rule 14d-9, Rule 14e-2(a) or Item
1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) making
any "stop, look and listen" communication to the stockholders of the Company

(including true, correct and complete copies of Tax Returns and other records
relating to Taxes) and shall furnish Parent and Merger Sub all financial,
operating and other data and information as Parent and Merger Sub through
their Representatives may reasonably request; provided, however, that the
Company and its Subsidiaries shall not be required to provide access to any

from being disclosed pursuant to any confidentiality agreement with a third
party entered into prior to the date hereof, (ii) violate any Applicable Law,
(iii) result in a loss or waiver of the attorney-client or other privilege
held by the Company or any of the Company's Subsidiaries or (iv) contain

be provided in a manner that (x) would not reasonably be expected to waive the
applicable privilege or protection or violate such confidentiality agreement
or Applicable Law and (y), in the case of competitively sensitive information,
complies with appropriate "clean room" arrangements). Any information provided

Parent in writing of any notice or other communication received by the Company

If any "moratorium," "control share acquisition," "business combination,"
"fair price" or other form of anti-takeover law or regulation becomes or is
deemed to be applicable to the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, the Merger or any
other Transactions, then each of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, and their

provided, however, that in satisfying its obligation under this Section
6.07(a), the Surviving Corporation shall not be obligated to pay aggregate
premiums in excess of two hundred fifty percent (250%) of its most recent
annual renewal prior to the date of this Agreement (the "Current Premium")
and, if such aggregate premiums for such insurance would exceed two hundred
fifty percent (250%) of the Current Premium, then the Surviving Corporation
shall cause to be maintained policies of insurance that, in the Surviving
Corporation's good faith judgment, provide the maximum coverage available for
an aggregate premium equal to two hundred fifty percent (250%) of the Current
Premium. The provisions of the immediately preceding sentence shall be deemed
to have been satisfied if prepaid "tail" or "runoff" policies have been
obtained by Parent, the Company prior to the Effective Time or by the
Surviving Corporation at or after the Effective Time, which policies provide
such directors and officers with coverage for an aggregate period of six (6)
years with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or
before the Effective Time, including, in respect of the Transactions,
provided, however, that the amount paid for such prepaid policies shall not
exceed two hundred fifty percent (250%) of the Current Premium without the
prior written consent of Parent and, for the avoidance of doubt, such policies
that obtain the maximum amount of coverage available for such premium amount
shall nevertheless be deemed to satisfy the provisions of the immediately
preceding sentence. In the event that, within sixty (60) days following the
date hereof, Parent provides written notice to the Company either (i)
requesting that the Company obtain such tail or runoff policies, the Company
shall obtain and fully pay the premium (in an amount not to exceed two hundred
fifty percent (250%) of the Current Premium) for such tail or runoff policies
at or prior to the Effective Time, or (ii) confirming that Parent or the
Surviving Corporation shall obtain such tail or runoff policies, the Company shall cooperate with Parent to arrange for such policies
to be so obtained. In the event that Parent fails to provide either such
written notice within sixty (60) days following the date hereof or, in the
case of an election under clause (ii), fails to obtain such policies at least
ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing, the Company may, after consulting
in good faith with Parent, obtain and fully pay the premium (in an amount not
to exceed two hundred fifty percent (250%) of the Current Premium) for such
tail or runoff policies at or prior to the Effective Time.

(b) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall fulfill
and honor in all respects the obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries
pursuant to (i) each indemnification agreement in effect as of the date of
this Agreement between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any
individual who at the Effective Time is, or at any time prior to the Effective
Time was, a director or officer of the Company or of a Company Subsidiary
(each, an "Indemnified Party") and (ii) any indemnification provision and any
exculpation provision set forth in the certificate of incorporation, as
amended, or bylaws of the Company or a Company Subsidiary, as the case may be,
as in effect on the date of this Agreement.

(c) The provisions of this Section 6.07 (i) are intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, his or her heirs and
his or her Representatives, (ii) are in addition to, and not in substitution
for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such
individual may have under the articles of organization or bylaws, by Contract
or otherwise, and (iii) may not be terminated or modified in a manner adverse
to any Indemnified Party without the consent of such affected Indemnified
Party. In the event that (A) the Surviving Corporation or any of its
successors or assigns (1) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (2) transfers or conveys all or a substantial
portion of its properties or other assets to any Person or (B) Parent or any
of its successors or assigns dissolves the Surviving Corporation, then, and in
each such case, Parent shall cause proper provision to be made so that the
applicable successors and assigns or transferees expressly assume the
obligations set forth in this Section 6.07.

Section 6.08 Efforts.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions provided in this Agreement, each of
the parties hereto shall use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable under Applicable Law and regulations to consummate and
make effective the Transactions, to cause all conditions to the obligations of
the other parties hereto to effect the Merger to be satisfied, to obtain all
necessary waivers, consents, approvals and other documents required to be
delivered hereunder and to effect all necessary registrations and filings and
to remove any injunctions or other impediments or delays, legal or otherwise,
in order to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement for the purpose of securing to the parties hereto the benefits
contemplated by this Agreement, in each case, so that the Closing may occur by
no later than the End Date; provided that, notwithstanding anything in this
Section 6.08 or any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary (but,
with respect to the Company, subject to the last sentence of this Section 6.08(a)), no party shall be required to agree (and the Company
shall not agree, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to agree, without the
prior written consent of Parent) to (i) any license, sale or other disposition
or holding separate (through establishment of a trust or otherwise) of any
shares of its capital stock or of any of its businesses, assets or properties,
its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, (ii) the imposition of any limitation on the
ability of Parent or its Affiliates or the Company or its Subsidiaries to
conduct their respective businesses or own any capital stock or assets or to
acquire, hold or exercise full rights of ownership of their respective
businesses or assets and, in the case of Parent, the businesses or assets of
the Company and its Subsidiaries or (iii) the imposition of any impediment on
Parent or its Affiliates or the Company or its Subsidiaries under any statute,
rule, regulation, executive order, decree, Order or other legal restraint
governing competition, monopolies or restrictive trade practices (any such
action described in (i), (ii) or (iii), an "Action of Divestiture"). Nothing
herein shall require Parent or its Affiliates or permit the Company or its
Subsidiaries (without the prior written consent of Parent) to litigate with
any Governmental Entity. Nothing in this Agreement shall require Parent or its
Affiliates or permit the Company or its Subsidiaries (without the prior
written consent of Parent) to pay any consideration or agree to any
modifications of existing Contracts or enter into new Contracts (other than
the payment of customary filing and application fees) in connection with
obtaining any waivers, consents or approvals from Governmental Entities or
other Persons in connection with this Agreement or the Merger. Without
limiting any obligations of the Company under this Agreement, the Company
shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, agree to such Actions of
Divestiture and enter into such Contracts as may be requested by Parent in
connection with the objectives set forth in the first sentence of this Section
6.08(a) so long as such Actions of Divestiture and Contracts are conditioned
on the Closing having occurred.

(b) The parties hereto will, or will cause their "ultimate parent entities" as
that term is defined in the HSR Act, as reasonably advisable, to make as
promptly as reasonably practicable (and, in any event, solely in the case of
any necessary filings and notifications under the HSR Act, within eighteen
(18) days following the date hereof) all necessary filings and notifications
and other submissions with respect to this Agreement and the Transactions
under the HSR Act, the EC Merger Regulation, and any other applicable
Antitrust Laws. To the extent permitted by Applicable Law, each of the Company
and Parent shall inform the other of any material communication between the
Company or Parent or any Affiliate thereof (as applicable) and any
Governmental Entity regarding the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
If the Company or Parent or any Affiliate thereof shall receive any formal or
informal request for supplemental information or documentary material from any
Governmental Entity with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, then, except to the extent prohibited by Applicable Law, the
Company or Parent (as applicable) shall promptly inform the other and make, or
cause to be made, as soon as reasonably practicable, a response in substantial
compliance with such request. Without limiting the generality or effect of
Section 6.08(a), to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, the parties hereto
shall consult and cooperate with one another, and consider in good faith the
views of one another, in connection with any analyses, appearances,
presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals made or
submitted by or on behalf of any party hereto in connection with proceedings
under or relating to the HSR Act, the EC Merger Regulation or any other
applicable Antitrust Laws.

(c) Without limiting the generality of Section 6.08(b), to the extent
permitted by Applicable Law, in connection with this Agreement and the
Transactions, the parties agree to (i) give each other reasonable advance notice of all meetings, calls or other
communications with any Governmental Entity relating to any Antitrust Laws,
(ii) give each other an opportunity to participate in each of such meetings,
calls or other communications, (iii) if any Governmental Entity initiates a
substantive oral communication regarding any Antitrust Laws, to add the other
parties hereto to such call if practicable and, if not practicable, to
promptly notify the other parties hereto of the substance of such
communication, (iv) provide each other with a reasonable advance opportunity
to review and comment upon all written communications (including any analyses,
presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals) with a
Governmental Entity regarding any Antitrust Laws and (v) provide each other
with copies of all written communications from any Governmental Entity
relating to any Antitrust Laws. Any disclosures or provision of copies by one
Party to the other may be made on an outside counsel basis, if appropriate.

(d) (A) Following the consultation with the Company as contemplated by Section
6.08(b) and Section 6.08(c), Parent shall have the exclusive right to make all
strategic and tactical decisions as to the manner in which to obtain from any
Governmental Entity under the HSR Act, the EC Merger Regulation or any other
applicable Antitrust Laws, any actions or non-actions, consents, approvals,
authorizations, clearances or orders required to be obtained by Parent or the
Company or any of their respective Affiliates in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (B) Parent
and its Representatives shall have no obligation to share with the Company,
any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives (other than
outside antitrust counsel) any nonpublic information, data or materials about
any of the businesses or operations of Parent and its Affiliates and (C) the
Company will not, nor will it permit any of its Subsidiaries or
Representatives to make any communications with, or proposals relating to, or
enter into, any understanding, undertaking or agreement with, any Governmental
Entity relating to the Transactions without Parent's prior review and
approval.

(e) Subject to the proviso to Section 6.08(a), the Company shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the consents listed on Section
6.08(e) of the Company Disclosure Schedules. For the avoidance of doubt, the
Company shall not be required to pay any amount or agree to any accommodation
with the counter-party to obtain any such consent.

Section 6.09 Stockholder Litigation.

The Company shall as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any event
within one (1) Business Day) following its being formally notified of the same
notify Parent in writing of any Stockholder Litigation and shall keep Parent
reasonably informed with respect to the status thereof. Without limiting the
preceding sentence, the Company shall give Parent the right to review and
comment on all material filings or responses to be made by the Company in
connection with any such litigation (and the Company will in good faith take
such comments into account) and to consult on any settlement with respect to
such litigation. No such settlement shall be agreed to without Parent's prior
written consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), except to the extent (i) such settlement is fully covered by the
Company's insurance policies (other than any applicable retention) or (ii)
such settlement relates solely to the provision of additional disclosure in
the Proxy Statement (and the Company complies with Section 6.10 and Section
6.13 with respect to such additional disclosure). Without Parent's prior
written consent

(which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), the
Company shall not (i) waive any provision of the Company's Organizational
Documents providing for the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the
exclusive forum for any Stockholder Litigation or (ii) consent to the
selection of an alternative forum other than the Court of Chancery of the
State of Delaware for any Stockholder Litigation. Section 6.10 Public Announcements.

Parent and the Company shall consult with each other before issuing any press
release or making any other public statement with respect to this Agreement or
the Transactions and shall not issue any such press release or make any such
other public statement without the consent of the other party, which shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, except as such release or
announcement that Parent or the Company determines, after consultation with
outside legal counsel, is required by Applicable Law or any listing agreement
with or rule of any securities exchange upon which the securities of the
Company or Parent, as applicable, are listed, in which case the party required
to make the release or announcement shall consult with the other party about,
and allow the other party reasonable time (taking into account the
circumstances) to comment on, such release or announcement in advance of such
issuance, and the party required to make the release or announcement will
consider such comments in good faith. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent
may make public statements with respect to this Agreement and the
Transactions, including their effect on Parent's business and its financial
projections, with investors, analysts and financing sources, including on its
periodic earnings calls and in any "road show." Notwithstanding the foregoing
provisions of this Section 6.10, (i) each of the Parties and their Affiliates
may issue press releases or public announcements concerning the Transactions
that are consistent with previous press releases or public announcements made
by Parent or the Company in compliance with this Section 6.10, (ii) each of
the Parties, their Affiliates, and their Representatives may make public
statements in response to specific questions by the press, analysts, investors
or those attending industry conferences or financial analyst conference calls,
so long as any such statements are consistent with previous press releases,
public disclosures or public statements made by Parent or the Company in
compliance with this Section 6.10 and do not reveal material, nonpublic
information regarding the other parties, the Merger or the other Transactions,
and (iii) without limiting the obligations of the parties hereto pursuant to
any other Section of this Agreement, the restrictions set forth in this
Section 6.10 shall not apply to any press release or public announcement
issued or proposed to be issued in connection with, or in response to, an
Acquisition Proposal, Superior Proposal or a Change in Recommendation.

Section 6.11 Section 16 Matters.

Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions necessary or
as reasonably requested by any party hereto to cause any dispositions of
equity securities of the Company (including any derivative securities with
respect to any equity securities of the Company) as a result of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who is a
director or officer of the Company, and who would otherwise be subject to Rule
16b-3 under the Exchange Act, to be exempt under Exchange Act Rule 16b-3.

Section 6.12 Employment Matters.

(a) For the one (1) year period immediately following the Effective Time,
Parent shall (or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) provide to each
person who is an employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
immediately prior to the Effective Time and who continues to be employed by
Parent, its Subsidiary or the Surviving Corporation following the Effective
Time (each, a "Continuing Employee"), so long as such Continuing Employee
remains employed by Parent, its Subsidiary or the Surviving Corporation, (i) cash
compensation (including any retention bonus, stay bonus, bridge bonus or
similar cash payment) that is substantially comparable in the aggregate to the
cash compensation (excluding any change in control or transaction bonus,
retention bonus, spot bonus or similar cash payment) provided to such
Continuing Employee as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (provided
that a Continuing Employee's base salary shall not be less than seventy-five
(75%) of the base salary provided to such Continuing Employee as of the date
hereof, and provided further that to the extent that such base salary is less
than 100% of base salary as of the date hereof, such Continuing Employee shall
receive a retention bonus, a stay bonus, a bridge bonus opportunity or a
similar cash payment opportunity, vesting monthly over a period not exceeding
twelve months, in an amount no less than such difference in salary), (ii)
health and welfare benefits (excluding severance benefits) that are
substantially similar to those health and welfare benefits that are provided
to similarly situated employees of Parent or its Subsidiaries, as determined
by Parent, and (iii) cash severance benefits (other than reimbursement of
COBRA continuation costs) that are no less favorable than the cash severance
benefits set forth on Section 6.12(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedules,
provided that payment of any such severance benefits shall be subject to such
Continuing Employee executing a general release of claims on Parent's standard
form.

(b) Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to the extent
permitted by the terms of Parent's existing benefit plans and Applicable Law
to ensure that, as of the Closing Date, each Continuing Employee receives
credit for service with the Company (or predecessor employers to the extent
the Company provides such past service credit under the Company Employee
Plans) for purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting, vacation
entitlement and level of severance benefits under each of the comparable
employee benefit plans, programs and policies of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or the relevant Subsidiary, as applicable ("Parent Plans"), in
which such Continuing Employee becomes a participant; provided that such
recognition of service shall not (i) apply for purposes of any equity or
equity-based plans (including any entitlement to equity acceleration in
connection with retirement); (ii) apply for purposes of any plan that provides
retiree welfare benefits, (iii) apply for purposes of benefit accruals or
participation eligibility under any defined benefit pension plan or plan
providing post-retirement pension plan benefits other than as required by
Applicable Law in non-US jurisdictions, (iv) operate to duplicate any benefits
of a Continuing Employee with respect to the same period of service, or (v)
apply for purposes of any plan, program or arrangement (A) under which
similarly situated employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries do not receive
credit for prior service or (B) that is grandfathered or frozen, either with
respect to level of benefits or participation.

(c) With respect to each "employee welfare benefit plan" (as that term is
defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA) that is maintained by Parent for the purpose
of providing for such plan's participants or their beneficiaries medical,
surgical or hospital care or benefits, the Surviving Corporation or the
relevant Subsidiary for the benefit of any Continuing Employees, Parent shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to the extent permitted by such plan and
Applicable Law (i) to cause all pre-existing condition exclusions of such plan
to be waived for each Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents,
unless and to the extent the individual, immediately prior to entry in such
plan, was subject to such conditions under the comparable Company Employee
Plan, and (ii) to cause each Continuing Employee to be given credit under such plan for all amounts paid by such Continuing Employee under any similar
Company Employee Plan for the plan year that includes the Closing Date for
purposes of applying deductibles, co-payments and out-of-pocket maximums as
though such amounts had been paid in accordance with the terms and conditions
of the applicable plan maintained by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the
relevant Subsidiary, as applicable, for the plan year in which the Closing
Date occurs, subject to the applicable information being provided to Parent in
a form that Parent reasonably determines in its sole discretion is
administratively feasible to take into account under its plans.

(d) Unless Parent provides written notice to the Company no later than ten
(10) Business Days prior to the Closing Date to the contrary, the Company
Board shall adopt resolutions providing that no rights to contributions will
accrue after, and that each Qualified Plan shall be terminated, as of the day
immediately prior to the Closing Date (but conditioned upon the occurrence of
the Closing). The Company and Parent shall cooperate in good faith prior to
the Closing with respect to the preparation and execution of all documentation
necessary to effect the foregoing termination, and the Company shall provide
Parent a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on all such
documentation. To the extent that the Qualified Plan(s) are terminated
pursuant to Parent's request, the Continuing Employees shall be eligible to
participate in a 401(k) plan maintained by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
or Affiliates as soon as reasonably practicable following the Closing Date.

(e) To the extent permitted by Applicable Law (including applicable Privacy
Laws), the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to deliver to
Parent, not less than ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, a
schedule in a form reasonably acceptable to Parent, which shall include the
information set forth below:

(i) With respect to each holder of a Company Option: (A) such holder's name,
address, e-mail address and, if available to the Company, social security
number (or tax identification number, as applicable), (B) the number of shares
of Company Common Stock underlying each Company Option held by such holder,
(C) the respective exercise price per Share of such Company Options, (D) the
respective grant date(s) of such Company Options and any changes thereto, (E)
the respective vesting schedule with respect to such Company Options and any
changes thereto, (F) whether any amount is required to be withheld, and (H)
such other relevant information that Parent may reasonably require.

(ii) With respect to each holder of a Company RSU or Company PSU: (A) such
holder's name, address, e-mail address and, if available to the Company,
social

security number (or tax identification number, as applicable), (B) the number
of shares of Company Common Stock underlying each Company RSU and/or Company
PSU held by such holder, (C) the respective grant date(s) of such Company RSUs
and/or Company PSUs and any changes thereto, (D) the respective vesting
schedule with respect to such Company RSUs and/or Company PSUs and any changes
thereto, (E) whether any amount is required to be withheld, and (F) such other
relevant information that Parent may reasonably require. (f) The consummation of the Merger shall constitute a "change in control" for
all purposes under the Company Employee Plans.

(g) The Company will provide Parent with a copy of any material written
communications intended for broad-based and general distribution to any
current or former employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries if such
communications relate to the compensation, employment or labor aspects of the
Transactions, and will provide Parent with a reasonable opportunity to review
and comment on such communications prior to distribution, and the Company will
give good faith consideration to such comments.

(h) As soon as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement,
but in no event later than seventy-five (75) days following the date of this
Agreement, with respect to each "officer" of the Company (as defined in Rule
16a-1 promulgated under the Exchange Act) (each a "Section 16 Officer") and
any other "disqualified individual" of the Company (as defined in Section
280G(c) of the Code), the Company shall furnish to Parent a schedule that sets
forth (i) the Company's reasonable, good faith estimate of the maximum amount
(separately identifying single and double-trigger amounts and any tax gross-up
payments) that could be paid to such Section 16 Officer or other disqualified
individual as a result of any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (alone or in combination with any other event), (ii) the "base
amount" (as defined in Section 280G(b)(3) of the Code) for each such Section
16 Officer or other disqualified individual, and (iii) to the extent
reasonably requested by Parent, underlying documentation on which such
calculations are based. The Company and the Parent agree to use commercially
reasonable efforts to cooperate to update the schedules and underlying
documentation required by this Section 6.12(h) prior to the anticipated
Closing Date.

(i) To the extent that any Collective Bargaining Agreement requires the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to consult with, provide notice to, or
obtain the consent or opinion of any labor organization or similar
organization, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts comply
with any such obligations.

(j) No provision in this Agreement shall modify or amend any Company Employee
Plan or Parent Plan unless this Agreement explicitly states that the provision
"amends" such Company Employee Plan or Parent Plan. This shall not prevent the
parties entitled to enforce this Agreement from enforcing any provision in
this Agreement, but no other party shall be entitled to enforce any provision
in this Agreement on the grounds that it is an amendment to such Company
Employee Plan or Parent Plan. If a party not entitled to enforce this
Agreement brings a lawsuit or other action to enforce any provision in this
Agreement as an amendment to such Company Employee Plan or Parent Plan and
that provision is construed to be such an

amendment despite not being explicitly designated as one in this Agreement,
that provision shall lapse retroactively as of its inception, thereby
precluding it from having any amendatory effect.

(k) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, this
Section 6.12 will not be deemed to (i) guarantee employment for any period of
time for, or preclude the ability of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any
of their respective Subsidiaries to terminate any Continuing Employee for any
reason; (ii) subject to the limitations and requirements specifically set
forth in this Section 6.12(k), require Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
any of their respective Subsidiaries to continue any Company Employee Plan or prevent the amendment, modification or termination thereof after the Effective
Time; (iii) create any third party beneficiary rights in any Person; or (iv)
establish, amend or modify any benefit plan, program, agreement or
arrangement.

(l) The Company may omit Personal Information from the Company Disclosure
Schedules (or any other document related to the Merger), including Personal
Information to be provided pursuant to Section 6.12(e), solely to the extent
that the inclusion of such Personal Information at the relevant time would
result in a breach of applicable Privacy Laws; provided that, prior to
omitting any such Personal Information, the Company shall (i) execute any
documents (such as data protection agreements) reasonably necessary to render
lawful such inclusion of such Personal Information in the Company Disclosure
Schedules (or such other document related to the Merger); (ii) provide Parent
with a general description of the omitted Personal Information and the reason
for such omission (to the extent not prohibited by applicable Privacy Laws);
and (iii) provide Parent with updated copies of the Company Disclosure
Schedules (and any such other document related to the Merger) with all omitted
Personal Information included, reasonably promptly after the earliest time at
which the disclosure of such omitted Personal Information would no longer
result in a breach of applicable Privacy Laws (and, in any event, no later
than the Closing, unless otherwise prohibited by applicable Privacy Laws);
provided, further, that, for the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Section
6.12(l) shall permit the Company to amend, modify or otherwise supplement the
Company Disclosure Schedules (or any other document related to the Merger)
other than to include the omitted Personal Information in accordance herewith.

Section 6.13 Proxy Statement; Company Stockholder Approval.

(a) Proxy Statement.

(i) As soon as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement,
and in any event within fifteen (15) Business Days after the date hereof, the
Company shall file with the SEC a preliminary Proxy Statement. The Company
shall include in the Proxy Statement the Company Recommendation, unless there
has been a Change in Recommendation in accordance with Section 6.02(c). If the
Company determines that it is required to file any document other than the
Proxy Statement in connection with the Merger pursuant to Applicable Law (such
document, as amended or supplemented, an "Other Required Company Filing"),
then, subject to Section 6.02, the Company will use its reasonable best
efforts to promptly prepare and file such Other Required Company Filing with the SEC. The Company shall cause the Proxy
Statement and any Other Required Company Filing to comply as to form in all
material respects with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the
rules of the SEC and the NYSE. The Company will not file the preliminary or
definitive Proxy Statement, any Other Required Company Filing, or any
supplement or amendment thereto (or any disclosure relating to the foregoing)
with the SEC or otherwise disseminate any of the foregoing without providing
Parent and its counsel a reasonable opportunity in advance to review and
comment thereon, which comments shall be considered and discussed with Parent
and its counsel by the Company and its counsel in good faith. On the date of
filing, the date of mailing to the stockholders of the Company and at the time
of the Company Meeting, the Company shall cause the Proxy Statement and all
Other Required Company Filings not to contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not false or misleading; provided,
notwithstanding the foregoing, no representation or warranty is made by the
Company with respect to any information supplied by Parent, Merger Sub or any
of their Affiliates for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy
Statement or any Other Required Company Filings.

(ii) Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall, and shall cause its
independent accountants, counsel and other Representatives to, cooperate with
the other parties hereto in the preparation of the Proxy Statement, and
furnish all information, data and documentation concerning the Company, Parent
or Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates, as applicable, that is
necessary or appropriate in connection with the preparation, filing and
distribution of the Proxy Statement and any Other Required Company Filing and
the resolution of any comments received from the SEC with respect thereto. If
at any time prior to the Company Meeting (or any adjournment or postponement
thereof) the Company, on the one hand, or Parent or Merger Sub, on the other
hand, discovers any information relating to the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or
any of their respective Affiliates, directors or officers, that should be set
forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement or any Other
Required Company Filing so that the Proxy Statement or such Other Required
Company Filing, as applicable, would not include any misstatement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading, then the party hereto that
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties hereto, and
the Company shall promptly file with the SEC an appropriate amendment or
supplement to such filing describing such information and, to the extent
required by Applicable Law or the SEC or its staff, disseminate such
information to the Company's stockholders.

(iii) The Company shall advise the Parent and Merger Sub, promptly after it
receives notice thereof, of any receipt of (A) a request by the SEC or its
staff for any amendment or revisions to the Proxy Statement or any Other
Required Company Filing, (B) comments from the SEC or its staff on the Proxy
Statement or any Other Required Company Filing or (C) a request by the SEC or
its staff for additional information in connection therewith, and the Company
shall provide Parent with copies

of all correspondence between the Company or any of its Representatives, on
the one hand, and the SEC, on the other hand, with respect to such filings or
the Transactions. No response to staff comments on, the Proxy Statement or any
Other Required Company Filing shall be made by the Company without providing
Parent and its counsel a reasonable opportunity in advance to review and
comment thereon, which comments shall be considered and discussed with Parent
and its counsel by the Company and its counsel in good faith. The Company
shall respond promptly to any comments from the SEC or the staff of the SEC on
the Proxy Statement or any Other Required Company Filing. (iv) The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy
Statement to be filed in definitive form and mailed to its stockholders as
promptly as practicable (and, in any event, within five (5) Business Days
after the earlier of (A) the eleventh (11th) day following the date on which
the preliminary Proxy Statement is filed, if the staff of the SEC has not
prior to such date informed the Company that they are reviewing the
preliminary Proxy Statement and (B) the date on which any comments from the
SEC or the staff of the SEC with respect to the preliminary Proxy Statement
have been resolved or withdrawn (the earlier of such dates, the "Proxy
Clearance Date")) and to cause the Proxy Clearance Date to occur as promptly
as reasonably practicable following the date hereof.

(b) Company Stockholder Approval.

(i) The Company shall take all actions necessary to duly call, establish a
record date for, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its
stockholders, for the purpose of voting upon the adoption of this Agreement
(the "Company Meeting"), so that the Company Meeting occurs as soon as
reasonably practicable following the Proxy Clearance Date (and, in any event,
within thirty (30) days following the Proxy Clearance Date), in accordance
with Applicable Law, the Company's certificate of incorporation and the
Company's bylaws; provided that the Company may postpone or adjourn the
Company Meeting following consultation with Parent (and the Company's good
faith consideration of any comments by Parent) if (A) as of the time for which
the Company Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy
Statement), there are insufficient Shares represented (either in person or by
proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Company
Meeting or to the extent that at such time the Company has not received
proxies sufficient to allow the receipt of the Requisite Company Stockholder
Approval at the Company Meeting (such postponement or adjournment to be for no
more than five (5) Business Days and shall be to no later than the date three
(3) Business Days prior to the End Date), (B) to allow time for the filing and
dissemination of any supplemental or amended disclosure document that the
Company Board has determined in good faith (after consultation with the

disseminated under Applicable Law, the Company's certificate of incorporation
or the Company's bylaws or (C) the Company is required to postpone or adjourn
the Company Meeting by Applicable Law, Order or a request from the SEC or its
staff (in each case, such postponement or adjournment to be for no more than a
reasonable amount of time and shall be to no later than the date three (3)
Business Days prior to the End Date). The Company shall, at the

instruction of Parent, postpone or adjourn the Company Meeting if there are
not sufficient affirmative votes in person or by proxy at the Company Meeting
to adopt this Agreement to allow reasonable time for the solicitation of
proxies for purposes of obtaining the Requisite Company Stockholder Approval.

(ii) Without the prior written consent of Parent, the adoption of this
Agreement shall be the only matter (other than matters of procedure and
matters required by Applicable Law to be voted on by the Company's
stockholders in connection with the adoption of this Agreement, including a
"Say-on-Golden-Parachute" vote) that the Company shall propose to be acted on by the stockholders of the Company at the
Company Meeting.

(iii) Once the Company has established a record date for the Company Meeting,
the Company shall not change such record date or establish a different record
date for the Company Meeting without the prior written consent of Parent
(which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed), unless
required to do so by the DGCL. If the record date for the Company Meeting is
changed, the Company shall, as to that record date, comply with each of its
obligations under this Section 6.13.

(iv) In connection with the Company Meeting, the Company shall (A) subject to
the right to make a Change in Recommendation in accordance with Section
6.02(c), solicit proxies in favor of the adoption if this Agreement in
accordance with Applicable Law and use reasonable best efforts to obtain the
Requisite Company Stockholder Approval and (B) otherwise comply with all legal
requirements applicable to such meeting. The Company shall cooperate with and
keep Parent informed on a reasonably current basis regarding its solicitation
efforts and voting results following the dissemination of the definitive Proxy
Statement.

(v) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, unless this Agreement
has been terminated in accordance with its terms, the Company shall establish
a record date for, call, give notice of, convene and hold the Company Meeting
and submit the Merger and the adoption of this Agreement for the approval of
its stockholders at the Company Meeting whether or not a Change in
Recommendation shall have occurred or an Acquisition Proposal shall have been
publicly announced or otherwise made known to the Company, the Company Board
or the Company's Representatives or its stockholders.

payoff letters for any third-party indebtedness for borrowed money of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Parent evidencing full repayment and satisfaction of all such
indebtedness (the "Payoff Letters"), together with any collateral releases,
collateral access agreement terminations, mortgage releases, Intellectual
Property releases, physical collateral deliveries and other related
termination and/or release items in connection therewith. Any such Payoff
Letter shall correctly specify the amount necessary to repay in full such
indebtedness and shall set forth the account(s) to which such amount(s) shall
be paid, and shall acknowledge that, subject to the repayment (or other
satisfactory arrangements

with respect to outstanding letters of credit) of the aggregate principal
amount outstanding under the relevant credit facility, together with all
interest accrued thereon, all obligations in respect thereof shall be
terminated or released and any Liens or guarantees with respect to such
indebtedness have been or concurrently will be released. The Company shall
deliver (a) a draft of each such Payoff Letter to Parent at least ten (10)

of each such Payoff Letter in substantially similar form at least one (1)
Business Day prior to the Closing Date.

This Agreement may be terminated and the Merger may be abandoned at any time
prior to the Effective Time (with any termination by Parent also being an
effective termination by Merger Sub):

(a) by mutual written agreement of the Company and Parent;

(b) by either the Company or Parent, if:

(i) the Closing shall not have occurred at or before 5:00 p.m. (New York City
time) on the twelve (12) month anniversary of the date of this Agreement (as
such date may be extended from time to time pursuant to this Section
8.01(b)(i), the "End Date"); provided, however, that the right to terminate
this Agreement under this Section 8.01(b)(i) shall not be available to any
party whose material breach of any provision of this Agreement has been the
principal cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the Closing to have
occurred at or prior to 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the End Date;
provided, further, that if by the fifth (5th) Business Day prior to any then-
scheduled End Date any of the conditions set forth in Section 7.01(b) and
Section 7.01(c) (if the Restraint arises under Antitrust Laws) have not been
satisfied or waived by each applicable party hereto entitled to the benefit of
such condition, then either Parent or the Company shall be entitled to extend
the End Date by three (3) months by delivering written notice to the other

that, except as provided for in Section 9.09, the End Date can never be
extended beyond the eighteen (18) month anniversary of the date hereof;

(ii) the Requisite Company Stockholder Approval shall not have been obtained
at the Company Meeting or at any adjournment or postponement thereof, in each
case, at which a vote on such adoption was taken;

(iii) any court of competent jurisdiction or any Governmental Entity shall
have issued a final, non-appealable Order or taken any other action, in each

perform any of its obligations under this Agreement has been the principal
cause of, or resulted in, the events specified in this Section 8.01(b)(iii);
or

(c) by Parent, if: (i) prior to the receipt of the Requisite Company Stockholder Approval, (A)
the Company Board (or any committee thereof) shall have failed to include the
Company Recommendation in the Proxy Statement or shall have otherwise effected
a Change in Recommendation, (B) the Company shall have entered into an
Alternative Acquisition Agreement or (C) the Company shall have committed a
material and Willful Breach of Section 6.02 or Section 6.13;

(ii) the Company shall have breached or failed to perform in any material
respect any of its covenants or other agreements contained in this Agreement
or any representation or warranty of the Company contained in this Agreement
shall not be true and correct, which breach, failure to perform or failure to
be true and correct (A) would give rise to the failure of one of the
conditions set forth in Section 7.02(a) or Section 7.02(b) to be satisfied and
(B) is incapable of being cured or has not been cured by the Company within
thirty (30) calendar days after written notice has been given by Parent to the
Company of such breach, failure to perform or failure to be true and correct
(or, if earlier, by the End Date); provided, however, that Parent may not

Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.01(c)(iii) shall not be available to
Parent if Parent's failure to perform any of its obligations under this
Agreement has been the principal cause of, or resulted in, the events

prior to or concurrently with such termination pays to Parent by wire transfer
in immediately available funds the Company Termination Fee required to be paid
pursuant to Section 8.03(a)(i) and (B) concurrently with such termination,
enters into such definitive Alternative Acquisition Agreement; or

(ii) if Parent shall have breached or failed to perform in any material
respect any of its covenants or other agreements contained in this Agreement
or any representation or warranty of Parent contained in this Agreement shall
not be true and correct, which breach, failure to perform or failure to be
true and correct (A) would give rise to the failure of one of the conditions
set forth in Section 7.03(a) or Section 7.03(b) to be satisfied, and (B) is
incapable of being cured or has not been cured by Parent within thirty (30)
calendar days after written notice has been given by the Company to Parent of
such breach, failure to perform or failure to be true and correct (or, if

pursuant to this Section 8.01(d)(ii) if, at the time such termination would

Agreement shall become void and of no effect without liability of any party,
any Representative of such party or any Parent Related Party to each other
party hereto; provided, however, that the provisions of this Section 8.02,

Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement shall continue in effect in

set forth in Section 7.01 have been satisfied except for the condition set
forth in Section 7.01(a)) or Section 8.01(b)(ii), and in any such case (1)
prior to the date of such termination (or the date of the Company Meeting in

Company or the Company Board or shall have been publicly disclosed and (2)
within twelve (12) months after such termination, (x) the Company enters into
a definitive agreement with respect to any Qualifying Acquisition Transaction
with a Third Party that is thereafter consummated or (y) the Company

the same Acquisition Proposal described in clause (1) above; (B) the Company
pursuant to Section 8.01(d)(i); or (C) Parent pursuant to Section 8.01(c)(i);
then, in any such case, the Company shall pay, or cause to be paid, to Parent
or Parent's designee(s), as the case may be, an amount equal to $80,000,000
(such amount, the "Company Termination Fee") (subject to any credit under
Section 8.03(d)(i)(B)).

(ii) If, but only if, this Agreement is terminated by either Parent or the
Company pursuant to Section 8.01(b)(ii), the Company shall pay, or cause to be
paid, to Parent or Parent's designee(s), as the case may be, an amount equal to
$21,000,000 (such amount, the "No Vote Fee").

(iii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 8.03(a), but
subject to Section 8.02 if the Company Termination Fee is paid, the Company
Termination Fee shall constitute liquidated damages, and from and after such
termination, Company shall have no further liability of any kind for any
reason in connection with this Agreement or the termination contemplated
hereby other than the payment of the Company Termination Fee (and any related
amounts owing pursuant to Section 8.03(d)) and such payments shall be the sole
and exclusive remedy under this Agreement of Parent, Merger Sub and their
respective Subsidiaries against the Company and the Company Related Parties in
the event of a termination of this Agreement giving rise to the payment of the
Company Termination Fee.

(b) Parent Termination Fee. If, but only if, (i) this Agreement is terminated
by Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 8.01(b)(i) (due to a failure to
satisfy any condition set forth in Section 7.01(b) or Section 7.01(c) (if the
Restraint arises under Antitrust Laws)), Section 8.01(b)(iii) (if the Order,
action or Applicable Law arises under Antitrust Laws) or Section 8.01(c)(iii)
(if the Order, action or Applicable Law arises under Antitrust Laws) (any such
termination, a "Parent Termination Fee Triggering Termination"), (ii) at the
time of such termination any condition set forth in Section 7.01(b) or Section
7.01(c) (if the Restraint arises under Antitrust Laws) shall not be satisfied
or waived by each applicable party hereto entitled to the benefit of such
condition, (iii) at the time of such termination all other conditions set
forth in Section 7.01 and Section 7.02 shall be satisfied or shall have been
waived other than any such conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied
by actions to be taken at the Closing (and, in the case of those conditions
that by their nature are to be satisfied by actions to be taken at the
Closing, such conditions are capable of being satisfied if the Closing were to
occur at the time of such termination) and (iv) the Company is not in material
breach of this Agreement, which material breach was the principal cause of the
failure to satisfy conditions to the Merger that resulted in the Parent
Termination Fee Triggering Termination, then Parent shall pay to the Company a
termination fee equal to $250,000,000 (the "Parent Termination Fee").
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 8.03(b), but subject
to Section 8.02, if the Parent Termination Fee is paid, the Parent Termination
Fee shall constitute liquidated damages, and from and after such termination,
Parent shall have no further liability of any kind for any reason in
connection with this Agreement or the termination contemplated hereby other
than the payment of the Parent Termination Fee (and any related amounts owing
pursuant to Section 8.03(d)) and such payments shall be the sole and exclusive
remedy under this Agreement of the Company and its Subsidiaries and
stockholders of the Company against Parent, Merger Sub and the Parent Related
Parties in the event of a Parent Termination Fee Triggering Termination.

(c) Payment of Termination Fees.

(i) Any payments required to be made by the Company under Section 8.03(a)

8.03(a)(ii), either immediately prior to or concurrently with such termination
(if such termination is by the Company) or promptly, but in no event later
than two (2) Business Days, after the date of such termination (if such
termination is by Parent).

(ii) Any payments required to be made by Parent under Section 8.03(b) shall be
made by wire transfer of same day funds to the Company no later than two (2)
Business Days after the date of such termination.

(d) No Duplication.

(i) (A) For the avoidance of doubt, any payment of the Company Termination Fee
made by the Company pursuant to Section 8.03(a), shall be payable only once
with respect to this Section 8.03 and not in duplication even though such
payment may be payable under one or more provisions hereof and (B) in the
event that a No Vote Fee has already been paid pursuant to Section 8.03(a),
the Company shall be entitled to credit the amount of the No Vote Fee actually
received by Parent against the amount of the Company Termination Fee.

(ii) For the avoidance of doubt, any payment of the Parent Termination Fee
made by Parent pursuant to Section 8.03(b), shall be payable only once with

(e) Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges that the
agreements contained in this Section 8.03 are an integral part of this
Agreement and the Transactions and that without such agreements the Company,
Parent and Merger Sub would not have entered into this Agreement. Accordingly,

due pursuant to this Section 8.03 or any portion thereof and, in order to
obtain such payment, Parent or Merger Sub commences a suit which results in an
Order against the Company or the Parent for such amounts or any portion
thereof, the Company shall pay to Parent or Merger Sub their costs and
expenses (including reasonable attorney's fees and disbursements) in
connection with such suit, together with interest on the amount of the Company
Termination Fee or No Vote Fee, as applicable (or, in each case, any portion
thereof that has not been paid timely in accordance with this Agreement), and
on the amount of such costs and expenses and (ii) if Parent fails to pay the
Parent Termination Fee pursuant to this Section 8.03 or any portion thereof
and, in order to obtain such payment, the Company commences a suit which
results in an Order against the Parent requiring Parent to pay such amount or
any portion thereof, Parent shall pay to the Company its costs and expenses
(including reasonable attorney's fees and disbursements) in connection with
such suit and together with interest on the amount of the Parent Termination
Fee (or any portion thereof that has not been paid timely in accordance with
this Agreement), and on the amount of such costs and expenses. Any interest
required to be paid pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be calculated, in
the case of the Company Termination Fee, the No Vote Fee or the Parent
Termination Fee, as applicable, from and including the date payment of was required to be made pursuant to Section 8.03(c) or, in the case
of any cost or expenses of Parent or the Company, from and including the date

Citibank, N.A. in effect on the date such payment was required to be made.

2.07(b), (iv) from and after (but not before) the Effective Time, the Persons
entitled to receive the consideration specified in Section 2.09 shall be
beneficiaries of Section 2.09, and (v) the last sentence of Section 8.03(b)

of doubt, no holder of Shares shall have any third-party beneficiary rights
under this Section 9.05 or any other provision of this Agreement except, only

(b) Except for the representations and warranties contained in Article 4, each
of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges that neither the Company nor any Person
on behalf of the Company makes, and neither Parent nor Merger Sub is relying

the Company or with respect to any other information (including any estimates,
projections, forecasts, plans or other forward-looking information) made
available to Parent or Merger Sub in connection with the Transactions
(including with respect to the accuracy or completeness thereof). In
connection with the due diligence investigation of the Company by Parent and
Merger Sub, Parent and Merger Sub have received and may continue to receive
from the Company certain estimates, projections, forecasts and other forward-
looking information, as well as certain business plans and cost-related plan
information, regarding the Company's business and operations. Section 9.06 Governing Law.

This Agreement and any Proceedings arising out of or related hereto or to the
Merger or to the inducement of any party hereto to enter into this Agreement
(whether for breach of contract, tortious conduct or otherwise and whether
predicated on common law, statute or otherwise) shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the Applicable Law of the State of Delaware,
including all matters of construction, validity and performance, without
regard to the conflicts of law rules of such State that would refer a matter
to the laws of another jurisdiction.

Section 9.07 Jurisdiction.

The parties hereto agree that any Proceeding seeking to enforce any provision
of, or based on any matter arising out of or in connection with, this
Agreement or the Transactions shall be brought in the Court of Chancery of the
State of Delaware located in Wilmington, Delaware and any state appellate
court therefrom located in Wilmington, Delaware, or, if no such state court
has proper jurisdiction, the Federal District Court for the District of
Delaware located in Wilmington, Delaware, and any appellate court therefrom.
Each party hereby irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of such
court in respect of any legal or equitable Proceeding arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or the Transactions, or relating to enforcement of
any of the terms of this Agreement, and hereby waives, and agrees not to
assert, as a defense in any such Proceeding, any claim that it is not subject
personally to the jurisdiction of such court, that the Proceeding is brought
in an inconvenient forum, that the venue of the Proceeding is improper or that
this Agreement or the Transactions may not be enforced in or by such courts.
Each party agrees that notice or the service of process in any Proceeding
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Transactions shall be
properly served or delivered if delivered in the manner contemplated by
Section 9.01 or in any other manner permitted by Applicable Law.

Section 9.08 Waiver of Jury Trial.

EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO
TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR
THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

Section 9.09 Specific Performance; Remedies.

The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur and that the
parties hereto would not have any adequate remedy at law in the event that any
of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that
the parties hereto shall be entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to seek to enforce specifically the
terms and provisions of this Agreement in the Court of Chancery of the State
of Delaware located in Wilmington, Delaware and any state appellate court
therefrom located in Wilmington, Delaware, or, if no such state court has
proper jurisdiction, the Federal District Court located in Wilmington,
Delaware, and any appellate court therefrom, and, in any action for specific performance, each party waives the defense of adequacy of a remedy at law and
waives any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection
with such remedy, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at law or in equity (subject to the limitations set forth in this
Agreement). If, prior to the End Date, any Party brings any Proceeding to
enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof (other
than any such terms and provisions that expressly survive the termination of
this Agreement) by any other Party, the End Date shall automatically be
extended to the later of (i) 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the twentieth
(20th) Business Day following the resolution of such Proceeding and (ii) such
other date and time established by the court presiding over such Proceeding,
as the case may be, solely if such later date and time is later than the End
Date.

Section 9.10 Severability.

Other than with respect to Section 8.03, which is an integral part of this
Agreement, if any term, provision, covenant or restriction of this Agreement
is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other Governmental Entity to
be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms, provisions,
covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and
effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated so long as the
economic or legal substance of the Merger and the other Transactions is not
affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such a
determination, the parties hereto agree to negotiate in good faith to modify
this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties hereto as
closely as possible in an acceptable manner, in order that the Merger be
consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

Section 9.11 Entire Agreement.

This Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement, the exhibits to this Agreement,
the Schedules, the Company Disclosure Schedules and the Parent Disclosure
Schedules and any documents delivered by the parties hereto in connection
herewith constitute the entire agreement among the parties hereto with respect
to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, among the parties hereto with respect
thereto.

Section 9.12 Rules of Construction.

Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that it has been represented by
counsel of its choice throughout all negotiations that have preceded the
execution and delivery of this Agreement, and that it has executed the same
with the advice of said independent counsel. Each party hereto and its counsel
cooperated and participated in the drafting and preparation of this Agreement
and the documents referred to herein, and any and all drafts relating thereto
exchanged among the parties hereto shall be deemed the work product of all of
the parties hereto and may not be construed against any party hereto by reason
of its drafting or preparation. Accordingly, any rule of law or any legal
decision that would require interpretation of any ambiguities in this
Agreement against any party that drafted or prepared it is of no application
and is hereby expressly waived by each of the parties hereto, and any
controversy over interpretations of this Agreement shall be decided without
regard to events of drafting or preparation. Section 9.13 Headings.

Headings of the Articles and Sections of this Agreement are for convenience of
the parties hereto only and shall be given no substantive or interpretive
effect whatsoever. The table of contents to this Agreement is for reference
purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of
this Agreement.

Section 9.14 Counterparts; Effectiveness.

This Agreement may be signed in any number of counterparts, each of which
shall be an original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto and
hereto were upon the same instrument. This Agreement shall become effective
when each party hereto shall have received a counterpart hereof signed by all
of the other parties hereto. Until and unless each party hereto has received a
counterpart hereof signed by each other party hereto, this Agreement shall
have no effect and no party shall have any right or obligation hereunder
(whether by virtue of any other oral or written agreement or other
communication). Signatures to this Agreement transmitted by facsimile
transmission, by electronic mail in PDF form, or by any other electronic means
designed to preserve the original graphic and pictorial appearance of a

action based upon, arising out of, or related to this Agreement or the
Transactions may only be brought against the Persons that are expressly named

Parent Related Party shall have any Liability to the Company or any of its
Affiliates or Representatives, or any holder of Shares, or any Person claiming
by, under or through the Company, or any other Person relating to or arising
out of this Agreement or in respect of any other document or theory (whether

oral representations made or alleged to be made in connection herewith
(whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise).
