"ERISA Affiliate" shall mean any person (as defined in Section 3(9) of ERISA)

has occurred and no condition exists with respect to the form or operation of
such Pension Plans that would cause the loss of such qualification or
exemption or the imposition of any material liability, penalty or tax under
ERISA or the Code.   (e) Each Pension Plan that is not qualified under Code
section 401(a) or 403(a) is exempt from Part 2, 3 and 4 of Title I of ERISA
as an unfunded plan that is maintained primarily for the purpose of providing
deferred compensation for a select group of management or highly compensated
employees, pursuant to Sections 201(2), 301(a)(3) and 401(a)(1) of ERISA. No
assets of the Company are allocated to or held in a "rabbi trust" or similar

of such plan or asserting any rights or claims to benefits under any Pension
Plan or against the assets of any trust under such plan, nor, to the best of
the Company\'s knowledge, are there any facts that would give rise to any
material liability.   (g) None of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or
any employee of the foregoing, nor any trustee, administrator, other
fiduciary or any other "party in interest" or "disqualified person" with
respect to the Pension Plans or Welfare Plans, has engaged in a "prohibited
transaction" (as such term is defined in Section 4975 of the Code or Section

required to be made by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any ERISA
Affiliate under Section 302 of ERISA and Section 412 of the Code have been
timely made, (ii) there has been no application for or waiver of the minimum
funding standards imposed by Section 412 of the Code, and (iii) no such plan
has incurred an "accumulated funding deficiency" within the meaning of

year.   (i) No employee benefit pension plan subject to Title IV of
ERISA maintained by the Company, any Subsidiary of the Company or any ERISA
Affiliate has been terminated or has     -26-   been the subject of a

thereunder) for which the 30-day notice requirement has not been waived by
the PBGC.   (j) With respect to any Pension Plan subject to Title IV of
ERISA, there is not any amount of "unfunded benefit liabilities" (as defined
in Section 4001(a)(18) of ERISA) under such plan, and the Company has no
knowledge of any facts or circumstances that would materially change the
funded status of any such plan.   (k) Neither the Company nor any
Subsidiary of the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has incurred, or is
reasonably likely to incur, liability under Title IV of ERISA.   (l) No
Pension Plan is a "multiemployer plan" as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA.
With respect to each Pension Plan that is a multiemployer plan: (i) no such
plan has been terminated, and no proceeding has been initiated to terminate
such plan; (ii) such plan is not, as of the date hereof, insolvent
(as described in Section 4245 of ERISA) or in reorganization (as described

future; (iii) neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has incurred any
liability on account of a partial withdrawal or complete withdrawal (within
the meaning of Sections 4205 and 4203, respectively, of ERISA) from such
plan, no such liability has been asserted, and there are no events or
circumstances which could result in such partial or complete withdrawal; (iv)
the Company, its Subsidiaries and ERISA Affiliates have made all
contributions to such plan due or accrued as of the date hereof and will have
made all such contributions as of the Closing Date; and (v) there would be no
withdrawal liability with respect to such plan if the Company, a Subsidiary
or an ERISA Affiliate were to withdraw from such plan on the Closing
Date.   (m) With respect to each of the Employee Benefit Plans, true,
correct and complete copies of the following documents have been made
available to Parent: (i) the plan document and any related trust agreement,
including amendments thereto, (ii) any current summary plan descriptions and
other material communications to participants relating to the Employee
Benefit Plans, (iii) the most recent Forms 5500, if applicable, (iv) the most
recent IRS determination letter, if applicable and (v) the most recent
actuarial report or valuation with respect to each Pension Plan subject to
Title IV of ERISA.   (n) None of the Welfare Plans maintained by the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries provide for continuing benefits or coverage for
any participant or any beneficiary of a participant following termination of
employment, except as may be required under Section 4980B of the Code and
Part 6 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA ("COBRA"), or except at the expense
of the participant or the participant\'s beneficiary. The Company, its
Subsidiaries, and any ERISA Affiliates which maintain a "group health plan"
within the meaning of Section 5000(b)(1) of the Code have complied in all
material respects with the "COBRA" notice and continuation requirements.  
(o) No liability under any Pension Plan or Welfare Plan has been funded nor

an insurance company as to     -27-   which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries has received notice that such insurance company is in
rehabilitation or a comparable proceeding.   (p) As of the Closing, the
Company, its Subsidiaries and any entity with which the Company or its
Subsidiaries could be considered a single employer under 29 U.S.C. Section
2101(a)(1) or under any relevant case law, has not incurred any liability or
obligation under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, as it
may be amended from time to time, and within the 90-day period immediately
following the Closing, will not incur any such liability or obligation if,
during such 90-day period, only terminations of employment in the normal
course of operations occur.   (q) The consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement will not result in an increase in the amount
of compensation or benefits or accelerate the vesting or timing of payment of
any benefits or compensation payable to or in respect of any employee of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries.   (r) The consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not result in or satisfy a
condition to the payment of compensation that would, in combination with any
other payment, result in an "excess parachute payment" within the meaning of
Section 280G(b) of the Code.   (s) The Company has disclosed to Parent on
Schedule 4.18(s) each Foreign Plan (as hereinafter defined) to the extent the
benefits provided thereunder are not mandated by the laws of the applicable
foreign jurisdiction. The Company, each of its Subsidiaries and each of the
Foreign Plans are in compliance with applicable laws and all required
contributions have been made to the Foreign Plans, except where the failure
to comply or make contributions would not, individually and in the aggregate,
either impair the Company\'s ability to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby or have a Material Adverse Effect. Each of the Foreign
Plans that is a funded defined benefit plan has a fair market value of plan
assets that is greater than the plan\'s liabilities, as determined in
accordance with applicable laws. Copies of the actuarial valuation reports or
FAS 87 reports for such plans have been made available to the Parent. For

Contracts set forth on Schedule 6.7. Each Seller agrees that, effective as of
the Closing, all rights of the Seller to indemnification by the Company and

Matters.   (a) Any federal Tax Return required to be filed by Parent or
Purchaser relating to any Straddle Period shall be submitted (with copies of
any relevant schedules, work papers and other documentation then available)
to the Sellers for their approval not less than 45 days prior to the due date
for the filing of such Tax Return, which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed. Each Seller shall have the option of providing to Parent
or Purchaser at any time at least 30 days prior to the due date, written
instructions as to how such Seller desires any item for which it may be
liable reflected on such Tax Return. Parent shall cause the items for which
such Seller is liable hereunder to be reflected in accordance with such
Seller\'s instructions (unless, in the opinion of tax advisors to Parent,
complying with such Seller\'s instructions would possibly subject Parent to
any criminal penalty or to civil penalties under Sections 6662 through 6664
of the Code or similar provisions of applicable state, local or foreign
Law).   (b) Upon the written request of Parent setting forth in
reasonable detail the computation of the amounts owed, each Seller shall pay
to Parent, no later than five business days prior to the due date for the
applicable Tax Return, the Taxes for which such Seller is liable pursuant to
Section 6.11(d) and which are payable with any Tax Return to be filed by
Parent with respect to any Straddle Period.   (c) Within 90 days after the
Closing Date, the Sellers shall prepare and provide to Parent a package of
Tax information materials, including schedules and work papers but limited to
those documents over which the Sellers or their accountants have control,
required by Parent to enable Parent to prepare and file all Tax Returns
required to be prepared and filed by it, it being understood that Parent has
the obligation to prepare and file all such Tax Returns. The Sellers shall
prepare such package in good faith in a manner consistent with past
practice.   (d) (i) To the extent permitted or required by law or
administrative  practice, (A) the taxable year of the Company and its
Subsidiaries which  includes the Closing Date shall be treated as closing on
and including the  Closing Date and, notwithstanding the foregoing, (B) all
transactions  whether or not in the ordinary course of business occurring
after the  Closing Date shall be reported on Parent\'s consolidated United
States  federal income Tax Return to the extent permitted by Treasury
Regulation  Section 1.1502-76(b) and shall be similarly reported on other Tax
Returns  of Parent or its Affiliates to the extent permitted by applicable
Law.   (ii) In determining any Seller\'s liability for Taxes pursuant to
this  Agreement, such Seller shall be credited with the amount of estimated
Taxes  of the Company paid by or on behalf of such Seller prior to the
Closing. To  the extent that such Seller\'s liability for fed-    
-42-    eral Taxes of the Company for a taxable year or period is less than
the  amount of estimated federal income Taxes previously paid by or on behalf
of  such Seller with respect to all or a portion of such taxable year or 
period, Parent shall pay such Seller the difference within five business 
days of the receipt of the Tax refund or in the case of amounts credited 
against Tax, the filing of the Tax Return relating to such income Taxes, 
whichever is later.   (e) (i) Any federal Tax refund (including any interest
in respect  thereof) received by Parent in respect of the Company, and any
amounts  credited against Tax of the Company to which Parent becomes
entitled  (including by way of any amended federal Tax Return other than
any  carryback filing), that relate to any taxable period, or portion
thereof,  ending on or before the Closing Date, shall be for the account of
the  Sellers pro rata, and Parent shall pay over to the Sellers any such
refund  or the amount of any such credit within five days of receipt of
such  credit. Parent shall pay the Sellers interest at the rate prescribed
under  Section 6621(a)(1) of the Code, compounded daily, on any amount not
paid  when due under this Section 6.11(e). For purposes of this Section
6.11(e),  where it is necessary to apportion a refund or credit between
Parent and  the Sellers for a Straddle Period, such refund or credit shall
be  apportioned between the period deemed to end at the close of the
Closing  Date and the period deemed to begin at the beginning of the day
following  the Closing Date on the basis of an interim closing of the books
of Parent,  except that refunds or credits of Taxes imposed on a period basis
shall be  allocated on a daily basis.   (ii) Parent shall cooperate in
obtaining any material federal Tax  refund that any Seller reasonably
believes should be available, including  through filing appropriate forms
with the applicable Governmental  Authority.   (f) (i) If the examination
of any federal Tax Return of the Company  for any taxable period ending on or
before the Closing Date shall result  (by settlement or otherwise) in any
adjustment which permits Parent to  increase deductions, losses or tax
credits or decrease the income, gains or  recapture of tax credits which
would otherwise (but for such adjustments)  have been reported or taken into
account (including by way of any increase  in basis) by Parent for one or
more periods ending after the Closing Date,  the Seller shall notify Parent
and provide it with adequate information so  that Parent can reflect on its
Tax Returns such increases in deductions,  losses or tax credits or decreases
in income, gains or recapture of tax  credits. Parent shall pay to each
Seller, within 30 days of the receipt of  such Tax Benefits, the amount of
any resulting Tax Benefits.   (ii) If the examination of any federal Tax
Return of Parent for any  taxable period ending after the Closing Date shall
result (by settlement or  otherwise) in any adjustment which permits any
Seller to increase  deductions, losses or tax credits or decrease the income,
gains or  recapture of tax credits which would otherwise (but for such
adjustments)  have been reported or taken into account (including by way of
any increase  in basis) by such Seller for one or more periods ending on or
before the  Closing Date, Parent, shall notify each Seller and provide it
with adequate  information so that such Seller can reflect on its Tax Returns
such  increases in deductions, losses or tax credits or decreases in
income,  gains or recapture of tax     -43-    credits. Each Seller
shall pay to Parent, within 30 days of the receipt of  such information, the
amount of any resulting Tax Benefits.   (g) (i) Parent shall not take any
action which Parent knows would (A)  increase any Seller\'s liability for
Taxes (including any liability of any  Seller to indemnify Parent for Taxes
pursuant to this Agreement) or (B)  result in, or change the character of,
any income or gain that any Seller  must report on any federal Tax
Return.   (ii) Parent shall not amend, refile or otherwise modify any
federal  Tax Return relating in whole or in part to the Company with respect
to any  taxable year or period ending on or before the Closing Date (or
with  respect to any Straddle Period) without the prior written consent of
the  Sellers, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed.   (h) After the Closing Date, each of Parent and the Sellers shall
(and shall cause their respective Affiliates to) (i) assist the other party
in preparing any Tax Returns which such other party is responsible for
preparing and filing, and (ii) cooperate fully in preparing for any audits
of, or disputes with any Tax Authority regarding, any Tax. The Sellers shall
not dispose of any Tax work papers, books or records relating to the Company
or its Subsidiaries during the six-year period following the Closing Date,
and thereafter shall give Parent reasonable written notice before disposing
of such items.   (i) Parent shall not make any election under Section 338(g)
of the Code (or any analogous provision of state, local, or foreign law) with
respect to any Subsidiary of the Company without the prior written consent of
the Sellers, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. If
the Sellers do so consent, Parent shall be liable for, and shall pay, any
Tax attributable to, or resulting from, the making of such election and
will indemnify the Sellers from and against any Tax liability or other
adverse consequences attributable to, or resulting directly or indirectly
from, the making of such election. Any indemnification obligation of Parent
pursuant to this Section 6.11(i) shall be increased by the relevant After Tax
Amount. For purposes of this Section 6.11(i), "After Tax Amount" means any
additional amount necessary to reflect the tax consequences of the receipt or
accrual of such reimbursement payment (including the payment of an additional
amount or amounts hereunder) determined by using the actual marginal federal,
state, foreign or local rates for the relevant taxable period.   (j)
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Sellers shall
indemnify Parent from and against and in respect of any and all
Losses incurred by Parent, which may be imposed on, sustained, incurred or
suffered by or assessed against Parent, directly or indirectly, to the extent
relating to or arising out of any liability for Indemnified Taxes imposed on
the Sellers or the Company or its Subsidiaries or predecessors of any of the
foregoing (other than JCI) for any taxable year or period that ends on or
before the Closing Date and, with respect to any Straddle Period, the portion
of such Straddle Period deemed to end on and include the Closing Date.  
(k) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Parent shall
indemnify the Sellers from and against and in respect of any and all Losses
incurred by the Sellers, which     -44-   may be imposed on, sustained,
incurred or suffered by or assessed against the Company, directly or
indirectly, to the extent relating to or arising out of:   (i) any liability
for Taxes (other than Indemnified Taxes) imposed on  any of the Company or
its Subsidiaries; and   (ii) any liability, or increase in a liability, for
Taxes imposed on  any Seller as a result of any failure by Parent to perform
or comply with  its obligations under Section 6.11(g)(i) of this
Agreement.   (l) (i) Notice. After the Closing Date, Parent and the Sellers
each shall notify the other party in writing within 20 days of the notice of
the commencement of any Tax audit or administrative or judicial proceeding
affecting the Taxes of the Company or its Subsidiaries, which, if determined
adversely to the taxpayer (the "Tax Indemnitee") or after the lapse of time,
would be grounds for indemnification under this Section 6.11 by the other
party (the "Tax Indemnitor"). Such notice shall contain factual information
describing any asserted Tax liability in reasonable detail and shall include
copies of any notice or other document received from any Tax Authority in
respect of any such asserted Tax liability. If Parent or any Seller fails to
give the other party prompt notice of an asserted Tax liability as required
under this Agreement, if such failure to give prompt notice results in a
detriment to the Tax Indemnitor, then any amount which the Tax Indemnitor is
otherwise required to pay pursuant to this Section 6.11 with respect to such
liability shall be reduced by the amount of such detriment.   (ii) Control
of Contests Involving Pre-Closing Periods or Straddle  Periods. In the case
of an audit or administrative or judicial proceeding  involving any asserted
liability for Taxes relating to any taxable years or  periods ending on or
before the Closing Date or any Straddle Period, the  Sellers shall have the
right, at their expense, to control the conduct of  such audit or proceeding;
provided, however, that Parent may participate in  the conduct of such audit
or proceeding at its own expense and the Sellers  shall not settle any such
audit or proceeding without the consent of  Parent, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld or delayed.   (iii) Control of Contests Involving
Post-Closing Periods. In the case  of an audit or administrative or judicial
proceeding involving any asserted  liability for Taxes relating to any
taxable years or periods beginning on  or after the Closing Date, Parent
shall have the right, at its expense, to  control the conduct of such audit
or proceeding; provided, however, that if  such audit or proceeding would be
reasonably expected to result in a  material increase in Tax liability of the
Company for which the Sellers  would be liable under this Section 6.11, the
Sellers may participate in the  conduct of such audit or proceeding at their
own expense and Parent shall  not settle any such audit or proceeding without
the consent of the Sellers,  which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld.     -45-    6.12 Maintenance of Insurance. The Sellers shall
cause the Company to continue to carry its existing insurance through the
Closing Date, and shall not allow any breach, default, termination or
cancellation of such insurance policies or agreements to occur or exist.

Date, each Seller shall, and shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to,
use their best efforts to cause the Company\'s accounts receivable to qualify

related documentation in respect of which Purchaser and its Subsidiaries are

after the date hereof until the Closing Date, each Seller shall cause each

claim for indemnification under this Agreement or any Related Agreement, the
Indemnified Person shall promptly give notice to the Indemnifying Person of
such claim and the amount the Indemnified Person will be entitled to receive
hereunder from the Indemnifying Person; provided that the failure of the
Indemnified Person to give notice shall not relieve the Indemnifying Person
of its obligations under this Article XII except to the extent (if any) that
the Indemnifying Person shall have been prejudiced thereby. If the
Indemnifying Person does not object in writing to such indemnification claim
within 30 calendar days of receiving notice thereof, the Indemnified Person

of such claim (but such recovery shall not limit the amount of any additional
indemnification to which the Indemnified Person may be entitled pursuant to
Section 12.2 or Section 12.3), and no later objection by the Indemnifying
Person shall be permitted. If the Indemnifying Person agrees that it has an

recover promptly from the Indemnifying Person the lesser amount, without
prejudice to the Indemnified Person\'s claim for the difference.   (b) The
liability of the Sellers and Purchaser under this Article XII shall be
reduced by an amount equal to (i) the value of any net Tax benefit realized
by the Indemnified Person (by reason of a Tax deduction, basis adjustment,
shifting of income, credits and/or deductions, or otherwise from one or more
fiscal periods to another resulting, in each case, from any Loss suffered by
the Indemnified Person that forms the basis of the Indemnifying Person\'s
obligation hereunder), giving effect to any Tax liabilities of
the Indemnified Person arising as a result of any payments made by an
Indemnifying Person with respect to such claim for indemnification; and (ii)
the value of insurance benefit realized by the Indemnified Person in
connection with any Loss suffered by such Person that forms the basis of the
Indemnifying Person\'s obligation hereunder.   12.5 Notice of Third Party
Claims; Assumption of Defense. The Indemnified Person shall give written
notice as promptly as is reasonably practicable to the Indemnifying Person of
the assertion of any claim, or the commencement of any suit, action or
proceeding, by any Person not a party hereto in respect of which indemnity
may be sought under this Agreement; provided that the failure of the
Indemnified Person to give notice shall not relieve the Indemnifying Person
of its obligations under this Article XII except to the extent (if any) that
the Indemnifying Person shall have been prejudiced thereby. The Indemnifying
Person may, at its own expense: (a) participate in the defense of any claim,
suit, action or proceeding; and (b) upon notice to the Indemnified Person and
the Indemnifying Person\'s delivering to the Indemnified Person a written
agreement that the Indemnified Person is entitled to indemnification pursuant
to Section 12.2 or Section 12.3 for all Losses arising out of such claim,
suit, action or proceeding and that the Indemnifying Person shall be liable
for the entire amount of any Loss, at any time during the course of any such
claim, suit, action or proceeding, assume the defense thereof;
provided, however, that: (i) the Indemnifying Person\'s counsel is
rea-     -54-   sonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person, and
(ii) the Indemnifying Person shall thereafter consult with the Indemnified
Person upon the Indemnified Person\'s reasonable request for such
consultation from time to time with respect to such claim, suit, action or
proceeding. If the Indemnifying Person assumes such defense, the Indemnified
Person shall have the right (but not the duty) to participate in the defense
thereof and to employ counsel, at its own expense, separate from the counsel
employed by the Indemnifying Person. If, however, the Indemnified Person
reasonably determines in its judgment that representation by the Indemnifying
Person\'s counsel of both the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person
would present such counsel with a conflict of interest or if the Indemnifying
Person\'s counsel is otherwise not reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified
Person, then such Indemnified Person may employ separate counsel to represent
or defend it in any such claim, action, suit or proceeding and
the Indemnifying Person shall pay the fees and disbursements of such
separate counsel. Whether or not the Indemnifying Person chooses to defend or
prosecute any such claim, suit, action or proceeding, all of the parties
hereto shall cooperate in the defense or prosecution thereof.   12.6
Settlement or Compromise. The Indemnifying Person may settle or compromise
any claim, suit, action or proceeding of the kind referred to in Section
12.5; provided, however, that no obligation, restriction or Loss shall be
imposed on the Indemnified Person as a result of such settlement without
its prior written consent. The Indemnified Person will give the Indemnifying
Person at least 30 days\' notice of any proposed settlement or compromise of
any claim, suit, action or proceeding it is defending, during which time the
Indemnifying Person may reject such proposed settlement or compromise;
provided, however, that from and after such rejection, the Indemnifying
Person shall be obligated to assume the defense of and full and complete
liability and responsibility for such claim, suit, action or proceeding and
any and all Losses in connection therewith in excess of the amount of
unindemnifiable Losses which the Indemnified Person would have been obligated
to pay under the proposed settlement or compromise.   12.7 Failure of
Indemnifying Person to Act. In the event that the Indemnifying Person does
not elect to assume the defense of any claim, suit, action or proceeding,
then any failure of the Indemnified Person to defend or to participate in the
defense of any such claim, suit, action or proceeding or to cause the same to
be done, shall not relieve the Indemnifying Person of its obligations.  
12.8 Limitations on Indemnification.   (a) The Sellers shall have no
obligation to indemnify any Purchaser Indemnified Party from and against any
Losses until the aggregate Losses suffered by all Purchaser Indemnified
Parties exceed $100,000, at which time the Sellers shall be liable to the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties for the entire amount of all aggregate Losses
suffered by all Purchaser Indemnified Parties. The foregoing limitation shall
not apply to any Losses suffered by the Purchaser Indemnified Parties with
respect to Taxes or the termination of the Buchanan Agreement to the extent
it exceeds the amounts set forth in Section 4.6(b) or the Detrex
Claim.     -55-    (b) No claim for indemnification (other than any
amounts with respect to Taxes or the Campbell Sales Commissions or the
Manufacturers Agreement or the termination of the Buchanan Agreement or the
termination of Harold Russell) under this Agreement may be brought after the
second anniversary of this Agreement. There shall be no time limit on claims
hereunder with respect to the Campbell Sales Commissions, the Manufacturers
Agreement or the Buchanan Agreement or the Detrex Claim. Any claim for
indemnification with respect to Taxes may only be made prior to the
expiration of the related statute of limitations.   (c) In no event shall
the aggregate liability of the Sellers (excluding any liability with respect
to Taxes, the termination of the Buchanan Agreement, the Campbell Sales
Commissions or the Manufacturers Agreement or the Detrex Claim) to Parent and
Purchaser arising under this Article XII exceed $25,000,000.   12.9
Satisfaction of Sellers\' Indemnification Obligations. At the option of the
Sellers, any amount owing by the Sellers to any Purchaser Indemnified Party
arising from or relating to this Agreement may be satisfied by delivering to
such Purchaser Indemnified Party shares of Common Stock valued at the lesser
of (i) the average per share closing price over the ten business
days immediately preceding the date on which such shares are delivered
in satisfaction of such claim, and (ii) a price per share yielding an
annual compounded rate of return of 30% measured from the date of this
Agreement to the date on which such shares are delivered in satisfaction of
such claim; provided, however, that in no event shall such value be less than
$5 per share, in each case as adjusted to give effect to the increase or
decrease in the number of shares as a result of a stock split or stock
dividend or similar event applying equally to all securities of that
class.   12.10....Assignment of Claims. The parties agree that on
satisfaction of the applicable obligation of the Indemnifying Person to
indemnify, the Indemnified Person will assign to the Indemnifying Person any
and all claims, causes of action and demands of whatever kind and nature
which the Indemnified Person may have against any person, firm or other
entity giving rise to the indemnified Loss, and will reasonably cooperate in
any efforts to recover from such person or entity.   12.11....Exclusive
Remedies. Other than equitable remedies which may be available for breaches
of covenants or claims of fraud, this Article XII provides the exclusive
remedy for any misrepresentation, breach of warranty, covenant or other claim
arising out of this Agreement or the transaction contemplated by it. Each
party shall use reasonable efforts to mitigate any Losses.   ARTICLE
XIII   MISCEllANEOUS   13.1 Expenses. Each party hereto shall bear its own
costs and expenses (including the fees and disbursements of legal counsel,
investment bankers and accountants) with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby; provided, however, that the Company shall pay up to
$250,000 of the fees and expenses of the Sellers relating to the HSR filing
fee of Becker and the reasonably documented attorneys\' and accountants\'
fees of the Sellers. The Sellers shall pay all sales, use, stamp,    
-56-   transfer, service, recording, real estate and like taxes or fees, if
any, imposed by any Governmental Authority in connection with the transfer
and assignment of the Shares and the Membership Interests.   13.2
Amendment. This Agreement may be amended, modified or supplemented only by a
written instrument signed by Parent, Purchaser, the Company and
the Sellers.   13.3 Notices. Any notice, request, instruction or other
document to be given hereunder by a party hereto shall be in writing and

hereto may designate for itself by notice given as herein provided.   13.4
Waivers. The failure of a party hereto at any time or times to require
performance of any provision hereof shall in no manner affect its right at a
later time to enforce the same. No waiver by a party of any condition or
of any breach of any term, covenant, representation or warranty contained in
this Agreement shall be effective unless in writing, and no waiver in any one
or more instances shall be deemed to be a further or continuing waiver of any
such condition or breach in other instances or a waiver of any other
condition or breach of any other term, covenant, representation or
warranty.   13.5 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which
together shall constitute one and the same instrument.   13.6 Headings. The
headings preceding the text of articles and sections included in this
Agreement and the headings to schedules attached to this Agreement are for
convenience only and shall not be deemed part of this Agreement or be given
any effect in interpreting this Agreement.   13.7 Interpretation. Unless
otherwise indicated, words describing the singular number shall include the
plural and vice versa, and words denoting each gender shall include the other
gender and words denoting natural persons shall include corporations and
partnerships and vice versa. The use of the terms "including" or "included"
shall in all cases herein mean "including, without limitation" or "include,
without limitation," respectively. Unless otherwise indicated, references to
articles, sections, subsections or schedules shall refer to those portions of
this Agreement. Subject to the limitations set forth in Section 12.1,
consummation of the transactions contemplated herein shall not be deemed a
waiver of a breach of or inaccuracy in any representation, warranty or
covenant or of any party\'s rights and remedies with regard thereto.
No specific representation, warranty or covenant contained herein shall limit
the generality or applicability of a more general representation, warranty
or covenant contained herein. A breach of or inaccuracy in any
representation, warranty or covenant shall not be affected by the fact that
any more general or less general representation, warranty or covenant was not
also breached or inaccurate.   13.8 Applicable Law. The validity,
construction and effect of this Agreement shall be governed by and construed
and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without
giving effect to the principles of conflicts of law of such State.   13.9
Jurisdiction. Any suit, action or proceeding seeking to enforce any provision
of, or based on any matter arising out of or in connection with, this
Agreement or the Related Agreements shall be brought in the United
States District Court for Delaware, and each of the parties hereby consents
to the jurisdiction of such courts (and of the appropriate appellate courts
therefrom) in any such suit, action or proceeding and irrevocably waives, to
the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection that it may now or
hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such suit, action or
proceeding in any such court or that any such suit, action or proceeding
brought in any such court has     -58-   been brought in an
inconvenient forum. Process in any such suit, action or proceeding may be
served on any party anywhere in the world, whether within or without the
jurisdiction of any such court. Without limiting the foregoing, each party
agrees that service of process on such party as provided in Section
13.3 shall be deemed effective service of process on such party.   13.10
Assignment. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of
the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns; provided,
however, that no assignment of any rights or obligations shall be made by any
Seller without the written consent of Purchaser, or by Parent or Purchaser
without the written consent of each Seller, except that Parent or Purchaser
may assign its rights hereunder without such consent to any Affiliate of
Parent.   13.11 No Third Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement is solely for
the benefit of the parties hereto and, to the extent provided herein,
their respective Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, members,
managers, agents and representatives, and no provision of this Agreement
shall be deemed to confer upon other third parties any remedy, claim,
liability, reimbursement, cause of action or other right.   13.12 Further
Assurances. Upon the reasonable request of Purchaser, each Seller shall on
and after the Closing Date execute and deliver to Purchaser such other
documents, releases, assignments and other instruments as may be required to
effectuate completely the transfer and assignment to Purchaser of, and
to vest fully in Purchaser title in and to, the Membership Interests, and
to otherwise carry out the purposes of this Agreement.   13.13
Severability. If any provision of this Agreement shall be held invalid,
illegal or unenforceable, the validity, legality or enforceability of the
other provisions shall not be affected thereby, and there shall be
deemed substituted for the provision at issue a valid, legal and enforceable
provision as similar as possible to the provision at issue.   13.14 Entire
Understanding. This Agreement, together with the exhibits and schedules
hereto and the Related Agreements, set forth the entire agreement and
understanding of the parties hereto and supersede any and all
prior agreements, arrangements and understandings among the parties
