and accountants of Purchaser regarding questions concerning Purchaser\'s

previously provided by Seller and its Affiliates to the Companies and the
Company Subsidiaries for the period from the Balance Sheet Date through the
Closing Date and any necessary supporting information reasonably requested.

   

 1. Unless Seller provides specific written notice to Purchaser of an objection to any aspect of the Preliminary Adjustment Report before the close of business on the thirtieth day after Seller\'s receipt thereof, the Preliminary Adjustment Report shall then become binding upon Purchaser and Seller, and shall be the "Final Adjustment Report", and such day shall be the "Final Adjustment Report Date". If Seller, by written notice to Purchaser before the close of business on such thirtieth day specifying the items and amount in dispute (an "Objection Notice"), objects to any aspect of the Preliminary Adjustment Report, then those aspects as to which the objection was made shall not become binding, Purchaser and Seller shall discuss such objection in good faith; and, if they reach written agreement with respect to all items in dispute amending the Preliminary Adjustment Report, the Preliminary Adjustment Report, as amended by such written agreement, shall become binding upon Purchaser and Seller, and shall be the "Final Adjustment Report", and the date of such written agreement shall be the "Final Adjustment Report Date". If Purchaser and Seller do not reach such written agreement within twenty (20) days after Seller gives such notice of objection, those aspects as to which such objection was made, and which has not been resolved, shall be submitted jointly by Purchaser and Seller for arbitration by an independent accounting firm of nationally recognized standing acceptable to Seller and Purchaser (the "Accounting Firm") (whose fees shall be paid equally by Purchaser and Seller), which shall arbitrate the dispute and submit a written statement of its adjudication, which statement, when delivered to Purchaser and to Seller, shall become final and binding upon Purchaser and Seller, and shall, together with those aspects of the Preliminary Adjustment Report as to which no objection was made, be the "Final Adjustment Report". In such case, the second Business Day after the date on which such statement is delivered to Purchaser and to Seller shall be the "Final Adjustment Report Date". The scope of the disputes to be resolved by the Accounting Firm is limited to whether the amounts set forth on the line items on the Closing Balance Sheet used to calculate the Preliminary Purchase Price were obtained from and in accordance with the books and records of the Companies, the Company Subsidiaries, Newco, Holdco, Interco and the Canadian Parks Business and are in accordance with GAAP, applied on a basis consistent with prior periods, and as applied to prepare the Balance Sheet, including normal fiscal year end closing adjustments, and whether there were mathematical errors in the Preliminary Adjustment Report, in each case, to the extent related to the unresolved items set forth in the Objection Notice, and the Accounting Firm is not to make any other determination. The determination of the Accounting Firm shall constitute an arbitral award that is final, binding and unappealable and upon which a judgment may be entered by any court having jurisdiction thereof. In acting hereunder, the Accounting Firm shall be entitled to the privileges and immunities of arbitrators.
 

 2. If Seller delivers an Objection Notice and Purchaser and Seller do not reach written agreement with respect to all items in dispute within twenty (20) days after Seller gives an Objection Notice, then within two Business Days after the expiration of such twenty-day period, (i) Purchaser shall pay to Seller the excess, if any, of (x) the lesser of (1) the Preliminary Purchase Price stated in the Preliminary Adjustment Report or (2) the Purchase Price calculated as if all of the items as to which Seller objected in the Objection Notice and as to which such objections remain unresolved were resolved in Seller\'s favor (the "Unresolved Objection Purchase Price") over (y) the Estimated Purchase Price (a "Purchaser Interim Payment"), and (ii) Seller shall pay to Purchaser the excess, if any, of (x) the Estimated Purchase Price over (y) the greater of (1) the Preliminary Purchase Price stated in the Preliminary Adjustment Report or (2) the Unresolved Objection Purchase Price (a "Seller Interim Payment").
 

 3. Within two Business Days after the Final Adjustment Report Date, Purchaser shall pay to Seller the excess, if any, of (i) the Purchase Price stated in the Final Adjustment Report under such Section, minus any Purchaser Interim Payment or plus any Seller Interim Payment over (ii) the Estimated Purchase Price, and Seller shall pay to Purchaser the excess if any, of (x) the Estimated Purchase Price plus any Purchaser Interim Payment or minus any Seller Interim Payment over (y) the Purchase Price stated in the Final Adjustment Report. To the extent such a payment relates to the Canadian Parks Business, the payment will be deemed to be made by Seller or Purchaser, as the case may be, as agent for and on behalf of CBS Canada (in the case of Seller) or Newco (in the case of Purchaser). 
 

 4. Any payment required to be made by Seller or Purchaser pursuant to Section 2.3(c) or 2.3(d) that does not already provide for interest from the Closing Date shall bear interest from the Closing Date to (but excluding) the date of such payment at the Applicable Rate as in effect from time to time and shall be made in immediately available funds to an account designated by recipient.

Liabilities, and there are no Liabilities with respect to the Canadian Parks
Business, of a nature required by GAAP to be reflected in a consolidated

Date or that would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect.

 

 9. _Absence of Certain Changes or Events
 _

. Since the Balance Sheet Date, except as contemplated by this Agreement, the
business of the Companies and the Company Subsidiaries and the Canadian Parks
Business has been conducted in the ordinary course and, since such date, there
has not been (a) any change, event or occurrence which has had or would
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect or (b) any action or
event that, if it had occurred after the date of this Agreement, would have
required the consent of Parent under Section 5.1.

 9. any agreement relating to capital expenditures by the Companies, any Company Subsidiary or CBS Canada (but only with respect to the Canadian Parks Business), providing for the payment of an aggregate amount of more than $500,000 in any fiscal year and not cancelable upon notice without penalty or consent within one hundred eighty (180) days; or
 

 10. any contract that would be required to be filed by Paramount Parks as a "material contract" pursuant to Item 601(b)(10) or Regulation S-K under the federal securities laws were Paramount Parks a reporting company under the Exchange Act.

Business, as the case may be. The Companies, the Company Subsidiaries and the
Canadian Parks Business have all permits, licenses, authorizations,
exemptions, orders, consents, approvals and franchises from Governmental
Authorities required to conduct their respective businesses and the Canadian
Parks Business as now being conducted, except for any such permit, license,

The certificate of incorporation and by-laws or other constituent documents of the Companies, the Company Subsidiaries, Interco, Holdco and Newco shall continue to contain provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of former or present directors, officers and employees than are presently set forth in the applicable company\'s certificate of incorporation and by-laws, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six years from the Closing Date in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any such individuals.

 3. This covenant is intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Directors and Officers and their respective heirs and legal representatives.

records (or copies thereof at Seller\'s expense) to the Seller or its agents,

regulations of any applicable United States securities exchange, in which case
the party required to make the release or announcement shall use its
reasonable best efforts to allow each other party reasonable time to comment
on such release or announcement in advance of such issuance, it being

Canadian income tax purposes.

The party afforded access shall bear all of the out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including attorneys\' fees, but excluding reimbursement for general overhead, salaries and employee benefits) reasonably incurred in connection with the foregoing. No party shall be required to provide access to or to disclose information where such access or disclosure would jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of such party or contravene any Law or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement (it being agreed that the parties shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause such information to be provided in a manner that does not cause such violation or jeopardization).
  

 11. _Letters of Credit
 _

. Purchaser shall replace, within 60 days of the Closing Date, each
outstanding letter of credit issued for the benefit of the Companies, the
Company Subsidiaries, Interco, Holdco or Newco or the Canadian Parks Business

credit reasonably satisfactory to the beneficiary thereof, and cause such
beneficiary to return the original letters of credit to Seller or the relevant
Affiliate of Seller (other than the Companies, the Company Subsidiaries,
Interco, Holdco or Newco); _provided_ that in the event Purchaser is unable to
replace any letter of credit referred to above by such time, Purchaser (i)
shall unconditionally reimburse Seller or the relevant Affiliate of Seller for
any payments required to be made by Seller or any Affiliate of Seller in
relation to any drawing of such letter of credit and any fees incurred to the
issuer of such letter of credit and (ii) continue to use its reasonable best
efforts to replace such letters of credit as soon as practicable.

extent Seller shall have received written notice of claims relating to such

events occurring prior to the Closing Date to the extent Seller shall have
received written notice of claims relating to such events on or before the

For a period of two years from the Closing Date, CBS and Seller shall not and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries not to (i) solicit, entice, persuade or induce any of the senior employees of any of the Companies, Company Subsidiaries or the Canadian Parks Business whose aggregate annual compensation is in excess of $75,000 to terminate his or her employment; (ii) solicit the employment of any such individual; or (iii) hire or engage, as an officer, employee, consultant, independent contractor or otherwise, any such individual, in each case without the prior written consent of Purchaser.

 2. The length of time for which any covenant contained in Sections 5.15(a) and (b) shall be in force shall not include any period of violation or any other period required for litigation during which Purchaser seeks to enforce such covenant. In the event that any such covenant shall be determined by any court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable by reason of its extending for too long a period of time or over too large a geographical area or by reason of its being too extensive in any other respect, it shall be interpreted to extend only over the longest period of time for which it may be enforceable, and/or over the largest geographical area as to which it may be enforceable and/or to the maximum extent in all other respects as to which it may be enforceable, all as determined by such court in such action.
 

 3. The covenants contained in Section 5.15(a) and (b) are each covenants independent of any other provision of this Agreement, and the existence of any claim which any party may allege against any other party to this Agreement, whether based on this Agreement or otherwise, shall not prevent the enforcement of these covenants. CBS and Seller acknowledge that Purchaser is purchasing the Paramount Parks Shares in reliance on the goodwill of the Business and the covenants contained in Section 5.15(a) and (b) are essential to the protection of Purchaser\'s purchase and that Purchaser would not purchase the Paramount Parks Shares but for these covenants. CBS and Seller (i) acknowledge and agree that the monetary damages for any material breach of Section 5.15(a) and (b) would be inadequate, and (ii) agree and consent that without intending to limit any additional remedies that may be available, temporary and permanent injunctive and other equitable relief may be granted in any Action that may be brought to enforce any of the provisions of Section 5.15(a) and (b).
  

 16. _No Solicitation or Negotiation

the Closing or (b) the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.1
hereof, Seller shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates and its and its
Affiliates\' respective directors, officers and employees not to, and shall
use reasonable best efforts to cause its representatives not to, directly or
indirectly (i) solicit, initiate, consider, encourage or accept any other
proposals or offers from any Person (A) relating to any acquisition or
purchase of all or any portion of the Paramount Parks Shares or material
assets of the Companies, the Company Subsidiaries and the Canadian Parks
Business, as a whole or (B) enter into any business combination with any of
the Companies, the Company Subsidiaries or CBS Canada (with respect to the
Canadian Parks Business) or (ii) participate in any discussions, negotiations
and other communications, regarding or furnish to any other Person any
information with respect to, or otherwise cooperate in any way, assist or
participate in, facilitate or encourage any effort or attempt by any other
Person to seek to do any of the foregoing. Seller immediately shall cease and
cause to be terminated all existing discussions, conversations, negotiations
and other communications with any Persons conducted heretofore with respect to
any of the foregoing. Seller shall notify Purchaser promptly if any such
proposal or offer, or any inquiry or other contact with any Person with
respect thereto, is made. Seller agrees not to, and to cause CBS not to,
without the prior written consent of Parent, release any Person from, or waive
any provision of, any confidentiality agreement to which Seller or CBS is a
party.

The Purchaser or the Companies or the Company Subsidiaries, as applicable, shall indemnify and hold the Seller and its respective Affiliates harmless from any and all damages incurred by the Seller or any of its Affiliates as a result of the failure of the Purchaser or the Companies or the Company Subsidiaries, as applicable, to comply with the requirements of COBRA where such requirement arises on or after the Closing Date, including applicable notice requirements. The Seller shall indemnify and hold the Purchaser, the Company, the Company Subsidiaries and their respective Affiliates harmless from any and all damages incurred by any of them as a result of the failure of the Seller, the Company or the Company Subsidiaries, as applicable, to comply with the requirements of COBRA with respect to COBRA qualifying events that occur before the Closing Date, including applicable notice requirements.

 2. in the case of Taxes not described in (i) above (such as franchise Taxes, Taxes that are based upon or related to income or receipts, based upon occupancy or imposed in connection with any sale or other transfer or assignment of property (real or personal, tangible or intangible)), the amount of any such Taxes shall be determined as if such taxable period ended as of the close of business on the Closing Date.

7.6. Within a reasonable time prior to the payment of any such Taxes, the
indemnified party paying such Taxes shall give written notice to the
indemnifying party of the Taxes payable and the amount which is the liability
of each party, although failure to do so will not relieve the indemnifying
party of its liability hereunder except to the extent the indemnifying party
is actually prejudiced as a result of such failure. Subject to the delivery of
prior written notice of the payment of any such Taxes, the party required to
provide reimbursement hereunder shall pay such amount by the latest to occur
of (i) the date payment is made by the party paying such Taxes, (ii) fifteen
Business Days after receipt of such prior written notice, and (iii) 10 days
prior to the due date for payment of such Taxes; _provided_ , _however_ , if

The representations and warranties of Parent and Purchaser set forth in this Agreement shall be true and correct in all material respects, in each case as of the Closing Date as though made on and as of such date (unless any such representation or warranty is made only as of a specific date, in which event such representation and warranty shall be true and correct in all material respects as of such specified date);
 

 2. Each of Parent and Purchaser shall have performed in all material respects the material obligations, and complied in all material respects with the material agreements and covenants, required to be performed by or complied with by it under this Agreement at or prior to the Closing Date; and

 INDEMNIFICATION

     

 1. _Survival of Representations, Warranties and Covenants
 _

. The representations and warranties contained in this Agreement shall expire
on December 31, 2007; _provided_ , _however_ , that (a) the representations
and warranties contained in Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.5, 3.20, 3.21(a) (first
sentence only), 3.22, 4.1, 4.2 and 4.7 shall survive indefinitely, (b) the
representations and warranties contained in Section 3.17 shall expire on the
third anniversary of the Closing Date, and (c) the representations and
warranties contained in Section 3.13 shall survive until the date that is 60
days following the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations. If
written notice of a claim has been given in accordance with Section 9.2(c)
prior to the expiration of the applicable representations and warranties, then
the relevant representations and warranties shall survive as to such claim,
until such claim has been finally resolved. Any written claim by Parent or
Purchaser with respect to a breach of any covenant or other agreement made by
the Seller in this Agreement to be performed at or prior to the Closing may be
given at any time prior to the day that is three months following the Closing
Date. All other covenants shall survive the Closing and survive indefinitely,
except those that by their terms expire earlier.

 

 2. _Indemnification
  

  _

. Purchaser and its Affiliates, officers, directors, employees, agents,
successors and assigns shall be indemnified and held harmless by Seller for
any and all Liabilities, Taxes (solely with respect to Section 3.18), losses,
damages, claims, costs and expenses, interest, awards, judgments and penalties
(including, reasonable attorneys\' fees and expenses) actually suffered or
incurred by them (hereinafter a "Loss"), arising out of or resulting from:

 

      

 1. the breach of any representation or warranty made by Seller in this Agreement; 
 

 2. the breach of any covenant or agreement by Sellers contained in this Agreement which is to be performed prior to the Closing; or
 

 3. any of the Actions set forth in Section 9.2(a)(iii) of the Seller Disclosure Letter (the "Assumed Litigation") (each of which shall be treated as a Third Party Claim for purposes of Article IX (other than Section 9.3)).
   

  

The foregoing provisions of this Section 9.2(a) shall not apply with respect
to any Losses arising out of (and no indemnification hereunder shall be
available with respect to) any breach of any representation or warranty of
Sellers that is terminated as provided in Section 9.1.

 

    

 1. Seller and its Affiliates, officers, directors, employees, agents, successors and assigns shall be indemnified and held harmless by Purchaser for any and all Losses arising out of or resulting from:
  

        

 1. the breach of any representation or warranty made by Purchaser in this Agreement; 
 

 2. the breach of any covenant or agreement by Purchaser contained in this Agreement which is to be performed prior to the Closing; or
 

 3. the Liabilities of the Companies and the Company Subsidiaries, except to the extent that they arise from a matter for which indemnification is due under Section 9.2(a).
   

  

The foregoing provisions of this Section 9.2(b) shall not apply with respect
to any Losses arising out of (and no indemnification hereunder shall be
available with respect to) any breach of any representation or warranty of
Purchaser that is terminated as provided in Section 9.1.

 

    

 1. Any party seeking indemnification under this Section 9.2 (an "Indemnified Party") shall promptly give the party from whom indemnification is being sought (an "Indemnifying Party") notice (a "Claim Notice") of any matter which such Indemnified Party has determined has given or could reasonably be expected to give rise to a right of indemnification under this Agreement, within 60 days of such determination, stating in reasonable detail, the nature of the claim, a good-faith reasonable estimate of the Loss and method of computation thereof (to the extent practicable), and containing a reference to the provisions of this Agreement in respect of which such right of indemnification is claimed or arises; _provided_ , _however_ , that the failure to provide such notice shall not release the Indemnifying Party from any of its obligations under Section 9.2 except to the extent the Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced by such failure. With respect to any recovery or indemnification sought by an Indemnified Party from the Indemnifying Party that does not involve a Third-Party Claim (as defined below), if the Indemnifying Party does not notify the Indemnified Party within 30 days from its receipt of the Claim Notice that the Indemnifying Party disputes such claim (the "Dispute Notice"), the Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to have accepted and agreed with such claim. If the Indemnifying Party has disputed a claim for indemnification (including any Third-Party Claim), the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall proceed in good faith to negotiate a resolution to such dispute. If the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party cannot resolve such dispute in 30 days after delivery of the Dispute Notice, such dispute shall be resolved by litigation in an appropriate court of law.
 

 2. The obligations and Liabilities of an Indemnifying Party under Section 9.2 with respect to Losses arising from claims of any third party which are subject to the indemnification provided for in Section 9.2 ("Third Party Claims") shall be governed by and contingent upon the following additional terms and conditions: if an Indemnified Party shall receive notice of any Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall give the Indemnifying Party notice of such Third Party Claim within 30 days of the receipt by the Indemnified Party of such notice and a copy of the papers served with respect to such claim (if any); _provided_ , _however_ , that the failure to provide such notice shall not release the Indemnifying Party from any of its obligations under Section 9.2 except to the extent the Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced by such failure. If the Indemnifying Party acknowledges in writing its obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party hereunder against any Losses that may result from such Third Party Claim, then the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to assume and control the defense of such Third Party Claim at its expense and through counsel of its choice reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party if it gives notice of its intention to do so to the Indemnified Party within twenty Business Days of the receipt of such notice from the Indemnified Party; _provided_ , _however_ , the Indemnified Party may, at its sole cost and expense, participate in the defense of such Third Party Claim, it being understood that the Indemnifying Party shall control such defense; _provided_ , _further_ , that if counsel to the Indemnified Party advises such Indemnified Party in writing that the Third Party Claim involves a conflict of interest (other than one of a monetary nature) that would make it inappropriate for the same counsel to represent both the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party, then the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to retain its own counsel at the cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party (except that the Indemnifying Party shall not be obligated to pay the fees and expenses of more than one separate counsel for all Indemnified Parties, taken together). In the event the Indemnifying Party exercises the right to undertake any such defense against any such Third Party Claim as provided above, it will keep the Indemnified Party reasonably informed of progress of the defense of such Third Party Claim, and the Indemnified Party shall cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in such defense and make available to the Indemnifying Party, all witnesses, pertinent records, materials and information in the Indemnified Party\'s possession or under the Indemnified Party\'s control relating thereto as is reasonably required by the Indemnifying Party. Similarly, in the event the Indemnified Party is, directly or indirectly, conducting the defense against any such Third Party Claim, it will keep the Indemnifying Party reasonably informed of progress of the defense of such Third Party Claim, and the Indemnifying Party shall cooperate with the Indemnified Party in such defense and make available to the Indemnified Party, all such witnesses, records, materials and information in the Indemnifying Party\'s possession or under the Indemnifying Party\'s control relating thereto as is reasonably required by the Indemnified Party. The rights of any Indemnifying Party shall be subrogated to any right of action (including indemnification, cross-claims and counterclaims) that the Indemnified Party may have against any other Person with respect to any matter giving rise to a claim for indemnification hereunder. The Indemnifying Party shall not, without the written consent of the Indemnified Party, (i) settle or compromise any Third Party Claim or consent to the entry of any judgment which does not include as an unconditional term thereof the delivery by the claimant or plaintiff to the Indemnified Party of a written release from all liability in respect of such Third Party Claim or (ii) settle or compromise any Third Party Claim in any manner that may adversely affect the Indemnified Party other than as a result of money damages or other money payments. Without limiting the foregoing, the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any amount required to be paid by the Indemnified Party that exceeds, where the Indemnified Party has unreasonably withheld or delayed consent in connection with the proposed compromise or settlement of a Third Party Claim, the amount for which that Third Party Claim could have been settled pursuant to that proposed compromise or settlement. No Third Party Claim which is being defended in good faith by the Indemnifying Party in accordance with the terms of this Agreement shall be settled by the Indemnified Party without the written consent of the Indemnifying Party. 
 

 3. To the extent that the Purchaser can pursue a claim for a Loss relating to Taxes under either Section 7.1 or Section 9.2 (as it relates to a breach of Section 3.18), the provisions of Article VII shall govern with respect to such claim.
  

       

 1. _Limits on Indemnification
 _

. No amount shall be payable by Seller pursuant to Section 9.2(a) for any
breach of any representation or warranty (other than any representation or
warranty in Section 3.2, 3.5, 3.20, 3.21(a) (first sentence only) or 3.22)
unless the aggregate amount of Losses indemnifiable under Section 9.2(a) for
breaches of representations or warranties exceeds one percent (1%) of the
Purchase Price (and only to the extent of such excess). No amount shall be
payable by Purchaser pursuant to Section 9.2(b) for any breach of any
representation or warranty (other than any representation or warranty in
Sections 4.2 or 4.7) unless the aggregate amount of Losses indemnifiable under
Section 9.2(b) for breaches of representations or warranties exceeds one
percent (1%) of the Purchase Price (and only to the extent of such excess).

   

 1. No amount shall be payable by an Indemnifying Party pursuant to Section 9.2 for any breach of any representation or warranty resulting in aggregate Losses of $50,000 or less with respect to any matter or series of related matters and such Losses shall not be included in calculating the threshold established in Section 9.3(a).
 

 2. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the maximum amount of aggregate indemnifiable Losses which may be recovered from Seller, on the one hand, or Purchaser, on the other hand, arising out of or resulting from the causes enumerated in Section 9.2 (excluding Section 9.2(b)(iii)) shall be an amount equal to twenty percent (20%) of the Purchase Price.
 

 3. No Indemnifying Party shall be liable for any indirect, consequential, special, multiple, exemplary or punitive damages or lost profits, diminution in value or any damages based on any type of multiple of any Indemnified Party, except in the event of fraud or willful misconduct.
 

 4. For purposes of determining the existence of, and calculating the amount of any losses arising out of or resulting from, any breach of a representation or warranty pursuant to Sections 9.2(a)(i) and 9.2(b)(i), the representations and warranties made by Seller or Purchaser in this Agreement, as applicable, shall be read without regard to any Material Adverse Effect or materiality qualifiers contained therein, except with respect to the representations and warranties made by Seller in Section 3.9.
  

 2. _Computation of Indemnifiable Losses
 _

. Any amount payable pursuant to this Article IX shall be decreased to the
extent of (i) any amounts actually recovered by the Indemnified Party from any
third party (including insurance proceeds) in respect of an indemnifiable
Loss, (ii) any net Tax benefit actually realized by the Indemnified Party
arising out of an indemnifiable Loss and (iii) any amounts that relate to such
Losses reflected in the Adjusted Working Capital Amount in the Final
Adjustment Report. The Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Parties shall
cooperate in good faith in providing each other the information necessary to
determine the Tax benefits, as the case may be, in each case. The Indemnified
Parties shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to pursue payment
under or from any insurer or third-party in respect of such Losses. Purchaser
shall not, and shall cause the Companies, the Company Subsidiaries, Interco,
Holdco and Newco not to, without the prior written consent of the Seller,
waive, release, compromise, reduce or otherwise amend in any way that would
limit coverage, any fully-paid insurance policies or coverage in effect at the
Closing that relate to Losses.

 

 3. _Access
 _

. From and after the delivery of a Claim Notice by any Indemnified Party, each
Indemnified Party shall grant the Indemnifying Party and its representatives
all reasonable access to the books, records, employees and properties of such
Indemnified Party (including the Companies, the Company Subsidiaries, Interco,
Holdco and Newco) related to the matters to which the claim relates (provided
that, as necessary to protect any attorney-client privilege, the parties shall
execute a joint defense agreement containing customary terms). All such access
shall be granted during normal business hours.

 

 4. _Mitigation of Damages
 _

. The parties hereto shall cooperate with each other to mitigate any Losses,
including maintaining insurance coverage with respect to the Companies, the
Company Subsidiaries, Interco, Holdco and Newco.

 

 5. _Indemnification as Exclusive Remedy
  

  _

. Except as expressly set forth in Section 5.15, the indemnification provided
in this Article IX, subject to the limitations set forth herein, shall be the
exclusive post-Closing remedy available to any party for any breach of any
representation, warranty or covenant by the other party contained herein and
no party shall pursue or seek to pursue any other remedy. Except as
specifically set forth in or arising under this Agreement, from and after the
Closing, the parties hereto waive any rights and claims that a party may have
against any other party, whether in law or in equity, relating to the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, including claims for contribution
or other rights of recovery arising out of or relating to any Environmental
Laws, claims for breach of contract, breach of representation or warranty,
negligent misrepresentation and all claims for breach of duty; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that nothing set forth in this Agreement shall limit the rights,
remedies and claims of any party hereto with respect to any fraud or willful
misconduct by any other party hereto.

may be abandoned at any time prior to the Closing Date:

be deemed to be an agreement by Seller that such items are "material" or to
further define the meaning of such term for purposes of this Agreement.
Disclosures included in any Section of the Seller Disclosure Letter shall be
considered to be made for purposes of all other Sections of the Seller
Disclosure Letter to the extent that the relevance of any such disclosure to
any other Section of the Seller Disclosure Letter is reasonably apparent from

 _

the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and

Action in any such court or that such Action in such court was brought in an
inconvenient court and agrees not to plead or claim the same. Each party
hereto hereby agrees that, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, service of
any process, summons, notice or document by U.S. registered mail to the
respective addresses set forth in Section 11.2 shall be effective service of
process for any suit or proceeding in connection with this Agreement or the

 9. _Counterparts

different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when executed

Newco3 will also establish a savings plan to cover the Canadian Parks Business employees from and after the closing date (which shall consist of a group registered retirement savings plan, an employee profit sharing plan and a deferred profit sharing plan) which is substantially similar to the savings plan provided to Canadian Parks Business employees immediately prior to the closing date.
