In such case, the second Business Day after the date on which such statement is delivered to Purchaser and to Seller shall be the &quot;<B>Final Adjustment Report Date</B>&quot;.  The scope of the disputes to be resolved by the Accounting Firm is limited to whether the amounts set forth on the line items on the Closing Balance Sheet used to calculate the Preliminary Purchase Price were obtained from and in accordance with the books and records of the Companies, the Company Subsidiaries, Newco, Holdco, Interco and the Canadian Parks Business and are in accordance with GAAP, applied on a basis consistent with prior periods, and as applied to prepare the Balance Sheet, including normal fiscal year end closing adjustments, and whether there were mathematical errors in the Preliminary Adjustment Report, in each case, to the extent related to the unresolved items set forth in the Objection Notice, and the Accounting Firm is not to make any other determination.

<LI>Section 3.7 of the Seller Disclosure Letter contains copies of the following financial statements of the Companies and the Canadian Parks Business (collectively, the &quot;<B>Financial Statements</B>&quot;):  (i) the audited combined balance sheet of the Companies, the Company Subsidiaries and the Canadian Parks Business (the &quot;<B>Balance Sheet</B>&quot;) as of December 31, 2005 (the &quot;<B>Balance Sheet Date</B>&quot;) and December 31, 2004 and the related statements of income and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ending December 31, 2005 (together with the notes thereto) and (ii) the unaudited balance sheet of the Companies, the Company Subsidiaries and the Canadian Parks Business as of March 31, 2006, and the related unaudited statement of income for the three month period then ended (the &quot;<B>Interim Financial Statements</B>&quot;).  The Financial Statements (x) present fairly in all material respects the combined financial condition and results of operations of the Companies, the Company Subsidiaries and the Canadian Parks Business as of the dates thereof or for the periods covered thereby (subject, in the case of the Interim Financial Statements, to normal year-end adjustments and the absence of full footnote disclosure) and (y) have been prepared in all material respects in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis for the periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto).  The Financial Statements have been prepared in all material respects in accordance with the books of account and other records of the Companies, the Company Subsidiaries and the Canadian Parks Business.  </LI>
<LI>All of the representations in (a) above are qualified by the fact that Paramount Parks is a wholly-owned Subsidiary of CBS.  As disclosed in Note 1 and Note 3 to the Financial Statements, Paramount Parks relies on CBS for certain general and administrative services and engages in related party transactions with CBS and certain companies affiliated with CBS.  The amounts recorded for these transactions are not necessarily representative of the amounts that would have been reflected in the Financial Statements had Paramount Parks been operated as a stand-alone company for the periods presented.  For purposes of the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement (other than Section 3.7(c) below), materiality standards and the application of GAAP shall be measured with respect to the Companies, the Company Subsidiaries and the Canadian Parks Business and not against CBS.</LI>
<LI>To Seller's Knowledge, the Companies, the Company Subsidiaries and CBS Canada (with respect to the Canadian Parks Business) maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances to CBS that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements of CBS in conformity with GAAP.</LI></OL>
