ARTICLE II

The Merger

2.01. The Merger.

(a)Subject to the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth, at the Effective

separate corporate existence of Valley Financial shall cease and Buyer shall
survive and continue to exist as a North Carolina corporation (Buyer, as the
surviving corporation in the Merger, sometimes being referred to herein as the
"Surviving Corporation"). Buyer may at any time prior to the Effective Time change the method of effecting the combination
with Valley Financial (including, without limitation, the provisions of this
Article II) if and to the extent it deems such change to be necessary,
appropriate or desirable; provided, that no such change shall (i) alter or
change the amount or kind of Merger Consideration, (ii) adversely affect the
tax-free treatment of the Merger to Valley Financial's stockholders as a
result of receiving the Merger Consideration, or (iii) materially impede or
delay consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and
provided further, that Buyer shall provide Valley Financial prior written
notice of such change and the reasons therefor.



(b)Subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in
Article VIII, the Merger shall become effective upon (i) (A) the filing with
the VSCC articles of merger in accordance with Section 13.1-720 of the VSCA,
and the issuance by the VSCC of a certificate of merger relating to the
Merger, and (B) the filing with the Secretary of State articles of merger in
accordance with the applicable sections of the North Carolina Business
Corporation Act (the "NCBCA"), and issuance by the Secretary of State of a
certificate of merger relating to the Merger, or (ii) effective upon such
later date and time as may be set forth in such articles of merger. The Merger
shall have the effects prescribed in the VSCA and the NCBCA.



(c)The Articles of Incorporation of Buyer, as in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time, shall be the Articles of Incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with applicable law.



2.02. Effective Date and Effective Time.



(a)Subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in
Article VIII, the parties shall cause the effective date of the Merger (the
"Effective Date") to occur on either (i) the fifth business day to occur after
the last of the conditions set forth in Article VIII shall have been satisfied
or waived in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the closing of the
Merger (or, at the election of Buyer, on the last business day of the month in
which such fifth business day occurs), or (ii) such other date to which the
parties may agree in writing. The time on the Effective Date when the Merger
shall become effective is referred to as the "Effective Time."



(b)Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary, if
Buyer shall exercise its right to delay the Effective Date pursuant to Section
2.02(a)(i), and a record date for any dividend or other distribution in
respect of the Buyer Common Stock is taken during the period of such delay
such that the Valley Financial stockholders will not be entitled to
participate in such dividend, each stockholder of Valley Financial shall be
entitled to receive, upon surrender of the Old Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares and compliance with the other provisions of Article IV, a payment equal
to the amount and kind of dividend or other distribution that such holder
would have received had such holder been a holder of record of the shares of
Buyer Common Stock issuable to such holder in the Merger on the record date
for such dividend or other distribution. 

2.03. Tax Consequences



It is intended that the Merger shall constitute a "reorganization" within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and that this Agreement shall
constitute a "plan of reorganization" for purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of
the Code.



ARTICLE III

The Bank Merger

3.01. The Bank Merger.

(a)After the Effective Time, Valley Bank, the wholly owned subsidiary of
Valley Financial, shall merge with and into Buyer Bank, a wholly owned
subsidiary of Buyer (the "Bank Merger"), pursuant to the terms and conditions
of the Bank Merger Agreement substantially in the form attached as Exhibit A.
The separate existence of Valley Bank shall cease and Buyer Bank shall survive
and continue to exist as a banking corporation chartered under the laws of
North Carolina. Buyer may at any time prior to the Effective Time change the
method of effecting the combination of Buyer Bank with Valley Bank (including,
without limitation, the provisions of this Article III) if and to the extent
it deems such changes necessary, appropriate or desirable; provided, however,
that Buyer shall provide Valley Financial with seven days prior written notice
of such change and the reasons therefore. Notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary, the Bank Merger shall not adversely affect the ability of the
Merger to qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a)
of the Code or materially impede or delay consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.



(b)Subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in
Article VIII, the Bank Merger shall become effective upon the filing with the
VSCC and the Secretary of State articles of merger in accordance with Section
13.1-720 of the VSCA and applicable sections of the NCBCA, and the issuance by
the VSCC and the Secretary of State of a certificate of merger relating to the
Bank Merger, or such later date and time as may be set forth in such articles
of merger. The Bank Merger shall have the effects prescribed in the VSCA and
NCBCA.



3.02. Effective Date and Effective Time

Subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article
VIII, it being agreed that any required consents, approvals, and
authorizations from any Governmental Authorities to effect the Bank Merger
shall not be a condition to the consummation of the Merger, the parties shall
use reasonable efforts to cause the effective date of the Bank Merger (the
"Bank Merger Effective Date") to occur as soon as reasonably practicable after
the Effective Date or such later date to which the parties may agree in
writing. ARTICLE IV

Consideration; Exchange Procedures

4.01. Merger Consideration

Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, at the Effective Time,
automatically by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of
any Person:



(a)Merger Consideration. Each holder of a share of Valley Financial Common
Stock (other than Buyer and its Subsidiaries, in each case except for shares
held by them in a fiduciary capacity or as a result of debts previously
contracted) shall receive in respect thereof, subject to the limitations set
forth in this Agreement, a number of shares (rounded to the nearest 1/1000th
of a share) of Buyer Common Stock based on the Buyer VWAP (the "Merger
Consideration"). In the event that the Buyer VWAP is:



(i) greater than $18.50, then the Merger Consideration shall equal 1.1081
shares of Buyer Common Stock;

(ii) equal to or less than $18.50 but greater than $14.25, then the Merger
Consideration shall equal $20.50 payable in shares of Buyer Common Stock (with
the exchange ratio for the Merger Consideration in such instance equal to
$20.50 divided by the Buyer VWAP); or

(iii) equal to or less than $14.25, then the Merger Consideration shall equal
1.4386 shares of Buyer Common Stock (such ratio in any of (i), (ii) or (iii),
the "Exchange Ratio").

(b)Stock Options. By virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part
of the holders of any outstanding option to purchase shares of Valley
Financial Common Stock (each, a "Valley Financial Stock Option"), whether
vested or unvested as of the date of this Agreement, under any and all plans
of Valley Financial under which stock options have been granted (collectively,
the "Valley Financial Stock Plans") shall be cancelled and the holder thereof
shall be paid in cash (without interest and less applicable taxes and
withholdings) an amount equal to the product of (a) the number of shares of
Valley Financial Common Stock subject to such Valley Financial Stock Option
times (b) the difference between (i) the imputed cash value per share of
Valley Financial Common Stock pursuant to the exchange and conversion
provisions of Section 4.01(a), as applicable (with shares of Buyer Common
Stock being valued based upon the closing price of such shares on the second
to last trading day prior to the Effective Date), and (ii) the exercise price
of each respective Valley Financial Stock Option. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, directors and employees of Valley Financial who continue in such
capacities with Buyer or Buyer Bank after the Effective Time shall have each
of their Valley Financial Stock Options converted into an option (each, a
"Replacement Option") to acquire, on the same terms and conditions as were
applicable under such Valley Financial Stock Option and at an exercise price
adjusted to account for the Exchange Ratio, the number of shares of Buyer
Common Stock equal to (a) the number of shares of Valley Financial Common Stock
subject to the Valley Financial Stock Option multiplied by (b) the Exchange
Ratio. For example, if a Valley Financial Stock Option provided for the
purchase of 100 shares at $10.00 per share of Valley Financial Common Stock,
assuming the Exchange Ratio is equal to 1.25, the Replacement Option would
provide for the purchase of 125 shares of Buyer Common Stock at $8.00 per
share.



(c)Outstanding Buyer Stock. Each share of Buyer Common Stock and Buyer Non-
Voting Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall remain issued and outstanding and unaffected by the Merger.



4.02. Rights as Stockholders; Stock Transfers

At the Effective Time, holders of Valley Financial Common Stock shall cease to
be, and shall have no rights as, stockholders of Valley Financial, other than
to receive the Merger Consideration (if so provided in Section 4.01 (a)) and
any dividend or other distribution with respect to such Valley Financial
Common Stock with a record date occurring prior to the Effective Time, the
payment, if any, in lieu of certain dividends on Buyer Common Stock provided
for in Section 2.02(b), and the consideration provided under this Article IV.
After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer
books of Valley Financial or the Surviving Corporation of shares of Valley
Financial Common Stock.



4.03. Fractional Shares



Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, no fractional shares of Buyer
Common Stock and no certificates or scrip therefore, or other evidence of
ownership thereof, will be issued in the Merger; instead, Buyer shall pay to
each holder of Valley Financial Common Stock who would otherwise be entitled
to a fractional share of Buyer Common Stock (after taking into account all Old
Certificates registered in the name of such holder or Book-Entry Shares held
by such holder) an amount in cash (without interest) determined by multiplying
such fraction by the Buyer VWAP.



4.04. Exchange Procedures.

(a)At or prior to the Effective Time, Buyer shall deposit, or shall cause to
be deposited, with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the holders of
certificates formerly representing shares of Valley Financial Common Stock
("Old Certificates") and holders of non‑certificated shares of Valley
Financial Common Stock ("Book-Entry Shares"), for exchange in accordance with
this Article IV, (i) certificates representing shares of Buyer Common Stock or
non-certificated shares of Buyer Common Stock (collectively, "New
Certificates") and (ii) an amount of cash necessary for payments required by
Section 4.03 (the "Exchange Fund"). The Exchange Fund will be distributed in
accordance with the Exchange Agent's normal and customary procedures
established in connection with merger transactions.

(b)As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, and in no event later than
five business days thereafter, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of
record of one or more Old Certificates or Book-Entry Shares a letter of transmittal
(which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the Old Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall pass, only upon
delivery of the Old Certificates or Book-Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent)
and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Old Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the cash and New Certificates, if any, that
the holders of the Old Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are entitled to
receive pursuant to Article IV, any cash in lieu of fractional shares into
which the shares of Valley Financial Common Stock represented by the Old
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall have been converted pursuant to this
Agreement and any payment required pursuant to Section 2.02(b) of this
Agreement. Upon proper surrender of an Old Certificate or Book-Entry Shares
for exchange and cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such
properly completed letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such
Old Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor (i) a New Certificate representing that number of whole shares of
Buyer Common Stock that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to
Article IV, if any, (ii) a check representing the amount of any cash in lieu
of fractional shares which such holder has the right to receive in respect of
the Old Certificates or Book-Entry Shares surrendered pursuant to the
provisions of this Article IV, and (iii) any payment required by Section
2.02(b), and the Old Certificates or Book-Entry Shares so surrendered shall
forthwith be cancelled.

(c)Neither the Exchange Agent, if any, nor any party hereto shall be liable to
any former holder of Valley Financial Common Stock for any amount properly
delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar laws.

(d)No dividends or other distributions with respect to Buyer Common Stock with
a record date occurring after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder
of any unsurrendered Old Certificate or Book-Entry Shares representing shares
of Valley Financial Common Stock converted in the Merger into the right to
receive shares of such Buyer Common Stock until the holder thereof shall be
entitled to receive New Certificates in exchange therefore in accordance with
the procedures set forth in this Section 4.04. After becoming so entitled in
accordance with this Section 4.04, the record holder thereof also shall be
entitled to receive any such dividends or other distributions by the Exchange
Agent, without any interest thereon, which theretofore had become payable with
respect to shares of Buyer Common Stock such holder had the right to receive
upon surrender of the Old Certificates or Book-Entry Shares.

(e)Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the stockholders
of Valley Financial on the business day after the one-year anniversary of the
Effective Date shall be paid to Buyer. Any stockholders of Valley Financial
who have not theretofore complied with this Article IV shall thereafter look
only to Buyer for payment of the Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of any
fractional shares and unpaid dividends and distributions on Buyer Common Stock
deliverable in respect of each share of Valley Financial Common Stock such
stockholder holds as determined pursuant to this Agreement, in each case,
without any interest thereon.



4.05. Anti-Dilution Provisions In the event Buyer changes (or establishes a record date for changing) the
number of shares of Buyer Common Stock issued and outstanding prior to the
Effective Date as a result of a stock split, reverse stock split, stock
dividend, reorganization, recapitalization or similar transaction with respect
to the outstanding Buyer Common Stock and the record date therefor shall be
prior to the Effective Date, or shall establish a record date prior to the
Effective Date with respect to any dividend or other distribution in respect
of the Buyer Common Stock other than a cash dividend consistent with past
practice, the Merger Consideration shall be proportionately adjusted to
provide the holders of Valley Financial Common Stock the same economic effect
as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event. The parties acknowledge
that Buyer will issue Buyer Common Stock in connection with its acquisition of
Harbor Bank Group, Inc. and such issuance shall be disregarded for purpose of
any adjustments under this Section 4.05.



4.06. Withholding Rights



Buyer or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, will be entitled to deduct
and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any Person such amounts, if any, as it is required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any
provision of state, local or foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are
so withheld and remitted to the appropriate Governmental Authority by or on
behalf of Buyer or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, such amounts
withheld will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to such Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made by Buyer or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be.

6.03 or 6.04 or to one or more of its covenants contained in Article V;
provided, that (a) no such item is required to be set forth in a Disclosure
Schedule as an exception to a representation or warranty if its absence would

being deemed untrue or incorrect under the standard set forth in Section 6.02,
and (b) the mere inclusion of an item in a Disclosure Schedule as an exception
to a representation or warranty shall not be deemed an admission by a party
that such item represents a material exception or fact, event or circumstance
or that such item is reasonably likely to result in a Material Adverse Effect
on the party making the representation. All of Valley Financial's and Buyer's
representations, warranties and covenants contained in this Agreement are

warranty contained in Section 6.03 or 6.04 has had or is reasonably likely to
have a Material Adverse Effect. For purposes of this Agreement, "knowledge"

to this agreement and the other transactions contemplated hereby. For purposes
of this Section 6.03(x), "IIPI" shall include any information relating to an
identified or identifiable natural person. Neither Valley Financial or Valley
Bank has any reason to believe that any facts or circumstances exist, which
would cause the collection and use of such IIPI by Valley Financial, the
transfer of such IIPI to Buyer, and the use of such IIPI by Buyer as
contemplated by this Agreement not to comply in any material respect with all
applicable privacy policies, the Fair Credit Reporting Act of 1970, as
amended, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 and all other applicable state,

result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any customer.



(y)Bank Secrecy Act; U.S.A. PATRIOT Act; Money Laundering. Neither Valley

notice of non-compliance with the applicable provisions of the Community
Reinvestment Act ("CRA") and the regulations promulgated thereunder. As of the
date hereof, Valley Financial or Valley Bank's most recent examination rating
under the CRA was "satisfactory" or better. Valley Financial knows of no fact or
circumstance or set of facts or circumstances which would be reasonably likely
to cause Valley Financial or Valley Bank to receive any notice of non-
compliance with such provisions of the CRA or cause the CRA rating of Valley
Financial or Valley Bank to decrease below the "satisfactory" level.



(aa)Securitizations. Valley Financial is not a party to any agreement
securitizing any of its assets.

consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement should not be
obtained on a timely basis.

the rights of creditors generally subject to general principles of equity, and

certain circumstances limit or delay enforceability of the obligor). All Loans

practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure.



ii.Neither Buyer nor any of its Subsidiaries has any material liability of any
nature whatsoever (whether absolute, accrued, contingent, or otherwise and
whether due to or to become due) required under GAAP to be set forth on a
balance sheet or in the notes thereto, except for those liabilities that are
reflected or reserved against on the consolidated balance sheet of Buyer
included in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended
September 30, 2014 (including any notes thereto) and for liabilities incurred
in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice since
September 30, 2014, including, without limitation, all letters of credit and
unfunded loan commitments or credit lines, or in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. Buyer has accurately
accounted for each loan participation interest that it has sold as a sale
under Topic 860.



iii.Since September 30, 2014, (i) through the date hereof, neither Buyer nor
any of its Subsidiaries nor, to the knowledge of the officers of Buyer, any

any of its Subsidiaries has received or otherwise had or obtained knowledge of
any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim, whether written or
oral, regarding the accounting or auditing practices, procedures,

related transactions contemplated by this Agreement, other than as set forth
on Section 6.04(g) of the Disclosure Schedule.



(h)Absence of Certain Changes or Events.



i.Since September 30, 2014, except as disclosed in the Buyer SEC Documents, no
event has occurred that has had or is reasonably likely to have, either
individually or in the aggregate with all other events, a Material Adverse
Effect on Buyer.



ii.Without limiting the foregoing, Buyer is not aware of any liability
relating to Buyer's sale of SBA or mortgage loans, (including repurchase
obligations where the repurchased portion is subject to an enforceable
guarantee by the SBA or other government-sponsored entity) beyond any reserves
established for such liabilities in the Buyer Financial Statements.



iii.Other than as set forth on Section 6.04(h) of the Disclosure Schedule,
since September 30, 2014 through and including the date of this Agreement,
Buyer and its Subsidiaries have carried on their respective businesses in all
material respects in the ordinary course of business consistent with their
past practice.



(i)Legal Proceedings.



i.Except as disclosed in the Buyer SEC Documents, none of Buyer or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party to any, and there are no pending or, to the best of
Buyer's knowledge, threatened, material legal, administrative, arbitral or
other proceedings, claims, actions or governmental or regulatory
investigations of any nature against Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries.



ii.There is no Injunction, judgment or, as otherwise disclosed in the Buyer
SEC Documents, regulatory restriction (other than those of general application
that apply to similarly situated bank holding companies or their Subsidiaries)
imposed upon Buyer, any of its Subsidiaries or the assets of Buyer or any of
its Subsidiaries.



(j)Taxes and Tax Returns. Each of Buyer and its Subsidiaries has duly and
timely filed (including all applicable extensions) all material Tax Returns
required to be filed by it on or before the date of this Agreement (all such

Taxes shown thereon as arising and has duly paid or made provision for the
payment of all material Taxes that have been incurred or are due or claimed to
be due from it by federal, state, foreign or local taxing authorities other
than Taxes that are not yet delinquent or are being contested in good faith,
have not been finally determined and have been adequately reserved against.
There are no material disputes pending, or claims asserted, for Taxes or
assessments upon Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries for which Buyer does not have reserves that
are adequate under GAAP.



(k)Compliance with Applicable Law.



i.Buyer and each of its Subsidiaries hold all material licenses, franchises,
permits and authorizations necessary for the lawful conduct of their
respective businesses under and pursuant to each, and have complied in all
respects with and are not in default in any material respect under any,
applicable law, statute, order, rule, regulation, policy or guideline of any
Governmental Authority relating to Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries.

obligations of Buyer related to its SBA and mortgage lending programs and (ii)
all laws applicable to Buyer related to its SBA and mortgage lending programs.

Act"), to the extent required by applicable law, Buyer has been and is in
compliance in all material respects with (i) the applicable provisions of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act and (ii) the applicable listing and corporate governance
rules and regulations of The NASDAQ Stock Market.



(l)Assets.



i.Since September 30, 2014, none of the Buyer Subsidiaries has incurred any
unusual or extraordinary loan losses that are material to Buyer and its
Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis; to Buyer's knowledge and in light of
each of the Buyer Subsidiaries' historical loan loss experience and its
management's analysis of the quality and performance of its loan portfolio,
the reserves for loan losses shown on the Buyer Financial Statements were, on
the respective dates thereof, adequate in all material respects under the
requirements of GAAP and applicable regulatory accounting practices, in each
case consistently applied, to provide for probable loan losses as of such
date, and were in accordance with the safety and soundness standards
administered by, and the practices, procedures, requests and requirements of,
the applicable Regulatory Authority.



ii.To the knowledge of Buyer, Buyer's Subsidiaries are in material compliance
with all reporting, recordkeeping, audit and other requirements under all
purchase and assumption agreements, commercial shared-loss agreements, and/or
loss share arrangements with the FDIC and all agreements and arrangements with
respect to loss sharing thereunder are enforceable against the FDIC in
accordance with their respective terms (except as may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, reorganization or similar laws affecting
the rights of creditors generally and subject to general principles of
equity).



(m)Approvals. As of the date of this Agreement, Buyer knows of no reason why all regulatory
approvals from any Governmental Authority required for the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement should not be obtained on a timely
basis.



(n)Buyer Information.



The information relating to Buyer and its Subsidiaries that is provided by
Buyer or its representatives for inclusion in the Proxy Statement and the
Registration Statement, or in any application, notification or other document
filed with any other Regulatory Authority or other Governmental Authority in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, will not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
in which they are made, not misleading. The Registration Statement will comply
in all material respects with the provisions of the Securities Act and the
rules and regulations thereunder.



(o)Bank Secrecy Act; Patriot Act; Money Laundering.



Neither Buyer nor any Buyer Subsidiary has any reason to believe that any
facts or circumstances exist, which would cause Buyer or the Buyer
Subsidiaries to be deemed to be operating in violation in any material respect
of the Bank Secrecy Act, the Patriot Act, any order issued with respect to
anti-money laundering by the United States Department of the Treasury, or any
other applicable anti-money laundering law. Furthermore, the Board of
Directors of Buyer Bank has adopted and Buyer Bank has implemented an anti-
money laundering program that contains adequate and appropriate customer
identification verification procedures, that has not been deemed ineffective
by any Governmental Authority and that meets the requirements of Sections 352
and 326 of the Patriot Act. Buyer has not engaged in any material "unfair,
deceptive, or abusive practice" as such phrase is used in the Dodd-Frank Wall
Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.



(p)CRA Compliance.



Neither Buyer nor any Buyer Subsidiary has received any notice of non-
compliance with the applicable provisions of the CRA and the regulations
promulgated thereunder. As of the date hereof, Buyer's and each Buyer
Subsidiary's most recent examination rating under the CRA was "satisfactory"
or better. Buyer knows of no fact or circumstance or set of facts or
circumstances which would be reasonably likely to cause Buyer or any Buyer
Subsidiary to receive any notice of non-compliance with such provisions of the
CRA or cause the CRA rating of Buyer or any Buyer Subsidiary to decrease below
the "satisfactory" level.



(q)Tax Matters.



Neither Buyer, nor Buyer Bank nor any of their affiliates has taken or agreed
to take any action, or knowingly failed to take any action, which action or
failure to act is reasonably likely to prevent the Merger from qualifying as a reorganization
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. As of the date of this
Agreement it is the present intention, and as of the date of the Closing it
will be the present intention, of Buyer and Buyer Bank to continue, either
through a wholly owned subsidiary of Buyer or through a member of Buyer's
Qualified Group, at least one significant historic business line of Valley
Financial, or to use at least a significant portion of the historic business
assets of Valley Financial in a business, in each case within the meaning of
Section 1.368‑1(d) of the regulations promulgated by the United States
Department of the Treasury with respect to the Code (the "Treasury
Regulations"). As used in this Agreement, the term "Qualified Group" shall
mean Buyer's "qualified group" as such term is defined within the meaning of
Treasury Regulations Section 1.368-1(d)(4)(ii). As of the date of the Merger,
(i) Buyer will own all of the outstanding stock or other equity interests in
Buyer Bank, and (ii) Buyer will be in "control" of Buyer Bank within the
meaning of Code Section 368(c). Buyer has no plan or present intention to
sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of any of the capital stock of Buyer Bank
following the Merger, and Buyer has no present plan or intention to cause
Buyer Bank to issue additional capital stock following the Merger, that in
either case would result in Buyer's not having "control" of Buyer Bank within
the meaning of Code Section 368(c). As of the date of this Agreement, and as
of the date of the Closing, neither Buyer, nor Buyer Bank, nor any "related
person" (as defined in Treasury Regulations Section 1.368-1(e)(4)) to Buyer or
Buyer Bank has or will have any plan or intention to redeem or reacquire,
either directly or indirectly, any of the Buyer shares issued to the Valley
Financial stockholders in connection with the Merger.



(r)Environmental Liability.



There are no legal, administrative, arbitral or other proceedings, claims,
actions, causes of action, orders, assessments (including penalty assessments)
or notices of any kind with respect to any environmental, health or safety
matters or any private or governmental environmental, health or safety
investigations or remediation activities of any nature seeking to impose, or
that are reasonably likely to result in, any material liability or obligation
of Buyer or Buyer Subsidiaries arising under common law or under any local,
state or federal environmental, health or safety statute, regulation or
ordinance, including the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation
and Liability Act of 1980, as amended, pending or, to Buyer's actual
knowledge, threatened against Buyer or any of Buyer Subsidiaries. To the
actual knowledge of Buyer, there is no reasonable basis for, or circumstances
that are reasonably likely to give rise to, any such proceeding, claim,
action, investigation or remediation by any Governmental Authority or any
third party that would give rise to any material liability or obligation on
the part of Buyer or any of Buyer Subsidiaries. Neither Buyer nor any of Buyer
Subsidiaries is subject to any agreement, order, judgment, decree, letter or
memorandum by or with any Governmental Authority or third party imposing any
liability or obligation with respect to any of the foregoing. To Buyer's
actual knowledge, each of Buyer and Buyer Subsidiaries, and (except as set
forth in written third party environmental reports included in the relevant
loan documentation regarding real property securing a Loan made in the
ordinary course of business to a third party that is not an affiliate or
Buyer) any property in which Buyer or any of Buyer Subsidiaries hold a security interest, is in material compliance with all
local, state or federal environmental, health or safety Laws, including the
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980,
as amended. The representations and warranties contained within this Section
6.04(r) are Buyer's only representations and warranties with respect to
environmental matters.



(s)State Takeover Laws.

Buyer has taken all necessary action, if any, to exempt the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement from, or if necessary to challenge the validity
or applicability of any applicable "moratorium," "fair price," "business
combination", "control share," or other anti-takeover laws.



(t)Employee Benefit Plans.



i.Buyer has made available all existing bonus, incentive, deferred
compensation, pension, retirement, profit‑sharing, thrift, savings, employee
stock ownership, stock bonus, stock purchase, restricted stock, stock option,
severance, welfare and fringe benefit plans, employment or severance
agreements and all similar practices, policies and arrangements in which any
current or former employee (the "Buyer Employees"), current or former
consultant (the "Buyer Consultants") or current or former director (the "Buyer
Directors") of Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries participates or to which any
such Buyer Employees, Buyer Consultants or Buyer Directors are a party (the
"Buyer Compensation and Benefit Plans"). Except as required by the terms of
this Agreement or as Previously Disclosed, neither Buyer nor any of its
Subsidiaries has any commitment to create any additional Buyer Compensation
and Benefit Plan or to modify or change any existing Buyer Compensation and
Benefit Plan.



ii.Each Buyer Compensation and Benefit Plan has been operated and administered
in all material respects in accordance with its terms and with applicable law,
including, but not limited to, ERISA, the Code, the Securities Act, the
Exchange Act, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, or any regulations or
rules promulgated thereunder, and all filings, disclosures and notices
required by ERISA, the Code, the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, the Age
Discrimination in Employment Act and any other applicable law have been timely
made. Each Buyer Compensation and Benefit Plan which is an "employee pension
benefit plan" within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA (a "Buyer Pension
Plan") and which is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code
has received a favorable determination letter or has applied for a favorable
determination letter in compliance with the Code (including a determination
that the related trust under such Buyer Compensation and Benefit Plan is
exempt from tax under Section 501(a) of the Code) from the Internal Revenue
Service ("IRS") or the Plan uses a prototype or volume submitter plan that is
the subject of an IRS opinion or advisory letter, and Buyer is not aware of
any circumstances that could adversely affect such qualification or that are
likely to result in the revocation of any existing favorable determination
letter or in not receiving a favorable determination letter. There is no
material pending or, to the knowledge of Buyer, threatened legal action, suit
or claim relating to the Buyer Compensation and Benefit Plans other than routine claims for benefits. Neither Buyer nor any of its Subsidiaries has
engaged in a transaction, or omitted to take any action, with respect to any
Buyer Compensation and Benefit Plan that would reasonably be expected to
subject Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries to a material tax or penalty imposed
by either Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502 of ERISA, assuming for
purposes of Section 4975 of the Code that the taxable period of any such
transaction expired as of the date hereof.



iii.No Buyer Compensation and Benefit Plans currently maintained, or
maintained within the last six years, by Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries or
any entity (an "Buyer ERISA Affiliate") that is considered one employer with
Buyer under Section 4001(a)(14) of ERISA or Section 414(b) or (c) of the Code
is or was subject to Title IV of ERISA or is or was a multiemployer plan under
Subtitle E of Title IV of ERISA. To the knowledge of Buyer, there is no
pending investigation or enforcement action by the PBGC, the DOL or IRS or any
other governmental agency with respect to any Buyer Compensation and Benefit
Plan.



iv.All contributions required to be made under the terms of any Buyer
Compensation and Benefit Plan or any employee benefit arrangements under any
collective bargaining agreement to which Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries is a
party have been timely made or have been reflected on Buyer's financial
statements. None of Buyer, any of its Subsidiaries or any Buyer ERISA
Affiliate (x) has provided, or would reasonably be expected to be required to
provide, security to any Buyer Pension Plan pursuant to Section 401(a) (29) of
the Code, and (y) has taken any action, or omitted to take any action, that
has resulted, or would reasonably be expected to result, in the imposition of
a lien under Section 412(n) of the Code or pursuant to ERISA.



v.Neither Buyer nor any of its Subsidiaries has any obligations to provide
retiree health and life insurance (except split dollar life insurance) or
other retiree death benefits under any Buyer Compensation and Benefit Plan,
other than benefits mandated by Section 4980B of the Code, and each such Buyer
Compensation and Benefit Plan may be amended or terminated without incurring
liability thereunder, and there has been no communication to Buyer Employees
by Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries that would reasonably be expected to
promise or guarantee such Buyer Employees retiree health or life insurance or
other retiree death benefits on a permanent basis.



vi.Buyer and its Subsidiaries do not maintain any Buyer Compensation and
Benefit Plans covering foreign Buyer Employees.



vii.The consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement would
not, directly or indirectly (including, without limitation, as a result of any
termination of employment prior to or following the Effective Time) reasonably
be expected to (A) entitle any Buyer Employee, Buyer Consultant or Buyer
Director to any payment (including severance pay or similar compensation) or
any increase in compensation, (B) result in the vesting or acceleration of any
benefits under any Buyer Compensation and Benefit Plan or (C) result in any material increase in benefits payable under
any Buyer Compensation and Benefit Plan.



viii.Neither Buyer nor any of its Subsidiaries maintains any compensation
plans, programs or arrangements the payments under which would not reasonably
be expected to be deductible as a result of the limitations under Section
162(m) of the Code and the regulations issued thereunder.



ix.As a result, directly or indirectly, of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (including, without limitation, as a result of any termination
of employment prior to or following the Effective Time), neither Buyer nor
Valley Financial, or any of their respective Subsidiaries will be obligated to
make a payment to an Employee of Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries that would
be characterized as an "excess parachute payment" to an individual who is a
"disqualified individual" (as such terms are defined in Section 280G of the
Code), without regard to whether such payment is reasonable compensation for
personal services performed or to be performed in the future.



x.Neither Buyer nor any of its Subsidiaries has made any agreement, taken any
action, or omitted to take any action, with respect to or as part of any Buyer
Compensation and Benefit Plan that is an operational failure under Section
409A of the Code or that would reasonably be expected to subject Buyer or any
of its Subsidiaries to any obligation to report any amount or withhold any
amount as includable in income and subject to tax, interest or any penalty by
any service provider to Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries under Section 409A of
the Code or to pay any reimbursement or other payment to any service provider,
as defined under Section 409A of the Code, respecting any such tax, interest
or penalty under Section 409A of the Code. As a result, directly or
indirectly, of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including,
without limitation, as a result of any termination of employment prior to or
following the Effective Time), neither Buyer nor any of its Subsidiaries will
be obligated to report any amount or withhold any amount as includable in
income and subject to tax, interest or any penalty by any service provider (as
defined under Section 409A of the Code) to Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries
under Section 409A of the Code or to pay any reimbursement or other payment to
any service provider (as defined under Section 409A of the Code) respecting
any such Tax, interest or penalty under Section 409A of the Code and no
provision of any of the Buyer Compensation and Benefit Plans, or any actions
taken or omitted thereunder, violate Section 409A of the Code.



(u)No Further Representations. Except for the representations and warranties
specifically set forth in this Section 6.04 of this Agreement, neither Buyer,
Buyer Bank, nor any other Person makes or shall be deemed to make any
representation or warranty to Valley Financial, express or implied, at law or
at equity, with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby, and Valley
Financial hereby disclaims any such representation or warranty whether by
Buyer, Buyer Bank or any of its officers, directors, employees, affiliates, or
any other Person.

Valley Financial Board, after having consulted with and considered the advice

matters as may be reasonably necessary or advisable or as may be reasonably
requested in connection with the Registration Statement, Proxy Statement or
any other statement, filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of
Buyer, Valley Financial or their respective Subsidiaries to any Governmental
Authority in connection with the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Valley Financial shall have the right to

statement in any earlier statement in the Proxy Statement or any amendment or
supplement thereto. Each of Valley Financial and Buyer further agrees that if
it shall become aware prior to the Effective Date of any information furnished

to make the statements therein not false or misleading, to promptly inform the
other party thereof and to take the necessary steps to correct the Proxy
Statement.

Buyer or its Subsidiaries nor Valley Financial or its Subsidiaries shall be
required to provide access to or to disclose information where such access or
disclosure would jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of Buyer, Valley
Financial or their respective Subsidiaries, as the case may be, or contravene
any applicable law or regulation or binding contract, agreement or arrangement
entered into prior to the date of this Agreement; and in any such event, the
parties will make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements.

entering into of this Agreement) unless such information (i) was already known
to such party, (ii) becomes available to such party from other sources not
known by such party to be bound by a confidentiality obligation, (iii) is

documents or extracts thereof containing information and data as to another
party hereto to be returned to the party that furnished the same. No
investigation by either party of the business and affairs of the other shall
affect or be deemed to modify or waive any representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement in this Agreement, or the conditions to either party's obligation
to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

have any discussions with any person relating to, any Acquisition Proposal. It
shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated any activities, discussions
or negotiations conducted prior to the date of this Agreement with any parties
other than Buyer with respect to any of the foregoing and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to enforce any confidentiality or similar agreement

promptly of all relevant details of any inquiries or contacts by third parties
relating to the possible disposition of the business or the capital stock of
Valley Financial or any merger, change or control or other business
combination involving Valley Financial. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, at
any time the Valley Financial Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with outside counsel, that failure to do so would be reasonably
likely to constitute a breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable law,
Valley Financial, in response to a written Acquisition Proposal that was
unsolicited after the date of this Agreement or that did not otherwise result
from a breach of this Section 7.06, may furnish non-public information with
respect to Valley Financial to the Person who made such Acquisition Proposal
and participate in negotiations regarding such Acquisition Proposal.



7.07 Takeover Laws No party hereto shall take any action that would cause the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement to be subject to requirements imposed by any
Takeover Law and each of them shall take all necessary steps within its
control to exempt (or ensure the continued exemption of) the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement from any applicable Takeover Law, as now or
hereafter in effect.



7.08 Exemption from Liability Under Section 16(b)

Buyer and Valley Financial agree that, in order to most effectively compensate
and retain certain directors and officers of Valley Financial in connection
with the Merger, both prior to and after the Effective Time, it is desirable
that the directors and officers of Valley Financial not be subject to a risk
of liability under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act, and for that
compensatory and retentive purposes agree to the provisions of this Section
7.08. The Valley Financial Board, or a committee of "Non-Employee Directors"
(as such term is defined for purposes of Rule 16b-3(d) under the Exchange Act)
thereof, shall adopt a resolution providing that the disposition by the
directors and officers of Valley Financial Common Stock and Valley Financial
Stock Options, in each case pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, are intended to be exempt from liability pursuant to Section 16(b)
under the Exchange Act.



7.09 Regulatory Applications.

(a)Buyer and Valley Financial and their respective Subsidiaries shall
cooperate and use their respective reasonable best efforts (i) to prepare
within 45 days of the date of this Agreement all documentation and to effect
all filings with Regulatory Authorities and Governmental Authorities necessary
to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) to
obtain all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third
parties, Regulatory Authorities and Governmental Authorities necessary to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each Party shall
use its reasonable efforts to resolve objections, if any, which may be
asserted by a Regulatory Authority or a Governmental Authority with respect to
the Merger under any applicable law, regulation or decree, including agreeing
to divest any assets, deposits, lines of business or branches; provided, that
Buyer shall not be required to agree to any condition or take any action if
such agreements or the taking of such action is reasonably likely to result in
a condition or restriction having an effect of the type referred to in Section
8.01(b). Each of Buyer and Valley Financial shall have the right to review in
advance, and to the extent practicable each will consult with the other, in
each case subject to applicable laws relating to the exchange of information,
with respect to, all material written information submitted to any third
party, Regulatory Authority or Governmental Authority in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In exercising the foregoing
right, each of the parties hereto agrees to act reasonably and as promptly as
practicable. Each party hereto agrees that it will consult with the other
party hereto with respect to the obtaining of all material permits, consents,
approvals and authorizations of all third parties, Regulatory Authorities and
Governmental Authorities necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and each party will keep the other party apprised of the status of material matters relating to completion of the
transactions contemplated hereby, including advising the other party upon
receiving any communication from a Regulatory Authority or a Governmental
Authority the consent or approval of which is required for the consummation of
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement that
causes such party to believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that any
required consent or approval from a Regulatory Authority or a Governmental
Authority will not be obtained or that the receipt of such consent or approval
may be materially delayed (a "Regulatory Communication"). Upon the receipt of
a Regulatory Communication, without limiting the scope of the foregoing
paragraphs, Buyer shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law (i)
promptly advise Valley Financial of the receipt of any substantive
communication from a Regulatory or a Governmental Authority with respect to
the transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) provide Valley Financial with a
reasonable opportunity to participate in the preparation of any response
thereto and the preparation of any other substantive submission or
communication to any Regulatory or Governmental Authority with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby and to review any such response, submission
or communication prior to the filing or submission thereof, and (iii) provide
Valley Financial with the opportunity to participate in any meetings or
substantive telephone conversations that Buyer or its Subsidiaries or their
respective representatives may have from time to time with any Regulatory
Authority or Governmental Authority with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.



(b)Each party agrees, upon request, to furnish the other party with all
information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and
stockholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or
advisable in connection with any filing, notice or application made by or on
behalf of such other party or any of its Subsidiaries to any third party or
Regulatory Authority or Governmental Authority.



7.10 Indemnification.

 (a) Following the Effective Date and for a period of six years thereafter,
Buyer shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the present directors,
officers and employees of Valley Financial and its Subsidiaries (each, an
"Indemnified Party") against all costs or expenses (including reasonable
attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities
incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
arising out of actions or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time (including the transactions contemplated by this Agreement), whether
asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time to the fullest
extent that Valley Financial is permitted or required to indemnify (and
advance expenses to) its directors, officers and employees under the laws of
the Commonwealth of Virginia, the Valley Financial Certificate, the Valley
Financial By-Laws and any agreement or Valley Financial Board resolution
adopted or in effect on the date hereof; provided that any determination
required to be made with respect to whether an officer's, director's or
employee's conduct complies with the standards set forth under Virginia law,
the Valley Financial Certificate, the Valley Financial By-Laws and any
agreement shall be made by independent counsel (which shall not be counsel
that provides material services to Buyer) selected by Buyer and reasonably
acceptable to such officer or director. The fees and expenses of such
independent legal counsel shall be paid for by Buyer.



For purposes of this Section 7.10 in the event any claim is asserted within
the six year period after the Effective Time, all such rights in respect of
any such claim shall continue until disposition thereof and the Indemnified
Party shall be entitled to advancement of expenses within five business days
following receipt of any such claim involving such Indemnified Party.



(b)For a period of six years from the Effective Time, Buyer shall use its
reasonable best efforts to provide that portion of director's and officer's
liability insurance that serves to reimburse the present and former officers
and directors of Valley Financial or any of its Subsidiaries (determined as of
the Effective Time) (as opposed to Valley Financial) with respect to claims
against such directors and officers arising from facts or events which
occurred before the Effective Time, which insurance shall contain at least the
same coverage and amounts, and contain terms and conditions no less
advantageous, as that coverage currently provided by Valley Financial;
provided, that in no event shall Buyer be required to expend more than 200% of
the current amount expended by Valley Financial (the "Insurance Amount") to
maintain or procure such directors and officers insurance coverage; provided,
further, that if Buyer is unable to maintain or obtain the insurance called
for by this Section 7.10(b), Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain as much comparable insurance as is available for the Insurance Amount;
provided, further, that officers and directors of Valley Financial or any
Subsidiary may be required to make application and provide customary
representations and warranties to Buyer's insurance carrier for the purpose of
obtaining such insurance.



(c)Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under Section
7.10(a), upon learning of any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation
described above, shall promptly notify Buyer thereof; provided that the
failure so to notify shall not affect the obligations of Buyer under Section
7.10(a) unless and to the extent that Buyer is actually prejudiced as a result
of such failure.

 (d)If Buyer or any of its successors or assigns shall consolidate with or
merge into any other entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving
entity of such consolidation or merger or shall transfer all or substantially
all of its assets to any entity, then and in each case, proper provision shall
be made so that the successors and assigns of Buyer shall assume the
obligations set forth in this Section 7.10.



(e)The provisions of this Section 7.10 (i) shall survive the Effective Time
and are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each

substantially similar to those provided to similarly situated employees of
Buyer, (ii) Buyer shall cause any and all pre-existing condition limitations

under group health plans to be waived with respect to such employees and their
eligible dependents, and (iii) all employees of Valley Financial and its
Subsidiaries shall receive credit for years of service with Valley Financial,
its Subsidiaries and their predecessors prior to the Effective Time for
purposes of eligibility and vesting (but not for purposes of benefit accrual
other than accrual for vacation or paid time off; provided, that, in
accordance with Buyer's policies, no vacation or paid time off shall be
thereafter carried over into a subsequent calendar year) under Buyer's benefit
plans.



(b)Buyer agrees that each employee of Valley Financial and its Subsidiaries
who is involuntarily terminated by Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries (other
than for cause) on or within 12 months of the Effective Date, shall receive

on the termination date) for each year of service at Valley Financial or its
Subsidiaries (with credit for partial years of service) with a minimum payment
equal to four weeks of base pay in lieu of severance benefits payable under
the Valley Financial Corporation Severance Plan, provided that employees of
Valley Financial and its Subsidiaries with individual agreements that provide
for payment of severance under certain circumstances who will be paid
severance only in accordance with such agreements, (ii) reimbursement for up
to six months of such employee's COBRA premium payments, if COBRA coverage is
elected by such employee, that are in excess of the premium payment paid by
such employee immediately prior to termination, and (iii) outplacement
services provided by or at the expense of Buyer in accordance with Buyer's
then current practices and procedures.

necessary to (A) freeze the benefit amounts payable under the Supplemental

with Article III thereof as of the Effective Time, (B) establish and fund a
"Rabbi" Trust for the purposes of providing benefits accrued under the SERP in accordance with Article III thereof as of
the Effective Time, and (C) amend the SERP's eligibility provisions to freeze
future participation as of the Effective Time. Buyer shall agree to assume

vest all accrued benefits provided under Valley Financial's 401(k) plan and
take action to terminate such plan, subject to consummation of the Merger.



(e)Except as provided on Section 7.11(e) to the Buyer Disclosure Schedule, at
and following the Effective Time, Buyer shall honor, and Buyer shall be
obligated to perform, or shall cause its Subsidiaries to honor and perform, in
accordance with their terms and applicable law, the contractual rights of
Employees, Consultants and Directors of Valley Financial and its Subsidiaries
existing as of the Effective Time.



7.12 Notification of Certain Matters

Each of Valley Financial and Buyer shall give prompt notice to the other of
any fact, event or circumstance known to it that (i) is reasonably likely,
individually or taken together with all other facts, events and circumstances
known to it, to result in any Material Adverse Effect with respect to it or
(ii) would cause or constitute a material breach of any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained herein.



7.13 Directors and Officers.

as a director of each of Buyer and Buyer Bank at the Effective Time. Valley

foreign statutes, laws, regulations, ordinances, rules, judgments, orders or

reorganization, within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.



7.15 Assumption of TRUPs Buyer acknowledges that Valley Statutory Trust I, Valley Statutory Trust II,
and Valley Statutory Trust III hold subordinated debentures issued by Valley
Financial and has issued preferred securities which are intended to be
"qualified trust preferred securities" as defined in applicable regulatory

trust preferred securities. Buyer agrees that at the Effective Time, it shall
expressly assume all of Valley Financial's obligations under the indentures
relating to such subordinated debentures (including, without limitation, being
substituted for Valley Financial) and execute any and all documents,
instruments and agreements, including any supplemental indentures, guarantees,
or declarations of trust required by said indentures, the subordinated
debentures or the trust preferred securities issued by Valley Statutory Trust
I, Valley Statutory Trust II, and Valley Statutory Trust III, or as may
reasonably be requested by the trustees thereunder, and thereafter shall

Director in connection with Director being a director of Seller that could be
used to compete against or harm Seller, Buyer or their Subsidiaries.

relating to: (i) Seller's, Buyer's and their Subsidiaries' customers,
including customer lists, contact information, contractual terms and
information regarding products or services provided to such customer; (ii)
Seller's, Buyer's and their Subsidiaries' finances, including nonpublic

6. Reasonableness and Breach. Director acknowledges that the restrictions herein are fair, reasonable, and necessary for the protection of Buyer and its acquisition of Seller and constitute a material inducement for Buyer to effect the Merger and provide the Merger Consideration. Therefore, Director agrees not to contest the enforceability of this Agreement in any forum. Director further acknowledges and agrees that a breach of any of such obligations and agreements will result in irreparable harm and continuing damage to Buyer for which there will be no adequate remedy at law and further agrees that in the event of any breach of such obligations and agreements, Buyer and its successors and assigns will be entitled to injunctive relief and to such other relief as is proper under the circumstances. Director acknowledges and agrees that the covenants in this Agreement are direct consideration for a sale of a business and should be governed by standards applicable to restrictive covenants entered into in connection with a sale of a business.

7. Judicial Modification. If a court of competent jurisdiction determines that any provision of this Agreement is invalid or incapable of being enforced, then the parties request that such court modify such provision by "blue-penciling" or otherwise in order to render such provision not invalid or incapable of being enforced and then enforce the provision as modified. The parties further agree that each provision of this Agreement is severable from each other provision of this Agreement.

8. Assignment. Buyer shall have the right to assign or transfer this Agreement to any affiliated entity or any successor (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise), and Director irrevocably consents to any such assignment or transfer. In the event of such assignment or transfer, "Buyer" shall mean the entity to which this Agreement is so assigned or transferred.

9. Applicable Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia without regard to any conflict‑of‑law rules.

10. Waiver; Construction. No modification, termination or attempted waiver of any of the provisions of this Agreement shall be binding unless reduced to writing and signed by the parties. This Agreement shall be construed according to a plain reading of its terms and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provision in this Agreement.



11. Entire Agreement. This Agreement (including the recitals, which are hereby incorporated by reference) and the Merger Agreement constitute the entire agreement among the parties pertaining to the subject matters contained herein.
