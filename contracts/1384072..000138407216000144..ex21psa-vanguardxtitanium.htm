prior to Closing, Seller shall prepare and submit to Buyer for review a draft
settlement statement (the "Preliminary Settlement Statement") that shall set
forth the Adjusted Purchase Price, reflecting each adjustment made in

to determine such amount, together with reasonable supporting information
reasonably necessary for Buyer to verify such adjustments and the designation
of Seller's accounts for the wire transfers of funds as required by Section
3.1 and Section 9.3(d). Within two (2) Business Days of receipt of the
Preliminary Settlement Statement, Buyer will deliver to Seller a written
report containing all changes with the explanation therefor that Buyer
proposes to be made to the Preliminary Settlement Statement. The Parties shall
in good faith attempt to agree on the Preliminary Settlement Statement as soon
as possible after Seller's receipt of Buyer's written report. The Preliminary
Settlement Statement, as agreed upon by the Parties, will be used to adjust
the Purchase Price at Closing; provided that if the Parties do not agree upon
an adjustment set forth in the Preliminary Settlement Statement, then the
amount of such adjustment used to adjust the Purchase Price at Closing shall
be that amount set forth in the draft Preliminary Settlement Statement
delivered by Seller to Buyer pursuant to this Section 3.5, subject to
subsequent adjustments pursuant to Section 3.6.

3.6 Final Settlement Statement. On or before ninety (90) days after Closing, a
final settlement statement (the "Final Settlement Statement") will be prepared
by Seller, based on actual income and expenses during the Interim Period and
which takes into account all final adjustments made to the Purchase Price and
shows the resulting final Purchase Price (the "Final Price"). The Final
Settlement Statement shall set forth the actual proration of the amounts
required by this Agreement. Seller shall at Buyer's request supply reasonable
documentation available to support any credit, charge, receipt or other item.
As soon as reasonably practicable, and in any event within thirty (30) days,
after receipt of the Final Settlement Statement, Buyer shall return to Seller
a written report containing any proposed changes to the Final Settlement
Statement and an explanation of any such changes and the reasons therefor (the
"Dispute Notice"). Any changes not so specified in the Dispute Notice shall be
deemed waived and Seller's determinations with respect to all such elements of
the Final Settlement Statement that are not addressed specifically in the
Dispute Notice shall prevail. If Buyer fails to timely deliver a Dispute
Notice to Seller containing changes Buyer proposes to be made to the Final
Settlement Statement, the Final Settlement Statement as delivered by Seller
will be deemed to be correct and will be final and binding on the Parties and
not subject to further audit or arbitration. If the Final Price set forth in
the Final Settlement Statement is mutually agreed upon by Seller and Buyer,
the Final Settlement Statement and the Final Price shall be final and binding
on the Parties hereto (other than with respect to amounts not accounted for
therein or settled thereby, which amounts shall be subject to the provisions
of Section 3.9). Any difference in the Adjusted Purchase Price as paid at
Closing pursuant to the Preliminary Settlement Statement and the Final Price
shall be paid by the owing Party within ten (10) days of final determination
of such owed amounts in accordance herewith to the owed Party. All amounts
paid pursuant to this



7 Section 3.6 shall be delivered in United States currency by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the account specified in writing by the
relevant Party.

3.7 Disputes. If Seller and Buyer are unable to resolve the matters addressed
in the Dispute Notice, each of Buyer and Seller shall within ten (10) Business
Days after the delivery of such Dispute Notice, summarize its position with
regard to such dispute in a written document of twenty pages or less and
submit such summaries to the Houston, Texas office of Grant Thornton or such
other Person as the Parties may mutually select (the "Accounting Arbitrator"),
together with the Dispute Notice, the Final Settlement Statement and any other
documentation such Party may desire to submit. Within ten (10) Business Days
after receiving the Parties' respective submissions, the Accounting Arbitrator
shall render a decision choosing either Seller's position or Buyer's position
with respect to each matter addressed in any Dispute Notice, based on the
materials described above. Any decision rendered by the Accounting Arbitrator
pursuant hereto shall be final, conclusive and binding on Seller and Buyer and
will be enforceable against any of the Parties in any court of competent
jurisdiction. The Accounting Arbitrator shall act as an expert for the
specific disputed matters submitted by either Party and may not award damages
or penalties to either Party with respect to any matter. The costs of such
Accounting Arbitrator shall be borne one-half by Buyer and one-half by Seller.

3.8 Allocation of Purchase Price / Allocated Values. Buyer and Seller agree
that the Purchase Price and any Assumed Obligation or other items treated as
consideration for federal income Tax purposes shall be allocated among the
Assets in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code as set forth in Schedule
3.8 to this Agreement (the "Allocated Values"), which schedule shall be
prepared by Buyer. Each Party shall utilize the Allocated Values, as updated
by mutual agreement of the Parties to reflect any adjustment to the Purchase
Price pursuant to this Agreement for purposes of all federal, state and local
Tax Returns and reports, including Internal Revenue Service Form 8594, and
neither any Party nor its Affiliates shall take any position on any Tax Return
that is inconsistent with such Allocated Values, as adjusted, unless such
position is mutually agreed by the Parties or required to be taken pursuant to
a final determination, as defined in Section 1313 of the Code. Buyer and
Seller agree that such allocation, as adjusted, is reasonable and shall not
take any position inconsistent therewith, including in notices to Preferential
Purchase Right holders. Seller and Buyer agree to promptly advise the other
regarding the existence of any Tax audit or controversy regarding the
correctness of the Allocated Values or any adjustment thereto.

3.9 Post-Closing Adjustments after Final Settlement Statement.

(a) If, during the period from and after the Parties' agreement upon the Final
Settlement Statement up until the first (1st) anniversary of Closing, (%3) any
Party receives monies belonging to the other, including proceeds of
production, then such amount shall promptly be paid over to the proper Party,
(%3) any Party pays monies for Operating Expenses which are the obligation of
the other Party hereto, then such other Party shall promptly reimburse the
Party which paid such Operating Expenses upon receipt of an invoice from such
paying Party, (%3) a Party receives an invoice of an expense or obligation
which is owed by the other Party, such Party receiving the invoice shall
promptly forward such invoice to the Party obligated to pay the same, and (%3)
if an invoice or other evidence of an obligation is received by a Party, which
is partially an obligation of



8 both Seller and Buyer, then the Parties shall consult with each other, and
each shall promptly pay its portion of such obligation to the obligee.

(b) If, during the period from and after the Parties' agreement upon the Final
Settlement Statement up until the date that is six (6) months after the
Closing, any Party becomes aware of an issue that, if such party had been
aware of such issue prior to the agreement of the Final Settlement Statement,
such party would have raised it in connection with the Final Settlement
Statement and such item would have been required to be incorporated as an
adjustment in the Final Settlement Statement, such Party shall notify the
other Party of the existence of such issue and the Parties shall, in good
faith, attempt to reconcile such issue in the same manner as they would have
in connection with the Final Settlement Statement. If the Parties are unable
to resolve any such issues within ten (10) Business Days after notification
thereof, such issues shall be resolved in the same manner as provided in
Section 3.7.

3.10 Allocation for Imbalances at Closing. If, prior to Closing, either Party
discovers an error in the Imbalances set forth in Schedule 4.12, then the
Purchase Price shall be further adjusted at Closing pursuant to Section
3.3(a)(iv), Section 3.3(a)(v), Section 3.3(b)(vi) or Section 3.3(b)(vii), as
applicable, and Schedule 4.12 will be deemed amended immediately prior to
Closing to reflect the Imbalances for which the Purchase Price is so adjusted.

ARTICLE VI 
CERTAIN AGREEMENTS

6.1 Conduct of Business.

(a) Except (x) as set forth in Schedule 6.1, and (y) as expressly contemplated
by this Agreement or as expressly consented to in writing by Buyer (which
consent shall not be unreasonably delayed, withheld or conditioned), Seller
shall from and after the date hereof until Closing:



15 (x) operate the Assets in the usual, regular and ordinary manner consistent
with past practice;

(xi) maintain the books of account and Records relating to the Assets in the
usual, regular and ordinary manner, in accordance with Seller's usual
accounting practice;

(xii) maintain its current insurance coverage on the Assets, if any, presently
furnished by unaffiliated Third Parties in the amounts and of the types
presently in force;

(xiii) use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain in full force and
effect all Leases;

(xiv) pay, when due, all expenses, Taxes (including severance, production and
similar Taxes), revenues, royalties, overriding royalties and other
obligations with respect to Seller's interest in the Assets;

(xv) meet all commitments with respect to the operations covered by the AFEs
and other capital commitments set forth on Schedule 4.13;

(xvi) not commit to any single operation, or series of related operations,
reasonably anticipated by Seller to require future capital expenditures by the
owner of the Assets in excess of $100,000 (net to Seller's interest) or make
any capital expenditures related to the Assets in excess of $100,000 (net to
Seller's interest), except for the operations covered by the AFEs and other
capital commitments set forth on Schedule 4.13;

(xvii) not enter into an Applicable Contract that, if entered into on or prior
to the date of this Agreement, would be required to be listed in a Schedule
attached to this Agreement, or materially amend or change the terms of any
Material Contract, except with respect to the operations covered by the AFEs
and other capital commitments set forth on Schedule 4.13;

(xviii) not transfer, sell, mortgage, pledge or dispose of any material
portion of the Assets other than the sale and/or disposal of Hydrocarbons in
the ordinary course of business and sales of equipment that is no longer
necessary in the operation of the Assets or for which replacement equipment
has been obtained; and

(xix) not commit to do any act prohibited by the foregoing.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of an emergency or a serious risk
to life, property, or the environment, Seller may take or consent to such
action as a prudent operator, or non-operator as the case may be, would take
and without obtaining Buyer's prior consent; provided, Seller shall notify
Buyer of such action promptly thereafter.

(b) Buyer acknowledges Seller owns undivided interests in certain of the
properties comprising the Assets that it is not the operator thereof, and
Buyer agrees that the acts or omissions of the other Working Interest owners
(including the operators) who are not Seller or any Affiliate of Seller shall
not constitute a breach of the provisions of this Section 6.1, and no action
required by a vote of Working Interest owners shall constitute such a breach
so long as Seller



16 has voted its interest in a manner that complies with the provisions of this
Section 6.1. Notwithstanding the foregoing, from and after the date hereof
until Closing, Seller shall promptly notify Buyer of any proposed AFEs,
pooling agreements or similar agreements relating to the Assets and provide
Buyer with a copy thereof. Upon any such notification, the Parties shall
negotiate in good faith to attempt to agree to a reasonable response to such
proposed AFE, pooling agreement or similar agreement relating to the Assets.

6.2 Successor Operator. While Buyer acknowledges that it or its designee
desires to succeed Seller as operator of those Assets or portions thereof that
Seller may presently operate, Buyer acknowledges and agrees that Seller cannot
and does not covenant or warrant that Buyer or its designee shall become
successor operator of such Assets since the Assets or portions thereof may be
subject to operating or other agreements that control the appointment of a
successor operator. Seller agrees, however, that as to the Assets it operates,
it shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to support Buyer's or its
designee's efforts to become successor operator of such Assets (to the extent
permitted under any applicable joint operating agreement) effective as of
Closing (at Buyer's sole cost and expense) and to designate and/or appoint, to
the extent legally possible and permitted under any applicable joint operating
agreement, Buyer or its designee as successor operator of such Assets
effective as of Closing.

6.3 HSR Act. If applicable, within five (5) Business Days following the
execution by Buyer and Seller of this Agreement, Buyer and Seller will each
prepare and simultaneously file with the DOJ and the FTC the notification and
report form required for the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by
the HSR Act, and request early termination of the waiting period thereunder.
Buyer and Seller agree to respond promptly to any inquiries from the DOJ or
the FTC concerning such filings and to comply in all material respects with
the filing requirements of the HSR Act. Buyer and Seller shall cooperate with
each other and, subject to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, shall
promptly furnish all information to the other Party that is necessary in
connection with Buyer's and Seller's compliance with the HSR Act. Buyer and
Seller shall keep each other fully advised with respect to any requests from
or communications with the DOJ or FTC concerning such filings and shall
consult with each other with respect to all responses thereto. Each of Seller
and Buyer shall use its reasonable efforts to take all actions reasonably
necessary and appropriate in connection with any HSR Act filing to consummate
the transactions consummated hereby. Any fees or expenses related to filings
required by this Section 6.3 shall be paid by the Buyer. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, nothing in this Section 6.3 shall require, or be construed to
require, Buyer or its Affiliates to agree to: (i) sell, hold, divest,
discontinue or limit, before or after the Closing Date, any assets, businesses
or interests of Buyer or any of its Affiliates; (ii) any conditions relating
to, or changes or restrictions in, the operations of any such assets,
businesses or interests which, in either case, could reasonably be expected to
materially and adversely impact the economic or business benefits to Buyer or
any of its Affiliates of the Transaction; or (iii) any material modification
or waiver of the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

6.4 Governmental Bonds. Buyer acknowledges that none of the bonds, letters of
credit and guarantees, if any, posted by Seller or its Affiliates with
Governmental Authorities and relating to the Assets are transferable to Buyer,
including those set forth on Schedule 6.4. On or before the Closing Date,
Buyer shall obtain, or cause to be obtained in the name of the Buyer,
replacements



17 for such bonds, letters of credit and guarantees to the extent such
replacements are necessary (a) for Buyer's ownership of the Assets and (b) to
permit the cancellation of the bonds, letters of credit and guarantees posted
by Seller and/or its Affiliates with respect to the Assets. In addition, at or
prior to Closing, Buyer shall deliver to Seller evidence of the posting of
bonds or other security with all applicable Governmental Authorities meeting
the requirements of such authorities to own and, where appropriate, operate,
the Assets.

6.5 Record Retention. Buyer shall, and shall request its successors and
assigns to, for a period of seven (7) years following Closing (a) retain the
Records, (b) provide Seller, its Affiliates and its and their officers,
employees and representatives with access to the Records (to the extent that
Seller has not retained the original or a copy) during normal business hours
for review and copying at Seller's expense, and (c) provide Seller, its
Affiliates and its and their officers, employees and representatives with
access, during normal business hours, to materials received or produced after
Closing relating to any indemnity claim made under Section 13.2 for review and
copying at Seller's expense.

6.6 Notification of Breaches. With respect to the representations and
warranties of Seller contained in this Agreement, Seller shall have the
continuing right until Closing to notify Buyer of any matter hereafter arising
or discovered which, if existing or known at the date hereof or thereafter,
would have been required to be set forth or described in the Schedules to
Seller's representations and warranties contained in this Agreement. Upon any
such notification, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to attempt to
agree to a reasonable cure of such breach of representation or warranty and if
such representation or warranty shall (if curable) be cured to the
satisfaction of Buyer prior to Closing, then such breach shall be considered
not to have occurred for all purposes of this Agreement. If the Parties are
unable to come to a good faith agreement with respect to the cure of such
breach of a representation or warranty prior to Closing, then the Parties
shall proceed to Closing and Buyer shall continue to have all rights under
Section 13.2 with respect to such breach.

6.7 Working Interest/Net Revenue Interest Reconciliation. Prior to Closing,
Seller shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to have prepared and
delivered to Buyer, with supporting documentation therefor and in reasonably
sufficient detail, a revised Exhibit A which includes an identification of
Seller's Working Interests and Net Revenue Interests in such of the Leases
that represent the top seventy-five percent (75%) of value of the Leases based
on the Allocated Values of such Leases. The information provided by Seller
pursuant to this Section 6.7 shall, on a consolidated basis with the mineral
fee interests and overriding royalty interests which appear on Exhibit A-2, be
consistent with the calculation of the Working Interests and Net Revenue
Interests which are set forth in Schedule 3.8, and shall be deemed to amend,
restate and replace the Exhibit A attached hereto.

6.8 Governmental Approvals.

(a) Buyer, within thirty (30) days after Closing, shall file for approval with
the applicable Governmental Authority the Assignment and other state, federal
and tribal transfer documents required to effectuate the transfer of the
Assets, including all Leases entered into with the Bureau of Indian Affairs or
the Bureau of Land Management that are identified on Exhibit A (the "BIA/BLM
Leases"). Buyer further agrees promptly after Closing to take all other
actions



18 required of it by federal, tribal or state agencies having jurisdiction to
obtain all requisite regulatory approvals with respect to this transaction,
and to use its best efforts to obtain the unconditional approval by such
federal, tribal or state agencies, as applicable, of (i) the documents
requiring federal, tribal or state approval in order for Buyer to be
recognized by the federal, tribal or state agencies as the owner of the
Assets, and (ii) its qualification as the operator of record with respect to
that portion of the Assets for which it is elected successor operator under
the operating agreements applicable to any of the Assets.

(b) Until all of the governmental approvals provided for in this Section 6.8
have been obtained by Buyer, the following shall occur with respect to the
affected portion of the Assets:

(i) Seller shall continue to hold record title to the affected Leases and
other affected portion of the Assets as nominee for Buyer;

(ii) Buyer shall assume responsibility for all of Buyer's Assumed Obligations
with respect to the affected Leases and other affected portion of the Assets
as if Buyer were the record owner of such Leases and other portion of the
Assets as of the Effective Time, and shall indemnify Seller with respect to
all Liabilities arising in connection with the ownership or operation of such
Leases and other Assets, as provided in Section 13.3;

(iii) Seller shall act as Buyer's nominee but shall be authorized to act only
upon and in accordance with Buyer's specific written instructions, and Seller
shall have no authority, responsibility or discretion to perform any tasks or
functions with respect to the affected Leases and other affected portion of
the Assets other than those which are purely administrative or ministerial in
nature, unless otherwise specifically requested and authorized by Buyer in
writing; and

(iv) if Seller continues to operate the affected Leases and other affected
portion of the Assets pending such approval, Seller and Buyer will have the
rights and obligations with respect to the operation of such Leases and other
Assets set forth in Section 6.1.

For the avoidance of doubt, subject to the terms of this Section 6.8, Seller
shall assign, and Buyer shall purchase and pay for, the affected Leases at
Closing.

(c) If the federal, tribal or state agency refuses to approve the Assignment
as contemplated by this Section 6.8, or fails to do so within twelve (12)
months after the Closing Date, Seller may continue to hold record title to the
affected Leases and other affected Assets as Buyer's nominee or at Seller's
option it may terminate this Agreement and all its obligations hereunder as to
the affected Leases and other affected portion of the Assets by giving thirty
(30) days written notice to Buyer. Upon such termination and as the exclusive
remedy for such termination: (i) this Agreement shall be null and void and
terminated as to the affected Leases and other affected portion of the Assets,
(ii) Buyer shall immediately reassign and return to Seller the Assignment and
any and all other documents, materials and data previously delivered to Buyer
with respect to the affected Leases and other affected portion of the Assets,
and (iii) Seller shall return to Buyer the Allocated Value of the affected
Leases and other affected portion of the Assets previously paid to Seller at
Closing, without interest, less the proceeds of production net of all
expenses, overhead, royalties,



19 and costs of operations (including plugging and abandonment expenses but
excluding mortgage interest and any burdens, liens, or encumbrances created by
Buyer which must be released prior to this payment) attributable to the
affected Leases or other affected portion of the Assets from the Effective
Date forward. In no event, however, shall Seller ever be required to reimburse
Buyer for any expenditures associated with workovers, recompletions, or the
drilling, completion or plugging and abandonment of wells drilled or work
performed by Buyer; provided, however, in the event that a well is proposed
and Buyer elects to participate therein prior to any reassignment of the
underlying affected Lease, Buyer shall be entitled to the assignment of any
such wellbore for which it paid promptly upon its making of such payment.
Seller will not be liable or obligated to Buyer if such federal, tribal or
state approvals are not obtained, except as expressly provided in this Section
6.8.

including the Confidentiality Agreement, shall terminate (except as to (a)
such portion of the Assets that are not conveyed to Buyer pursuant to the
provisions of this Agreement, (b) the Excluded Assets and (c) information
related to assets other than the Assets).

ARTICLE XI 
TITLE MATTERS; CASUALTY; TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS

11.1 Seller's Title.

(r) General Disclaimer of Title Warranties and Representations. Except for the
special warranty of title as set forth in Section 11.1(b) and in the
Assignment and the Deed, and without limiting Buyer's remedies for Title
Defects set forth in this Article XI, Seller makes no warranty or
representation, express, implied, statutory or otherwise, with respect to
Seller's title to any of the Assets and Buyer hereby acknowledges and agrees
that Buyer's sole remedy for any defect of title, including any Title Defect,
with respect to any of the Assets (i) before Closing, shall be as set forth in
Section 11.2 and (ii) after Closing, shall be pursuant to the special warranty
of title set forth in Section 11.1(b) and in the Assignment.

(s) Special Warranty of Title. If Closing occurs, then effective as of the
Closing Date, Seller warrants Defensible Title to the Assets (but, with
respect to any Lease and any Well associated therewith, limited to the depths
set forth in Exhibit A or Exhibit A-1, as applicable) unto Buyer against every
Person whomsoever lawfully claiming or to claim the same or any part thereof
by, through or under Seller or its Affiliates, but not otherwise, subject,
however, to any matters of record in the applicable counties or in the
applicable state or federal records prior to the Defect Claim Date. Said
special warranty of title shall be subject to the further limitations and
provisions of Section 11.1(c).

(t) Recovery on Special Warranty.

(i) Buyer's Assertion of Title Warranty Breaches. Buyer shall furnish Seller a
Title Defect Notice meeting the requirements of Section 11.2(a) setting forth
any matters which Buyer intends to assert as a breach of Seller's special
warranty in Section 11.1(b) or in the Assignment or the Deed. Seller shall
have a reasonable opportunity, but not the obligation, to cure any Title
Defect asserted by Buyer pursuant to this Section 11.1(c)(i). Buyer agrees to
reasonably cooperate with any attempt by Seller to cure any such Title Defect.



27 (ii) Limitations on Special Warranty. For purposes of Seller's special
warranty of title in Section 11.1(b) and in the Assignment and the Deed, the
value of the Wells and/or Leases set forth in Schedule 3.8, as appropriate
(but limited to the depths, if any, set forth on Exhibit A-1 for such Well
and/or Lease), shall be deemed to be the Allocated Value thereof, as adjusted
herein. Recovery on Seller's special warranty of title in the Assignment and
the Deed following Closing shall be limited to an amount (without any interest
accruing thereon) equal to the reduction in the Purchase Price to which Buyer
would have been entitled had Buyer asserted the Title Defect giving rise to
such breach of Seller's special warranty of title as a Title Defect prior to
Closing pursuant to Section 11.2, without taking into account the Individual
Title Defect Threshold or the Aggregate Deductible.

11.2 Notice of Title Defects; Defect Adjustments.

(e) Title Defect Notices. Buyer must deliver at least five (5) Business Days
before Closing (the "Defect Claim Date") claim notices to Seller meeting the
requirements of this Section 11.2(a) (collectively the "Title Defect Notices"
and individually a "Title Defect Notice") setting forth any matters which, in
Buyer's reasonable opinion, constitute Title Defects and which Buyer intends
to assert as a Title Defect pursuant to this Section 11.2(a). For all purposes
of this Agreement and except as provided in Section 11.1 with respect to
breaches of the special warranty of title, Buyer shall be deemed to have
waived, and Seller shall have no liability for, any Title Defect which Buyer
fails to assert as a Title Defect by a properly delivered Title Defect Notice
received by Seller on or before the Defect Claim Date; provided, however,
that, for purposes of Seller's special warranty to title under Section
11.1(b), such waiver shall not apply to any matter that prior to the Defect
Claim Date is neither reflected of record in the applicable counties or in the
applicable state or federal records nor discovered by any of Buyer's or any of
its Affiliate's employees, title attorneys, landmen or other title examiners
while conducting Buyer's due diligence with respect to the Assets. To be
effective, each Title Defect Notice shall be in writing, and shall include (i)
a description of the alleged Title Defect and the Asset, or portion thereof,
affected by such Title Defect (each a "Title Defect Property"), (ii) the
Allocated Value of each Title Defect Property, (iii) supporting documents
reasonably necessary for Seller to verify the existence of such alleged Title
Defect, and (iv) the amount by which Buyer reasonably believes the Allocated
Value of each Title Defect Property is reduced by such alleged Title Defect
and the computations upon which Buyer's belief is based. To give Seller an
opportunity to commence reviewing and curing Title Defects, Buyer agrees to
use reasonable efforts to give Seller, on or before the end of each calendar
week prior to the Defect Claim Date, written notice of all alleged Title
Defects discovered by Buyer during the preceding calendar week, which notice
may be preliminary in nature and supplemented prior to the Defect Claim Date.
Buyer shall also, promptly upon discovery, furnish Seller with written notice
of any Title Benefit which is discovered by any of Buyer's or any of its
Affiliate's employees, title attorneys, landmen or other title examiners while
conducting Buyer's due diligence with respect to the Assets prior to the
Defect Claim Date.

(f) Title Benefit Notices. Seller shall have the right, but not the
obligation, to deliver to Buyer on or before the Defect Claim Date with
respect to each Title Benefit a notice (a "Title Benefit Notice") including
(i) a description of the alleged Title Benefit and the Asset, or portion
thereof, affected by such alleged Title Benefit (each a "Title Benefit
Property"), (ii) supporting



28 documents reasonably necessary for Buyer to verify the existence of such
alleged Title Benefit, and (iii) the amount by which Seller reasonably
believes the Allocated Value of such Title Benefit Property is increased by
such alleged Title Benefit and the computations upon which Seller's belief is
based. Seller shall be deemed to have waived all Title Benefits for which a
Title Benefit Notice has not been delivered on or before the Defect Claim
Date.

(g) Seller's Right to Cure. Seller shall have the right, but not the
obligation, to attempt, at its sole cost, to cure at any time prior to Closing
(the "Cure Period"), any Title Defects of which it has been advised by Buyer.

(h) Remedies for Title Defects. Subject to Seller's continuing right to
dispute the existence of a Title Defect and/or the Title Defect Amount
asserted with respect thereto and subject to the rights of the Parties
pursuant to Section 14.1(c), in the event that any Title Defect timely
asserted by Buyer in accordance with Section 11.2(a) is not waived in writing
by Buyer or cured during the Cure Period, Seller shall, at its sole option
except with respect to (ii) below, elect to:

(i) subject to the Individual Title Defect Threshold and the Aggregate
Deductible, reduce the Purchase Price by the Title Defect Amount determined
pursuant to Section 11.2(g) or Section 11.2(j);

(ii) indemnify Buyer against all Liability resulting from such Title Defect
with respect to the Assets pursuant to an indemnity agreement in a form and
substance mutually agreed upon by the Parties (a "Title Indemnity Agreement");
provided, that if Buyer and Seller cannot mutually agree on a Title Indemnity
Agreement, Seller shall select another option;

(iii) retain the entirety of the Title Defect Property that is subject to such
Title Defect, together with all Assets located on any such Title Defect
Property or primarily used in connection therewith, in which event the
Purchase Price shall be reduced by an amount equal to the Allocated Value of
such Title Defect Property and such associated Assets; or

(iv) if applicable, terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 14.1(c).

(i) Remedies for Title Benefits. With respect to each Title Benefit Property
reported under Section 11.2(b), any Purchase Price reduction pursuant to
Section 11.2(d)(i) shall be offset by an amount (the "Title Benefit Amount")
equal to the increase in the Allocated Value for such Title Benefit Property
caused by such Title Benefit, as determined pursuant to Section 11.2(h) or
Section 11.2(j).

(j) Exclusive Remedy. Except for Buyer's rights under Seller's special
warranty of title under Section 11.1(b) and in the Assignment and the Deed and
Buyer's rights to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 14.1(c), the
provisions set forth in Section 11.2(d) shall be the exclusive right and
remedy of Buyer with respect to Seller's failure to have Defensible Title with
respect to any Asset or any other title matter.



29 (k) Title Defect Amount. The amount by which the Allocated Value of a Title
Defect Property is reduced as a result of the existence of a Title Defect
shall be the "Title Defect Amount" and shall be determined in accordance with
the following terms and conditions:

(i) if Buyer and Seller agree on the Title Defect Amount, then that amount
shall be the Title Defect Amount;

(ii) if the Title Defect is an Encumbrance that is undisputed and liquidated
in amount, then the Title Defect Amount shall be the amount necessary to be
paid to remove the Title Defect from the Title Defect Property;

(iii) if the Title Defect represents a discrepancy between (A) Seller's Net
Revenue Interest for any Title Defect Property and (B) the Net Revenue
Interest set forth for such Title Defect Property in Exhibit A, Exhibit A-1,
Exhibit A-2 or Schedule 3.8, as applicable, then the Title Defect Amount shall
be the product of the Allocated Value of such Title Defect Property multiplied
by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Net Revenue Interest decrease and
the denominator of which is the Net Revenue Interest set forth for such Title
Defect Property in Exhibit A, Exhibit A-1, Exhibit A-2 or Schedule 3.8, as
applicable; provided, however, that the Title Defect Amount with respect to
such Title Defect Property shall be equal to 100% of the Allocated Value of
such Title Defect Property if the Net Revenue Interest decrease for such Title
Defect Property results in a Net Revenue Interest of less than 75% (on an
8/8ths basis);

(iv) if the Title Defect represents an obligation or Encumbrance upon or other
defect in title to the Title Defect Property of a type not described above,
then the Title Defect Amount shall be determined by taking into account the
Allocated Value of the Title Defect Property, the portion of the Title Defect
Property affected by the Title Defect, the legal effect of the Title Defect,
the potential economic effect of the Title Defect over the life of the Title
Defect Property, the values placed upon the Title Defect by Buyer and Seller
and such other reasonable factors as are necessary to make a proper
evaluation; provided, however, that if such Title Defect is cured by Seller
prior to Closing, the Title Defect Amount shall be zero;

(v) the Title Defect Amount with respect to a Title Defect Property shall be
determined without duplication of any costs or losses included in another
Title Defect Amount hereunder; and

(vi) notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article XI, the
aggregate Title Defect Amounts attributable to the effects of all Title
Defects upon any Title Defect Property shall not exceed the Allocated Value of
such Title Defect Property.

(l) Title Benefit Amount. The Title Benefit Amount resulting from a Title
Benefit shall be determined in accordance with the following methodology,
terms and conditions:

(i) if Buyer and Seller agree on the Title Benefit Amount, then that amount
shall be the Title Benefit Amount;



30 (ii) if the Title Benefit represents a discrepancy between (A) Seller's Net
Revenue Interest for any Title Benefit Property and (B) the Net Revenue
Interest set forth for such Title Benefit Property in Exhibit A, Exhibit A-1,
Exhibit A-2 or Schedule 3.8, as applicable, then the Title Benefit Amount
shall be the product of the Allocated Value of such Title Benefit Property
multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Net Revenue Interest
increase and the denominator of which is the Net Revenue Interest set forth
for such Title Benefit Property in Exhibit A, Exhibit A-1, Exhibit A-2 or
Schedule 3.8, as applicable; and

(iii) if the Title Benefit is of a type not described above, then the Title
Benefit Amounts shall be determined by taking into account the Allocated Value
of Title Benefit Property, the portion of such Title Benefit Property affected
by such Title Benefit, the legal effect of the Title Benefit, the potential
economic effect of the Title Benefit over the life of such Title Benefit
Property, the values placed upon the Title Benefit by Buyer and Seller and
such other reasonable factors as are necessary to make a proper evaluation.

(m) Title Deductibles. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, (i) in no
event shall there be any adjustments to the Purchase Price or other remedies
provided by Seller for any individual Title Defect for which the Title Defect
Amount does not exceed $25,000 (the "Individual Title Defect Threshold"); and
(ii) in no event shall there be any adjustments to the Purchase Price or other
remedies provided by Seller for any Title Defect that exceeds the Individual
Title Defect Threshold unless (A) the amount of the sum of (1) the aggregate
Title Defect Amounts of all such Title Defects that exceed the Individual
Title Defect Threshold (but excluding any such Title Defects cured by Seller),
plus (2) the aggregate Remediation Amounts of all Environmental Defects that
exceed the Individual Environmental Threshold (but excluding any Environmental
Defects cured by Seller), exceeds (B) the Aggregate Deductible, after which
point Buyer shall be entitled to adjustments to the Purchase Price or other
applicable remedies available hereunder, but, only with respect to the
aggregate amount of such Title Defect Amounts and Remediation Amounts in
excess of the Aggregate Deductible.

(n) Title Dispute Resolution. Seller and Buyer shall attempt to agree on all
Title Defects, Title Benefits, Title Defect Amounts and Title Benefit Amounts
prior to Closing. If Seller and Buyer are unable to agree by Closing, the
Title Defect Amounts and Title Benefit Amounts in dispute shall be exclusively
and finally resolved pursuant to this Section 11.2(j). There shall be a single
arbitrator, who shall be a title attorney with at least ten (10) years'
experience in oil and gas titles involving properties in the regional area in
which the Title Defect Properties are located, as selected by mutual agreement
of Buyer and Seller within fifteen (15) days after the end of the Cure Period,
and absent such agreement, by the Houston, Texas office of the American
Arbitration Association (the "Title Arbitrator"). The arbitration proceeding
shall be held in Houston, Texas and shall be conducted in accordance with the
Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association, to the
extent such rules do not conflict with the terms of this Section 11.2(j). The
Title Arbitrator's determination shall be made within twenty (20) days after
submission of the matters in dispute and shall be final and binding upon both
Parties, without right of appeal. In making its determination, the Title
Arbitrator shall be bound by the rules set forth in Section 11.2(g) and
Section 11.2(h) and, subject to the foregoing, may consider such other matters
as in the opinion of the Title Arbitrator are necessary to make a proper
determination. The Title Arbitrator,



31 however, may not award the Buyer a greater Title Defect Amount than the Title
Defect Amount claimed by Buyer in its applicable Title Defect Notice. The
Title Arbitrator shall act as an expert for the limited purpose of determining
the specific disputed Title Defect, Title Benefit, Title Defect Amount and/or
Title Benefit Amount submitted by either Party and may not award damages,
interest or penalties to either Party with respect to any matter. Seller and
Buyer shall each bear its own legal fees and other costs of presenting its
case. Each of Seller and Buyer shall bear one-half of the costs and expenses
of the Title Arbitrator. To the extent that the award of the Title Arbitrator
with respect to any Title Defect Amount or Title Benefit Amount is not taken
into account as an adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to Section 3.5 or
Section 3.6, then within ten (10) days after the Title Arbitrator delivers
written notice to Buyer and Seller of his award with respect to a Title Defect
Amount or a Title Benefit Amount and, subject to Section 11.2(i) (i) Buyer
shall pay to Seller the amount, if any, so awarded by the Title Arbitrator to
Seller, and (ii) Seller shall pay to Buyer the amount, if any, so awarded by
the Title Arbitrator to Buyer. Nothing herein shall operate to cause Closing
to be delayed on account of any arbitration conducted pursuant to this Section
11.2(j) and, to the extent any adjustments are not agreed upon by the Parties
as of Closing, the Purchase Price shall not be adjusted therefor at Closing
and subsequent adjustments to the Purchase Price, if any, will be made
pursuant to Section 3.6 or this Section 11.2.

11.3 Casualty Loss. (a) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, from
and after the Effective Time, if Closing occurs, Buyer shall assume all risk
of loss with respect to production of Hydrocarbons through normal depletion
(including watering out of any well, collapsed casing or sand infiltration of
any well) and the depreciation of Personal Property due to ordinary wear and
tear, in each case, with respect to the Assets.

(a) If, after the date of this Agreement but prior to the Closing Date, any
portion of the Assets is destroyed by fire or other casualty (each, a
"Casualty Loss"), the Closing shall nevertheless occur despite such Casualty
Loss without any adjustment to the Purchase Price, and Seller, at Closing,
shall pay to Buyer all sums paid to Seller by Third Parties by reason of any
Casualty Loss insofar as with respect to the Assets and shall assign, transfer
and set over to Buyer or subrogate Buyer to all of Seller's right, title and
interest (if any) in insurance claims, unpaid awards, and other rights against
Third Parties (excluding any Liabilities, other than insurance claims, of or
against any Seller Indemnified Parties) arising out of such Casualty Loss
insofar as with respect to the Assets.

11.4 Preferential Purchase Rights and Consents to Assign.

(a) With respect to each Preferential Purchase Right set forth in Schedule
4.10, Seller, promptly following the date hereof, shall send to the holder of
each such Preferential Purchase Right a notice in material compliance with the
contractual provisions applicable to such Preferential Purchase Right.

(i) If, prior to Closing, any holder of a Preferential Purchase Right notifies
Seller that it intends to consummate the purchase of the Asset to which its
Preferential Purchase Right applies or if the time for exercising such
Preferential Purchase Right has not expired, then the Asset subject to such
Preferential Purchase Right shall be excluded from the Assets to be assigned
to Buyer at Closing (but only to the extent of the portion of such Asset
affected by the



32 Preferential Purchase Right), and the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the
Allocated Value of the Asset (or portion thereof) so excluded. Seller shall be
entitled to all proceeds paid by any Person exercising a Preferential Purchase
Right prior to Closing. If such holder of such Preferential Purchase Right
thereafter fails to consummate the purchase of the Asset (or portion thereof)
covered by such Preferential Purchase Right on or before sixty (60) days
following the Closing Date, or the time for exercising such Preferential
Purchase Right expires without exercise by the holder thereof (A) Seller shall
so notify Buyer and (B) Buyer shall purchase, on or before ten (10) days
following receipt of such notice, such Asset (or portion thereof) that was so
excluded from Seller, under the terms of this Agreement and for a price equal
to the amount by which the Purchase Price was reduced at Closing with respect
to such excluded Asset (or portion thereof).

(ii) All Assets for which any applicable Preferential Purchase Right has been
waived, or as to which the period to exercise the applicable Preferential
Purchase Right has expired, in each case, prior to Closing, shall be sold to
Buyer at Closing pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement.

(b) With respect to each Consent set forth in Schedule 4.4, Seller, promptly
following the date hereof, shall send to the holder of each such Consent a
notice in material compliance with the contractual provisions applicable to
such Consent seeking such holder's consent to the transactions contemplated
hereby.

(i) If, prior to Closing, Seller fails to obtain any Hard Consent, then the
Asset (or portion thereof) affected by such un-obtained Hard Consent shall be,
at the option of Buyer, excluded from the Assets to be assigned to Buyer at
Closing, and the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the Allocated Value of
such Asset (or portion thereof) so excluded. In the event that a Hard Consent
(with respect to an Asset excluded pursuant to this Section 11.4(b)(i)) that
was not obtained prior to Closing is obtained within a period of one hundred
eighty (180) days following Closing, then, within ten (10) days after such
Hard Consent is obtained (x) Buyer shall purchase the Asset (or portion
thereof) that was so excluded as a result of such previously un-obtained Hard
Consent under the terms of this Agreement and pay to Seller the amount by
which the Purchase Price was reduced at Closing with respect to the Asset (or
portion thereof) so excluded and (y) Seller shall assign to Buyer the Asset
(or portion thereof) so excluded at Closing pursuant to an instrument in
substantially the same form as the Assignment. If Buyer purchases the Asset as
provided in this Section 11.4(b)(i), Buyer shall retain all revenue and be
responsible for any expense attributable to such Asset from and after the
Effective Time. In the event Buyer exercises its option to require the
assignment of any Asset that is subject to an un-obtained Hard Consent as part
of the Assets, Buyer shall have no claim against, and Seller shall have no
Liability for, the failure to obtain such Hard Consent.

(ii) If, prior to Closing, Seller fails to obtain a Consent set forth in
Schedule 4.4 that is not a Hard Consent, then the Asset (or portion thereof)
subject to such un-obtained Consent shall nevertheless be assigned by Seller
to Buyer at Closing as part of the Assets and Buyer shall have no claim
against, and Seller shall have no Liability for, the failure to obtain such
Consent.



33 (iii) Prior to Closing, Seller and Buyer shall use their commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain all Consents listed on Schedule 4.4; provided,
however, that neither Party shall be required to incur any Liability or pay
any money in order to obtain any such Consent. Prior to and for a period of
one hundred eighty (180) days following the Closing, Seller and Buyer shall
use their commercially reasonable efforts, but without any obligation to incur
any Liability or pay any money in connection therewith, to obtain all Hard
Consents listed on Schedule 4.4. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section
11.4(b) shall not apply to the BIA/BLM Leases.

ARTICLE XII 
ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

12.1 Notice of Environmental Defects.

(a) Environmental Defects Notice. Buyer must deliver, at or prior to the
Defect Claim Date, claim notices to Seller meeting the requirements of this
Section 12.1(a) (collectively the "Environmental Defect Notices" and
individually an "Environmental Defect Notice") setting forth any matters
which, in Buyer's reasonable opinion, constitute Environmental Defects and
which Buyer intends to assert as Environmental Defects pursuant to this
Section 12.1. For all purposes of this Agreement, but subject to Buyer's
remedy for a breach of Seller's representation contained in Section 4.14,
Buyer shall be deemed to have waived, and Seller shall have no liability for,
any Environmental Defect which Buyer fails to assert as an Environmental
Defect by a properly delivered Environmental Defect Notice received by Seller
on or before the Defect Claim Date. To be effective, each Environmental Defect
Notice shall be in writing and shall include (i) a description of the matter
constituting the alleged Environmental Condition (including the applicable
Environmental Law violated or implicated thereby) and the Assets affected by
such alleged Environmental Condition, (ii) the Allocated Value of the Assets
(or portions thereof) affected by such alleged Environmental Condition, (iii)
supporting documents reasonably necessary for Seller to verify the existence
of such alleged Environmental Condition, and (iv) a calculation of the
Remediation Amount (itemized in reasonable detail) that Buyer asserts is
attributable to such alleged Environmental Defect. Buyer's calculation of the
Remediation Amount included in the Environmental Defect Notice must describe
in reasonable detail the Remediation proposed for the alleged Environmental
Condition that gives rise to the asserted Environmental Defect and identify
all assumptions used by the Buyer in calculating the Remediation Amount,
including the standards that Buyer asserts must be met to comply with
Environmental Laws. Seller shall have the right, but not the obligation, to
cure any asserted Environmental Defect on or before Closing.

(b) Remedies for Environmental Defects.

(xii) Subject to Seller's continuing right to dispute the existence of an
Environmental Defect and/or the Remediation Amount asserted with respect
thereto, and subject to the rights of the Parties pursuant to Section 14.1(c),
in the event that any Environmental Defect timely asserted by Buyer in
accordance with Section 12.1(a) is not waived in writing by Buyer or cured
during the Cure Period, Buyer shall, at its sole option, elect to (A) assume
the entirety of the Asset that is subject to such Environmental Defect,
together with all associated Assets, or (B) cause Seller to retain the
entirety of such Assets. If Buyer elects the option set forth in clause (A),
Seller shall, at its sole option, elect to (1) subject to the Individual
Environmental Threshold and the



34 Aggregate Deductible, reduce the Purchase Price by the Remediation Amount, or
(2) assume responsibility for the Remediation of such Environmental Defect. If
Buyer elects the option set forth in clause (B), Seller shall, at its sole
option, elect to (1) subject to the Individual Environmental Threshold and the
Aggregate Deductible, reduce the Purchase Price by an amount equal to the
Allocated Value of the Asset that is subject to such Environmental Defect and
such associated Assets, or (2) if applicable, terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Section 14.1(c).

(xiii) If Buyer elects the option set forth in clause (A) above and Seller
then elects the option set forth in clause (1), Buyer shall be deemed to have
assumed responsibility for all of the costs and expenses attributable to the
Remediation of the Environmental Condition attributable to such Environmental
Defect and all of all Liabilities with respect thereto and such responsibility
of Buyer shall be deemed to constitute part of the Assumed Obligations
hereunder. If Buyer elects the option set forth in clause (A) above and Seller
then elects the option set forth in clause (2), Seller shall use reasonable
efforts to implement such Remediation in a manner which is consistent with the
requirements of Environmental Laws in a timely fashion for the type of
Remediation that Seller elects to undertake and Buyer, effective as of
Closing, hereby grants to Seller and its representatives, access to the Assets
to conduct such Remediation. Seller will be deemed to have adequately
completed the Remediation required in the immediately preceding sentence (X)
upon receipt of a certificate or approval from the applicable Governmental
Authority that the Remediation has been implemented to the extent necessary to
comply with existing Laws or (Y) upon receipt of a certificate from a licensed
professional engineer that the Remediation has been implemented to the extent
necessary to comply with existing Laws.

(c) Exclusive Remedy. Except for Buyer's remedy for a breach of Seller's
representation contained in Section 4.14 and Buyer's rights to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 14.1(c), the provisions set forth in Section
12.1(b) shall be the exclusive right and remedy of Buyer with respect to any
Environmental Defect with respect to any Asset or other environmental matter.

(d) Environmental Deductibles. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, (i)
in no event shall there be any adjustments to the Purchase Price or other
remedies provided by Seller for any individual Environmental Defect for which
the Remediation Amount does not exceed $100,000 (the "Individual Environmental
Threshold"); and (ii) in no event shall there be any adjustments to the
Purchase Price or other remedies provided by Seller for any Environmental
Defect for which the Remediation Amount exceeds the Individual Environmental
Threshold unless (A) the amount of the sum of (1) the aggregate Remediation
Amounts of all such Environmental Defects that exceed the Individual
Environmental Threshold (but excluding any Environmental Defects cured by
Seller), plus (2) the aggregate Title Defect Amounts of all Title Defects that
exceed the Individual Title Defect Threshold (but excluding any Title Defects
cured by Seller), exceeds (B) the Aggregate Deductible, after which point
Buyer shall be entitled to adjustments to the Purchase Price or other
applicable remedies available hereunder, but only with respect to the
aggregate amount of such Remediation Amounts and Title Defect Amounts in
excess of the Aggregate Deductible.

(e) Environmental Dispute Resolution. Seller and Buyer shall attempt to agree
on all Environmental Defects and Remediation Amounts prior to Closing. If
Seller and Buyer are



35 unable to agree by Closing, the Environmental Defects and/or Remediation
Amounts in dispute shall be exclusively and finally resolved by arbitration
pursuant to this Section 12.1(e). There shall be a single arbitrator, who
shall be an environmental attorney with at least ten years' experience in
environmental matters involving oil and gas producing properties in the
regional area in which the affected Assets are located, as selected by mutual
agreement of Buyer and Seller within fifteen (15) days after the Closing Date,
and absent such agreement, by the Houston, Texas office of the American
Arbitration Association (the "Environmental Arbitrator"). The arbitration
proceeding shall be held in Houston, Texas and shall be conducted in
accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration
Association, to the extent such rules do not conflict with the terms of this
Section 12.1. The Environmental Arbitrator's determination shall be made
within twenty (20) days after submission of the matters in dispute and shall
be final and binding upon both Parties, without right of appeal. In making its
determination, the Environmental Arbitrator shall be bound by the rules set
forth in this Section 12.1 and, subject to the foregoing, may consider such
other matters as in the opinion of the Environmental Arbitrator are necessary
or helpful to make a proper determination. The Environmental Arbitrator,
however, may not award Buyer its share of any greater Remediation Amount than
the Remediation Amount claimed by Buyer in its applicable Environmental Defect
Notice. The Environmental Arbitrator shall act as an expert for the limited
purpose of determining the specific disputed Environmental Defects and/or
Remediation Amounts submitted by either Party and may not award damages,
interest or penalties to either Party with respect to any matter. Seller and
Buyer shall each bear its own legal fees and other costs of presenting its
case. Each of Seller and Buyer shall bear one-half of the costs and expenses
of the Environmental Arbitrator. To the extent that the award of the
Environmental Arbitrator with respect to any Remediation Amount is not taken
into account as an adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to Section 3.5 or
Section 3.6, then, within ten (10) days after the Environmental Arbitrator
delivers written notice to Buyer and Seller of his award with respect to any
Remediation Amount, and subject to Section 12.1(d) (i) Buyer shall pay to
Seller the amount, if any, so awarded by the Environmental Arbitrator to
Seller, and (ii) Seller shall pay to Buyer the amount, if any, so awarded by
the Environmental Arbitrator to Buyer. Nothing herein shall operate to cause
Closing to be delayed on account of any arbitration conducted pursuant to this
Section 12.1(e), and to the extent any adjustments are not agreed upon by the
Parties as of Closing, the Purchase Price shall not be adjusted therefor at
Closing and subsequent adjustments to the Purchase Price, if any, will be made
pursuant to Section 3.6 or this Section 12.1(e).

12.2 NORM, Wastes and Other Substances. Buyer acknowledges that the Assets
have been used for exploration, development, and production of oil and gas and
that there may be petroleum, produced water, wastes or other substances or
materials located in, on or under the Assets or associated with the Assets.
Equipment and sites included in the Assets may contain asbestos, NORM or other
Hazardous Substances. NORM may affix or attach itself to the inside of wells,
materials and equipment as scale, or in other forms. The wells, materials and
equipment located on the Assets or included in the Assets may contain NORM and
other wastes or Hazardous Substances. NORM containing material and/or other
wastes or Hazardous Substances may have come in contact with various
environmental media, including, water, soils or sediment. Special procedures
may be required for the assessment, remediation, removal, transportation, or
disposal of environmental media, wastes, asbestos, NORM and other Hazardous
Substances from the Assets.



36 ARTICLE XIII 
ASSUMPTION; INDEMNIFICATION; SURVIVAL

13.1 Assumption by Buyer. Without limiting Buyer's rights to indemnity under
this Article XIII, including for the Seller Retained Obligations, and Buyer's
rights under any Title Indemnity Agreement, and subject to the covenants of

after Closing, Buyer assumes and hereby agrees to fulfill, perform, pay and
discharge (or cause to be fulfilled, performed, paid and discharged) all of
Seller's obligations and Liabilities, known or unknown, arising from, based
upon, related to or associated with the Assets, regardless of whether such

any sales or use Tax for which Seller is responsible under this Agreement as a
result of the sale of Assets contemplated by this Agreement; or

(xvii) attributable to or arise out of the actions, litigation, suits or other
proceedings, if any, pending against Seller and relating to the Assets as of
the Closing Date (including those set forth in Schedule 13.1), except insofar
and only insofar as they are attributable or relate to the ownership or
operation of the Assets, or production therefrom, for periods after the
Effective Time.

limitations set forth in Section 13.4 and Section 13.8 or otherwise in this
Agreement, Seller shall be responsible for, shall pay on a current basis and
hereby defends, indemnifies, holds harmless and forever releases Buyer and its
Affiliates, and all of its and their respective equityholders, partners,
members, directors, officers, managers, employees, agents and representatives
(collectively, "Buyer Indemnified Parties") from and against any and all
Liabilities, whether or not relating to Third Party claims or incurred in the
investigation or defense of any of the same or in asserting, preserving or
enforcing any of their respective rights hereunder, arising from, based upon,
related to or associated with:



37 (c) any breach by Seller of any of its representations or warranties contained
in Article IV;

(f) the actions, suits or proceedings, if any, set forth in Schedule 13.1 and
any other actions, suits or proceedings required by this Agreement to be set

13.3 Indemnities of Buyer. Effective as of Closing, Buyer and its successors
and assigns shall assume, be responsible for, shall pay on a current basis,
and hereby defends, indemnifies, holds harmless and forever releases Seller
and its Affiliates, and all of its and their respective equityholders,

representatives (collectively, "Seller Indemnified Parties") from and against
any and all Liabilities, whether or not relating to Third Party claims or
incurred in the investigation or defense of any of the same or in asserting,
preserving or enforcing any of their respective rights hereunder, arising
from, based upon, related to or associated with:

(a) any breach by Buyer of any of its representations or warranties contained
in Article V;

(a) Seller shall not have any liability for any indemnification under Section
13.2(a) or (b) of this Agreement (other than with respect to breaches of the
representations set forth in Sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.15 and 4.16) (i) for
any individual Liability unless the amount with respect to such Liability
exceeds $100,000, and (ii) until and unless the aggregate amount of all
Liabilities for which Claim Notices are delivered by Buyer exceeds two percent
of the Purchase Price, and then only to the extent such Liabilities exceed two
percent of the Purchase Price; provided that the adjustments to the Purchase
Price under Section 3.3, Section 3.5, Section 3.6, Section 3.7 or Section
13.2(a) (solely with respect to any breach by Seller of any of its
representations or warranties contained in the last sentence of Section 4.4)
and any payments in respect thereof shall not be limited by this Section
13.4(a).

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
Seller shall not be required to indemnify Buyer for aggregate Liabilities in
excess of fifteen percent (15%) of the Purchase Price; provided that the
adjustments to the Purchase Price under Section 3.3, Section



38 3.5, Section 3.6 and Section 3.7 and any payments in respect thereof shall not
be limited by this Section 13.4(b).

13.5 Express Negligence. THE DEFENSE, INDEMNIFICATION, HOLD HARMLESS, RELEASE
AND ASSUMED OBLIGATIONS PROVISIONS PROVIDED FOR IN THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE
APPLICABLE WHETHER OR NOT THE LIABILITIES, LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES AND DAMAGES
IN QUESTION AROSE OR RESULTED SOLELY OR IN PART FROM THE ACTIVE, PASSIVE,
CONCURRENT OR COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER FAULT OR
VIOLATION OF LAW OF OR BY ANY INDEMNIFIED PARTY. BUYER AND SELLER ACKNOWLEDGE
THAT THIS STATEMENT COMPLIES WITH THE EXPRESS NEGLIGENCE RULE AND IS
CONSPICUOUS.

13.6 Exclusive Remedy. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, the Parties agree that, from and after Closing, Section
10.1(c), Section 11.1(c), Section 13.2 and Section 13.3, Seller's special
warranty of title in the Assignment and the Deed and any Title Indemnity
Agreement entered into by the Parties, contain the Parties' exclusive remedies
against each other with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby,
including breaches of the representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements of the Parties contained in this Agreement or in any document or
certificate delivered pursuant to this Agreement. Except as specified in
Section 11.1(c), Section 13.2 and any Title Indemnity Agreement entered into
by the Parties, effective as of Closing, Buyer, on its own behalf and on
behalf of the Buyer Indemnified Parties, hereby releases, remises and forever
discharges Seller and its Affiliates and all such Persons' equityholders,
partners, members, directors, officers, employees, agents and representatives
from any and all suits, legal or administrative proceedings, claims, demands,
damages, losses, costs, Liabilities, interest or causes of action whatsoever,
in Law or in equity, known or unknown, which Buyer or the Buyer Indemnified
Parties might now or subsequently may have, based on, relating to or arising
out of this Agreement, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the
ownership, use or operation of any of the Assets prior to Closing or the
condition, quality, status or nature of any of the Assets prior to Closing,
including rights to contribution under the Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, as amended, breaches of
statutory or implied warranties, nuisance or other tort actions, rights to
punitive damages, common Law rights of contribution and rights under insurance
maintained by Seller or any of its Affiliates.

13.7 Indemnification Procedures. All claims for indemnification under Section
10.1(c), Section 13.2 and Section 13.3 shall be asserted and resolved as
follows:

(a) For purposes of Section 10.1(c) and this Article XIII, the term
"Indemnifying Party" when used in connection with particular Liabilities shall
mean the Party or Parties having an obligation to indemnify another Party or
Parties with respect to such Liabilities pursuant to Section 10.1(c) or this
Article XIII, and the term "Indemnified Party" when used in connection with
particular Liabilities shall mean the Party or Parties having the right to be
indemnified with respect to such Liabilities by another Party or Parties
pursuant to Section 10.1(c) or this Article XIII.

(b) To make claim for indemnification under Section 10.1(c), Section 13.2 and
Section 13.3, an Indemnified Party shall notify the Indemnifying Party of its
claim under this



39 Section 13.7, including the specific details of and specific basis under this
Agreement for its claim (the "Claim Notice"). In the event that the claim for
indemnification is based upon a claim by a Third Party against the Indemnified
Party (a "Third Party Claim"), the Indemnified Party shall provide its Third
Party Claim Notice promptly after the Indemnified Party has actual knowledge
of the Third Party Claim and shall enclose a copy of all papers (if any)
served with respect to the Third Party Claim; provided that the failure of any
Indemnified Party to give notice of a Third Party Claim as provided in this
Section 13.7(b) shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations
under Section 10.1(c), Section 13.2 and Section 13.3 (as applicable) except to
the extent such failure results in insufficient time being available to permit
the Indemnifying Party to effectively defend against the Third Party Claim or
otherwise materially prejudices the Indemnifying Party's ability to defend
against the Third Party Claim. In the event that the claim for indemnification
is based upon an inaccuracy or breach of a representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement, the Third Party Claim Notice shall specify the representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement that was inaccurate or breached.

(c) In the case of a claim for indemnification based upon a Third Party Claim,
the Indemnifying Party shall have thirty (30) days from its receipt of the
Claim Notice to notify the Indemnified Party whether it admits or denies its
liability to defend the Indemnified Party against such Third Party Claim at
the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party. The Indemnified Party is
authorized, prior to and during such thirty (30) day period, to file any
motion, answer or other pleading that it shall deem necessary or appropriate
to protect its interests or those of the Indemnifying Party and that is not
prejudicial to the Indemnifying Party.

(d) If the Indemnifying Party admits its liability to defend the Indemnified
Party against a Third Party Claim, it shall have the right and obligation to
diligently defend, at its sole cost and expense, the Indemnified Party against
such Third Party Claim. The Indemnifying Party shall have full control of such
defense and proceedings, including any compromise or settlement thereof. If
requested by the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party agrees to cooperate
in contesting any Third Party Claim which the Indemnifying Party elects to
contest. The Indemnified Party may participate in, but not control, any
defense or settlement of any Third Party Claim controlled by the Indemnifying
Party pursuant to this Section 13.7(d). An Indemnifying Party shall not,
without the written consent of the Indemnified Party, (i) settle any Third
Party Claim or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect thereto which
does not include an unconditional written release of the Indemnified Party
from all liability in respect of such Third Party Claim or (ii) settle any
Third Party Claim or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect thereto
in any manner that may materially and adversely affect the Indemnified Party
(other than as a result of money damages covered by the indemnity).

(e) If the Indemnifying Party does not admit its liability or admits its
liability to defend the Indemnified Party against a Third Party Claim, but
fails to diligently prosecute, indemnify against or settle the Third Party
Claim, then the Indemnified Party shall have the right to defend against the
Third Party Claim at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party, with
counsel of the Indemnified Party's choosing, subject to the right of the
Indemnifying Party to admit its liability and assume the defense of the Third
Party Claim at any time prior to settlement or final determination thereof. If
the Indemnifying Party has not yet admitted its liability to defend the



40 Indemnified Party against a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall
send written notice to the Indemnifying Party of any proposed settlement and
the Indemnifying Party shall have the option for ten (10) days following
receipt of such notice to (i) admit in writing its liability to indemnify the
Indemnified Party from and against the liability and consent to such
settlement and (ii) if liability is so admitted, reject, in its reasonable
judgment, the proposed settlement, or (iii) deny liability. Any failure to
respond such notice by the Indemnified Party shall be deemed to be an election
under subsection (i) above.

(f) In the case of a claim for indemnification not based upon a Third Party
Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall have thirty (30) days from its receipt of
the Claim Notice to (i) cure the Liabilities complained of, (ii) admit its
liability for such Liability or (iii) dispute the claim for such Liabilities.
If the Indemnifying Party does not notify the Indemnified Party within such
thirty (30) day period that it has cured the Liabilities or that it disputes
the claim for such Liabilities, the amount of such Liabilities shall
conclusively be deemed a liability of the Indemnifying Party hereunder.

13.8 Survival.

(a) The representations and warranties of the Parties in Article IV and
Article V (other than the representations and warranties in Sections 4.1, 4.2,
4.3, 4.6, 4.15, 4.16, 5.1, 5.2, 5.9, 5.10 and 5.11, and the covenants and
agreements of the Parties in Section 15.2(b)), and the covenants and
agreements of the Parties in Section 9.4, shall survive Closing for a period
of nine (9) months. Subject to the foregoing and Section 13.8(b), the
remainder of this Agreement (including Sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.6, 4.15,
4.16, 5.1, 5.2, 5.9, 5.10 and 5.11 and the covenants and agreements of the
Parties in Section 15.2(b)) shall survive Closing without time limit.
Representations, warranties, covenants and agreements shall be of no further
force and effect after the date of their expiration, provided that there shall
be no termination of any bona fide claim asserted pursuant to this Agreement
with respect to such a representation, warranty, covenant or agreement prior
to its expiration date.

(b) The indemnities in Section 13.2(a), Section 13.2(b), Section 13.3(a) and
Section 13.3(b) shall terminate as of the expiration date of each respective
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement that is subject to
indemnification, except in each case as to matters for which a specific
written claim for indemnity has been delivered to the Indemnifying Party on or
before such expiration date. Seller's indemnity in Section 13.2(c) shall
survive Closing for a period of twelve (12) months. Seller's indemnity in
Section 13.2(d) shall survive Closing without time limit and Buyer's
indemnities in Section 10.1(c) and in Section 13.3(c) shall survive Closing
without time limit.

13.9 Indemnity Escrow. In order to provide security for Seller's
indemnification obligations under this Agreement, the Transition Services
Agreement, the special warranty of title in the Assignment and the Deed and
any Title Indemnity Agreement, the Indemnity Escrow shall be held by Escrow
Agent, and disbursed by Escrow Agent after the Closing in accordance with this
Section 13.9 and the Escrow Agreement. With respect to each claim for
indemnification asserted by Buyer against Seller pursuant to this Agreement,
the Transition Services Agreement, the special warranty of title in the
Assignment or the Deed or any Title Indemnity Agreement during the period from
and after the Closing Date up to the date that is six months following the
Closing Date (the



41 "Escrow Termination Date"), upon final resolution or determination of such an
indemnity or special warranty claim by the Parties, Buyer and Seller shall
jointly instruct Escrow Agent to disburse to Buyer the amount set forth in
such joint instruction, which will be that portion of the Indemnity Escrow
being held in the Indemnity Escrow account as would satisfy such finally
resolved or determined indemnity or warranty claim. On the Escrow Termination
Date, Seller shall, subject to the remainder of this sentence, be entitled to
receive the Indemnity Escrow balance as of such time and such amount shall be
distributed to Seller pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement (and Buyer
and Seller shall jointly instruct Escrow Agent to take any necessary actions
in order to accomplish the foregoing); provided, however, that Seller at such
time shall not be entitled to, and Escrow Agent shall retain, any amounts
necessary to satisfy any unresolved Claim Notices that have been timely
delivered by Buyer (which amounts shall remain in the Indemnity Escrow until
such Claim Notices are finally resolved or determined). If there are remaining
amounts due by Seller to Buyer pursuant to its indemnity obligations after the
Indemnity Escrow balance is exhausted, then such amounts shall be promptly
paid to Buyer by Seller as they are agreed by Buyer and Seller or finally
determined in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. If there are any
funds remaining in the Indemnity Escrow account after the resolution of all
previously outstanding Claim Notices, then Seller and Buyer shall promptly
jointly instruct Escrow Agent to release the remaining account balance to
Seller.

13.10 Waiver of Right to Rescission. Seller and Buyer acknowledge that,
following Closing, the payment of money, as limited by the terms of this
Agreement, shall be adequate compensation for breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein or for any other claim
arising in connection with or with respect to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. As the payment of money shall be adequate compensation,
following Closing, Buyer and Seller waive any right to rescind this Agreement
or any of the transactions contemplated hereby.

13.11 Insurance. The amount of any Liabilities for which any of the Buyer
Indemnified Parties or Seller Indemnified Parties is entitled to
indemnification under this Agreement or in connection with or with respect to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be reduced by any
corresponding insurance proceeds, from insurance policies carried by a party
realized by such Party.

13.12 Non-Compensatory Damages. None of the Buyer Indemnified Parties nor
Seller Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to recover from Seller or Buyer,
or their respective Affiliates, any special, indirect, consequential,
punitive, exemplary, remote or speculative damages, including damages for lost
profits of any kind, arising under or in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, except to the extent (a) any such damages or
lost profits would otherwise be recoverable under applicable Law in an action
for breach of contract as natural, probable and reasonably foreseeable damages
for such breach or (b) any such Party suffers such damages to a Third Party,
which damages (including costs of defense and reasonable attorneys' fees
incurred in connection with defending against such damages) shall not be
excluded by this provision as to recovery hereunder. Subject to the preceding

ARTICLE XIV 
TERMINATION, DEFAULT AND REMEDIES

14.1 Right of Termination. This Agreement and the transactions contemplated
herein may be terminated at any time prior to Closing:

(g) by Seller, at Seller's option, if any of the conditions set forth in
Article VIII have not been satisfied on or before the Closing Date;

(h) by Buyer, at Buyer's option, if any of the conditions set forth in Article
VII have not been satisfied on or before the Closing Date and, following
written notice thereof from Buyer to Seller specifying the reason such
condition is unsatisfied (including any breach by Seller of this Agreement),
such condition remains unsatisfied for a period of ten (10) Business Days
after Seller's receipt of written notice thereof from Buyer;

(i) by Buyer if the condition set forth in Section 7.4 has not been satisfied
on or before the Closing Date or by Seller if the condition set forth in
Section 8.4 is not satisfied on or before the Closing Date; or

(j) by Seller or Buyer if Closing shall not have occurred on or before June
30, 2016;

provided, however, that no Party shall have the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to clause (a), (b) or (d) above if such Party or its
Affiliates are at such time in material breach of any provision of this
Agreement.

14.2 Effect of Termination; Remedies.

(d) If the obligation to close the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
is terminated pursuant to any provision of Section 14.1 hereof, then, except
as provided in this Section 14.2 and except for the provisions of Sections
1.1, 10.1(c) through (e), 10.2, 10.3, 13.12, this Section 14.2, Section 14.3
and Article XV (other than Sections 15.2(b), 15.7 and 15.8) and such of the
defined terms set forth on Appendix I to give context to such sections, this
Agreement shall forthwith become void and the Parties shall have no liability
or obligation hereunder except and to



43 the extent such termination results from the Willful Breach by a Party of any
of its covenants or agreements hereunder in which case the other Party shall
have the right to seek all remedies available at Law or in equity, including
specific performance, for such Willful Breach; provided that if Seller is
entitled to retain the Deposit as liquidated damages pursuant to Section
14.2(b), then such retention shall constitute full and complete satisfaction
of any and all damages Seller may have against Buyer.

(e) If (i) Seller has performed or is ready, willing and able to perform all
of its agreements and covenants contained herein which are to be performed or
observed by Seller at the Closing hereunder, (ii) Seller has the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 14.1(a) because of (A) the
failure of Buyer to materially perform any of its obligations hereunder, or
(B) the failure of any of Buyer's representations and warranties hereunder to
be true and correct in all material respects as of the date of this Agreement
and Closing, and (iii) all conditions precedent to the obligations of Buyer
set forth in Article VII (other than those actions or deliveries to occur at
Closing) have been met or waived by Buyer, then, in such event, Seller, as its
sole and exclusive remedy for such failure, may, terminate this Agreement and
the Deposit shall be paid to Seller as liquidated damages, free of any claims
of Buyer. The Parties agree upon the Deposit as liquidated damages due to the
difficulty and inconvenience of measuring actual damages and the uncertainty
thereof, and the Parties agree that such amount would be a reasonable estimate
of Seller's loss in the event of any such breach or failure to perform by
Buyer.

(f) If Closing does not occur for any reason other than as set forth in
Section 14.2(b), then Buyer shall be entitled to the delivery of the Deposit,
free of any claims by Seller with respect thereto.

(g) The Parties shall execute such joint instructions or other instruments as
necessary to cause any distribution of the Deposit that is required pursuant
to the terms of this Agreement.

14.3 Return of Documentation and Confidentiality. Upon termination of this
Agreement, Buyer shall return to Seller all title, engineering, geological and
geophysical data, environmental assessments and/or reports, maps and other
information furnished by Seller to Buyer or prepared by or on behalf of Buyer
in connection with its due diligence investigation of the Assets, in each case
in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement and an officer of Buyer shall
certify same to Seller in writing.

(d) All required documentary, filing and recording fees and expenses in

borne by Seller. Seller shall retain responsibility for, and shall bear and
pay, all federal income Taxes and state income Taxes (including any applicable

transactions described in this Agreement or (ii) the ownership of the Assets,
the production of Hydrocarbons, or the receipt of proceeds therefrom for all
periods on or prior to the Closing Date. Seller shall be responsible for and
pay any and all sales Taxes, use Taxes, or other similar transfer Taxes

of the Assets pursuant to this Agreement, and Seller shall remit such Taxes to
the appropriate Taxing Authority on or before the due date for such Taxes.
Seller and Buyer agree to cooperate with each other in demonstrating that the
requirements for any applicable exemptions from such sales, use or transfer
Taxes have been met. Except to the extent reflected in the computation of the

from Buyer requesting such reimbursement. Seller and Buyer shall cooperate
fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other Party, in
connection with the filing of Tax Returns relating to the Assets transferred
by Seller to Buyer (regardless of whether the period in question with respect
to such filings falls before or after the Closing Date), and any audit,
litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation shall
include the retention and (upon the requesting Party's request and reasonable
reimbursement of costs) the provision of records and information that are
reasonably relevant to any such audit, litigation or other proceeding and
making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide
additional information and explanation of material provided hereunder.

15.3 Assignment. This Agreement may not be assigned by Buyer without prior

consents to any other assignment by Buyer, such assignment shall not relieve
Buyer of any obligations and responsibilities hereunder. Any assignment or
other transfer by Buyer or its successors and assigns of any of the Assets

hereafter may acquire any immunity from jurisdiction of any court or from any
