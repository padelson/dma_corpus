_Working Capital Adjustment_



2.1. _Closing Date Statement of Working Capital of the EST Business_.



(a) As soon as practicable, but in any event not more than 90 days after the
Closing Date, SPX shall prepare and furnish to GE a statement of the Working
Capital of the EST Business as of the close of business on the day immediately
preceding the Closing Date in accordance with Section 2.2 (the " _Closing Date
Statement of Working Capital_ "). The Closing Date Statement of Working
Capital (i) shall be audited by Deloitte and Touche LLP and (ii) shall be
accompanied by a draft opinion of Deloitte and Touche LLP stating that the
Working Capital of the EST Business as of the close of business on the day
immediately preceding the Closing Date, as determined from the Closing Date
Statement of Working Capital, has been prepared in accordance with Section 2.2
(the " _Draft SPX Auditors  Certificate_"). GE and GEs accountants shall
have the opportunity to consult with and to examine the work papers, schedules
and other documents prepared or reviewed by Deloitte and Touche LLP in
connection with the preparation of their report on the Closing Date
Statement of Working Capital and the SPX Auditors Certificate.



(b) After SPX shall have furnished the audited Closing Date Statement of
Working Capital to GE including the Draft SPX Auditors Certificate, GE may
object to such statement only on the grounds that it has not been prepared in
accordance with Section 2.2. If GE so objects, GE may give a reasonably
detailed written notice of its objection to SPX within 45 days after its
receipt of such statement. If no such notice is delivered in respect of the
Closing Date Statement of Working Capital within such 45-day period, or if GE
and SPX agree upon all  



 

-5-  matters in dispute within the 45-day period specified in Section 2.1(c), the
Closing Date Statement of Working Capital, as furnished by SPX or as adjusted
to reflect any such agreements (as applicable), shall be final and binding
upon all parties hereto for the purpose of determining the Closing Date
Working Capital, and shall be referred to herein as the " _Final Closing Date
Statement of Working Capital_." Once the Final Closing Date Statement of
Working Capital has been determined, no party hereto shall have the right to
bring any Claim or Action against Deloitte and Touche LLP with respect to its
audit of the Closing Date Statement of Working Capital.



(c) GE and SPX will use reasonable best efforts to resolve any matters in
dispute with respect to the calculation of the Closing Date Working Capital as
rapidly as possible. If GE and SPX are unable to resolve all items in dispute
within 45 days after SPXs receipt of GEs written objection to the Closing
Date Statement of Working Capital pursuant to Section 2.1(b), then those items
in dispute shall be submitted for resolution to the Independent Accountant.
The Independent Accountant shall act as an expert to determine, based solely
on the presentations by GE and SPX, and not by independent review, only those
issues still in dispute. In resolving any disputed item, the Independent
Accountant (x) shall be bound by the provisions of this Section 2.1 and (y)
may not assign a value to any item greater than the greatest value for such
item claimed by either party or less than the smallest value for such item
claimed by either party. The determination of the Independent Accountant with
respect to those items in dispute, which shall be made within 30 days of the
submission of the dispute or as soon as practicable thereafter, shall be set
forth in a written statement delivered to GE and SPX, and the Closing Date
Statement of Working Capital, adjusted to reflect such determination, as well
as the determinations of GE and SPX with respect to those items accepted by GE
or otherwise resolved between GE and SPX, shall become the Final Closing Date
Statement of Working Capital and shall be final and binding upon all parties
hereto, and the Working Capital of the EST Business derived therefrom shall be
the Closing Date Working Capital.



(d) GE shall pay the fees of its accountants, and SPX shall pay the fees of
its accountants, in connection with the preparation and review of the
Closing Date Statement of Working Capital. The fees and disbursements of or
related to the Independent Accountant shall be borne one-half by GE and one-
half by SPX.



2.2. _Procedures for Preparing Closing Date Statement of Working Capital_. The
Closing Date Statement of Working Capital shall be prepared in accordance
with the methods, policies, practices, procedures, assumptions, conventions
and adjustments set forth on _Exhibit 2.2_.



2.3. _Working Capital Adjustment_.



(a) If the Closing Date Working Capital is greater than an amount which is
$5,000,000 greater than the Reference Working Capital (such amount, the "
_Permitted Excess Amount_ "), then, within three Business Days after final
calculation of the Closing Date Working Capital, GE and/or the Purchasing
Entities shall pay to SPX, by wire transfer to an account or accounts
specified in writing by SPX, an amount in cash equal to the excess over the
Permitted Excess Amount plus interest on such excess amount from the Closing
Date to the date of such payment at an annual rate equal to the Borrowing
Rate.



 

-6- (b) If the Closing Date Working Capital is less than an amount which is
$5,000,000 less than the Reference Working Capital (such amount, the "
_Permitted Deficiency Amount_ "), then, within three Business Days after final
calculation of the Closing Date Working Capital, SPX shall pay to GE and/or
the Purchasing Entities, by wire transfer to an account or accounts specified
in writing by GE, an amount in cash equal to the excess of the Permitted
Deficiency Amount over the Closing Date Working Capital plus interest on such
deficient amount from the Closing Date to the date of such payment at an
annual rate equal to the Borrowing Rate.

fraudulent conveyance, moratorium or other similar Laws relating to or
affecting creditors rights generally and to general principles of equity
(regardless of whether enforcement is considered in a proceeding in equity or

the knowledge of SPX, any other party is in material default under or in
material breach of or is otherwise materially delinquent in performance under
any Material Contract, and no event has occurred that with notice or lapse or
time, or both, would constitute such a material default. There are no material
disputes pending or, to SPXs knowledge, threatened with respect to any
Material Contract. None of the EST Companies has received any written notice

third party any rights, adverse or otherwise, that would constitute a breach

-18- 3.15. _Litigation_.

their respective properties, assets, or, to SPXs knowledge, officers or
directors is subject, in each case that relates to (i) the EST Business and
is material or (ii) that seeks to impair, prohibit or restrain the ability of
SPX (which shall include any material delay in SPXs ability) to enter into
this Agreement or to consummate any of the transactions contemplated hereby
or the ability of SPX or any of its Affiliates (which shall include any

the Ancillary Agreements to which it is a party or to consummate any of the
transactions contemplated thereby.



(b) There is no order, writ, injunction or decree, whether preliminary or
final, entered by any court, arbitrator or other Governmental Authority (each,
an " _Order_ ") imposed (or, to SPXs knowledge, threatened to be imposed)
upon any EST Company, any executive officer or director thereof or the assets
of any EST Company (including their respective Intellectual Property rights)
by or before any Governmental Authority, including, in each case, in
connection with an alleged violation of applicable Laws relating to (i) the
Export Control Requirements or (ii) improper payments, including the Foreign
Corrupt Practices Act.



(c) There is no Action pending that was instituted by any of the EST Companies
and since January 1, 2003 none of the EST Companies has made any Claim
or threatened to make any Claim or commence any such Action involving an

3.16. _Insurance_. Each of the material casualty, general liability and other
insurance policies maintained by or on behalf of any of the EST Companies
(the " _Insurance Policies_ ") is in full force and effect and no written
notice has been received by any of the EST Companies from any insurance
carrier purporting to cancel or materially modify coverage under any of
the Insurance Policies. There are no pending material claims against the
Insurance Policies by any of the EST Companies as to which the insurers have
in writing denied liability. None of the EST Companies is in material breach
or default, and none of the EST Companies have taken any action or failed to
take any action which, with notice or the lapse of time, or both, would
constitute such a breach or default, or permit termination or material
modification of any of the Insurance Policies. 



3.17. _Employee Benefit Plans_.



(a) The Disclosure Schedule contains a list, as of the date hereof, of
all Benefit Plans and specifies which is an EST Benefit Plan. With respect to
each Benefit Plan, SPX has delivered or made available to GE true and complete
copies of the most recent summary plan description or, if no summary plan
description exists, a written description of all material terms and
conditions of such Benefit Plan. With respect to each Benefit Plan, SPX has
provided or made available to GE a correct and complete copy of the following
documents (to the extent applicable): (i) all current plan documents, benefit
schedules, trust agreements, and insurance contracts; (ii) the most recent
Annual Report (Form 5500 Series) or other annual information  



 

-19-  return, and accompanying schedule, if any; (iii) the most recent annual
financial report, if any; (iv) the most recent actuarial report, if any; and
(v) the most recent determination letter from the IRS or similar approval
from any governmental authority. SPX has also provided to GE a correct and
complete copy of each Employment Agreement involving annual compensation in
excess of $200,000. SPX has provided (or, promptly after the date hereof,
will provide) GE with a list, complete and accurate in all material respects,
of all EST Group Employees and all other Business Employees (separately
identified on such list) on the date indicated thereon, including their dates
of hire, years of service, job title, salary and status of employment.



(b) Each Benefit Plan has been operated in material compliance with its terms
and applicable Law, including (i) ERISA and (ii) limits on investments
of each of the Canadian Hourly Pension Plans in "foreign property" (within
the meaning of the Income Tax Act (Canada)) to a level which avoids the
imposition of penalty taxes. Each Benefit Plan that is intended to be
qualified under Section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the "Code"), if any, has received a favorable determination letter
from the IRS, and, to the knowledge of SPX, nothing has occurred which would
cause the revocation of such letter. None of SPX or its Affiliates, or any
"party in interest" or "disqualified person" with respect to the Benefit
Plans, has engaged in a material non-exempt "prohibited transaction" within
the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code or Section 406 of ERISA. No fiduciary
has any material Liability for breach of fiduciary duty or any other failure
to act or comply in connection with the administration or investment of the
assets of any Benefit Plan. There are no pending Actions which have been
asserted or instituted against the Benefit Plans, the assets of any of the
trusts under such plans or the plan sponsor or the plan administrator, or
against any fiduciary of the Benefit Plans with respect to the operation
of such plans (other than routine benefit claims), nor to the knowledge of
SPX are any such Actions threatened, other than Actions that would not result
in a material Liability.



(c) The only Benefit Plan that is subject to Title IV of ERISA is the SPX
Individual Account Retirement Plan (the " _U.S. SPX Pension Plan_ "), and the
U.S. SPX Pension Plan is not an EST Benefit Plan. None of the U.S. Benefit
Plans is a multiemployer plan within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(3) of
ERISA.



(d) All Benefit Plans that are subject to the Laws of any
jurisdiction outside of the United States (i) have been maintained in all
material respects in accordance with all applicable requirements of such Laws,
and (ii) if they are intended to qualify for special tax treatment, meet all
requirements for such treatment, except where a failure to so qualify would
not result in a material Liability.



(e) The consummation of the transactions contemplated by, and in accordance
with, this Agreement will not, either alone or in combination with another
event, (i) entitle any Business Employee to any severance pay, retention
bonus, sale bonus, stay bonus, unemployment compensation or any other similar
payment under any agreement, arrangement or understanding, or (ii) materially
accelerate the time of payment or vesting or increase the amount of
compensation due any Business Employee under any agreement, arrangement or
understanding.



(f) Except as would not result in a material Liability, to SPXs knowledge,
any individual who performs services for the EST Business and who is not
treated as an  



 

-20-  employee of the EST Business for federal income tax purposes by the EST
Business is not an employee.



(g) With respect to each Canadian Hourly Pension Plan:



(i) each such plan has been assigned a registration number by the applicable
Canadian tax and pension benefits regulatory authority; and



(ii) SPX and its Affiliates have not received written notice of current
prosecutions, orders or notices of proposal (including a so-called "Monsanto
letter") from any Canadian tax or pension benefits regulatory authority in
respect of such plans.



(h) No payments, transfers or other benefits made or to be made to any
Business Employee or Former Business Employee under any Benefit Plan or
existing contract or arrangement with or covering such employee will give rise
to the payment of any amount that would not be deductible pursuant to Section
280G of the Code. In addition, no payment, transfers or other benefits made to
any Business Employee under any Benefit Plan or existing contract or
arrangement with or covering such Business Employee will fail to be
deductible by GE or any of its Affiliates under Section 162(m) of the Code so
long as GE does not cause such person to become a "covered employee" (within
the meaning of Section 162(m)(3) of the Code) of GE.



3.18. _Undisclosed Liabilities_. The EST Companies do not have
any Liabilities of any nature whether or not required, if known, to be
reflected or reserved against on a consolidated balance sheet of the EST
Companies prepared in accordance with GAAP or the notes thereto, other than
(a) Liabilities that are reflected or reserved against in the unaudited
combined balance sheet of the EST Companies as of September 30, 2004; (b)
Liabilities arising since September 30, 2004 in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice, (c) Liabilities arising in the
ordinary course of business pursuant to Contracts disclosed or referred to in
the Disclosure Schedule or that are not required to be disclosed in the
Disclosure Schedule pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, (d) Liabilities
set forth in the Disclosure Schedule, and (e) Liabilities incurred after the
date hereof in accordance with, and not in violation of, Section 5.1.



3.19. _Fees_. Except for the fees payable to J.P. Morgan Chase and Co., which
are the responsibility of SPX, none of the EST Companies has paid or become
obligated (nor have they created any Liability on the part of GE or the
Purchasing Entities) to pay any fee or commission to any broker, finder or
intermediary in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.



3.20. _Sufficiency of Assets_. The assets and properties held by the Members
of the EST Group, together with the EST Assets, constitute all of the material
assets and properties that are used or held for use by SPX and its Affiliates
to conduct the EST Business as currently conducted.



3.21. _Real Estate_. The Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true and complete
list, as of the date hereof, of all of the real property in which any EST
Company holds legal or equitable title (the " _Owned Real Property_ ") and all
the leasehold interests in real property of the  



 

-21-  EST Companies (the " _Leased Real Property_ " and the leases relating to
such Leased Real Property, the " _Real Property Leases_ ," and the Leased
Real Property together with the Owned Real Property, the " _Real Property_ ").
Each EST Company has title to, or a valid leasehold interest entitling it to
the sole and unencumbered right to possession and use of all of the Real
Property owned or leased by it free and clear of any Encumbrances, other than
Permitted Encumbrances.



3.22. _Labor Matters_.



(a) The Disclosure Schedule lists all collective bargaining agreements, union
contracts, employee representation agreements, works council, and
similar agreements or arrangements in effect on the date hereof that cover
any Business Employee (each, a " _Collective Bargaining Agreement_ "). With
respect to any Business Employee, (i) there is no labor strike, dispute,
slowdown, lockout or stoppage pending or, to SPXs knowledge, threatened
against any of the EST Companies, and none of the EST Companies has
experienced any labor strike, dispute, slowdown, lockout or stoppage since
December 31, 2003; (ii) there is no unfair labor practice charge or complaint
against any of the EST Companies pending or, to the knowledge of SPX,
threatened before the National Labor Relations Board or before any similar
state or foreign agency; (iii) to SPXs knowledge, no Person has made any
claim or charge against the EST Business or any Affiliate of the EST Business
under any Law relating to discrimination with respect to employees or
employment practices or with respect to breaches of any such statute,
regulation or ordinance, except for claims or charges that would not result
in a material Liability; and (iv) there has been no material grievance since
December 31, 2003 or material arbitration since December 31, 2003 arising out
of any Collective Bargaining Agreement or other grievance procedure.



(b) None of the EST Companies has any continuing obligation with respect to
any Business Employee in connection with: (i) a "plant closing" (as defined in
the WARN Act) affecting any site of employment or one or more facilities or
operating units within any site of employment or facility; or (ii) a "mass
layoff" (as defined in the WARN Act) affecting any site of employment or
facility.



(c) The EST Companies are in compliance with all Laws relating to the
employment of labor, including all such Laws relating to wages, hours, the
WARN Act and any similar state or local "mass layoff or "plant closing" Law,
collective bargaining, pay equity, discrimination, civil rights, safety and
health, workers compensation and the collection and payment of
withholding and/or social security taxes and any similar tax, except for
failures to comply that, individually or in the aggregate, have not resulted
in, and would not reasonably be expected to result in, a material Liability.



3.23. _Intercompany Services_. There are no material Contracts pursuant to
which any goods, services, materials or supplies are provided (i) by the EST
Companies, on the one hand, to SPX or any of its Affiliates (other than the
EST Companies), on the other hand, or (ii) by SPX or any of its Affiliates
(other than the EST Companies), on the one hand, to the EST Companies, on the
other hand (each, an " _Intercompany Arrangement_ "). There have not been any
Intercompany Arrangements since January 1, 2003.



 

-22- 3.24. _Relationships with Customers and Suppliers_ To SPXs knowledge, none of
the EST Companies has received, within 180 days prior to the date of this
Agreement, any written communication from any distributor, strategic partner
or customer of the EST Business who accounted for annual sales of the EST
Business in excess of $500,000 during the immediately preceding fiscal year
that would indicate that any such Person intends to terminate or materially
reduce its business with the EST Business.



3.25. _Regulatory Matters; Products Compliance with Laws_. To the knowledge of
SPX, there are no facts which would (a) furnish a substantial basis for the
recall, withdrawal or suspension of any product lines of any of the EST
Companies by any competent Governmental Authority or (b) otherwise reasonably
be expected to cause any of the EST Companies to withdraw, recall or suspend
any product lines of any of the EST Companies from the market or to change the
marketing classification of any products of the EST Companies or to terminate
or suspend the testing of any products of the EST Companies. There are no (x)
product lines which have been recalled or remediated by any of the EST
Companies (whether voluntarily or otherwise) at any time in the past 12 months
or (y) proceedings (whether completed or pending) at any time during the past

except as expressly made by SPX in Article III hereof, no representation or

with respect to any of the tangible assets being so transferred, or as to the

delivered to or made available to GE, or (c) with respect to any other
information or documents made available to GE.



ARTICLE IV



_Representations and Warranties of GE_



GE hereby represents and warrants to SPX as follows (all representations with
respect to the Purchasing Entities being only as of the Closing Date): 



4.1. _Organization and Good Standing_. Each of GE and the Purchasing Entities
is an entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
Laws of its jurisdiction of organization and has all requisite corporate or
similar power and authority to own, lease, and operate the properties
and assets it currently owns or leases and to carry on its business as such
business is currently conducted. Each of GE and the Purchasing Entities is
duly licensed or qualified to do business as a foreign entity and is in good
standing in all jurisdictions in which the character of the properties and
assets now owned or leased by it or the nature of the business  



 

-23-  now conducted by it requires it to be so licensed, qualified or in good
standing, except, in each case, where the failure so to be so licensed,
qualified or in good standing would not reasonably be expected to,
individually or in the aggregate, materially hinder, impair or delay the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (a " _GE Material Adverse
Effect_ ").



4.2. _Corporate Authority and Approval_. Each of GE and the
Purchasing Entities has all requisite corporate or other similar power, as
the case may be, and authority to enter into, deliver and perform its
obligations under this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. Each of GE and
the Purchasing Entities has all requisite corporate or other similar power, as
the case may be, and authority to enter into, deliver and perform its
obligations under the other agreements, documents and instruments to be
executed and delivered by them in connection with this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements and to consummate the transactions contemplated thereby.
The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements by
each of GE and the Purchasing Entities, the performance by each of GE and the
Purchasing Entities of its obligations hereunder and thereunder, and the
consummation by GE and the Purchasing Entities of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby, and the execution, delivery and performance
of the other agreements, documents and instruments to be executed and
delivered in connection with this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements by GE
and the Purchasing Entities which are a party thereto and the consummation by
them of the transactions contemplated thereby, have been duly authorized by
all requisite corporate or similar action on the part of each such Person. No
vote or approval of the stockholders of GE is required for GE to enter
into, deliver or perform its obligations under, this Agreement or the
Ancillary Agreements. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by
each of GE and GE Canada and (assuming the valid authorization, execution, and
delivery of this Agreement by SPX and the Other SPX Sellers) constitutes a
legal, valid and binding obligation of each of GE and GE Canada enforceable
against such Person in accordance with its terms, except to the extent such
enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
fraudulent conveyance, moratorium or other similar Laws relating to or
affecting creditors rights generally and to general principles of equity
(regardless of whether enforcement is considered in a proceeding in equity or
at law). The Tax Matters Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by GE
and the Purchasing Entities which are a party thereto and (assuming the valid
authorization, execution, and delivery of the Tax Matters Agreement by SPX and
its Affiliates which are a party thereto) constitutes a legal, valid and
binding obligation of each of GE and the Purchasing Entities which are a party
thereto, enforceable against each such Person in accordance with its terms,
except to the extent such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent conveyance, moratorium or other similar
Laws relating to or affecting creditors rights generally and to general
principles of equity (regardless of whether enforcement is considered in a
proceeding in equity or at law). The Ancillary Agreements and the other
agreements, documents and instruments to be executed and delivered in
connection with this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements at the
Closing will be duly executed and delivered by GE and the Purchasing Entities
which are a party thereto and (assuming, if applicable, the valid
authorization, execution, and delivery thereof by the other parties thereto)
will constitute the legal, valid and binding obligations of GE and the
Purchasing Entities which are a party thereto, enforceable against each such
Person in accordance with their respective terms, except to the extent such
enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
fraudulent conveyance, moratorium or other similar Laws relating to or
affecting creditors rights generally  



 

-24-  and to general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforcement is
considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).



4.3. _Consents_. Except as set forth on _Exhibit 4.3_ , no Governmental
Consent or Third Party Consent is required in connection with the execution,
delivery and performance by GE and the Purchasing Entities of this Agreement,
the Ancillary Agreements or the other agreements, documents or instruments to
be executed and delivered by any of them in connection with this Agreement or
the Ancillary Agreements, or the taking by any such Person of any other action
contemplated hereby or thereby, excluding, however, (a) Third Party Consents
which, if not obtained, would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a GE Material Adverse Effect and (b)
Governmental Consents which SPX or any of its Affiliates are required to
obtain or make.



4.4. _No Conflicts_. None of the execution and delivery by GE and
the Purchasing Entities of this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements and the
other agreements, documents and instruments to be executed and delivered by
any of them in connection with this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements, the
performance by them of their respective obligations under this Agreement, the
Ancillary Agreements and such other agreements, documents and instruments, and
the consummation by any of them of the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby shall, with or without the giving of notice or the lapse of time, or
both, subject to obtaining any Governmental Consents referred to in Sections
3.6 and 4.3, (a) conflict with or violate any provision of the charter or
bylaws of GE or the organizational documents of any of the Purchasing
Entities, (b) violate any Order or Law applicable to GE or any of the
Purchasing Entities, (c) violate or conflict with, result in the loss of any
material benefit under, constitute a default under, result in the termination
of or a right of termination or cancellation under, accelerate the
performance required by, or result in the creation of any Encumbrance upon any
of the properties, Intellectual Property Rights or assets of GE or any of the
Purchasing Entities under any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any
Contract, or (d) conflict with or result in the breach of any agreement
reflecting obligations of GE or any of the Purchasing Entities for
Indebtedness, except in the case of clauses (c) and (d) for violations,
conflicts, breaches or defaults that, individually or in the aggregate, have
not had, and would not reasonably be expected to have, a GE Material Adverse
Effect.



4.5. _Funds Available_. GE has, and has arranged for the Purchasing Entities
to have on the Closing Date, sufficient funds to enable them to pay the
Purchase Price and otherwise to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.



4.6. _Litigation_. There is no Action pending or, to GEs knowledge,
threatened against GE or the Purchasing Entities (a) with respect to
which there is a reasonable likelihood of a determination that would,
individually or in the aggregate, have, or reasonably be expected to have, a
GE Material Adverse Effect or (b) that seeks to enjoin or obtain damages in
respect of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.



4.7. _Fees_. None of GE or the Purchasing Entities has any liability or
obligation to pay any fee or commission to any broker, finder or intermediary
in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby for which SPX could
become liable or obligated.

 



 

-25- 4.8. _Purchase for Investment; Receipt of Information_. The Purchasing
Entities will be acquiring the Troy Shares, the ISS Shares, the Shanghai
Shares, the Edwards International Shares and the Dongguan Shares solely for
their own account for investment and not with a view to the distribution
thereof. GE and its authorized agents and representatives have been given,
and GE and the Purchasing Entities and their respective authorized agents and
representatives prior to the Closing Date will have been given, an opportunity
to examine such instruments, documents, and other information relating to,
and ask questions regarding and receive answers from, SPX and the EST
Companies, and their authorized agents and representatives as GE has deemed
necessary or advisable in order to make an informed decision relating to
the Purchasing Entities acquisition of the Troy Shares, the ISS Shares, the
Shanghai Shares, the Edwards International Shares, the Dongguan Shares and
their suitability as an investment for GE and the Purchasing Entities,
respectively. GE and GE Canada each is, and the other Purchasing Entities
each will be, an "Accredited Investor" within the meaning of Rule 501(a) of
Regulation D of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.



4.9. _Disclaimer_. Neither GE nor any of its Affiliates, representatives or
advisors has made, or shall be deemed to have made, to SPX any representation
or warranty other than those expressly made by GE in Article IV hereof, any
Ancillary Agreement or any other agreement, document or instrument
contemplated hereby to be delivered to SPX in connection herewith or
therewith.

officers, employees, investment bankers, financial advisors, attorneys,
accountants, agents and other representatives (collectively, "
_Representatives_ ") reasonable access, during normal business hours and on
reasonable advance notice, to SPXs (but only to the extent relating to the

rights of customers of the EST Business, violate any Law, Order or term of any
Contract, or adversely affect the ability of SPX, any EST Company or any of

not, nor shall it authorize or permit any of its Affiliates or any officer,

or worthless assets, and the transactions provided for in Article I.



5.4. _Consents of Third Parties_.



(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, to the
extent the assignment of any Contract to be assigned to GE or a Purchasing
Entity pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements
or any Exhibit hereto shall require the consent of any other party, this
Agreement shall not constitute a breach thereof or create rights in others
not desired by GE or the Purchasing Entities. If any such consent is not
obtained and the Closing occurs, SPX shall, at GEs expense, cooperate with GE
and the Purchasing Entities in any reasonable arrangement, including the
arrangement set forth on _Exhibit 5.4_ , designed to provide for GE and the
Purchasing Entities the benefit and burden of any such Contract, including

business or, in SPXs discretion, by way of capital contribution, dividend or
otherwise and shall be excluded from the determination of the Closing Date
Working Capital, and (ii) all Contracts between SPX and its Affiliates (other
than the EST Companies), on the one hand, and the EST Companies, on the other
hand, shall be terminated without any liability to any party thereto.



(b) SPX shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain at or before the
Closing the written release and waiver from all appropriate Persons of (i)
any and all Encumbrances on the EST Business, the EST Assets or the shares of
stock or other equity interests or assets of any of the Members of the EST
Group in respect of guaranties or Liabilities referred to in clause (ii) or
(iii) of this Section 5.5(b), (ii) any and all guaranties granted by any of
the Members of the EST Group in respect of any Indebtedness or other
obligations of SPX or any of its Affiliates (other than the EST Companies) and

obtaining new Permits so that it may operate the EST Business as of the
Closing Date in compliance with applicable Laws, including Environmental Laws.



(b) At any time after the Closing Date, SPX shall, at GEs expense
and without incurring any legal liability beyond that provided for in this
Agreement, promptly execute, acknowledge and deliver any other assurances or
documents reasonably requested by GE and necessary for GE to satisfy its
obligations hereunder or obtain the benefits contemplated hereby.



5.7.  _Non-Competition_.



(a) Except as expressly permitted by Section 5.7 of the Disclosure Schedule,
SPX agrees that, until the third anniversary of the Closing Date (the " _Non-
Competition Period_ ") SPX shall not, and shall cause each of its Affiliates,
so long as it is an Affiliate, not to: (i) directly or indirectly, operate,
perform, control, engage in, manage or have a greater than 5% ownership
interest in a business or Person that develops, manufactures, sells or
distributes products or performs services in competition with the
EST Business (as such business is conducted as of the Closing Date) (a "
_Competing Business_ "); (ii) solicit, raid, entice, encourage or induce any
Person that currently or at any time prior to or during the Non-Competition
Period is or was a distributor, strategic partner or customer (or is actively
pursued as a potential distributor, strategic partner or customer) of the EST
Business to purchase any products or services sold by the EST Business (as
such business is conducted as of the Closing Date) from anyone other than GE
and its Subsidiaries or to become a distributor, strategic partner or  



 

-30-  customer of any Person (other than GE or its Subsidiaries) for products or
services the same as, or competitive with, those products and services as
provided by the EST Business as of the Closing Date; or (iii) knowingly
interfere with, disrupt or attempt to disrupt any relationship, contractual or
otherwise, between the EST Business, or GE or any of its Subsidiaries (with
respect to the EST Business) and any of their respective distributors,
strategic partners, clients, customers or suppliers (including soliciting or
encouraging any such distributor, strategic partner, client, customer or
supplier to discontinue or reduce its business with the EST Business, GE or
any of its Subsidiaries (with respect to the EST Business)); or (iv) knowingly
approach any Person for such purpose or authorize the taking of such actions
by any Person or knowingly assist or participate with or provide information
to any such Person in taking any of the foregoing prohibited actions. The
parties hereto specifically acknowledge and agree that the remedy at Law for
any breach of the foregoing will be inadequate and that GE, in addition to any
other relief available to it, shall be entitled to temporary and permanent
injunctive relief without the necessity of proving actual damage or posting
any bond whatsoever.



(b) The parties hereto agree that, if any court of competent jurisdiction in a
final nonappealable judgment determines that a specified time period, a
specified geographical area, a specified business limitation or any other
relevant feature of this Section 5.7 is unreasonable, arbitrary or against
public policy, then a lesser time period, geographical area,
business limitation or other relevant feature which is determined to be
reasonable, not arbitrary and not against public policy may be enforced
against the applicable party.



5.8. _Environmental Matters_.



 

(a) SPX shall permit GE and GEs environmental consultant to conduct such
investigations (including investigations known as "Phase I" and "Phase II"
environmental site assessments) of the environmental conditions of any real
property owned, operated or leased by or for any EST Company and the
operations thereat (subject to any limitations contained in valid,
previously executed leases) as GE, in its reasonable discretion, shall deem
necessary (" _GE s Environmental Assessment_"). GEs Environmental Assessment
shall be conducted by a qualified environmental consulting firm,
possessing reasonable levels of insurance, in compliance with applicable Laws
and in a manner that minimizes the disruption of the operations of the EST
Companies.



(b) SPX shall promptly file all materials required to be filed by
Environmental Laws as a result of or in furtherance of the transactions
contemplated hereunder, including, but not limited to, any notifications or
approvals required under environmental property transfer Laws such as the New
Jersey Industrial Site Recovery Act, N.J. Stat. Ann. § 13:1K-6 et seq, or the
Connecticut Property Transfer Act, Gen. Stat. Ann. § 22a-134, and all
requests necessary for the transfer or re-issuance of Environmental Permits
required to conduct the EST Business after the Closing Date. GE shall
cooperate in all reasonable respects with SPX with respect to such filings
and Environmental Permit activities.



5.9. _Inventory Count_. Promptly after the Closing, representatives of SPX and
GE shall take a count of the EST Business Inventories as of the close of
business on the day immediately preceding the Closing Date. If GE so
elects, GEs accountants shall participate in such Inventory count. Such
Inventory count shall be taken in accordance with the EST Companies
historical inventory taking procedures, provided such procedures are not  



 

-31-  substantially different from standard inventory taking procedures, in which
case such standard procedures shall apply. SPX and GE hereby agree that
such Inventory count shall be used in determining the Closing Date Working
Capital pursuant to Section 2.2.



5.10. _Resignations_. SPX shall use reasonable best efforts to deliver or
cause to be delivered to GE and the Purchasing Entities at the Closing
the resignations (effective as of the Closing) of all directors and officers
of the Members of the EST Group.



5.11. _Insurance_. To the extent that there is any loss or casualty in respect
of the EST Business or any Liabilities of the EST Business between December
31, 2003 and the Closing Date and there exist any Insurance Policies owned by
SPX or any of its Affiliates (other than the Members of the EST Group) that
may cover such loss, casualty or Liability, SPX shall file, or cause to be
filed, a claim for the amount of such loss, casualty or Liability under such
Insurance Policies. Any proceeds received by SPX or its Affiliates (other than
the Members of the EST Group), net of any reasonable, documented, out-of-
pocket expenses incurred in collecting the proceeds, in respect of such claim
shall be for the account of GE (or its designated Affiliate).



5.12. [ _Intentionally Omitted_.]



5.13. _Audited Financial Statements_. Within five days after the date hereof,
SPX will engage Deloitte and Touche LLP (" _D andT_") for the purpose of
delivering to SPX an audited consolidated balance sheet of the EST Business as
at September 30, 2004 (the " _Audited Balance Sheet_ "), an audited
consolidated statement of income of the EST Business for the twelve months
ended September 30, 2004 (the " _LTM Income Statement_ ") and an audited
consolidated statement of cash flows of the EST Business for the twelve months
ended September 30, 2004 (together with the Audited Balance Sheet and the
LTM Income Statement, the " _Audited Financial Statements_ "). The Audited
Financial Statements will be prepared in accordance with the procedures set
forth in _Exhibit 5.13_ hereof. While the auditor will be engaged directly by
SPX, the costs of the auditors report on the Audited Financial Statements
shall be borne one-half by SPX and one-half by GE, and GE shall promptly
reimburse SPX upon GEs receipt of notice from SPX as to the costs of the
auditors. SPX will consult with GE regarding the terms of DandTs engagement
and the scope of its audit work.



5.14. _Cooperation with Respect to Financial Reporting_. After the date of
this Agreement, SPX shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to,
reasonably cooperate with GE and to provide GE with access to historical
financial records and data relating to the EST Business in connection with
GEs filings under the U.S. federal securities laws following the Closing.



5.15. _Agreement with Respect to Indebtedness_. In the event that any Member
of the EST Group is obligated for any Indebtedness (other than Indebtedness
set forth on Schedule 13.10(a)) that is not satisfied or released as of the
Closing, then, at the Closing, at SPXs option, SPX shall (a) request that a
portion of the Purchase Price equal to the amount of such Indebtedness be
held back by GE, on SPXs behalf, which amount shall be released only to
satisfy such Indebtedness or after satisfaction in full of such Indebtedness
by SPX or (b) pay to such Member of the EST Group the amount of such
Indebtedness by wire transfer of immediately available funds and, upon receipt
of such funds, such Indebtedness shall cease to be an Excluded Liability
hereunder.



 

-32- 5.16. _Transfer of Watercourse_. Prior to the Closing, SPX shall cause Edwards
International to transfer all of its interest in Watercourse to SPX (or an
Affiliate of SPX that is not a Member of the EST Group).

GE hereby covenants and agrees with SPX:



6.1. _Preservation of Books and Records_.



(a) For a period of seven years from the Closing Date:



(i) GE shall not, and shall cause each of the Members of the EST Group and
each Purchasing Entity not to, dispose of or destroy any of the books and
records of the EST Business relating to periods prior to the Closing Date ("
_Books and Records_ ") without first offering to turn over possession thereof
to SPX by written notice to SPX at least 30 days prior to the proposed date of
such disposition or destruction.



(ii) GE shall allow SPX and its agents access to all Books and Records on
reasonable notice and at reasonable times at GEs principal place of business
or at any location where any Books and Records are stored, and SPX shall have
the right, at its own expense, to make copies of any Books and Records;
_provided_ , _however_ , that any such access or copying shall be had or done
in such a manner so as not to unduly interfere with the normal conduct of GEs
business.



(iii) GE shall make available to SPX upon written request (1) personnel of GE,
the Purchasing Entities and the Members of the EST Group to assist SPX in
locating and obtaining any Books and Records, and (2) any of such personnel
whose assistance or participation is reasonably required by SPX or any of its
Affiliates in anticipation of or preparation for, or for depositions or
testimony in, existing or future Action or other matters in which SPX or any
of its Affiliates is involved. SPX shall reimburse GE for the reasonable out-
of-pocket expenses incurred by it in performing the covenants contained in
this Section 6.1(a). 



(b) The seven-year period referred to in Section 6.1(a) shall be extended in
the event that any Action or investigation has been commenced or is pending or
threatened at the termination of such seven-year period and such extension
shall continue until any such Action or investigation has been settled
through judgment or otherwise or is no longer pending or threatened.



6.2. _Performance Bonds and Guarantees_.



(a) Subject to Section 6.2(b), at the Closing, GE shall deliver to SPX
replacement (or, to the extent the beneficiary thereof will not permit
replacement, back-up) performance bonds, surety bonds, bank guarantees,
letters of credit and/or corporate guarantees (" _Guaranties_ "), in an
aggregate principal amount and with terms and from banks or other financial
institutions or surety companies (or in the case of corporate guarantees, GE
or one of its  



 

-33-  Affiliates), in each case reasonably satisfactory to SPX, to replace (or, to
the extent required, as described above, to collateralize) any Guaranties
given by any Member of the SPX Group in respect of the EST Business (in each
case, or portions thereof) remaining outstanding on the Closing Date with
respect to which any Member of the SPX Group will have any liability after the
Closing. Not later than fifteen (15) days prior to the Closing, SPX shall
preliminarily advise GE, and not later than five (5) Business Days prior to
the Closing, SPX shall advise GE, in writing of the Guaranties to be replaced
or collateralized pursuant to this Section 6.2.



(b) To the extent any Guaranties required to be replaced or collateralized in
accordance with Section 6.2(a) were not included in the written notice to GE,
GE shall use its reasonable best efforts to replace or collateralize any such
Guaranties as promptly as practicable following notification of the existence
of any such Guaranties.



6.3. _CERCLA Waiver_. GE, on its own behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates,
including each Member of the EST Group, hereby waives any right to seek
contribution or other recovery from SPX or any of SPXs Affiliates that it may
now or in the future ever have under any Environmental Law, including,
without limitation, 42 U.S.C. §§ 9607 and 9613(f) of the Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (" _CERCLA_ "), and
similar provisions under any other U.S. or foreign Environmental Law, as such
Laws were in the past or are currently in effect, or may in the future be
enacted or be in effect. GE, on its own behalf and on behalf of its
Affiliates, including each Member of the EST Group, hereby
further unconditionally releases SPX and SPXs Affiliates from any and all
claims, demands and causes of action that it may now or in the future ever
have against SPX or any of SPXs Affiliates for recovery under CERCLA or under
any other U.S. or foreign Environmental Law as such Laws were in the past or
are currently in effect, or may in the future be enacted or be in effect.
Nothing in this Section 6.3 shall affect GEs rights to indemnification for
any breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty contained in
Section 3.13 or for Excluded Liabilities pursuant to the provisions of Article
XII.



6.4. _Audit Actions_. GE agrees that it shall take any action, including
signing any document or waiver, that is requested by the auditors of
the Audited Financial Statements referred to in Section 5.13 in order to
cause such Audited Financial Statements to be delivered to SPX and GE. If GE
does not take such action or sign such document or waiver within three
Business Days after the date DandT requests SPX to execute management
representation letters in connection with the delivery of the Audited
Financial Statements, GE shall be deemed to have irrevocably waived the
condition set forth in Section 8.10.



6.5. _Further Assurances_. At any time after the Closing Date, GE shall, at
SPXs expense and without incurring any legal liability beyond that provided
for in this Agreement, promptly execute, acknowledge and deliver any other
assurances or documents reasonably requested by SPX and necessary for SPX to
satisfy its obligations hereunder or obtain the benefits contemplated hereby.

(a) From the date hereof until the Closing, GE and SPX shall, and shall cause
their respective Subsidiaries to, (x) use reasonable best efforts,
and cooperate with one another, to promptly secure all necessary consents,
approvals, authorizations, exemptions and waivers from third parties
(including Governmental Consents) as shall be required in order to enable the
parties to effect the transactions contemplated hereby, (y) take all actions
necessary, proper or advisable to comply promptly with all legal requirements
which may be imposed with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby, and
(z) otherwise use its reasonable best efforts to cause the consummation of
such transactions as promptly as practicable in accordance with the terms and
conditions hereof.



(b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of SPX and GE shall
cooperate to (i) make or cause to be made all filings required under
the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the "
_HSR Act_ "), the Competition Act (Canada) (the " _Competition Act_ ") or
other Antitrust Laws with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby
as promptly as practicable, (ii) comply at the earliest practicable date with
any request under the HSR Act, the Competition Act or other Antitrust Laws for
additional information, documents, or other materials received from the FTC,
the Antitrust Division, the Canadian Competition Bureau or any other
Governmental Authority in respect of such filings or such transactions, and
(iii) resolve any investigation or other inquiry of any of the FTC, the
Antitrust Division, the Canadian Competition Bureau or other Governmental
Authorities under any Antitrust Laws with respect to any such filing or any
such transaction (including, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
providing copies of all such documents to the non-filing party prior
to filing and considering all reasonable additions, deletions or changes
suggested in connection therewith). Each of SPX and GE shall use reasonable
best efforts to furnish to each other all information required for any
application or other filing to be made pursuant to any applicable Law in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each such
party shall promptly provide copies of written communications with any
Governmental Authority regarding any such filings or any such transaction.
Subject to applicable Law, SPX and GE shall consult and cooperate with one
another in connection with any analyses, appearances, presentations,
memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals made or submitted by or
on behalf of any party hereto relating to proceedings under the HSR Act, the
Competition Act or other Antitrust Laws. SPX and GE may, as each deems
advisable and necessary, reasonably designate any competitively sensitive
material provided to the other under this Section 7.1 as "outside counsel
only." Such materials and the information contained therein shall be given
only to the outside legal counsel of the recipient and will not be disclosed
by such outside counsel to employees, officers, or directors of the
recipient, unless express written permission is obtained in advance from the
source of the materials (SPX or GE, as the case may be).



(c) Each of SPX and GE shall use reasonable best efforts to resolve such
objections, if any, as may be asserted by any Governmental Authority with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under the HSR Act,
the Sherman Act, as amended,  



 

-35-  the Clayton Act, as amended, the Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended,
the Competition Act, and any other United States federal or state or
foreign statutes, rules, regulations, orders, decrees, administrative or
judicial doctrines or other Laws that are designed to prohibit, restrict or
regulate actions having the purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint
of trade (collectively, the " _Antitrust Laws_ "). Each of SPX and GE shall
use reasonable best efforts to take such action as may be required to cause
the expiration of the notice periods under the HSR Act, the Competition Act or
other Antitrust Laws with respect to such transactions as promptly as
possible after the execution of this Agreement.



(d) From the date hereof until the Closing, the parties hereto agree that they
shall take or cause to be taken all actions necessary, proper or advisable to
enable the parties to consummate as soon as practicable after the date of
this Agreement the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
defending against any suits, actions or proceedings, judicial or
administrative, challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, and seeking to vacate or reverse any
temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction or other legal restraint
or prohibition entered or imposed by any court or other Governmental Authority
that is not yet final and non-appealable. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, in connection with the execution and performance
of this Agreement: (i) none of GE, the Purchasing Entities or SPX nor any of
their respective Affiliates shall be required to hold separate (including by
trust or otherwise) or divest any of their respective businesses or assets or
any EST Company or asset thereof, or agree to any condition, restraint or
limitation relating to their ability to freely own or operate all or any
portion of their respective businesses or assets or any EST Company or asset
thereof; and (ii) none of the EST Companies shall, without GEs prior written
consent, commit to any divestiture transaction, or commit to alter
their businesses or commercial practices in any way, or otherwise take or
commit to take any action that limits GEs or the Purchasing Entities freedom
of action with respect to, or their ability to retain any of the businesses,
product lines or assets of the EST Business.



7.2. _Publicity_. Neither SPX nor GE shall issue any press release or public
announcement concerning this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements or the
transactions contemplated hereby without obtaining the prior written approval
of the other party hereto, which approval will not be unreasonably withheld
or delayed, unless, in the sole judgment of SPX or GE, disclosure is otherwise
required by applicable Law or by the applicable rules of any stock exchange on
which SPX or GE lists securities, provided that, to the extent required by
applicable Law, the party intending to make such release shall use its
reasonable best efforts consistent with such applicable Law to consult with
the other party with respect to the text thereof.



7.3. _Notification by the Parties_. SPX and GE shall use their respective
reasonable best efforts to promptly inform the other in writing if, prior to
the Closing, it obtains knowledge that any of the representations and
warranties made by such party in this Agreement ceases to be accurate and
complete in any material respect (except for any representation and warranty
that is qualified hereunder as to materiality or Material Adverse Effect, as
to which such notification shall be given if the notifying party obtains
knowledge that such representation and warranty ceases to be accurate and
complete in any respect). Any such notification shall not  



 

-36-  be deemed to have cured any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement made in this Agreement for any purposes of this Agreement. 



7.4. _Use of Name._



(a) Except as specifically set forth herein, GE shall not, and shall
cause the Purchasing Entities and the Members of the EST Group not to,
operate the EST Business utilizing, based on or taking advantage of the name
of SPX or any of its Subsidiaries (other than the Members of the EST Group),
including the Other SPX Sellers; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Members of
the EST Group may use packaging, advertising, sales and promotional materials
on hand or on order at the Closing Date and bearing the corporate names or
consumer information telephone numbers of SPX or such Other SPX Sellers in
connection with the marketing and sale of products of the EST Business until
the date that is nine months after the Closing Date, or such shorter period if
limited by the requirements of any Law or if new product labeling and/or
packaging is printed within such nine month time period. The Purchasing
Entities, GE and the Members of the EST Group shall maintain quality standards
for products of the EST Business at least equal to those maintained by
SPX and such Other SPX Seller on the Closing Date for so long as any of the
Purchasing Entities or the Members of the EST Group continues to use any
packaging, advertising, sales or promotional materials bearing the corporate
names or consumer information telephone numbers of SPX or any such Other SPX
Seller. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, promptly after the
Closing Date, GE shall cause each of its Affiliates to make all filings with
the appropriate Governmental Authorities to effectuate the said name changes.



(b) Within 60 days after the Closing, (a) SPX shall cause each of its
Affiliates (other than the Members of the EST Group), to the extent
applicable, to change its corporate name to a name that does not include the
name "Edwards Systems Technology," "EST" or "Ziton" or any derivatives
thereof and (b) SPX shall cause each of its Affiliates (other than the Members
of the EST Group) to cease to use the names "Edwards Systems Technology,"
"EST" and "Ziton" or any derivatives thereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that
promptly after the Closing Date, SPX shall cause each of its Affiliates (other
than the Members of the EST Group) to make all filings with the
appropriate Governmental Authorities to effectuate the said name changes
within such 60 day period.



7.5. _Tax Matters Agreement_. SPX, each of the Other SPX Sellers, GE and GE
Canada have entered into the Tax Matters Agreement, dated the date hereof (the
" _Tax Matters Agreement_ "), contemporaneously with the execution and
delivery of this Agreement. All representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements between the parties with respect to tax matters are set forth in
the Tax Matters Agreement, except to the extent set forth in Sections 3.10,
3.17, 5.1(b)(x)(2), 5.1(b)(x)(3), 8.1, 8.2, 8.9, 9.1, 9.2, 9.7, 12.2(c)(v) and
12.4(h) of this Agreement.



7.6. _Closing Date Cash_. If, as of the close of business on the day
immediately preceding the Closing Date, any Member of the EST Group owns
any cash (" _Closing Date Cash_ "), GE will pay, or will cause a Purchasing
Entity or a Member of the EST Group to pay, to SPX or one of the Other SPX

_Employment Matters_



10.1. _Offers of Employment; Employee Representation_



(a) In the case of each Business Employee immediately prior to the Closing, GE
shall, or shall cause one of its Affiliates to, effective as of the Closing,
(i) continue to employ such employees who are EST Group Employees and (ii)
offer employment to such employees who are not EST Group Employees (and SPX
shall provide GE with a list, as of a date at least three days and not more
than ten days prior to the Closing Date, of Business Employees covered by
clause (ii) hereof so as to enable GE to make such offers). Nothing in this
Agreement shall require GE to continue to employ any of the Business Employees
for any specified period following the Closing or prevent GE from terminating
any of the Business Employees after the Closing.



(b) For a period of one year following the Closing Date, each Business
Employee shall be provided with the same base salary or base wages as in
effect immediately prior to the Closing Date. For a period of one
year following the Closing Date, Business Employees shall be provided with
benefits and compensation that in the aggregate are substantially comparable,
on a value basis, to the benefits and compensation (including the target
amount of EVA Plan bonuses without any multiplier, but otherwise excluding
EVA Plan bonuses, all other cash incentive compensation, equity-based
compensation and all retention,  



 

-40-  transaction or similar change in control bonus or compensation arrangements)
provided generally to such employees immediately prior to the Closing Date.
In addition, each Business Employee who participated in an EVA Plan or other
cash incentive compensation plan immediately prior to the Closing shall
participate in an annual bonus program (as determined by GE) that is no less
favorable than an annual bonus program covering similarly situated employees
of GE and its Affiliates. Subject to the foregoing, nothing contained in this
paragraph shall require GE to adopt or establish any EVA Plan or equity
incentive compensation plans.



(c) SPX and GE acknowledge and agree that certain transactions
contemplated hereby may constitute the "transfer of an undertaking" solely in
those jurisdictions that are subject to the European Communitys Directive
77/187/EEC and any similar provisions of other applicable Law (collectively,
the " _Transfer Provisions_ "). Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, SPX and GE shall comply in all respects with all Transfer
Provisions in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.



(d) GE shall, or shall cause one of its Affiliates, to (i) recognize
the collective bargaining units recognized by the EST Business, and (ii)
assume all Collective Bargaining Agreements of such units and any Liabilities
thereunder (subject to SPXs responsibility for Excluded Business Employee
Liabilities), and employ (as successor employer) all employees covered by
such Collective Bargaining Agreements, on the Closing Date. GE shall, or shall
cause one of its Affiliates to, assume any responsibilities with respect to
recall rights of laid-off Business Employees who are covered by a Collective
Bargaining Agreement. In addition, GE shall, or shall cause one of its
Affiliates to, assume the employee benefit plans or portions thereof relating
to employees covered by a Collective Bargaining Agreement, except any
Excluded Business Employee Liabilities.



10.2.  _Savings Plans_. As of the Closing, GE shall, or shall cause one of
its Affiliates to, provide a 401(k) plan for all Business Employees who are
eligible to participate in the SPX Retirement Savings Plan immediately prior
to the Closing. GE shall permit the Business Employees who participate in the
SPX Retirement Savings Plan (the " _U.S. SPX 401(k) Plan_ ") immediately prior
to the Closing to effect a direct rollover of their accounts in cash
(including outstanding participant loans) to a 401(k) plan designated by GE.
GE and SPX shall cooperate in (1) making all filings required under the Code
or ERISA, (2) implementing all appropriate communications with participants,
and (3) taking all such other actions as may be necessary and appropriate to
implement the provisions of this Section 10.2 in a timely manner. GE and SPX
shall cooperate to make available similar rollovers, as nearly as practicable,
in respect of the Group Retirement Savings Plan component of the SPX
Retirement Savings Plan for Salaried and Hourly Employees of SPX Canada (the "
_Canadian SPX Savings Plan_ ").



10.3. _Pension Plans_.



(a) Effective as of the Closing, SPX shall assign and GE or one of its
Affiliates shall assume all of the rights, duties, and Liabilities of SPX
with respect to the Retirement Plan for Employees of Edwards who are Members
of the Owen Sound Bargaining Unit (" _Owen Sound Hourly Pension Plan_ ") and
Retirement Plan for British Columbia Employees of Edwards who are Members of
the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, Local 213 (such plan,
collectively with the Owen Sound Hourly Pension Plan, the " _Canadian Hourly
Pension Plans_ "), including the funding and investment management agreements
in respect of the  



 

-41-  Canadian Hourly Pension Plans. In order to give effect to such assignment
and assumption regarding the Canadian Hourly Pension Plans, SPX and GE
shall execute on the Closing an assignment and assumption agreement in
respect of each of the Canadian Hourly Pension Plans. Upon such assignment and
assumption, GE shall become the successor administrator and sponsor of the
Canadian Hourly Pension Plans. 



(b) Effective as of the Closing Date, SPX shall assume sponsorship of and
exclusive responsibility for all Liabilities under the Retirement Plan for
Salaried Employees of SPX Canada Inc. and Employing Companies (the " _Canadian
Salaried Pension Plan_ ") (and such plan shall not be treated as an EST
Benefit Plan). GE shall, or shall cause one of its Affiliates to, provide a
registered pension plan covering employees who were members of the Canadian
Salaried Pension Plan and maintain such plan for a period of not less than two
years. 



10.4. _SPX Bonus Plans_. With respect to the Executive EVA Incentive
Compensation Plans (the " _EVA Plans_ "), SPX shall determine the bonuses
under the EVA Plans in respect of 2004 for the Business Employees, SPX shall
pay such bonuses to Business Employees not later than the date that bonuses
under the EVA Plans are paid to employees of SPX generally, and, if the
Closing occurs, GE shall reimburse SPX for such bonuses promptly after the
payment thereof (or, if later, at the Closing). On the Closing Date, SPX shall
also cause the amount of the "bank balance" under the EVA Plans remaining
after payment of such bonuses to be paid in cash to each Business Employee,
and GE shall have no obligation to reimburse SPX for such payments. GE shall
pay or shall cause one of its Affiliates to pay cash bonuses in respect of
2004 to each other Business Employee who was participating in any other
incentive compensation plan or arrangement (excluding the EVA Plans) for any
period beginning before the Closing Date in accordance with the terms of such
plan; provided, that, if the Closing Date occurs after the date such bonuses
are to be paid, SPX shall pay such 2004 bonuses and GE shall reimburse SPX for
such 2004 bonuses at the Closing.



10.5. _Business Employee Obligations_.



(a) GE or one of its Affiliates shall cause the Business Employees to
be granted credit for all service with SPX and its Affiliates and their
respective predecessors prior to the Closing for purposes of eligibility and
vesting, but not for purposes of benefit accrual (except for purposes of
calculating benefits under any vacation, severance or sick leave plan), under
any plan or arrangement of GE or any of its Affiliates which provides
compensation and employee benefits to the same extent that such service was
credited with respect to any similar plan or arrangement of SPX or any of its
Affiliates prior to the Closing. Any employee benefit plan of GE or any of its
Affiliates which provides medical, dental or life insurance benefits after the
Closing to any Business Employee or a dependent thereof shall, with respect
to such individuals, waive any actively-at-work exclusions, waiting periods
and any pre-existing condition exclusions to the same extent waived by any
Benefit Plan and shall provide that any expenses incurred (as disclosed on
employee explanation of benefits statements) on or before the Closing by such
individuals in the current plan year of the Benefit Plans shall be taken into
account under such plans for purposes of satisfying deductible or coinsurance
provisions applicable in the current plan year.



(b) Except as otherwise provided in this Section 10.5(b), GE shall assume, as
of the Closing, all Business Employee- and Former Business Employee-related
Liabilities of the  



 

-42-  EST Business, including without limitation all Liabilities under any EST
Benefit Plans, occupational health and safety, pay equity,
workers compensation arrangements, COBRA Coverage, accrued vacation pay, and
post-retirement medical and life insurance benefits with respect to Business
Employees and their respective dependents and beneficiaries, whether any such
Liabilities arose or are incurred or accrued prior to, on or following the
Closing, and shall indemnify and reimburse SPX for any such Business Employee-
and Former Business Employee-related Liabilities incurred by or paid for by
SPX after the Closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, SPX shall retain, as of
the Closing, (i) medical, dental, vision, life insurance and other, similar
claims incurred prior to the Closing under the SPX Benefit Plans, (ii)
Liabilities under health and dependent care spending accounts of Business
Employees in existence at the time of the Closing, (iii) Liabilities related
to (x) the U.S. SPX Pension Plan, (y) the SPX Supplemental Retirement Savings
Plan, the SPX Supplemental Individual Account Retirement Plan and other,
similar unfunded pension arrangements for senior management and (z) the U.S.
SPX 401(k) Plan and the Canadian SPX Savings Plan (in the case of clause (z),
except for account balances rolled over pursuant to Section 10.4), (iv) the
Liability of SPX to pay out the bank balances under the EVA Plans pursuant to
Section 10.4, (v) post-retirement medical and life insurance benefits with
respect to Former Business Employees and their respective dependants and
beneficiaries, (vi) severance Liabilities with respect to Former Business
Employees, (vii) Liabilities under the Canadian Salaried Pension Plan, (viii)
equity awards under the SPX 1992 Stock Compensation Plan and 2002 Stock
Compensation Plan and any other SPX equity awards and (ix) the sale incentive
letters for seven executives set forth in Section 3.17 of the Disclosure
Schedule (collectively, the " _Excluded Business Employee Liabilities_ "), and
shall indemnify and reimburse GE for any such Excluded Business
Employee Liabilities incurred by or paid for by GE after the Closing. For
purposes of this Section 10.5(b), a claim shall be deemed to have been
incurred upon the incurrence of a qualifying expense for which reimbursement
is sought. Nothing in this Section 10.5(b) shall relieve SPX from its
indemnification obligations set forth in Section 12 in accordance with the
terms of such Section and subject to the limitations contained in such
Section.



(c) To the extent any Business Employee- and Former Business Employee-
related Liabilities of the EST Business (other than Excluded Business
Employee Liabilities) are funded by assets held in a trust, voluntary
employees beneficiary association or escrow and separately accounted for with
respect to a Business Employee or Former Business Employee, SPX shall cause
such separately accounted assets to be assigned or otherwise transferred to GE
or, if applicable, to a successor trust, voluntary employees beneficiary
association or escrow. To the extent any Business Employee- and Former
Business Employee-related Liabilities of the EST Business (other than Excluded
Business Employee Liabilities) are covered by any contract of insurance, then,
if SPX receives proceeds from such insurance that are
specifically attributable and identifiable to a Business Employee or Former
Business Employee, and not based on aggregate claims or occurrences of more
than one Business Employee, Former Business Employee or other current or
former employee of SPX or any of its Affiliates, SPX shall deliver promptly
after receipt such proceeds to GE or, if necessary to preserve the tax impact
to such Business Employee or Former Business Employee, to such Business
Employee or Former Business Employee directly, in each case net of any
reasonable, documented, out-of-pocket expenses incurred in collecting the
proceeds. In connection with the Closing, SPX and GE shall also endeavor to
cause any contract of insurance covering solely EST Group Employees to be  



 

-43-  transferred to GE or an Affiliate designated by GE. In addition, effective
as of the Closing Date, GE shall assume sponsorship of and
exclusive responsibility for any U.S. EST Benefit Plans.



(d) In the event GE would be required to replicate a SPX Benefit Plan in
order to provide benefits to an inactive Business Employee, then, at GEs
request on or before the Closing, SPX shall continue to provide such benefits
from the applicable SPX Benefit Plan covering such inactive Business Employee
in accordance with the terms of such plan, and GE shall promptly reimburse SPX
for the costs of such benefits. GE may elect to discontinue such coverage and,
at its sole cost (subject to any permitted employee contributions), provide
coverage under a GE benefit plan or other arrangement.



(e) Promptly after the date hereof, GE and SPX shall engage an enrolled
actuary to determine, as of the last day of the month that falls on or
immediately after the Closing Date, (x) the total benefit obligations
associated with the Business Employees and Former Business Employees (the "
_EST LTD Benefit Obligations_ ") under the SPX long-term disability plan (the
" _SPX LTD Plan_ "), (y) the total benefit obligations under the SPX LTD Plan
(including the EST LTD Benefit Obligations) and (z) the aggregate fair market
value of the assets in the trust maintained by SPX for the purposes of
satisfying such benefit obligations (the " _SPX Trust_ "). The enrolled
actuary shall make such calculations employing generally accepted accounting
principles and generally accepted actuarial principles, subject to any
specific directions to which the parties shall mutually agree, and its
determination shall be final, binding and conclusive on the parties. The
parties shall bear the costs of the enrolled actuary equally. At or as soon as
practicable after the enrolled actuary makes its determination, SPX shall
transfer from the SPX Trust to a successor trust designated by GE an amount of
cash equal to the lesser of (A) that portion of the assets in the SPX Trust
that bears to the total amount of the assets in the SPX Trust the same ratio,
as nearly as practicable, as the EST LTD Benefit Obligations bear to the
total benefit obligations under the SPX LTD Plan and (B) the full amount of
the EST LTD Benefit Obligations.



10.6. _Severance_.



(a) GE shall, or shall cause one of its Affiliates to, provide pay in lieu of
notice (including common law notice under Canadian law) and/or severance
pay and other severance-related benefit entitlements that may be owing to any
Business Employee whose employment is terminated by GE or one of its
Affiliates on or within one year after the Closing Date, subject to the
following sentence. If such termination of employment occurs on or within one
year after the Closing Date, such pay in lieu of notice, severance pay and
severance-related benefit entitlements shall be determined (on a Business
Employee by Business Employee basis) in accordance with the more favorable of
(i) the termination or severance terms (if any) applicable to such Business
Employee immediately prior to the Closing, and (ii) the termination of
severance terms (if any) of GE or one of its Affiliates applicable to
such Business Employee after the Closing. Without limiting the generality of
Section 10.1, GE shall cause offers of employment to be made to Business
Employees employed on the Closing Date in Canada so as to avoid the incurrence
of severance benefits to such Business Employees in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.



(b) GE and SPX agree to the matters set forth in Section 10.6(b) of the
Disclosure Schedule.



 

-44- 10.7. _WARN_. GE shall, or shall cause one of its Affiliates to, give all
notices required to be given under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining
Notification Act (the " _WARN Act_ ") or any similar statutes or regulations
of any jurisdiction relating to any plant closing or mass layoff after the
Closing Date. For this purpose, GE and its Affiliates shall be deemed to have
caused a plant closing (or mass layoff) if the plant closing (or mass layoff)
would not have occurred but for GE or one of its Affiliates failure to
continue to employ any EST Group Employees or to offer to employ any of the
other Business Employees in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. GE
shall indemnify and hold SPX harmless from any and all Liabilities arising
from its acts or failures to act as described in this Section 10.7.



10.8. _Cooperation and Exchange of Information_. GE and SPX shall cooperate
with one another, and shall provide each other, as promptly as practicable,
with such information as the other shall reasonably request, in order to
timely and efficiently implement the provisions of this Article X. All
communications by GE or any of its respective Affiliates and by SPX or any of
its Affiliates with Business Employees regarding the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement (including this Section 10.8) that are made at any time
at or before the Closing shall be approved in advance by individuals
designated by SPX and GE, respectively (which approvals shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed).



10.9. _Non-Solicitation of Employees_. SPX shall not, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries and Affiliates not to, at any time prior to the second
anniversary of the Closing Date, directly or indirectly, (i) hire, employ or
solicit for employment any Business Employee whose name is set forth in
writing prior to the Closing Date (such list not to include more than
25 individuals) or (ii) solicit the employment of any Business Employee or
any employee of GE whom SPX learns of in connection with the transaction
contemplated hereby without GEs prior written consent. The term "solicit the
employment" shall not be deemed to include generalized searches for employees
through media advertisements that are not focused on individuals employed by
GE or its Affiliates or use of an independent executive search firm or other
employment agency (so long as it is not directed directly or indirectly to
contact such Business Employee). This restriction (i) shall not apply to any
Business Employee whose employment with GE or any of its Affiliates is
involuntarily terminated by such entity after the Closing and (ii) shall
apply to any Business Employee who does not accept GEs offer of employment
but, in the case of this clause (y), only until the one-year anniversary of
the Closing Date.



ARTICLE XI



_Termination, Amendment, and Waiver_



11.1. _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated by either party prior to
the Closing:



(a) by the mutual written consent of SPX and GE;



(b) by either GE, on the one hand, or SPX, on the other hand, if the
Closing shall not have occurred on or before July 29, 2005 (the "
_Termination Date_ "); provided that the right to terminate this Agreement
under this Section 11.1(b) shall not be available to a party if such partys
breach of this Agreement or willful act or willful failure to act has been
the cause of or resulted in the failure of the Closing to be consummated on or
before the Termination Date;



 

-45- (c) by GE, upon written notice to SPX, if any of the conditions to the Closing
set forth in Article VIII shall have become incapable of fulfillment and
shall not have been waived in writing by GE;



(d) by SPX, upon written notice to GE, if any of the conditions to the Closing
set forth in Article IX shall have become incapable of fulfillment and shall
not have been waived in writing by SPX; or



(e) by either GE or SPX, upon written notice to the other, if there shall
be in effect a final, non-appealable order of a court or government
administrative agency of competent jurisdiction prohibiting the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby.



11.2. _Effect on Obligations_. Termination of this Agreement pursuant to this
Article XI shall terminate all rights and obligations of the parties
hereunder and none of the parties shall have any liability to the other party
hereunder, except that Article XIII, the Confidentiality Agreement, Section
7.2 and the penultimate sentence of Section 5.2 shall remain in effect, and
provided that nothing herein shall relieve any party from liability for any
breach of any covenant or agreement in this Agreement prior to such
termination in any manner that shall have proximately contributed to the
occurrence of the failure of the Closing to occur.



ARTICLE XII



_Survival of Representations and Warranties; Indemnification _



12.1. _Survival_. The representations and warranties made in this Agreement
shall survive the Closing for a period of 13 months and shall thereupon
expire, together with any right to indemnification for breach thereof, except
to the extent a Valid Third Party Claim Notice (as defined below) or Valid
Other Claim Notice (as defined below) (each a " _Valid Claim Notice_ ") shall
have been given in accordance with Section 12.3 by the party seeking
indemnification (the " _indemnified party_ ") to the party from whom
indemnification is being sought (the " _indemnifying party_ "), in which case
the representation or warranty alleged in the Valid Claim Notice to have been
breached shall survive, to the extent of the claim set forth in the
Valid Claim Notice only, until such claim is resolved; _provided_ , _however_
, that (a) the representations and warranties set forth in Sections 3.1, 3.3,
3.4(b), 3.5, and 4.2, together with any right to indemnification for breach
thereof, shall survive the Closing indefinitely; and (b) the representations
and warranties set forth in Section 3.13, together with any right to
indemnification for breach thereof, shall survive the Closing for a period of
five years and shall thereupon expire, together with any right to
indemnification for breach thereof. The covenants and agreements contained
herein to be performed or complied with at or prior to the Closing (other than
those set forth in Sections 5.1, 5.5(a), 5.8(b), 5.11, and 6.2 (the "
_Surviving Pre-Closing Covenants_ ")) shall expire at the Closing along with
all rights and remedies with respect to the breach thereof. The Surviving Pre-
Closing Covenants shall survive the Closing for a period of 13 months and
shall thereupon expire, together with any right to indemnification for breach
thereof, except to the extent a Valid Claim Notice shall have been given in
accordance with Section 12.3 by the indemnified party to the indemnifying
party, in which case the covenant alleged in the Valid Claim Notice to have
been breached shall survive, to the extent of the claim set forth in the Valid
Claim Notice only, until such claim is resolved; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the Surviving Pre-Closing Covenants set forth in Sections 5.1(b) and 5.5(a),
together with any right  



 

-46-  to indemnification for breach thereof, shall survive the Closing for a
period of five years and shall thereupon expire, together with any right
to indemnification for breach thereof. The covenants and agreements contained
herein to be performed or complied with after the Closing (other than the
covenant and agreement to indemnify against breaches of representations and
warranties, which shall expire as set forth in this Section 12.1 (the "
_Post-Closing Covenants_ ")) shall survive the Closing until the expiration of
the applicable statute of limitations. The indemnification obligation of SPX
set forth in Section 12.2(a)(iv) shall survive the Closing for a period of 13
months and shall thereupon expire, together with any right to indemnification,
except to the extent a Valid Claim Notice shall have been given in accordance
with Section 12.3 by the indemnified party to the indemnifying party, in
which case the claim alleged in the Valid Claim Notice shall survive, to the
extent of the claim set forth in the Valid Claim Notice only, until such claim
is resolved.



12.2. _Indemnification_.



(a) If the Closing shall occur, SPX shall indemnify GE, the
Purchasing Entities, each Member of the EST Group and their respective
Subsidiaries, Affiliates, officers, directors, employees, agents and
representatives (the " _GE Indemnified Parties_ ") and hold each such Person
harmless from and against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities,
settlement amounts, penalties, costs and expenses, including reasonable
attorneys fees and disbursements, court costs and other out-of-pocket
expenses but not including internal management, administrative or overhead
costs that an indemnified party reasonably incurs in connection with the
administration, supervision or performance of actions required in response to
a Claim (collectively, " _Damages_ "), that are incurred or suffered by any
of them:



(i) by reason of the breach or inaccuracy of the representations or
warranties made by SPX herein as of the date hereof or as of the Closing Date
(except, in each case, to the extent made as of a specified date, which shall
be measured only as of such specified date) (in each case, without regard to
any qualifications as to materiality or Material Adverse Effect contained in
such representations and warranties);



(ii) by reason of the failure by SPX or any other Member of the SPX Group to
perform or comply with any of its Surviving Pre-Closing Covenants or its
Post-Closing Covenants; or



(iii) in respect of the Excluded Liabilities.



(b) Any recovery by the GE Indemnified Parties for indemnification shall be
limited as follows: (1) the GE Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to
any recovery unless a claim for indemnification is made in accordance with
Section 12.3, so as to constitute a Valid Claim Notice, and within the time
period of survival set forth in Section 12.1; (2) the GE Indemnified Parties
shall not be entitled to recover any amount for indemnification claims under
clause (i) of Section 12.2(a) and clause (v) of Section 4(a) of the Tax
Matters Agreement unless and until the amount that the GE Indemnified Parties
are entitled to recover in respect of such claims exceeds, in the aggregate,
$24,412,500 (the " _Deductible_ "), in which event (subject to clause (3)
below) the entire amount that the GE Indemnified Parties are entitled to
recover in respect of such claims less the Deductible shall be payable; or (3)
the maximum amount recoverable by the GE Indemnified Parties
for indemnification claims under clause (i) of  



 

-47-  Section 12.2(a) and clause (v) of Section 4(a) of the Tax Matters Agreement
shall in the aggregate be equal to $209,250,000 (the " _Cap_ ");  _provided_
, _however_ , that the limitations set forth in clauses (2) and (3) shall not
apply to any breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty set forth
in Sections 3.1, 3.3, 3.4(b) or 3.5. No Damages shall be included
in determining whether the Deductible has been reached unless a Valid Claim
Notice seeking indemnification for such Damages has been given by a GE
Indemnified Party to SPX in accordance with Section 12.3.



(c) If the Closing shall occur, GE and the Purchasing Entities shall
jointly and severally indemnify each Member of the SPX Group and their
respective Subsidiaries, Affiliates, officers, directors, employees, agents
and representatives (the " _SPX Indemnified Parties_ ") and hold each of them
harmless from and against all Damages that are incurred or suffered by any of
them:



(i) by reason of the breach or inaccuracy of any of the representations or
warranties made by GE or a Purchasing Entity herein as of the date hereof or
as of the Closing Date (except, in each case, to the extent made as of a
specified date, which shall be measured only as of such specified date) (in
each case, without regard to any qualifications as to materiality or GE
Material Adverse Effect contained in such representations and warranties);



(ii) by reason of the failure by GE or any Purchasing Entity to perform or
comply with any of its Surviving Pre-Closing Covenants or its Post-Closing
Covenants;



(iii) by reason of any payments made by SPX or its Affiliates after the
Closing under the Guaranties which are not substituted by GE in accordance
with Section 6.2;



(iv) in respect of the Assumed Liabilities (including any attempt, whether or
not meritorious, by any third party to impose responsibility on SPX or any of
its Affiliates for any Assumed Liabilities); or



(v) in respect of any Liabilities, whether incurred prior to or following the
Closing, incurred by reason of the sale of the assets of EST and GSBS if such
Liabilities would not have been incurred if the stock of EST had been acquired
in a transaction in which a valid election under Section 338(h)(10) of
the Code (and any corresponding or similar elections under state, local or
foreign tax laws) was made in respect of the equity interests in EST and GSBS.



(d) Any recovery by the SPX Indemnified Parties for indemnification shall be
limited as follows: (1) the SPX Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled
to any recovery unless a claim for indemnification is made in accordance with
Section 12.3, so as to constitute a Valid Claim Notice, and within the time
period of survival set forth in Section 12.1; (2) the SPX Indemnified Parties
shall not be entitled to recover any amount for indemnification claims under
clause (i) of Section 12.2(c) unless and until the amount that the SPX
Indemnified Parties are entitled to recover in respect of such claims exceeds,
in the aggregate, the Deductible, in which event (subject to clause (3)
below) the entire amount that the SPX Indemnified Parties are entitled to
recover in respect of such claims less the Deductible shall be payable; and
(3) the maximum amount recoverable by the SPX Indemnified Parties for
indemnification claims under clause (i) of Section 12.2(c) shall in the
aggregate be equal to the Cap; _provided_ , _however_ , that  



 

-48-  the limitation set forth in clauses (2) and (3) shall not apply to any
breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty set forth in Section
4.2. No Damages shall be included in determining whether the Deductible has
been reached unless a Valid Claim Notice seeking indemnification for such
Damages has been given by a SPX Indemnified Party to GE in accordance with
Section 12.3.



12.3. _Procedures for Claims_.



(a)(i) In order for an indemnified party to be entitled to
any indemnification provided for under this Article XII in respect of,
arising out of or involving a claim made by any third party against the
indemnified party (a " _Third Party Claim_ "), the indemnified party must
notify the indemnifying party in writing of the Third Party Claim (a " _Third
Party Claim Notice_ ") promptly following receipt by such indemnified party of
written notice of the Third Party Claim, which notification, to be a valid
Third Party Claim Notice, with the effect set forth in Sections 12.1 and 12.2
(a " _Valid Third Party Claim Notice_ "), must be accompanied by a copy of the
written notice of the third party claimant to the indemnified party asserting
the Third Party Claim;  _provided_ , that the failure to promptly provide
such Notice or to promptly provide a copy of the written notice of the third
party claimant (so long as a Valid Third Party Claim Notice is given before
the expiration of the applicable period set forth in Section 12.1) shall not
waive any rights of the indemnified party, except to the extent that the
rights of the indemnifying party are actually prejudiced thereby. The
indemnified party shall deliver to the indemnifying party copies of all other
notices and documents (including court papers) received by the indemnified
party relating to the Third Party Claim.



(ii) The indemnifying party shall have the right to defend and to direct the
defense, and in the case of Assumed Liabilities shall have the obligation
at the request of the indemnified party to defend and direct the defense,
against any such Third Party Claim (including to conduct any proceedings or
settlement negotiations) with counsel of its own choosing, unless there is a
conflict of interest between the indemnified party and the indemnifying party
in the conduct of the defense of such Third Party Claim. Prior to the time the
indemnified party is notified by the indemnifying party as to whether the
indemnifying party will assume the defense of a Third Party Claim, the
indemnified party shall take all actions reasonably necessary to timely
preserve the collective rights of the parties with respect to such Third Party
Claim, including responding timely to legal process. In the event the
indemnifying party has assumed the defense of a Third Party Claim in
accordance herewith, the indemnified party shall have the right to participate
in the defense of any Third Party Claim and to employ its own counsel (it
being understood that the indemnifying party shall control such defense), at
its own expense. If the indemnifying party is permitted to but shall decline
to assume the defense of a Third Party Claim (or shall fail to notify the
indemnified party of its election to defend such Third Party Claim) within 30
days after the giving by the indemnified party to the indemnifying party of a
Valid Third Party Claim Notice with respect to the Third Party Claim, or in
the case of a conflict of interest, the indemnified party shall defend
against the Third Party Claim and the indemnifying party shall be liable to
the indemnified party for all reasonable fees and expenses incurred by the
indemnified party in the defense of the Third Party Claim, including
without limitation the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel employed by
the indemnified party, if and to the extent that the indemnifying party is
responsible to indemnify for such Third Party Claim. Regardless of which party
assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim, the parties agree to  



 

-49-  cooperate with one another in connection therewith. Such cooperation shall
include providing records and information that are relevant to such Third
Party Claim, and making employees and officers available on a mutually
convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any
material provided hereunder and to act as a witness or respond to legal
process. Whether or not the indemnifying party assumes the defense of a Third
Party Claim, the indemnified party shall not admit any liability with respect
to, or settle, compromise or discharge, such Third Party Claim without the
indemnifying partys prior written consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld). The indemnifying party, if it has assumed the defense
of any Third Party Claim as provided in Section 12.3(a), shall not consent to
a settlement of, or the entry of any judgment arising from, any such Third
Party Claim without the indemnified partys prior written consent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld) unless such settlement or judgment
(a) relates solely to monetary damages for which the indemnifying party shall
be responsible and (b) includes as an unconditional term thereof the release
of the indemnified party from all liability with respect to such Third Party
Claim.



(b) In order for an indemnified party to be entitled to any indemnification
provided for under this Article XII in respect of a claim that does not
involve a Third Party Claim being asserted against such indemnified party (an
" _Other Claim_ "), the indemnified party must promptly notify the
indemnifying party in writing of such Other Claim (the " _Other Claim Notice_
"), which notification, to be a valid Other Claim Notice, with the effect set
forth in Sections 12.1 and 12.2 (a " _Valid Other Claim Notice_ "), (i) must
certify that the indemnified party has in good faith already sustained some
(though not necessarily all) Damages with respect to such claim and (ii) if
the Other Claim Notice is asserting a claim for breach of any of the
representations and warranties contained in Section 3.13 (an " _Environmental
Breach_ "), must be accompanied by a written report from a reputable
nationally or regionally recognized environmental consulting firm confirming,
in reasonable detail, the existence of the conditions as to which
an Environmental Breach is claimed. The failure by any indemnified party to
notify the indemnifying party promptly (so long as a Valid Other Claim Notice
is given before the expiration of the applicable period set forth in Section
12.1) will not waive any rights of the indemnified party, except to the
extent that the rights of the indemnifying party are actually prejudiced
thereby.



12.4. _Other Provisions_.



(a) If the Closing shall occur, the indemnification provided in this Article
XII shall be the sole and exclusive remedy for any inaccuracy or breach
of any representation or warranty made by SPX or GE or their respective
Affiliates in this Agreement; provided, however, that this exclusive remedy
for Damages does not preclude a party from bringing an action for specific
performance or other equitable relief to require a party to perform its
agreements, covenants or obligations under this Agreement or for fraud or
willful misconduct; and, provided, further, that the provisions of this
Section 12.4 shall not apply to the Supply Agreement or the Transitional
Services Agreement. All amounts payable by a party in indemnification of
another party hereto shall be considered an adjustment to the Purchase Price.



(b) An indemnifying party shall only be liable for actual Damages of the
indemnified party in connection with an Other Claim, it being understood that
an indemnifying party shall in no event be liable for punitive damages in
connection with an Other Claim. An  



 

-50-  indemnifying party shall be liable (subject to the limitations on liability
set forth in this Article XII) for all Damages that form part of a Third
Party Claim, including loss of profits, consequential damages and punitive
damages.



(c) Upon making any payment to an indemnified party for any indemnification
claim under this Agreement, the indemnifying party shall be subrogated, to the
extent of such payment (an " _Indemnification Payment_ "), to any rights
which the indemnified party or its Affiliate may have against any other
parties (including under any insurance policies) with respect to the subject
matter underlying such indemnification claim. The indemnified party and its
Affiliates shall cooperate with the indemnifying party in the pursuit of such
rights and shall promptly turn over to the indemnifying party any payments (up
to the amount of the Indemnification Payment) received in respect of
such rights.



(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, neither SPX
nor its Affiliates shall have any liability for any failure by a GE
Indemnified Party to comply with applicable Law after the Closing by reason of
the EST Business being operated after the first anniversary of the Closing
in the manner operated prior to the Closing.



(e) In respect of any Environmental Liability for which a Valid Claim Notice
has been submitted, the indemnified party shall control all Remedial Action
with respect thereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that SPX shall retain control
over all Remedial Actions relating to Excluded Liabilities. The indemnifying
party shall be entitled to participate fully in all substantive deliberations
regarding the Environmental Liability and any Remedial Action with respect
thereto. The indemnifying party shall only be responsible for Remedial
Actions that are required to be undertaken by an Environmental Law or by any
Governmental Authority and only for such Remedial Action as represents the
least stringent remedy required by an Environmental Law or by
such Governmental Authority based on the use of the property as of the
Closing Date. Each of the GE Indemnified Parties understands and agrees that
the rights accorded by Section 12.2(a) in respect of Section 3.13 are its sole
and exclusive remedy against SPX with respect to any Environmental Breaches.
For the avoidance of doubt, in the event of Damages arising out of an
Environmental Breach, the entire amount of any such Damages shall be included
in determining whether the Deductible has been reached, it being understood
that no claim for Damages arising out of an Environmental Breach with respect
to the representations and warranties set forth in Sections 3.13(a), (e) and
(f) may be made until any breaches of or inaccuracies in such Sections,
individually or in the aggregate, give rise to Environmental Liabilities in
excess of $3,000,000 but once such threshold has been met, any claim for
indemnification shall include such threshold amount.



(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, (i)
no investigation of the EST Business by GE or its representatives or advisors
(or any knowledge of GEs representatives or advisors) prior to or after the
date of this Agreement shall, and (ii) the delivery by GE of any document,
waiver or other instrument or written communication pursuant to Section 6.4
shall not, diminish, obviate or cure any breach of any of the representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements of SPX contained in this Agreement, any
Ancillary Agreement or any other agreement, document or instrument delivered
pursuant hereto.



 

-51- (g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, there shall be
no right to indemnification for the breach or inaccuracy of the
representations and warranties set forth in the GEs Certificate or the SPXs
Certificate.



(h) The amount of any Damages shall be computed net of any insurance proceeds
received by the indemnified party in connection therewith but shall not
take account of any tax benefit.



(i) In calculating any amounts payable by SPX pursuant to Article XII in
respect of any Damages incurred by a GE Indemnified Party, SPX shall receive
credit for (and the amount of Damages subject to indemnification pursuant to
Article XII shall be reduced by) (a) the amount of any reduction in current
assets or increase in current liabilities reflected in the calculation of
Closing Date Working Capital applicable to such Damages, but only to the
extent any such amount results in a reduction to the cash consideration
paid by GE or a Purchasing Entity to SPX and its Affiliates hereunder (i.e. a
reduction in the amount by which the Closing Date Working Capital exceeds the
Permitted Excess Amount or an increase in the amount by which the Permitted
Deficiency Amount exceeds the Closing Date Working Capital) and (b) the
amount of any reduction in current assets or increase in current liabilities
sought by GE to be reflected in the calculation of Closing Date Working
Capital applicable to such Damages but which were not so reflected by reason
of SPXs dispute of such reflection and the resolution of such dispute
(including by agreement of SPX and GE) in favor of SPX pursuant to Section
2.1.



12.5. _Brokers Fees, Etc_. SPX shall pay, and shall indemnify GE in respect
of, any and all investment banking fees, brokers or finders fees, or any
other commission or similar fee, payable to any Person acting on behalf of SPX
or any of its Affiliates (including the Members of the EST Group) or under the
authority of any of them, in connection with any of the transactions
contemplated herein, and GE shall pay, and shall indemnify SPX in respect of,
any and all investment banking fees, brokers or finders fees, or any other

with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof, and supersede all
previous written, oral or implied understandings among them with respect to
such matters. Any matters disclosed in any particular section of the
Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to have been disclosed in any other
section of the Disclosure Schedule for which such matter is relevant so long
as the applicability of such matter to such other section is apparent. Any
such disclosure shall expressly not be deemed to constitute an admission by
SPX or to otherwise imply that any such matter is material for the purposes
of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the
contrary, nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to confer
on any Person other than the parties hereto or their respective
successors and permitted assigns any rights, remedies, obligations or
liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement.



13.3. _Governing Law, Etc_. This Agreement shall be construed in accordance
with and governed by the Laws of the State of New York applicable
to agreements made and to be performed wholly within such jurisdiction. Each
of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consents to
submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the State of New York
and of the United States of America in each case located in the County of New
York for any Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby (and agrees not to commence any Action
relating thereto except in such courts), and further agrees that service of
any process, summons, notice or document by U.S. registered mail to its
respective address set forth in Section 13.7 shall be effective service of
process for any Action brought against it in any such court. Each of the
parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives any objection to
the laying of venue of any Action arising out of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby in the courts of the State of New York or the
United States of America in each case located in the County of New York and
hereby further irrevocably and unconditionally waives and agrees not to plead
or claim in any such court that any such Action brought in any such court has
been brought in an inconvenient forum. Each of the parties hereto hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law, any and all rights to trial by jury in connection with any
Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby.



13.4. _Successors and Assigns_. The terms and conditions of this Agreement
shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the respective successors
and assigns of the parties hereto. None of GE, GE Canada, the Purchasing
Entities, SPX or the Other SPX Sellers may assign this Agreement or any of
its rights hereunder without the prior written consent of SPX or GE, as
applicable; provided, however, that each of GE and GE Canada may assign, in
its sole discretion, any or all of its rights, interests and obligations
under this Agreement to any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of GE,
and provided that EST and/or GSBS may, prior to the Closing, transfer,

rights and obligations under this Agreement in respect of the portion of such
U.S. EST Assets, capital stock and/or Assumed Liabilities so assigned, in
which event the assignee shall be the transferor hereunder of the U.S. EST
Assets so assigned; _provided_ , _however_ , that GE shall be deemed to have
acted reasonably in withholding its consent if such assignment would increase
the indemnification obligations of GE and GE Canada under Section  



 

-53-  4(b) (iii) of the Tax Matters Agreement or increase the indemnification
obligations of GE and the Purchasing Entities under Section 12.2(c)(v), it
being further understood that if SPX, on behalf of the SPX Indemnified
Parties, waives any rights to such increased indemnification, the
indemnification obligations of GE, GE Canada and the Purchasing Entities under
the foregoing provisions shall not be deemed to be increased. Any such
assignment shall not relieve the party making the assignment from any of its
obligations under this Agreement.



13.5. _Bulk Sales Laws_. GE, GE Canada and the Purchasing Entities hereby
waive any requirement that SPX or any of the Other SPX Sellers comply
with any bulk sales Laws applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby.

policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
adverse manner to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other
provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties
hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect
the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable
manner so that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the
