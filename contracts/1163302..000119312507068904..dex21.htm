iv _AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER_

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of March 28, 2007 (this "Agreement"),
by and among UNITED STATES STEEL CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation
("Parent"),WP ACQUISITION HOLDING CORP., a Delaware corporation and a wholly
owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"), and LONE STAR TECHNOLOGIES, INC., a
Delaware corporation (the "Company"). Capitalized terms used in this
Agreement shall have the meanings assigned to them in Article XI, or in the
applicable Section of this Agreement to which reference is made in Article XI.

WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company
have approved the merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company
(the "Merger") upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement and have approved and declared advisable this Agreement and
determined that it is in the best interest of their respective stockholders;

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, the
parties hereto agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

THE MERGER

1.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and
into the Company, whereupon the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub
shall cease and the Company shall be the surviving corporation (the
"Surviving Corporation"). The Merger shall have the effects specified in the
Delaware General Corporation Law (the "DGCL").

1.2 _Closing; Effective Time_.

(a) The closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall take place at the offices
of Morgan, Lewis and Bockius LLP, One Oxford Centre, Pittsburgh, PA 15219 as
soon as possible, but in any event no later than two Business Days after
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VIII (other
than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing,
but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions at the Closing),
or on such other date or at such other place as Parent and the Company may
mutually agree (the "Closing Date").

(b) Upon the Closing, the Company and Merger Sub shall file the Certificate
of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware as provided in
Section 252(c) of the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective at such time as
the Certificate of Merger is so filed or at such later time as may be agreed
by Parent and the Company and specified in the Certificate of Merger (the
"Effective Time").



 

1 1.3 _Certificate of Incorporation; Bylaws_.

(a) The Certificate of Incorporation of the Company shall be amended at the
Effective Time as set forth in Exhibit A hereto and, as so amended, shall be
the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until amended
thereafter in accordance with Applicable Law.

(b) The Bylaws of Merger Sub in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in
accordance with Applicable Law.

(c) From and after the Effective Time, until successors are duly elected or
appointed and qualified in accordance with Applicable Law, (i) the directors
of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors
of the Surviving Corporation, and (ii) the officers of Merger Sub immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be the officers of the
Surviving Corporation.

ARTICLE II

EFFECT ON CAPITAL STOCK; SURRENDER OF CERTIFICATES AND PAYMENT

2.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any
stockholder of the Company (each such stockholder, a "Company Stockholder"):

(a) Except as otherwise provided in Section 2.1(b) or Section 2.5, each share
of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be converted into the right to receive $67.50 in cash, without interest
(the "Merger Consideration").

(b) Each outstanding share of Company Common Stock owned by Parent, Merger Sub
or any other Subsidiary of Parent and each outstanding share of Company Common
Stock owned by the Company or any direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary
of the Company, in each case not held on behalf of third parties, immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to
exist, and no cash, securities or other consideration shall be payable with
respect thereto.

(c) Each share of common stock of Merger Sub, par value $.001 per share,
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into and become one fully paid and nonassessable share of common
stock of the Surviving Corporation.

(d) If between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock shall have been changed into a
different number of shares or a different class, by reason of any stock
dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination
or exchange of shares or any similar event, the Merger Consideration and any
other amounts payable pursuant to this  



 

2  Agreement shall be correspondingly adjusted to the extent appropriate to
reflect such stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization,
split, combination or exchange of shares or similar event.

2.2 _Surrender of Stock Certificates and Payment_.

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint a paying agent
reasonably acceptable to the Company (the "Paying Agent") for the purpose of
exchanging (i) certificates representing shares of Company Common Stock (the
"Certificates") and (ii) uncertificated shares of Company Common Stock (the
"Uncertificated Shares") for the Merger Consideration. Immediately following
the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with
the Paying Agent for exchange in accordance with this Section through the
Paying Agent, cash sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration
pursuant to Section 2.1(a) (the "Payment Fund"). The Paying Agent shall make
the cash payments provided for in the preceding sentence out of the Payment
Fund. The Payment Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. The Payment
Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by Parent, _provided_
that such investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United
States of America, in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better
by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation,
respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or
bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $1 billion.
Any interest or other income resulting from such investment shall be payable
to Parent.

(b) Promptly after the Effective Time and in any event within five Business
Days after the Closing Date, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to
each holder of record of shares of Company Common Stock at the Effective Time
a letter of transmittal and instructions (which shall be in customary form
and shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title
shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates or transfer of the
Uncertificated Shares to the Paying Agent) for use in such exchange. Each
holder of shares of Company Common Stock that have been converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration shall be entitled to receive the
Merger Consideration in respect of the Company Common Stock represented by a
Certificate or Uncertificated Share upon (x) surrender to the Paying Agent of
a Certificate, together with a properly completed letter of transmittal, or
(y) receipt of an "agents message" by the Paying Agent (or any other
evidence that the Paying Agent may reasonably request ) in the case of a book-
entry transfer of Uncertificated Shares. Until so surrendered or transferred
as the case may be, each such Certificate or Uncertificated Share shall
represent after the Effective Time for all purposes only the right to receive
such Merger Consideration.

(c) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person
other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the
transferred Uncertificated Share is registered, it shall be a condition to
such payment that (i) either such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or
shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer or such Uncertificated Share
shall be properly transferred and (ii) the Person requesting such payment
shall pay to the Paying Agent any transfer or other taxes required as a
result of such payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate or Uncertificated Share or establish by evidence satisfactory to
the Paying Agent that any such taxes have been paid or are not payable. 



 

3 (d) After the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be
closed and there shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of
Company Common Stock. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares are presented to Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
the Paying Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the
Merger Consideration provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set
forth, in this Article II.

(e) Any portion of the Payment Fund that remains unclaimed by the holders of
Company Common Stock six months after the Effective Time shall be returned to
Parent, and any such holder who has not exchanged shares of Company Common
Stock for the Merger Consideration in accordance with this Section 2.2 prior
to that time shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of the Merger
Consideration. Any portion of the Payment Fund remaining unclaimed by Company
Stockholders immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise
escheat to or become property of any Governmental Entity pursuant to
Applicable Law shall, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, become the
property of Parent free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto. Neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation
shall be liable to any Company Stockholder or other Person for cash delivered
to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat
or similar law.

2.3 _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Surviving Corporation, Parent and
the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any Company
Stockholder such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect
to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the "Code"), or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law. To
the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving Corporation, Parent
or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, such withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder
of the shares of Company Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying
Agent, as the case may be.

2.4 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact
by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, and,
if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such
reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that
may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will
issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger
Consideration to be paid in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock
formerly represented by such Certificate, as contemplated by this Article II.



 

4 2.5 _Dissenting Shares_.

(a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, shares of
Company Common Stock that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time and held by a holder who has not voted in favor of the Merger or
consented thereto in writing and who has properly demanded appraisal for such
shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (collectively,
the "Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into a right to receive the
Merger Consideration. Such holders shall be entitled to receive payment of the
appraised value of the shares of Company Common Stock held by them in
accordance with the DGCL, unless and until such holders fail to perfect or
effectively withdraw or otherwise lose their appraisal rights under the DGCL.
All shares of Company Common Stock held by holders who shall have failed to
perfect or who shall have effectively withdrawn or lost their right to
appraisal of such shares under the DGCL shall thereupon be treated as if they
had been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration.

(b) From the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, the Company
shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any demands for appraisal received by
the Company, withdrawals of such demands, and any other related instruments
served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company and (ii) the
opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to,
or demands for, appraisal under the DGCL. The Company shall not, except with
the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or
offer to settle or settle, any such demands.

2.6 _Company Stock Options; Company Restricted Shares_.

(a) In connection with the Merger and prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall take all action as is necessary to cause each option to purchase shares
of Company Common Stock (each, a "Company Stock Option") outstanding under any
stock option, equity compensation plan or agreement (the "Company Stock
Plans"), whether or not then vested or exercisable, to become, as of the
Effective Time, fully vested and converted into the right to receive at the
Effective Time, a cash payment from the Surviving Corporation equal to the
product of (i) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the
exercise price per share of such option, multiplied by (ii) the number of
shares of Company Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such option (with the
aggregate amount of such payment rounded down to the nearest cent), less such
amounts as are required to be withheld or deducted under any provision of
Applicable Law. At the Effective Time, all Company Stock Options shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically cease to exist, and each holder
of a Company Stock Option shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive the cash payment (if any) described in
this Section 2.6.

(b) In connection with the Merger and prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall take all action as is necessary to cause each share of Company Common
Stock outstanding under any Company Stock Plan that is subject to vesting and
a repurchase option in favor of the Company immediately prior to the Effective
Time, to become fully vested at the Effective Time and be converted to the
right to receive the Merger Consideration, less such amounts as are required
to be withheld or deducted under any provision of Applicable Law.



 

5 (c) In connection with the Merger and prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall take all action as is necessary to cause each restricted stock unit and
each share of phantom stock outstanding under any Company Stock Plan, whether
or not then vested or exercisable, to become, as of the Effective Time, fully
vested and converted into the right to receive at the Effective Time, a cash
payment from the Surviving Corporation equal to the Merger Consideration, less
such amounts as are required to be withheld or deducted under any provision of
Applicable Law. At the Effective Time, all restricted stock units or shares
of phantom stock of the Company shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically cease to exist, and each holder of a restricted stock unit or
share of phantom stock shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto,
except the right to receive the cash payment described in this Section 2.6.

(d) The Company shall take all action that is necessary to (i) cause the
exercise of each outstanding purchase right under the Companys Employee Stock
Purchase Plan (the "ESPP") no less than five Business Days prior to the
Effective Time; (ii) provide that no further purchase period or offering
period shall commence under the ESPP following the date of this Agreement; and
(iii) terminate the ESPP immediately prior to and effective as of the
Effective Time.

ARTICLE III

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

Except as set forth in the disclosure schedule dated the date hereof and
provided to Parent by the Company (the "Company Disclosure Schedule"), or as
disclosed in the Company SEC Reports filed or furnished prior to the date
hereof (excluding, in each case, any disclosures set forth in any risk factor
section and in any section relating to forward-looking statements), the
Company represents and warrants to Parent that:

3.1 _Organization and Good Standing_. The Company is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State
of Delaware and has all corporate powers required to own, lease and operate
its properties and to carry on its business as now being conducted.
The Company is duly qualified to do business as a foreign corporation and is
in good standing in each jurisdiction where such qualification is necessary,
except for those jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified and in
good standing would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company has delivered to
Parent prior to the date of this Agreement complete and correct copies of its
certificate of incorporation and bylaws as currently in effect.

3.2 _Authority and Enforceability_.

(a) The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority to enter into
this Agreement, and, subject in the case of the consummation of the Merger to
obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, to perform its obligations
hereunder and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The
execution, delivery and  



 

6  performance by the Company of this Agreement and the consummation by the
Company of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly authorized by
all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company, subject in the
case of the consummation of the Merger to obtaining the Company Stockholder
Approval. The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock at a duly convened meeting of the Companys
stockholders to adopt this Agreement (the "Company Stockholder Approval") is
the only vote of the holders of any class of capital stock or other security
of the Company necessary in connection with the consummation of the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. This Agreement has
been duly executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming the due
execution of this Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub, constitutes the valid
and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against it in accordance
with its terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws affecting or
relating to creditors rights generally, and the availability of injunctive
relief and other equitable remedies.

(b) At a meeting duly called and held, prior to the execution of this
Agreement, at which all directors of the Company were present, the Board of
Directors of the Company, by resolutions duly adopted, unanimously (i) adopted
this Agreement and declared it advisable, (ii) recommended that the Company
Stockholders vote in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and (iii)
directed that the Company submit the adoption of this Agreement to a vote at
the Company Stockholder Meeting.

3.3 _Governmental Authorizations_. The execution, delivery and performance by
the Company of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby require no action by or in respect of, or filing with, any
Governmental Entity, other than (i) compliance with the applicable
requirements of (A) the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976
(the "HSR Act") and (B) the antitrust and competition laws of all relevant
jurisdictions other than those of the United States (the "Other Antitrust
Laws"), (ii) the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Delaware
Secretary of State and appropriate documents with the relevant authorities of
other states in which the Company is qualified to do business, (iii) the
filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") of the Proxy
Statement and such reports under Sections 13, 15(d) and 16 of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act") as may be required in connection
with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and (iv) such
filings under the rules of the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE") as may be
required in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby.

3.4 _Non-Contravention_. The execution, delivery and performance by the
Company of this Agreement and the consummation by the Company of the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby do not and will not (i)
contravene, conflict with, or result in any violation or breach of any
provision of the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Company, (ii)
assuming compliance with the matters referred to in Section 3.3, contravene,
conflict with, or result in a violation or breach of any provision of any
Applicable Law or Order, (iii) require any consent or other action by any
Person under, constitute a default, or an event that, with or without notice
or lapse of time or both, would  



 

7  constitute a default under, or cause or permit the termination,

included in the Proxy Statement based upon information furnished to the
Company in writing by Parent or Merger Sub specifically for use therein.

requirements of ERISA, the Code, and other Applicable Laws and have been
administered in accordance with their terms and such laws, except where the
failure to so comply or to be so administered would not be material. Each
Company Benefit Plan that is intended to be qualified within the meaning of

sharing arrangement or other actual or contingent liability arising wholly or
partially out of events occurring prior to the Closing.



 

17 (d) There are no pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened
claims and no pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened
litigation with respect to any Company Benefit Plans, other than ordinary and

Labor or Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation or (ii) any material Contract,
Order or other understanding between the Company or any ERISA Affiliate, on
the one hand, and any of the SEC, Internal Revenue Service, Department of
Labor or Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation on the other.

(e) No Company Benefit Plan is a "multiemployer plan" as that term is defined

the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice, or as required
by their terms as in effect on the date of this Agreement, of claims,

and supervision over its and its Subsidiaries respective operations.

5.2 _Access to Information_. Subject to Applicable Laws relating to the
exchange of information and the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement by and
between Parent and the Company dated January 23, 2007 (the "Confidentiality
Agreement"), upon reasonable notice, the Company shall, and shall cause
its Subsidiaries to, afford to Parents officers, directors, employees,
accountants, counsel, consultants, advisors and agents ("Representatives")
reasonable access to and the right to reasonably inspect, during normal
business hours, all of the Real Property, properties, assets, records,
Contracts and other documents related to the Company and its Subsidiaries, and
shall permit them to consult with the officers, employees, accountants,
counsel and agents of the Company and its Subsidiaries; provided, however,
for the avoidance of doubt, Parent and Parents Representatives (including
environmental consultants) shall not be allowed to undertake any invasive
environmental investigations, which means for the sake of clarity, no
sampling of the environment, including soil, groundwater, surface water,
sediments or air emissions or building materials at the Real Property. Subject
to Applicable Laws, the Company shall furnish to Parent all such
material documents and copies of material documents and records and
information with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries and copies of any
working papers relating thereto as Parent may reasonably request and  



 

30  which can be provided without undue expense. All requests for access to
individuals and information under this Section 5.2 shall be directed solely
to Robert Spears or such persons as he may designate. Neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or to disclose
information where such access or disclosure would violate or prejudice the
rights of its customers, jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of the
institution in possession or control of such information or contravene any
Applicable Laws. Any such investigation pursuant to this Section 5.2 shall be
conducted in such a manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the business
or operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries.

5.3 _Nonsolicitation_.

 

(a) Subject to Section 5.3(b), except with respect to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, the Company agrees that it will not, and it
will cause its Subsidiaries and its and their respective Representatives not
to: (i) initiate, solicit, encourage or seek, directly or indirectly, any
inquiries relating to or the making or implementation of any Third Party
Proposal; (ii) engage in any negotiations concerning, or provide any
information or data to, or have any substantive discussions with, any Person
(other than Parent and its Representatives) relating to a Third Party
Proposal; (iii) otherwise knowingly cooperate in or knowingly facilitate any
effort or attempt to make, implement or accept any proposal or offer that
constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead to, any Third Party
Proposal; (iv) enter into a Contract with any Person relating to a Third
Party Proposal or (v) release any third party from, or waive any provision of,
any confidentiality or standstill agreement to which it is a party. The
Company will immediately cease, and will cause its Subsidiaries and
Representatives immediately to cease, any and all existing activities,
discussions or negotiations with any third parties conducted heretofore with
respect to (or reasonably likely to lead to) any Third Party Proposal. "Third
Party Proposal" means any Contract, proposal or offer (including any proposal
or offer to the stockholders of the Company) with respect to a proposed or
potential Acquisition Transaction. "Acquisition Transaction" means: (A) any
sale, lease or other disposition, direct or indirect (and however structured),
of any business or assets of the Company and/or any of its Subsidiaries (which
business or assets represent 15% or more of the consolidated revenues, net
income or assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole), (B)
any tender offer (including a self-tender offer) or exchange offer that, if
consummated, would result in a third party beneficially owning 15% or more of
any class of securities of the Company, (C) a merger, consolidation, share
exchange, business combination, reorganization, joint venture,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or other similar transaction
involving the Company and/or any of its Subsidiaries (which Subsidiaries
represent 15% or more of the consolidated revenues, net income or assets of
the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole), (D) the issuance, sale or
other disposition, direct or indirect (and however structured), of securities
(or securities or other rights convertible into, or exercisable or
exchangeable for, such securities) representing 15% or more of the voting
power or capital stock of the Company and/or any of its Subsidiaries (which
Subsidiaries represent 15% or more of the consolidated revenues, net income or
assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole) or (E) any
combination of the foregoing (other than the Merger or any other transaction
by or on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub).



 

31 (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to the adoption of this Agreement by
the Company Stockholders, in response to an unsolicited _bona fide_ written
Third Party Proposal made after the date hereof that the Companys Board of
Directors determines in good faith (after consultation with a financial
advisor of nationally recognized reputation and outside legal counsel)
constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal, the
Company may, after giving Parent prompt notice of such determination, (i)
furnish information with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the
Person making such Third Party Proposal (and its Representatives) pursuant to
a confidentiality and standstill agreement on terms no less favorable to the
Company than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement and containing
additional provisions that expressly permit the Company to comply with the
terms of this Section 5.3 (a copy of which confidentiality agreement shall be
promptly (and in all events within 24 hours) provided for informational
purposes only to Parents outside legal counsel); _provided_ , _that_ (A)
prior to providing any information or data to any Person or entering into
discussions or negotiations with any Person, the Company notifies Parent
promptly of any such inquiry, proposal or offer received by, any such
information requested from, or any such discussions or negotiations sought to
be initiated or continued with, the Company or any of its officers, directors,
employees, advisors and agents indicating, in connection with such notice,
the material terms and conditions of the Third Party Proposal and the identity
of the Person making such Third Party Proposal and (B) subject to Applicable
Laws relating to the exchange of information, all such information (to the
extent such information has not been previously provided or otherwise made
available to Parent) is provided or made available to Parent, as the case may
be, substantially concurrent with the time it is provided or made available
to such Person, as the case may be, and (ii) participate in discussions or
negotiations with the Person making such Third Party Proposal (and its
Representatives) regarding such Third Party Proposal; _provided_ ,  _that_
the Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed, on a prompt basis, of the
status and material terms of any such proposals or offers and the status of
any such discussions or negotiations and will notify Parent promptly of
any determination by the Board of the Directors of the Company that a
Superior Proposal has been made. For purposes of this Agreement, a "Superior
Proposal" means an unsolicited written _bona fide_ Third Party Proposal
pursuant to which a Person (or its stockholders) would own, if consummated,
all of the outstanding capital stock of the Company (or of the surviving
entity in a merger or the direct or indirect parent of the surviving entity in
a merger) or all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole containing terms that the Board of Directors of
the Company determines, in its good faith judgment, after consultation with a
financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation and outside legal
counsel, and taking into account all legal, financial, regulatory, timing and
other aspects regarding the proposal and the Person making the proposal deemed
relevant by the Board of Directors of the Company (i) are terms more
favorable to the Company Stockholders from a financial point of view than the
terms of the Merger, and (ii) constitute a transaction that is reasonably
likely to be completed as proposed.

(c) The Board of Directors of the Company shall not (i) withdraw or modify or
change in a manner adverse to Parent, the approval of this Agreement or
recommendation by the Board of Directors of the Company that the Company
Stockholders vote in favor of this Agreement, (ii) approve, recommend or cause
the  



 

32  Company to enter into any agreement with respect to any Third Party Proposal
or (iii) propose to do any of the foregoing (any such action, resolution
or agreement to take such action, an "Adverse Recommendation Change").
Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to obtaining the Company
Stockholder Approval, the Board of Directors of the Company may, in response
to a Superior Proposal or an Intervening Event, effect an Adverse
Recommendation Change, _provided_ _that_ the Board of Directors determines in
good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that its failure to
do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law;
_provided_ , _however_ , if such action is in response to a Third Party
Proposal that the Board of Directors determined, in its good faith judgment,
constitutes a Superior Proposal, then such action may only be taken
concurrently with entering into a definitive agreement providing for the
consummation of a transaction with respect to such Superior Proposal and
termination of this Agreement in accordance with Section 9.1(a)(iv)(B); 
_provided_ , _further_ , prior to taking such action, the Board of Directors
shall have (1) given Parent at least three Business Days prior written notice
(the "Notice Period") that the Company intends to take such action, which
notice shall, in the case of an Intervening Event, include information
describing such Intervening Event in reasonable detail, and provided Parent
with a reasonable opportunity to respond to any such Superior Proposal
or Intervening Event (which response could include a proposal to revise the
terms of the transactions contemplated hereby) and (2) fully considered, to
the extent deemed appropriate by the Board of Directors of the Company, any
such response by Parent and concluded that, notwithstanding such response, in
the case of a Superior Proposal such Third Party Proposal continues to be a
Superior Proposal in relation to the transactions contemplated hereby, as the
terms hereof may be proposed to be revised by such response, and in the case
of an Intervening Event, such event continues to constitute an Intervening
Event.

(d) For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Intervening Event" means an
event, circumstance or state of facts unknown to the Board of Directors of the
Company as of the date of this Agreement, which event, circumstance or state
of facts becomes known to the Board of Directors of the Company prior to the
Company Stockholder Approval and which causes the Board of Directors of the
Company to conclude in good faith, after consultation with outside legal
counsel, that its failure to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in no event shall the receipt, existence or terms of a Third
Party Proposal or any matter relating thereto or consequence thereof
constitute an Intervening Event.

(e) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or its
Board of Directors from taking and disclosing to the Company Stockholders a
position contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the
Exchange Act; or from making any disclosure to the Company Stockholders with
respect to a tender or exchange offer by a third party, if the Board of
Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after consultation with its
financial advisor and legal counsel, that its failure to do so would
constitute a breach of Applicable Law; _provided_ _that_ neither the Company
nor its Board of Directors, nor any committee thereof, shall approve or
recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend, a Third Party Proposal
unless the Company has first terminated this Agreement pursuant to Section
9.1(a)(iv)(B) hereof and has otherwise complied with the provisions thereof.



 

33 5.4 _Company Stockholder Meeting; Proxy Statement_.

(a) The Company shall establish a record date for, duly call, give notice of,
convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders (the "Company Stockholder
Meeting"), for the purpose of voting on adoption of this Agreement. Subject to
Section 5.3, the Board of Directors of the Company shall recommend adoption of
this Agreement by the Companys stockholders. In connection with such
meeting, the Company shall, as promptly as practicable after the date hereof,
prepare and file the Proxy Statement with the SEC. The Company shall, as
promptly as practicable after the date hereof, (i) use its reasonable best
efforts to (A) have the Proxy Statement cleared by the SEC, (B) mail to its
stockholders as promptly as practicable the Proxy Statement and all other
proxy materials for the Company Stockholder Meeting and (C) if necessary in
order to comply with applicable securities laws, after the Proxy Statement
shall have been so mailed, promptly circulate amended or supplemental proxy
material, and, if required in connection therewith, resolicit proxies, (ii)
use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval
and (iii) otherwise comply with all legal requirements applicable to the
Company Stockholder Meeting.

(b) Parent and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review
and comment on the Proxy Statement before such document (or any amendment or
supplement thereto) is filed with the SEC, and the Company shall include in
such document any comments reasonably proposed by Parent and its counsel. The
Company shall (i) as promptly as practicable after receipt thereof, provide
Parent and its counsel with copies of any written comments, and advise Parent
and its counsel of any oral comments, with respect to the Proxy Statement (or
any amendment or supplement thereto) received from the SEC or its staff
("SEC Comments"), (ii) provide Parent and its counsel a reasonable
opportunity to review the Companys proposed response to the SEC Comments,
(iii) include in the Companys written response to the SEC Comments any
comments reasonably proposed by Parent and its counsel, and (iv) provide
Parent and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to participate in any
discussions or meetings with the SEC with respect to the SEC Comments.

COVENANTS OF PARENT

 

6.1 _Delisting and Deregistration_. Parent shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the Company Common Stock to be no longer listed on the NYSE

34 6.2 _Indemnification_.

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, to the fullest
extent permitted by Applicable Law, indemnify, defend and hold harmless, and
provide advancement of expenses to, each Person who was, is now or who becomes
prior to the Effective Time, an officer, director or employee of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries (the "Indemnified Parties") against all losses,
claims, damages, costs, fees, disbursements, expenses, liabilities or
judgments or amounts that are paid in settlement of, investigation of or
otherwise in connection with, including preparation for defending against,
any Action that is based in whole or in part on, or arises in whole or in part
out of, the fact that such Person is or was a director, officer or employee of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and pertaining to any matter existing
or occurring, or any acts or omissions occurring, at or prior to the Effective
Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, or at or after, the Effective Time
(including matters, acts or omissions occurring in connection with the
approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby) to the same extent such Persons are entitled to be
indemnified or have the right to advancement of expenses as of the date
of this Agreement by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws of such entity and indemnification
agreements of the Company and its Subsidiaries, if any, in existence on the
date hereof with any directors, officers and employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries; _provided_ , _however_ , that the provision of the Companys
certificate of incorporation that limits each directors personal liability to
$25,000 shall be deemed instead to limit each such directors personal
liability to $0 (other than those liabilities set forth in the certificate of
incorporation that are not subject to limitation). For purposes of this
paragraph, expenses shall include fees, disbursements and expenses of
counsel, consultants, advisors and expert witnesses.

(b) At the Companys election in consultation with Parent, (i) the Company
shall obtain prior to the Effective Time prepaid "tail" insurance policies
with a claims period of six (6) years from the Effective Time with respect to
directors and officers liability indemnification in amount and scope
(including Side A Coverage) no less favorable than the Companys existing
policies for claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or prior to
the Effective Time or (ii) if the Company shall not have obtained such tail
policy, for a period of six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause
to be maintained in effect the current directors and officers liability
insurance policies maintained by the Company with respect to claims arising
from facts or events that occurred prior to the Effective Time (including
matters, acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby); 
_provided_ , _that_ if the existing directors and officers liability
insurance policy expires, is terminated or cancelled during such six-year
period, Parent shall cause to be substituted therefor policies containing
terms and conditions which are no less favorable to the former officers and
directors of the Company and its Subsidiaries only with respect to claims
arising from facts or events that occurred prior to the Effective Time
(including matters, acts or omissions occurring in connection with the
approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby); _provided_ , _further_ , _that_ if the aggregate annual
premiums for such policies at any time during such period exceed 300% of the
amount paid by the Company in respect of its 2007 coverage, which amount is
set forth in Section 6.2(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, Parent shall
be required to provide such coverage as will then be available at an annual
premium equal to 300% of such rate.



 

35 (c) This Section 6.2 is intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, the Indemnified Parties and their heirs and personal
representatives and shall be binding on Parent and the Surviving Corporation
and their respective successors and assigns.

(d) In the event the Surviving Corporation or Parent or any of their
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving
Corporation or Parent, as applicable, assume the indemnification obligations
set forth in this Section 6.2.

6.3 _Employee Matters_. Parent shall, for a period of 12 months immediately
following the Effective Time, cause the Surviving Corporation and
its Subsidiaries to provide employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries
other than those covered by Company CBAs (the "Company Employees") with (i)
the same level of base salary as in effect on the Effective Time and (ii)
employee benefit plans, programs, contracts and arrangements that are no less
favorable, in the aggregate, than similar employee benefit plans, programs,
contracts and arrangements provided by the Company and its subsidiaries to
Company Employees prior to the Effective Time. Parent or one of its
Affiliates shall recognize the service of Company Employees with the Company
prior to the Effective Time as service with Parent and its Affiliates in
connection with any tax-qualified pension plan, 401(k) savings plan, welfare
benefit plans and policies (including vacations and holiday policies)
maintained by Parent or one of its Affiliates which is made available
following the Effective Time by Parent or one of its Affiliates for purposes
of any waiting period, vesting, eligibility and benefit entitlement (but
excluding benefit accruals); _provided_ , _however_ , that with respect to any
defined benefit pension plan maintained by Parent or one of its Affiliates in
which any such Company Employee participates following the Effective Time,
such service credit shall be measured from the earliest date that such
employee commenced participation in a tax-qualified pension or savings plan
maintained by the Company or one of its Affiliates. Parent shall or, as
appropriate, shall cause the Surviving Corporation to (i) waive, or cause its
insurance carriers to waive, all limitations as to pre-existing and at-work
conditions, if any, with respect to participation and coverage requirements
applicable to Company Employees under any welfare benefit plan (as defined in
Section 3(1) of ERISA) which is made available to Company Employees following
the Effective Time by Parent or one of its Affiliates, and (ii) provide
credit to Company Employees for any co-payments, deductibles and out-of-pocket
expenses paid by such employees under the employee benefit plans, programs and
arrangements of the Company and its subsidiaries during the portion of the
relevant plan year including the Effective Time. In the event Surviving
Corporation or Parent or any of their successors or assigns (i) consolidates
with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing
or surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger or (ii)
transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person,
then, and in each case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors
and assigns of Surviving Corporation or Parent, as applicable, honor all the
Companys employment, severance, termination and deferred compensation
Contracts as in effect at the Effective Time, in accordance with the  



 

36  terms thereof. Notwithstanding the above, nothing in this Agreement shall
alter the employment status of employees who are employed on an at-will basis,
and nothing herein shall require the Surviving Corporation or its
Subsidiaries to continue the employment of any person for any specific period
following the Closing Date.

shall be governed by and interpreted and enforced in accordance with the laws
of the State of Delaware applicable to contracts executed in and to be

hereof and that each party shall be entitled to specific performance of the
