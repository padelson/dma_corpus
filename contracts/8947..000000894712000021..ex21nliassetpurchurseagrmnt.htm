SECTION 3.

  |  

Purchase Price; Payment; Adjustment; Allocation

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

3.1 Payment of Purchase Price.

  

  

(a) In consideration of the sale of the Purchased Assets and the Company's and
Principal Shareholders' other covenants and obligations hereunder, at the
Closing, Purchaser agrees, pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions
hereof, to (a) pay to the Company an amount equal to Eighty Million Dollars
($80,000,000.00), as adjusted pursuant to Section 3.2 (the "Cash Purchase
Price"), in accordance with Section 3.1(b) and (b) pay to each of The Frost
National Bank, Craig Irish, and Aron Seiken (the "Creditors") an amount equal
to the applicable portion of the Loan Pay-Off Amount payable to each such
Creditor (together with the Cash Purchase Price, the "Purchase Price") in
accordance with Section 3.1(c).

  

  

(b) The Purchase Price minus (a) the Escrow Amount, and (b) the Loan Pay-Off
Amount will be paid by Purchaser to the Company at Closing by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account specified by the Company.

  

  

(c) At the Closing, Purchaser shall pay to each of the Creditors to such
accounts designated in writing by the Company prior to the Closing Date by
wire transfer of immediately available funds, such amounts, in the aggregate,
that are necessary to repay in full the Company Credit Facilities as of the
Closing Date (such aggregate amount paid, the "Loan Pay-Off Amount").

  

  

(d) At the Closing, Purchaser shall transfer to the Escrow Account, to
JPMorgan Chase Bank, NA as escrow agent (the "Escrow Agent"), a portion of the
Purchase Price equal to the Escrow Amount pursuant to the terms of an escrow
agreement, dated as of the Closing Date, by and among Purchaser, the Company
and the Escrow Agent, in a form substantially similar to the form attached
hereto as Exhibit A (the "Escrow Agreement"), which Indemnity Escrow Amount,
shall be held and distributed in the manner specified in accordance with the
terms and conditions of the Escrow Agreement and this Section 3.1.

  

  

(e) A portion of the Escrow Amount equal to the Receivables Escrow Amount will
be released to the Company on the earlier of (i) the date that all
indebtedness represented by the Accounts Receivable that are included in the
Purchased Assets have been collected or (ii) the date that the Company and the
Principal Shareholders have made payment to Purchaser of the cash amount
described in Section 7.6.

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

15  

  

 

 

 

   
 

(f) If no claim for any Losses is made against the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties pursuant to Section 10.2 (such indemnifiable claims, the "Seller
Indemnifiable Claims") remains unresolved or in dispute, then a portion of the
Indemnity Escrow Amount equal to $4,500,000 shall be released to the Company
on the twelve month anniversary of the Closing Date (the "Initial Escrow
Release Date") and the remainder of the Escrow Amount shall be released to the
Company on the eighteen month anniversary of the Closing Date (together with
the Initial Escrow Release Date, the "Escrow Release Dates"). To the extent
any Seller Indemnifiable Claim remains unresolved or in dispute on either of
the Escrow Release Dates, (i) an amount equal to the estimated Losses with
respect to such disputed or unresolved Seller Indemnifiable Claim shall be
withheld from the Escrow Amount to be released on such Escrow Release Date
and, together with all income (if any) earned on such withheld amount, shall
continue to be held in accordance with the Escrow Agreement and this Section
3.1(e) until such Seller Indemnifiable Claim has been resolved.

  

  

(g) For federal and state income Tax purposes, the Company and Purchaser agree
to treat the Escrow Amount in accordance with Proposed Treasury Regulation
Section 1.468B-8 (February 1, 1999). Accordingly, prior to the determination
date (as defined in Proposed Treasury Regulation Section 1.468B-8(b)),
Purchaser shall be treated as the owner of the Escrow Amount and thus shall
take into account in filing its income Tax Returns all items of income, gain,
loss and deduction with respect to the Escrow Amount in accordance with
Proposed Treasury Regulation Section 1.468B-8(c). From and after the
determination date, Purchaser and the Company shall be treated for Tax
purposes as the owners of their respective shares of the Escrow Amount as set
forth in a statement provided to the Escrow Agent in accordance with Proposed
Treasury Regulation Section 1.468B-8(f), and thus each of Purchaser and the
Company shall take into account in filing its income Tax Returns its share of
the items of income, gain, loss and deduction with respect to the Escrow
Amount in accordance with Proposed Treasury Regulation Section 1.468B-8(e).
Any amount distributed from the Escrow Amount to the Company shall be treated
as a payment pursuant to Purchaser's obligation to the Company arising from
the Company's sale of property to which the installment sale provisions of
Section 453 of the Code, and the interest provisions of Section 483 or 1274 of
the Code shall apply. For this purpose, Purchaser and the Company shall
cooperate to provide to the Escrow Agent, at the time of any disbursement, a
schedule indicating the allocation of such disbursement from the Escrow Amount
between (i) principal and (ii) imputed interest to be reported on IRS Form
1099-INT or 1099-OID. Neither Purchaser nor the Company shall take any
position for federal or state income Tax purposes that is inconsistent with
the provisions of this Section 3.1(f).

  

  

3.2 Adjustment of Purchase Price.

  

  

(a) Within 10 days after the Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to
Purchaser the balance sheet of the Company as of the Closing Date which have
been prepared in a manner consistent with, and using the same methodologies
used in the preparation of, the Financial Statements and the balance sheet
attached hereto as Exhibit B (the "Final Financial Statements"); provided,
however, that the Excluded Assets shall not be included in the calculation of
total assets as set forth therein. Promptly upon Purchaser's request, the
Company shall make available to Purchaser copies of the work papers and back-
up materials used by the Company and the Company's accountants in preparing
the Final Financial Statements and such other documents as Purchaser may
reasonably request in connection with its review of the Final Financial
Statements. Any reasonable fees and expenses incurred by the Company in
connection with the preparation of the Final Financial Statements shall be the
sole responsibility of Purchaser.

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

16  

  

 

 

 

   
 

  

(b) Purchaser shall have thirty (30) days (the "Verification Period") to have
the Final Financial Statements verified by its accounting firm, BDO USA LLP
("BDO"), in a manner consistent with, and using the same methodologies used in
the preparation of, the Financial Statements. During the Verification Period,
the Company shall provide BDO with all required access to conduct such
verification. The fees and expenses payable to BDO with respect to such
verification shall be paid by Purchaser. Within 30 days after Purchaser's
receipt of the Final Financial Statements, Purchaser shall notify the Company
in writing whether or not Purchaser accepts the Final Financial Statements. If
Purchaser accepts the Final Financial Statements, the Final Financial
Statements shall become final and binding on all Parties.

  

  

(c) If Purchaser in good faith objects to any item set forth on the Final
Financial Statements, Purchaser shall give notice thereof to the Company in
writing within 30 days after receipt of the Final Financial Statements,
specifying in reasonable detail the nature and extent of such disagreement,
and Purchaser and the Company shall have a period of 30 days from the
Company's receipt of such notice in which to resolve such disagreement. If
such notice of objection is not received by the Company within 30 days after
receipt of the Final Financial Statements, it shall be deemed that Purchaser
has accepted the Final Financial Statements with respect to all items set
forth therein and the Final Financial Statements shall become final and
binding on all Parties. Any disputed items which cannot be agreed to by the
Parties within 30 days from the Company's receipt of Purchaser's notice of
objection to any of the items set forth in the Final Financial Statements
shall be referred to a mutually agreed upon nationally or regionally
recognized independent accounting firm (the "Independent Accountant") to fully
and finally resolve all unresolved objections. The engagement of and the
determination by Independent Accountant (or any other accounting firm
designated by Independent Accountant as set forth below) shall be completed
within 60 days after such assignment is given to Independent Accountant and
shall be final and binding and shall be nonappealable by the Company and
Purchaser. Judgment may be entered based upon the determination of the
Independent Accountant in any court having jurisdiction over the party against
which such determination is to be enforced. If for any reason Independent
Accountant is unable to act in such capacity, such determination will be made
by any other nationally or regionally recognized accounting firm selected by
Independent Accountant. The scope of the disputes to be resolved by the
Independent Accountant shall be limited to fixing mathematical errors and
determining whether the items in dispute were determined in accordance with
the procedures and standards set forth in this Section 3.2 and the Independent
Accountant is not to make any other determination, including any determination
as to whether the Shareholder's Equity Value is correct. The Independent
Accountant's decision shall be based solely on written submissions by
Purchaser and the Company and their respective representatives and not by
independent review. The Independent Accountant may not assign a value greater
than the greatest value for such item claimed by either party or smaller than
the smallest value for such item claimed by either party. The fees and
expenses payable to Independent Accountant (or any other accounting firm
designated by Independent Accountant) in connection with such determination
will be borne 50% by the Company and the Principal Shareholders (jointly and
severally) and 50% by

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

17  

  

 

 

 

   
 

Purchaser, unless (i) the determination of Independent Accountant (or any
other accounting firm designated by Independent Accountant) with respect to
the disputed amounts results in a payment by the Company, out of the Escrow
Fund or otherwise, in an amount which exceeds by more than $25,000 the amount
the Company shall have last claimed the Company owes hereunder at the end of
the 30 day period following the Company's receipt of Purchaser's notice of
objection, in which case the fees and expenses payable to Independent
Accountant (or any other accounting firm designated by Independent Accountant)
shall be paid by the Company and the Principal Shareholders (jointly and
severally), or (ii) the determination of Independent Accountant (or any other
accounting firm designated by Independent Accountant) with respect to the
disputed amounts results in a payment by Purchaser in an amount which exceeds
by more than $25,000 the amount Purchaser shall have last claimed it owes
hereunder at the end of the 30 day period following the Company's receipt of
Purchaser's notice of objection, in which case the fees and expenses payable
to Independent Accountant (or any other accounting firm designated by
Independent Accountant) shall be paid by Purchaser.

  

  

(d) Within three (3) business days after the date that the Final Financial
Statements become final and binding in accordance with Section 3.2(b) or
3.2(c), as the case may be, either (i) Purchaser shall pay to the Company in
cash (by means of federal funds wire or interbank transfer in immediately
available funds) the amount by which the Shareholders' Equity Value is greater
than $8,022,404 or (ii) Purchaser shall be entitled to receive from the
Company a cash payment equal to the amount by which the Shareholders' Equity
Value is less than $8,022,404 (such amount, the "Company True-Up Payment") or,
at Purchaser's election, to receive from the Escrow Account a portion of the
Escrow Amount equal to the Company True-Up Payment, and Purchaser and the
Company shall promptly execute and deliver a joint instruction letter to the
Escrow Agent to such effect.

  

  

3.3 Allocation of Purchase Price. Prior to the Closing, Purchaser shall engage
an independent third party appraiser (the "Appraiser") to promptly prepare an
appraisal of the fair market values of the tangible Purchased Assets (the
"Appraisal"). The Purchaser and the Company shall jointly participate in the
Appraisal process with both having equal access to the Appraiser. Purchaser
and the Company shall allocate the Purchase Price in amounts equal to the fair
market values of the tangible Purchased Assets set forth in the Appraisal,
consistent with the principles of Section 1060 of the Code (the "Allocation").
After the Closing, the Parties shall make consistent use of the allocation,
fair market value and useful lives specified in the Allocation for all Tax
purposes and in all filings, declarations and reports with the Internal
Revenue Service ("IRS"), or any other Governmental Authority, in respect
thereof, including the reports required to be filed under Section 1060 of the
Code. Within forty-five (45) days after the Closing Date, Purchaser and the
Company shall jointly prepare the IRS Form 8594 to be filed with the IRS. In
any proceeding related to the determination of any Tax, neither Purchaser, the
Company, nor the Principal Shareholders shall contend or represent that such
Allocation is not a correct allocation of the Purchase Price. Purchaser and
the Company agree that the fair market value of the agreements provided for in
Section 7.3(a) shall be $1,000,000 (the "Non-Compete Allocation"), which Non-
Compete Allocation shall be allocated between the agreements of each of the
Company and the Principal Shareholders contained in such Section in a
reasonable manner as determined by the Company and the Principal Shareholders.

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

18  

  

 

 

 

   
 

3.4 Additional Payment.

  

  

(a) The Company shall be eligible to receive an additional payment (the
"EBIDTA Payment") based upon the aggregate EBITDA of the Acquired Business for
the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the four (4) year
anniversary of the Closing Date (the "EBITDA Period"), which amount of EBITDA
shall be calculated by the Company as soon as reasonably practicable after the
expiration of the EBITDA Period and which payment shall be calculated in the
following manner:

  

  

(i) if the aggregate EBITDA of the Acquired Business is equal to or greater
than $62,400,000 but less than $76,400,000 for the EBITDA Period, Purchaser
will make a payment to the Company in the amount of the Threshold EBITDA
Payment; and

  

  

(ii) if the aggregate EBITDA of the Acquired Business is equal to or greater
than $76,400,000 for the EBITDA Period, Purchaser will make a payment to the
Company in the amount of the Maximum EBITDA Payment.

  

  

(b) During the EBITDA Period, Parent and Purchaser shall operate the Acquired
Business in accordance with the following principles, and the March 31, 2013
Financial Statements and the EBITDA Schedule required to be prepared and
calculations required to be made pursuant to this Section 3.4 shall be
prepared and calculated in accordance with the following terms and conditions:

  

  

(i) The separate existence of Purchaser shall be maintained and Purchaser
shall operate the Acquired Business in a commercially reasonable manner
consistent with past practice.

  

  

(ii) The books and records of Purchaser shall be maintained as standalone
businesses (separate from Parent and its Affiliates) and prepared in
accordance with GAAP.

  

  

(iii) For purposes of calculating EBITDA of the Acquired Business and
preparing the EBITDA Schedule, Purchaser shall not allocate or charge to the
Acquired Business (A) corporate overhead, consulting, administrative,
management or advisor fees, charges or expenses, (B) any extraordinary, non-
recurring expenses, (C) fees, charges and expenses related to financing
arrangements, (D) compensation expenses attributable to equity awards granted
to employees of the Acquired Business and other third parties providing
services to the Acquired Business, or (E) any expenses incurred by Parent
and/or its Affiliates (other than Purchaser) in connection with providing
services to the Acquired Business; provided further, that (1) items of income
or expense attributable to the operation of any portion of the Acquired
Business that is acquired by Purchaser after the Closing Date through the
purchase of any business enterprise, division or line of business that would
otherwise be included within the calculation of EBITDA shall be excluded from
the calculations contemplated by this Section 2.6; (2) if after the Closing
Date (y) Purchaser sells, leases, transfers or otherwise disposes of assets
(other than sales of assets in the ordinary course of business), or (z)
Purchaser shuts down or discontinues any current division or line of business,
then in each case Purchaser and the Company shall agree on a fair and
reasonable adjustment to the EBITDA calculation to reflect the impact of such

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

19  

  

 

 

 

   
 

transaction (and if unable to agree thereon shall submit such matter to the
Arbitrating Accountant for resolution, as soon as possible and, if
practicable, prior to the consummation of such transaction) on a basis
consistent with the procedures set forth in this Section 3.4; (3) expenses of
integrating the Acquired Business (including travel-related expenses) shall
not be included as expenses of the Acquired Business; and (4) there shall be
no allocation of expenses to the Acquired Business to the extent that such
expenses constitute Losses for which any Purchaser Indemnified Party receives
indemnification hereunder or reimbursement pursuant to any applicable
insurance policy or by any third party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
charges, expenses, fees and other amounts set forth on Section 3.4(a) of the
Disclosure Schedule may be allocated or charged to the Acquired Business for
such purposes, provided that such charges or allocations are made in good
faith and consistent with Parent's past practices with respect to its other
businesses and Affiliates.

  

  

(iv) Parent and Purchaser shall not cause or permit the sale of any products
or services currently sold or provided by the Acquired Business to be diverted
to, made or provided by, Parent or any of its Affiliates (other than
Purchaser).

  

  

(c) As soon as reasonably practicable after the expiration of the EBITDA
Period, Purchaser shall cause to be prepared and delivered to the Company a
schedule (the "EBITDA Schedule") setting forth the computations of and a copy
of the financial information used in making the computations for EBITDA of the
Acquired Business for the EBITDA Period, including information in sufficient
detail as to reasonably allow the Company to understand such calculations.
Such calculations shall be performed by Purchaser using financial information
prepared and recorded in accordance with GAAP. In connection with its review
of the EBITDA Schedule, Purchaser shall give the Company direct access to the
financial statements, books, records, work-papers, personnel, documents, and
reports created or prepared by Purchaser with respect to the Acquired Business
as requested by the Company for such purpose, provided, that any such access
shall be conducted at reasonable times and in such a manner as to not
interfere with the normal operation of the business of the Purchaser. Upon
receipt of the EBITDA Schedule, the Company shall be entitled to review the
calculations and the financial statements, books, records, work-papers and
other materials requested by the Company, and, within sixty (60) days thereof,
shall advise Purchaser in writing if the Company disagrees with such
calculations (the "Dispute Notice"). If the Company so objects to Purchaser's
computation of such EBITDA, then the Company and Purchaser shall attempt
through negotiation to resolve any such disputed items within thirty (30) days
following receipt of the Dispute Notice. If the Company and Purchaser agree in
writing on the resolution of all such disputed items, such resolution shall be
conclusive and binding on all of the Parties hereto. If the Company and
Purchaser are unable to resolve all disputed items within such thirty (30) day
period, then the Company and Purchaser shall mutually agree on the selection
of an independent certified public accounting firm (the "Arbitrating
Accountant") to determine the amount of any such remaining disputed items as
promptly as possible. If the Company and Purchaser cannot agree on the
selection of the Arbitrating Accountant, then the Company and Purchaser shall
each select an independent certified public accounting firm. Such accounting
firms shall then mutually agree on the selection of an Arbitrating Accountant.
The written resolution of the remaining disputed items by the Arbitrating
Accountant shall be final and binding upon and nonappealable by the Parties
hereto. Judgment may be entered based upon the determination of the
Arbitrating Accountant in any court having jurisdiction over the party against
which such determination is to

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

20  

  

 

 

 

   
 

be enforced. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the
Arbitrating Accountant's engagement pursuant hereto shall be limited solely to
resolving the remaining disputed items initially set forth in the Dispute
Notice and not otherwise previously resolved by the Parties hereto. The scope
of the disputes to be resolved by the Arbitrating Accountant shall be limited
to fixing mathematical errors and determining whether the items in dispute
were determined in accordance with the procedures and standards set forth in
this Section 3.4 and the Arbitrating Accountant is not to make any other
determination. The Arbitrating Accountant's decision shall be based solely on
written submissions by Purchaser and the Company and their respective
representatives and not by independent review. The Arbitrating Accountant may
not assign a value greater than the greatest value for such item claimed by
either party or smaller than the smallest value for such item claimed by
either party. With respect to the resolution of disputes submitted to the
Arbitrating Accountant regarding the computation of EBITDA hereunder, the
fees, costs and expenses of the Arbitrating Accountant shall be borne by (i)
Purchaser if the Arbitrating Accountant determines that EBITDA of the Acquired
Business is in an amount such that an EBITDA payment is payable to the
Company, or (ii) the Company and the Principal Shareholders (jointly and
severally) if the Arbitrating Accountant determines that EBITDA of the
Acquired Business is in an amount such that an EBITDA payment is not payable
to the Company; provided, however, that the fees, costs and expenses of the
Arbitrating Accountant shall be borne by the Company and the Principal
Shareholders (jointly and severally) in the event that Purchaser claims that
it is only obligated to make the Threshold EBITDA Payment and the Company
claims that Purchaser is obligated to make the Maximum EBITDA Payment and the
Arbitrating Accountant determines that EBITDA of the Acquired Business is in
an amount such that Purchaser is only obligated to make the Threshold EBITDA
Payment.

  

  

(d) Purchaser shall make any payment required by Section 3.4(a) promptly
following the final determination of the EBITDA of the Acquired Business for
the EBITDA Period pursuant to Section 3.4(c), such payment to be made through
wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by the
Company for such purpose. Purchaser, the Company, and the Principal
Shareholders agree that a portion of the EBITDA Payment shall be treated as
interest for federal income Tax purposes under applicable Treasury
Regulations. Upon determination of the amount of the EBITDA Payment, the
Company shall prepare a schedule of the portion of the EBITDA Payment that
shall be treated as interest for Purchaser's review and comment.

intention to do any of the foregoing.

  

  

4.21 Insurance Coverage. To the knowledge of Company, the Company has
insurance policies in full force and effect for such amounts as are sufficient
for compliance with all requirements of Law and of all Contracts to which the
Company is a party or by which the Company or the Purchased Assets are bound.
Set forth in Section 4.21 of the Disclosure Schedule is a list of all material
fire, liability, pollution, errors and omissions, directors and officers, and
other insurance and all fidelity bonds and other financial assurance
applicable to or currently held by the Company or the Purchased Assets,
setting forth, in respect of each such policy, the policy name, policy number,
carrier, term, type of coverage and deductibles. To the knowledge of the
Company, no event has occurred, including, without limitation, the failure by
the Company to give any notice or information or the Company giving any
inaccurate or erroneous notice or information, which limits or impairs the
rights of the Company under any such insurance policies.

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

35  

  

 

 

 

   
 

  

4.22 Solvency.

  

  

(a) The Company is not now insolvent and will not be rendered insolvent by any
of the Transactions. As used in this section, "insolvent" means that the sum
of the debts and other probable liabilities of the Company exceeds the present
fair saleable value of the Company's assets.

  

  

(b) Immediately after giving effect to the consummation of the Transactions:
the Company, (i) will be able to pay its liabilities as they become due in the
usual course of its business; (ii) will not have unreasonably small capital
with which to conduct its present or proposed business; (iii) will have assets
(calculated at fair market value) that exceed its liabilities; and (iv) taking
into account all pending and threatened litigation, final judgments against
the Company in actions for money damages are not reasonably anticipated to be
rendered at a time when, or in amounts such that, the Company will be unable
to satisfy any such judgments promptly in accordance with their terms (taking
into account the maximum probable amount of such judgments in any such actions
and the earliest reasonable time at which such judgments might be rendered) as
well as all other obligations of the Company. The cash available to the
Company after taking into account all other anticipated uses of the cash, will
be sufficient to pay all such debts and judgments promptly in accordance with
their terms.

  

  

4.23 Certain Business Practices.

  

  

(a) The Company is, and during all times since its formation has been, in
compliance with (i) the obligations and requirements of the United States

anti-bribery provisions and the accounting and record-keeping requirements set
forth in the FCPA, (ii) the principles set out in the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development Convention Combating Bribery of Foreign
Public Officials in International Business Transactions and (iii) all other
similar or equivalent anti-corruption or anti-bribery laws of any jurisdiction
applicable to the Company (whether by virtue of the Company's jurisdiction of
organization or conduct of its business) (clauses (i), (ii) and (iii)
collectively, "Anti-Corruption Laws").

  

  

(b) Neither the Company nor, to the knowledge of the Company, any director,
officer, partner, shareholder, agent, representative, consultant or other
person acting for or on behalf of the Company has, at any time since its
formation:

  

  

(i) made, directly or indirectly, any payment or promise to pay, or gift or
promise to give or authorized such a promise or gift, of any money or anything
of value, directly or indirectly, (A) to (1) any "foreign official" (as such
term is defined in the FCPA) for the purpose of influencing any official act
or decision of such official or inducing him or her to use his or her
influence to affect any act or decision of a foreign Governmental Authority,
or (2) any foreign political party or official thereof or candidate for
foreign political office for the purpose of influencing any official act or
decision of such party, official or candidate or inducing such party, official
or candidate to use his, her or its influence to affect any act or decision of
a foreign Governmental Authority, in the case of both (1) and (2) above, in
order to assist the Company to obtain or retain business for, or direct
business to, the Company under circumstances which could reasonably be
expected to subject the Company to liability under any Anti-Corruption Law or
(B) that is otherwise illegal or improper under any Anti-Corruption Law; or

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

36  

  

 

 

 

   
 

  

(ii) made any fraudulent entry on the books or records of the Acquired
Company.

arrangement or Contract made by or on behalf of the Company.

  

  

4.25 Disclosure. To the knowledge of the Company, none of the representations
and warranties made by the Company contained in this Agreement, the
Transaction Documents and any other document executed and delivered to
Purchaser in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,

under the circumstances under which they were or are made.

  

  

4.26 No Other Representations. Except as and to the extent expressly set forth
in this Section 4 or Section 5, neither the Company or any Principal
Shareholder makes any representations or warranties whatsoever to Purchaser or
any other Person, and hereby disclaim all liability and responsibility for any

officer, employee, agent, consultant, or representative of the Company or any
Principal Shareholder). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,

NEITHER THE COMPANY NOR ANY PRINCIPAL SHAREHOLDER MAKES ANY REPRESENTATIONS OR
WARRANTIES, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS TO (I) THE CONDITION, REPAIR,

Shareholder is, directly or indirectly, making any representations or
warranties regarding any pro-forma financial information, financial

which such Principal Shareholder is a party or by which such Principal
Shareholder is bound.

  

  

    

SECTION 6.

  |  

Representations and Warranties of Purchaser

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

In order to induce the Company and the Principal Shareholders to enter into
this Agreement, Parent and Purchaser hereby jointly and severally make to the
Company and the Principal Shareholders the representations and warranties
contained in this Section 6:

  

  

6.1 Organization and Corporate Power. Purchaser is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of its state
of formation and has all required power and authority to carry on its business
as presently conducted, to enter into and perform this Agreement and the
Contracts contemplated hereby to which it is a party and to carry out the
Transactions.

  

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

38  

  

 

 

 

  

6.2 Authority and Non-Contravention. Purchaser has full right, authority and
power under its charter and by-laws to enter into this Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents executed by Purchaser, as the case may be, pursuant
hereto and to carry out the Transactions. This Agreement and the Transaction
Documents executed by Purchaser pursuant hereto are valid and binding
obligations of Purchaser enforceable against such Party in accordance with
their respective terms, subject to the effect, if any, of the Bankruptcy and
Equity Exception. The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement
and Transaction Documents executed by Purchaser pursuant hereto have been duly
authorized by all necessary action under Purchaser's charter and by-laws. The
execution, delivery and performance by Purchaser of this Agreement and
Transaction Documents to be executed and delivered by Purchaser pursuant
hereto, and the performance by Purchaser of the Transactions, do not and will
not: (a) violate or result in a violation of, conflict with or constitute or
result in a violation of or default (whether after the giving of notice, lapse
of time or both) or loss of benefit under any provision of Purchaser's
organizational documents; (b) violate, conflict with or result in a violation
of, or constitute a default (whether after the giving of notice, lapse of time
or both) under, any provision of any Law applicable to Purchaser; (c) require
from Purchaser any notice to, declaration or filing with, or consent or
approval of any Governmental Authority or other Person; or (d) violate or
result in a violation of, or conflict with or constitute or result in a
violation of or default (whether after the giving of notice, lapse of time or
both) under, accelerate any obligation under, or give rise to a right of
termination of, any material Contract or Permit to which Purchaser is a party
or by which Purchaser or assets of either are bound.

  

  

6.3 No Brokers. There are no claims for investment banking fees, brokerage
commissions, broker's or finder's fees or similar compensation in connection
with the Transactions payable by Parent or Purchaser, or based on any
arrangement or Contract made by or on behalf of Parent or Purchaser.

  

  

6.4 Sufficient Funds. As of the date of this Agreement, Parent has, and on the
Closing Date, Purchaser will have, available the funds necessary to pay all
amounts payable by Purchaser pursuant to Section 3.1 of this Agreement and all
of its fees and expenses in order to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. Each of Parent and Purchaser confirm that it is not a
condition to Closing or any of its other obligations under this Agreement that
Parent or Purchaser obtain financing for or in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

  

6.5 Litigation. There is no claim, action, suit or legal proceeding pending or
to the knowledge of Parent, threatened against Parent or any material portion
of its properties or assets before any Governmental Authority with respect to
which there is a substantial possibility of a determination which questions
the validity or legality of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby or which seeks to prevent the transactions contemplated hereby or
otherwise would reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to
materially impair the ability of Parent or Purchaser to effect the
transactions contemplated hereby, except, in each case, for those matters
described or contemplated in Section 8.4 below.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

39  

  

 

 

 

  

  

    

SECTION 7.

  |  

Covenants

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

7.1 Confidentiality. The provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement between
the Company and Parent (the "Confidentiality Agreement"), shall terminate upon
the Closing and shall thereafter be of no further force or effect.

  

  

7.2 Efforts and Actions. Each Party hereto shall, from time to time and
without further consideration, either before or after the Closing, execute
such further instruments and take such other actions as any other Party hereto
shall reasonably request in order to fulfill its obligations under any of the
Transaction Documents, to effectuate the purposes of the Transaction Documents
and to provide for the orderly and efficient transition of the Business
following the Closing.

  

  

7.3 Non-Competition; Non-Solicitation, Etc.

  

  

(a) Non-Compete. Ancillary to the consideration reflected within this
Agreement and the other Transaction Documents, each of the Company and the
Principal Shareholders (collectively, the "Restricted Parties") agrees to the
following non-competition provisions. Each Restricted Party agrees that for a
period of five (5) years following the Closing Date:

  

  

(i) Each Restricted Party shall not, directly or indirectly, (A) engage in or
participate (including, without limitation, as an investor, officer, employee,
director, agent, or consultant (any such capacity, being a "Participant")) in
or on behalf of any entity engaging in any line of business competitive with
that of the Company, Purchaser or any of their respective Affiliates on the
Closing Date, or any line of business competitive with any line of business
that the Company, Purchaser or any of their respective Affiliates was
conducting, or any line of business that the Company was contemplating
conducting (as evidenced by existing memoranda, minutes or other
correspondence (including, without limitation, internal or external
presentations)), within the twenty-four (24) months prior to the Closing Date,
or (B) in any capacity for the Restricted Party or others, directly or
indirectly call on, service, or solicit from clients or prospective clients of
the Company or Purchaser in any business competitive with any line of business
that the Company, Purchaser or any of their respective Affiliates was
conducting, or any line of business that the Company was contemplating
conducting (as evidenced by existing memoranda, minutes or other
correspondence (including, without limitation, internal or external
presentations)), within the twenty-four (24) months prior to the Closing Date
(the "Non-Compete Obligations"), provided, however, that nothing herein shall
prevent a Restricted Party from (a) investing as a less than 2.5% shareholder
in securities of any company listed on a national securities exchange or
quoted on an automated quotation system, or (b) investing as less than a 10%
investor in hedge funds or private equity funds or other similar investment
entities or vehicles where the investment is "passive" in nature, and the
Restricted Party does not participate in, or consult with respect to, any
management or investment decisions of such funds or other similar investment
entities or vehicles; provided further, however, that such activities
described in the immediately preceding clauses (a) and (b) do not interfere
with such Restricted Party's availability or ability to perform such
Restricted Party's duties and responsibilities hereunder or under the
applicable employment agreement with the Company and do not breach such
Restricted Party's other obligations hereunder or thereunder.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

40  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(ii) The geographic limitation for the Non-Compete Obligations is any state or
province (or substantially equivalent designation of a geographic area within
a foreign country) (A) in which the Company or Purchaser provided its
products, services, or activities during the twenty-four (24) months prior to
the Closing Date, or (B) in which the Company or Purchaser had plans to
provide or contemplated providing its products, services, or activities during
the twenty-four (24) months prior to the Closing Date.

  

  

(b) Nonsolicitation of Employees. Except as set forth in Section 7.4, each
Restricted Party agrees that for a period of five (5) years following the
Closing Date, each Restricted Party will not, directly or indirectly, (i)
induce or solicit any Transferred Employee (as defined in Section 7.4) to
terminate such individual's employment or service with the Company, Purchaser
or any of their respective Affiliates, (ii) hire or retain the services of any
such Transferred Employee, or (iii) assist any other person or entity in such
activities.

  

  

(c) Nondisparagement. Each Restricted Party will not for a period of five (5)
years following the Closing Date (the "Nondisparagement Period"), directly (or
through any other person or entity) make any public or private statements
(whether orally or in writing) that disparage, denigrate or malign the
Company, Purchaser or any of their respective Affiliates, their respective
businesses, activities, operations, affairs, reputations or prospects or any
of their respective Affiliates, officers, employees, directors, partners,
agents, or shareholders.

  

  

(d) Reformation. If, in any judicial proceeding, the court shall refuse to
enforce any of the separate covenants contained in this Section 7.3 because
the time limit is too long, it is expressly understood and agreed between the
Restricted Parties and Purchaser that for purposes of such proceeding such
time limitation shall be deemed reduced to the extent necessary to permit
enforcement of such covenants. If, in any judicial proceeding, the court shall
refuse to enforce any of the separate covenants contained in this Section 7.3
because they are more extensive (whether as to geographic area, scope of
business or otherwise) than necessary to protect the business and goodwill of
Purchaser and/or any of its Affiliates, it is expressly understood and agreed
between the Restricted Parties and Purchaser that for purposes of such
proceeding the geographic area, scope of business or other aspect shall be
deemed reduced to the extent necessary to permit enforcement of such
covenants.

  

  

(e) Injunctive Relief. Each Restricted Party acknowledges that a breach of
this Section 7.3 would cause irreparable damage to Purchaser and its
Affiliates, and in the event of such Restricted Party's breach of the
provisions of this Section 7.3, Purchaser and its Affiliates shall be entitled
to a temporary restraining order and an injunction restraining such Restricted
Party from breaching such covenants without the necessity of posting bond or
proving irreparable harm, such being conclusively admitted by such Restricted
Party. Nothing shall be construed as prohibiting Purchaser or its Affiliates
from pursuing any other available remedies for such breach, including the
recovery of damages from such Restricted Party. Such Restricted Party
acknowledges that the restrictions set forth in this Section 7.3 are
reasonable in scope and duration, given the nature of the business of
Purchaser and its Affiliates. Such Restricted Party agrees that issuance of an
injunction restraining such Restricted Party from breaching such covenants in
accordance with their terms will not pose an unreasonable restriction on such
Restricted Party's ability to obtain employment or other work following the
effective date of any termination of employment with Purchaser.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

41  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(f) Other Agreements. The provisions of this Section 7.3 shall be independent
of and in addition to any other agreement between any Restricted Party and
Purchaser or its Affiliates regarding the subject matter hereof (including,
without limitation, any noncompetition, nondisclosure or nonsolicitation
provisions set forth in the employment agreements described in Section 9.2).

  

  

7.4 Employment.

  

  

(a) Purchaser agrees to offer to employ substantially all of the employees of
the Company at the Closing, subject to Purchaser's employment procedures and
policies, although Purchaser shall be under no obligation to employ any
specific employees of the Company. To the extent that Purchaser may so
request, the Company and the Principal Shareholders shall cooperate with
Purchaser in hiring those persons who are, or within the last year have been,
employees of the Company. Except as provided below with respect to continued
health benefit coverage, the Company shall be responsible for any obligations
to any employees of the Company who do not become Transferred Employees (each,
a "Terminated Employee") relating to the Terminated Employees' employment by
the Company. The Company shall take no action that would impede Purchaser's
hiring of any employee of the Company. After the date of this Agreement,
neither the Company nor the Principal Shareholders shall, directly or
indirectly, hire, retain, employ or otherwise provide compensation for or to
any previous employee of the Company who becomes an employee of Purchaser.
Nothing contained in this Section 7.4 shall create or be deemed to create any
rights of any employees of the Company or of Purchaser, and Purchaser shall
have no obligation to continue the employment of any employees of the Company
hired by Purchaser (each, a "Transferred Employee") or to maintain the terms
and conditions thereof except as may be set forth in a written agreement;
Purchaser shall provide each Transferred Employee credit for years of service
prior to the Closing with the Company for the purposes of eligibility and
vesting under Purchaser's health and welfare plans, vacation programs and
policies, and retirement, savings and 401(k) plans. Purchaser shall cause any
and all pre-existing condition limitations and eligibility waiting periods
under group health plans of Purchaser to be waived with respect to the
Transferred Employees and their dependents, and shall cause to be credited to
any deductible or out-of-pocket expenses (which are applicable in the plan
year of Purchaser in which the Closing Date falls) under any health plans of
Purchaser any deductibles or out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Transferred
Employee and their beneficiaries and dependents under health plans of the
Company during the plan year of the Company in which the Closing Date falls.
Purchaser shall provide from and after the Closing Date continued health
benefit coverage pursuant to ERISA sections 601 through 608 and section 4980B
of the Code to each employee and former employee of the Company (and each such
person's eligible dependents and former eligible dependents) arising from such
employee's or former employee's (or dependent's or former dependent's) prior
coverage under a group health plan maintained by the Company prior to the
Closing Date.

  

  

(b) The Company shall terminate the employment of, or accept the resignation
of, the Transferred Employees effective upon the Closing Date (or such later
date with respect to an employee on leave of absence). Subject to applicable
Laws, on and after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall have the right to dismiss
any or all Transferred Employees. Except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, the Company is solely responsible for and shall timely pay or
provide to each employee all remuneration, salaries, wages, commissions,
bonuses, severance pay, vacation, sick and other paid leave and any other
compensation or benefits under any Employee Benefit Program arising out of
services performed by such employee through the Closing Date. Purchaser shall
be solely responsible, and shall indemnify the Company and its directors,
officers, employees, Affiliates, agents, and assigns, for any Losses incurred
by the Company to the extent arising out of Purchaser's actions or omissions
on or following the Closing with respect to the Transferred Employees,
including the terms and conditions of employment of the Transferred Employees
with Purchaser, or Purchaser's failure to comply with Section 7. If Purchaser
does not make a sufficient number of employment offers to employees prior to
Closing to avoid a "mass layoff" or "plant closing" (as defined by WARN) based
on employment losses occurring on or after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall
indemnify the Company and its directors, officers, employees, Affiliates,
agents, and assigns, for any Losses incurred by the Company for failing to
provide notice to employees on or before the Closing as required by WARN or
any similar Law requiring notice to employees of layoffs.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

42  

  

 

 

 

  

  

7.5 Change of Names. Within thirty (30) Business Days after the Closing Date,
the Company shall take all actions necessary, including without limitation the
filing with the Secretary of State of the State of Texas an amendment to its
certificate of formation, to effect the change of the Company's name from
Nuclear Logistics Incorporated to a name that does not use the words "Nuclear
Logistics", or any similar words. Within thirty (30) Business Days after the
Closing Date, the Company shall take all actions necessary, including without
limitation making appropriate filings, to effect such name change in each
state where the Company is qualified to conduct business and to cancel any
assumed business name using any such words in all jurisdictions in which an
assumed business name certificate has been filed. At Purchaser's request, the
Company shall execute a written consent or other documentation allowing for
the use of the name "Nuclear Logistics" by Purchaser and its Affiliates. From
and after the date of this Agreement, the Company and the Principal
Shareholders shall otherwise cease to use the name "Nuclear Logistics" and any
derivatives of that name.

  

  

7.6 Receivables Guaranty. At the Closing, the Company and the Principal
Shareholders shall execute and deliver to Purchaser a Guaranty in the form
attached as Exhibit D hereto (the "Receivables Guaranty"), under the terms of
which the Company and the Principal Shareholders shall, jointly and severally,
unconditionally guarantee that all indebtedness represented by the Accounts
Receivable will be paid by the respective debtors to Purchaser. In the event
all such net indebtedness is paid after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall
promptly notify the Company of such payment (but no later than ten (10)
Business Days after such payment), and in such event the Company shall be
entitled to receive from the Escrow Account an amount equal to the Receivables
Escrow Amount, and Purchaser and the Company shall promptly execute and
deliver a joint instruction letter to the Escrow Agent to such effect. In the
event such net indebtedness is not paid within 180 days after the Closing
Date, Purchaser shall promptly notify the Company of such non-payment (the
"Guaranty Notice"), in which event (a) Purchaser shall be entitled to receive
from the Escrow Account a portion of the Escrow Amount equal to the difference
between such net indebtedness and the amount collected in respect of such
Accounts Receivable (the "AR Shortfall Amount"), (b) the Company shall be
entitled to receive from the Escrow Account an amount equal to the amount, if
any, by which the Receivables Escrow Amount exceeds the AR Shortfall Amount,
and (c) Purchaser and the Company shall promptly execute and deliver a joint
instruction letter to the Escrow Agent to such effect, whereupon Purchaser
shall promptly assign or cause to be assigned to the Company or the Principal
Shareholders all rights, claims, actions or causes of action which Purchaser
may have relating to such unpaid indebtedness. In the event that the Guaranty
Notice is not sent to the Company within 210 days following the Closing Date,
Purchaser shall be deemed to have

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

43  

  

 

 

 

  

  

collected all indebtedness represented by the Accounts Receivable and the
Company and the Principal Shareholders shall be released from any obligation
with respect to the Receivables Guaranty, and in such event the Company shall
be entitled to receive from the Escrow Account an amount equal to the
Receivables Escrow Amount, and Purchaser and the Company shall promptly
execute and deliver a joint instruction letter to the Escrow Agent to such
effect. For the avoidance of doubt, Purchaser shall not be obligated to
commence a suit to enforce payment of any accounts or notes receivable or
undertake any extraordinary collection efforts.

  

  

7.7 GAAP Audit. The Company shall (i) give Purchaser and BDO reasonable access
to all employees, personnel, agents, Affiliates, Purchased Assets, facilities,
books and records, operating instructions and procedures, Tax Returns, and all
other information of the Company and (ii) cause the officers of the Company to
furnish Purchaser and BDO with such financial and operating data and other
information with respect to the business and properties of the Company as
Purchaser and BDO may from time to time reasonably request, in each case so as
to allow BDO to audit the books and records of the Company for the purpose of
preparing financial statements of the Company, as of the Closing Date, that
are in accordance with GAAP. The cost of such audit and the preparation of the
such financial statements (including, without limitation, the fees of BDO)
shall be the sole responsibility of Purchaser.

  

  

7.8 Transfer Fees. No sales, use, transfer, registration, or similar Taxes and
fees (including interest and penalties thereon) ("Transfer Fees") which result
from the transfer of the Purchased Assets or Assumed Liabilities pursuant to
this Agreement, shall be collected by the Company at the Closing. If any such
Transfer Fees are determined to be owed with respect to the transfer of the
Purchased Assets or Assumed Liabilities pursuant to this Agreement, the
Company, with the cooperation of Purchaser, shall prepare and file any related
Tax Returns required to be filed in connection with the payment of such
Transfer Fees on a timely basis. The Company and Purchaser each agree to be
responsible for one-half of all Transfer Fees due by virtue of this
transaction on the Purchased Assets transferred pursuant hereto (regardless of
the Person liable for such Transfer Fees under applicable Law) and shall remit
such Transfer Fees at that time. The Company and Purchaser agree to cooperate
with each other in demonstrating that the requirements for any exemption from
such Transfer Fees have been met.

  

  

7.9 Cooperation on Tax Matters; Business Records.

  

  

(a) Purchaser, the Company and the Principal Shareholders agree to furnish or
cause to be furnished to each other, as promptly as practicable and at the
requesting party\'s reasonable expense, such information and assistance
relating to the Company as is reasonably necessary for the preparation and
filing of any return, claim for refund or other required or optional filings
relating to Tax matters, for the preparation for and proof of facts during any
tax audit, for the preparation for any Tax protest, for the prosecution or
defense of any suit or other proceeding relating to Tax matters and for the
answer to any governmental or regulatory inquiry relating to Tax matters.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

44  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) The Company agrees to retain possession of all accounting, business,
financial and Tax records and information (i) relating to the Purchased Assets
and the Company's Business in existence on the Closing Date transferred to
Purchaser hereunder and (ii) coming into existence after the Closing Date
which relate to the Purchased Assets and the Company's Business prior to or on
the Closing Date, for the period not to exceed the applicable statute of
limitations for such Taxes. In addition, from and after the Closing Date,
Purchaser agrees that it will not unreasonably withhold access by the Company
and its attorneys, accountants and other Representatives (after reasonable
notice and during normal business hours and with reasonable charge), to such
personnel, books, records, documents and any or all other information relating
to the Purchased Assets as the Company or the Principal Shareholders may
reasonably deem necessary to properly prepare for, file, prove, answer,
prosecute and/or defend any such Tax Return, filing, audit, protest, claim,
suit, inquiry or other proceeding. Such access shall include without
limitation access to any computerized information retrieval systems relating
to the Company's Business.

  

  

7.10 Proration of Property Taxes. The Company shall be liable for and shall
pay when due all ad valorem, personal property, and similar Taxes attributable
to the ownership or the operation of the Purchased Assets, and shall timely
file any related Tax Returns, for the Taxable periods ending on or before the
Closing Date. Purchaser shall be liable for and shall pay when due all ad
valorem, personal property and similar Taxes attributable to the ownership or
the operation of the Purchased Assets, and shall timely file any related Tax
Returns, for the Taxable periods ending after the Closing Date; provided,
however, that the Company shall be liable for and shall pay all Taxes due with
respect to such Tax Returns relating to the pre-Closing Date portion of any
Taxable period that includes but ends after the Closing Date without
duplication of any amounts taken into account under Section 3.2. Such Tax
liabilities shall be calculated based on the number of days in the Taxable
period ending on or before the Closing Date and the number of days in the
Taxable period after the Closing Date (as the case may be) as compared to the
total number of days in the entire Taxable period. Whichever party is
responsible for the filing of any such Tax Return hereunder shall bear all
costs associated with the filing of such Tax Return. Such party shall further
have all available rights to contest the Tax (and the other party shall
provide reasonable cooperation and assistance at the sole expense and cost of
the requesting party); provided, however, that in the case of any Tax Return
relating to a Taxable period that includes but does not end on the Closing
Date, Purchaser shall provide the Company with a copy of such Tax Return
within twenty (20) days prior to the date Purchaser intends to file such Tax
Return. Purchaser shall revise such Tax Return to reflect the Company's
reasonable comments, if any, provided that the Company provides such changes
in writing to Purchaser within ten (10) days of the receipt of such Tax
Return.

  

  

7.11 Warranty Claims. In the event that any customer or former customer of the
Company makes any request, claim or demand for the Company or Purchaser to
repair, service or replace any products pursuant to a warranty or service
agreement granted or entered into in the ordinary course of business in
connection with the sale of such products prior to the Closing Date, upon the
reasonable request of the Company, Purchaser shall repair, service or replace
such product and the Company and the Principal Shareholders (jointly and
severally) shall reimburse Purchaser for the direct out of pocket cost of such
repair, service or replacement. Purchaser shall provide the Company with
written notice of any such costs, which notice shall set forth a reasonable
description of Purchaser's calculation thereof. Purchaser shall be entitled to
receive such reimbursement(s) either through a cash payment from the Company
and the Principal Shareholders (jointly and severally) equal to the amount of
such costs set forth on any such notice (each such amount, a "Warranty
Reimbursement Payment") or, at Purchaser's election, to receive from the
Escrow Account a portion of the Escrow Amount equal to the Warranty
Reimbursement Payment, and Purchaser and the Company shall promptly execute
and deliver a joint instruction letter to the Escrow Agent to such effect.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, and without limiting the generality of Section
2.6, Purchaser shall have no, and hereby disclaims any, obligation to pay any
full or partial refund or to make any other payment to any customer or former
customer of the Company that makes any request, claim or demand for such
refund or payment pursuant to any warranty or service agreement granted or
entered into by the Company.

and its Representatives reasonable access to all employees, personnel, agents,
Affiliates, Purchased Assets, facilities, books and records, operating
instructions and procedures, Tax Returns, and all other information of the

examination and investigation of each of the Business and the Company as
Purchaser may desire to make, including without limitation an environmental
evaluation of the Company, (ii) permit Purchaser and its Representatives to
make such copies and inspections thereof as may reasonably be requested, and
(iii) cause the officers of the Company to furnish Purchaser and its

to not interfere with the normal operation of the business of the Company.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Purchaser shall be entitled
to conduct or cause to be conducted (at its expense and upon reasonable
notice) such non-invasive assessments, audits and tests and such
environmental, structural and other physical inspections as Purchaser shall
deem necessary or useful in connection with the Transactions; provided,
however, that Purchaser shall provide the Company's Representatives upon
request with copies of any reports generated from data collected as part of
any environmental assessments, including any Phase I Environmental Site

8.3 Consents of Third Parties; Governmental Approvals.

  

  

(a) The Company and Purchaser will act diligently and reasonably in attempting
to secure, before the Closing Date, the consent, approval or waiver, in form
and substance reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser, required to be obtained
from any Person (other than a Governmental Authority) that is listed on
Section 8.3(a) of the Disclosure Schedule. The Company shall be solely
responsible for any change in control, transfer or similar payments required
to obtain any such consent, approval or waiver (the "Transfer Payments").

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

47  

  

 

 

 

  

(b) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
each of the Parties agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist
and cooperate with the other Party in doing all things necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the
Transactions, including but not limited to: (i) obtaining all necessary
actions or non-actions, waivers, consents and approvals from all Governmental
Authorities and making all necessary registrations and filings (including
filings with Governmental Authorities) and taking all steps as may be
necessary to obtain an approval or waiver from, or to avoid an action or
proceeding by, any Governmental Authorities (including those in connection
with the HSR Act), (ii) defending any lawsuits or other legal proceedings,
whether judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or the
consummation of the Transactions, including seeking to have any stay or
temporary restraining order entered into by any court or other Governmental
Authorities vacated or reversed, (iii) keeping the other Party informed in all
material respects of any material communication received by such Party from,
or given by such Party to, any Governmental Authorities and of any material
communication received or given in connection with any proceeding by a private
party relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, in each
case regarding any of the Transactions, and (iv) permitting the other Party to
review any material communication delivered to, and consulting with the other
Party in advance of any meeting or conference with, any Governmental
Authorities relating to the Transactions or in connection with any proceeding
by a private party, and giving the other Party the opportunity to attend and
participate in such meetings and conferences (to the extent permitted by such
Governmental Authorities or private party). No Party to this Agreement shall
consent to any voluntary delay of the consummation of the Transactions at the
behest of any Governmental Authority without the consent of the other Party to
this Agreement, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. The Parties
agree that, except as mutually agreed, none of them shall contact any supplier
or customer of the Company prior to the Closing for the purpose of notifying
such Person of the Transactions or obtaining such Person's consent thereto.

  

  

(c) This Agreement shall not constitute an agreement to assign any interest in
any Assigned Contract if an assignment without the consent of a third party,
or without novation of the same, would constitute a breach or violation
thereof or affect in a material adverse way the rights of the Company or
Purchaser thereunder. If novation is required in order to transfer and assign
any such Contract to Purchaser, or if the consent of a third party is required
in order to assign any such interest and such consent is not obtained prior to
the Closing Date, or if an attempted assignment would be ineffective or would
adversely affect the Company's ability to convey the benefit of such Contract
to Purchaser, (i) Purchaser shall be entitled to the benefits of each such
Contract accruing after the Closing Date, (ii) Purchaser shall assume as
Assumed Liabilities all obligations and liabilities relating to or arising out
of or incurred in connection with such Contracts from and after the Closing
Date, and (iii) without any expense or liability to the Company, the Company
will assist Purchaser in obtaining all such consents and cooperate with
Purchaser until such consent or novation is obtained or effected in any lawful
and economically feasible arrangement, including by subcontract, agency or
other arrangement, so that Purchaser will supply the goods and services that
are necessary for the Company to perform its obligations under such Contracts,
and for Purchaser to receive the Company's interest in the benefits under any
such Contract accruing after the Closing Date.

  

  

8.4 Antitrust Law Compliance. As promptly as reasonably practicable after the
date hereof, Purchaser and the Company shall file with the Federal Trade
Commission and the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice the
notifications and other information required to be filed under the HSR Act, or
any rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, with respect to the
Transactions. If one or more filings are required under the HSR Act, each of
Purchaser and the Company agrees to request early termination of the waiting
period under the HSR Act. Each of Purchaser and the Company represents and
warrants that all such filings by it will be, as of the date filed, true and
accurate in all material respects and in material compliance with the
requirements of the HSR Act and any such rules and regulations. Each of
Purchaser and the Company agrees to make available to the other such
information as each of them may reasonably request relative to its business,
assets and property as may be required of each of them to file any additional
information requested by such agencies under the HSR Act and any such rules
and regulations. For the avoidance of doubt, and notwithstanding anything to
the contrary herein, in no event shall Purchaser or its Affiliates (including,
without limitation, Parent or Arbor-Crowley, Inc.) be required to effect the
sale or other disposition of any of their respective properties (including the
stock of any Subsidiary) or any properties of their respective subsidiaries in
order to obtain such clearance.

Principal Shareholders will, directly or indirectly, through any Affiliate or
Representative or otherwise, continue, solicit, entertain, initiate or
participate in or encourage discussions or negotiations with, or the

whether directly or indirectly, an acquisition or a financing of any of the
Company, or any acquisition of any capital stock, equity interest or other
pecuniary or other interest of any of the Company or any assets, by any means
whatsoever, or enter into any Contract, arrangement or understanding regarding
any of the foregoing, and the Company or any Principal Shareholder, as
applicable, shall notify Purchaser immediately if any such bids, offers or
proposals are received, or any such negotiations or discussions are sought
and, if represented, the material terms thereof. In addition, during the
Interim Period, except as required by applicable Law, none of the Company or
the Principal Shareholders will, directly or indirectly, through any Affiliate
or Representative or otherwise disclose any information not customarily
disclosed to any Person (other than Purchaser) concerning any of the Company
or afford to any such other Person access to the Company's employees,
personnel, agents, Affiliates, assets, facilities, books and records,
operating instructions and procedures, Tax Returns without the consent of
Purchaser.

respect at or prior to the Closing Date, and (ii) any failure of such Party to
comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied
with or satisfied by it hereunder; provided, however, that the delivery of any
notice pursuant to this Section 8.6 or a Party's knowledge of the facts or
events described in clauses (i) or (ii) above with respect to another Party
shall not serve to cure such breach or non-compliance or limit or otherwise
affect the remedies available hereunder to the Party receiving such notice or
with such knowledge.

notice to the other Parties hereto of the occurrence or the non-occurrence

shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause such condition to be
satisfied.

  

  

(c) Each of the Company and the Principal Shareholders shall give notice the
Purchaser of the occurrence of any event that results, or could reasonably be

8.7 Publicity . Each of the Parties agrees that no public release or
announcement concerning the Transactions shall be issued by or on behalf of
any Party without the prior written consent of the Company and Purchaser
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed),
except as such release or announcement may be required by applicable Law or
the rules or regulations of any applicable Governmental Authority or
securities exchange to which the relevant Party is subject, in which case the
Party required to make the release or announcement shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to allow each other Party reasonable time to comment on
such release or announcement in advance of such issuance, it being understood
that the final form and content of any such release or announcement, to the
extent required, shall be at the final discretion of the disclosing Party.

content of such press releases shall be at the final discretion of Purchaser,
provided that Purchaser shall provide the Company with a copy of such press
releases at least three (3) Business Day prior to the date on which Purchaser
issues such press releases.

10.4 Procedure.

  

  

(a) Third Party Claims. All claims for indemnification relating to third party
claims (other than claims with respect to Taxes) shall be asserted and
resolved as set forth in this Section 10.4. In the event that any written
claim or demand for which an Indemnifying Party would be liable is asserted
against or sought to be collected from any Indemnified Party by a third party,
such Indemnified Party shall promptly, but in no event more than 30 days
following such Indemnified Party's receipt of such claim or demand, notify the
Indemnifying Party of such claim or demand and the amount or the estimated

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

54  

  

 

 

 

  

  

amount thereof to the extent then feasible (which estimate shall not be
conclusive of the final amount of such claim and demand) (the "Claim Notice").
The Indemnified Party shall not be foreclosed by any failure to provide timely
notice of the existence of a third party claim or demand to the Indemnifying
Party except to the extent (and only to the extent) such failure causes the
Losses for which the Indemnifying Party is otherwise obligated to indemnify to
be materially greater than such Losses would have been had the Indemnified
Party so promptly notified the Indemnifying Party hereunder. The Indemnifying
Party shall have 30 days from the delivery or receipt of the Claim Notice (the
"Notice Period") to notify the Indemnified Party (a) whether or not the
Indemnifying Party disputes the liability of the Indemnifying Party to the
Indemnified Party hereunder with respect to such claim or demand and (b)
whether or not it desires to defend the Indemnified Party against such claim
or demand. All costs and expenses incurred by the Indemnifying Party in
defending such claim or demand shall be a liability of, and shall be paid by,
the Indemnifying Party. In the event that the Indemnifying Party notifies the
Indemnified Party within the Notice Period that it desires to defend the
Indemnified Party against such claim or demand and except as hereinafter
provided, the Indemnifying Party shall have the (i) right to defend the
Indemnified Party by appropriate proceedings and (ii) to use or retain counsel
in connection with such defense that is reasonably acceptable to the
Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party shall make available to the
Indemnifying Party all information reasonably available to such Indemnified
Party relating to such claim or demand. In addition, the Indemnified Party and
the Indemnifying Party shall render to each other such assistance as may
reasonably be requested in order to ensure the proper and adequate defense of
any such claim or demand. The Party in charge of the defense shall keep the
other Party fully apprised at all times as to the status of the defense or any
settlement negotiations with respect thereto. If any Indemnified Party desires
to participate in, but not control, any such defense or settlement it may do
so at its sole cost and expense. In the event that the Indemnifying Party does
not elect to defend the claim, the Indemnified Party shall not settle a claim
or demand without the consent of the Indemnifying Party. The Indemnifying
Party shall not, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party,
settle, compromise or offer to settle or compromise any such claim or demand
(i) on a basis which would result in the imposition of a consent order,
injunction or decree which would restrict the future activity or conduct of
the Indemnified Party without the written consent of the Indemnified Party and
(ii) without obtaining a (a) release with respect to such claim or demand and
(b) the dismissal with prejudice of any litigation or other proceeding with
respect to such claim or demand, in each case for the benefit of and in form
and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party. If the
Indemnifying Party elects not to defend the Indemnified Party against such
claim or demand, whether by not giving the Indemnified Party timely notice as
provided above or otherwise, then the amount of any such claim or demand, or,
if the same be contested by the Indemnified Party, then that portion thereof
as to which such defense is unsuccessful (and the reasonable costs and
expenses pertaining to such defense) shall be the liability of the
Indemnifying Party hereunder to the extent any Losses are sustained which are
otherwise the subject of indemnification under this Section 10. To the extent
the Indemnifying Party shall control or participate in the defense or
settlement of any third party claim or demand, the Indemnified Party will give
to the Indemnifying Party and its counsel access to, during normal business
hours, the relevant business records and other documents, and shall permit
them to consult with the employees and counsel of the Indemnified Party. The
Indemnified Party shall use its commercially reasonable efforts in the defense
of all such claims.

  

  

(b) Payment. If the Indemnifying Party concedes liability in whole or in part,
it shall, within thirty (30) days of such concession, pay (in accordance with
this Agreement) the amount of the claim to the Indemnified Party to the extent
of the liability conceded. Any such payment with respect to the Company
Indemnifying Parties shall be made in cash in immediately available funds (or
paid from the Escrow Amount (to the extent available) and in accordance with
the Escrow Agreement). Any such payment with respect to the Purchaser
Indemnifying Parties shall be made in cash, in immediately available funds
equal to the amount of such claim so payable. If the Indemnifying Party does
not respond or denies liability in whole or in part or advises that the
matters set forth in the notice are, or will be, subject to contest or legal
proceedings not yet finally resolved, then the Indemnifying Party shall make
no payment (except for the amount of any conceded liability payable as set
forth above) until the matter is resolved in accordance with this Agreement.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

55  

  

 

 

 

  

10.5 Limitations on Indemnification.

  

  

(a) Subject to Section 10.5(c), none of the Company Indemnifying Parties shall
be liable for Losses in respect of Claims made by any Purchaser Indemnified
Party for indemnification under Section 10.2(a) unless and to the extent the
total of all Losses in respect of claims made by the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties for indemnification shall exceed $400,000 in the aggregate (the
"Indemnity Threshold"), at which point the Company Indemnifying Parties shall
be obligated to indemnify all claims by all Purchaser Indemnified Parties for
all Losses (including those Losses that constitute such Indemnity Threshold),
but subject to the other limitations established by this Section 10.5.

  

  

(b) Subject to Section 10.5(c), the maximum aggregate amount for which the
Company Indemnifying Parties shall be liable to all Purchaser Indemnified
Parties taken together for Losses under Section 10.2(a) shall not exceed
$12,000,000.

  

  

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the limitations contained in Sections
10.5(a) and 10.5(b) shall not apply to any Losses incurred by any Purchaser
Indemnified Party with respect to

  

  

(i) fraud on the part of the Company or any of the Principal Shareholders;

  

  

(ii) any of the matters described in Sections 10.2(b), (c), (d) or (e); and

  

  

(iv) any breach of the Fundamental Representations or the representations and
warranties contained in Sections 4.11 and 4.23

  

  

and the Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to indemnification
under Section 10.2 hereof for all such Losses without limitation as to the
amount of such Losses.

  

  

(d) Under no circumstances shall any Indemnified Party be entitled to be
indemnified for special, consequential, indirect, multiple, punitive or other
similar damages, including lost profits, lost revenues, business
interruptions, or loss of business opportunity or reputation, except, in each
case, to the extent such damages are actually paid by an Indemnified Party to
a third party. The party seeking indemnification under Section 10 shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate any Loss which forms the basis
of an indemnification claim hereunder.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

56  

  

 

 

 

  

(e) No Indemnifying Party shall be obligated to indemnify any other Person
with respect to (i) any representation, warranty, covenant or condition
specifically waived in writing by the other party on or prior to the Closing,
(ii) any Losses included in the calculation of the adjustment or payment
pursuant to Sections 3.2 or 7.6 (to the extent so included), or (iii) for any
Losses for a claims notice was not duly delivered prior to the end of the
applicable survival period for the underlying claim.

  

  

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, except in the case of
fraud or in connection with a dispute under Section 3.2 or 3.4 (which dispute
shall be governed exclusively by Section 3.2 or 3.4, as applicable), the
indemnification provisions of Section 10 shall be the sole and exclusive
remedy of the Parties following the Closing for any and all breaches or
alleged breaches of any representations, warranties, covenants or agreements
of the Parties, or any other provision of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby.

  

  

(g) The amount of any Loss for which indemnification is provided under this
Section 10 shall be net of any amounts actually recovered by any Indemnified
Party under insurance policies with respect to such Loss (and with respect to
the Acquired Business, net of amounts accrued on the Final Financial
Statements with respect to such Loss).

  

  

10.6 Treatment of Indemnification Payments. Purchaser, the Company and the
Principal Shareholders agree to treat any indemnification payments received
pursuant to this Agreement for all Tax purposes as an adjustment to the
Purchase Price.

  

  

    

SECTION 11.

  |  

Termination of Agreement

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

11.1 Termination. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, this Agreement may be terminated or the Transactions may be
abandoned at any time prior to the Closing:

  

  

(a) by the mutual written consent of the Company and Purchaser;

  

  

(b) by either Purchaser or the Company hereto if any Governmental Authority
shall have issued an Order or taken any other action which permanently
restrains, enjoins or otherwise prohibits the Transactions and such Order
shall have become final and non-appealable;

  

  

(c) by Purchaser if there has been a misrepresentation or other breach by the
Company or any Principal Shareholder in its representations, warranties and
covenants set forth herein (without giving effect to any materiality
limitation or qualification, except for changes therein specifically resulting
from any transaction expressly consented to in writing by Purchaser) which,
individually or in the aggregate, have had, or could reasonably be expected to
have, a Material Adverse Effect; provided, however, that if such breach is
susceptible to cure, the Company or the Principal Shareholders, as the case
may be, shall have 15 Business Days after receipt of notice from the other
Parties of their intention to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 11.1(c) if such breach continues in which to cure such breach before
the other Parties may so terminate this Agreement; and provided, further, that
the Company and the Principal Shareholders shall collectively be offered the
right to cure only one such breach susceptible to cure;

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

57  

  

 

 

 

  

(d) by Purchaser if any event occurs that results, or could reasonably be
expected to result, in a Material Adverse Effect;

  

  

(e) by the Company if there has been a material misrepresentation or other
material breach by Purchaser in its representations, warranties and covenants
set forth herein; provided, however, that if such breach is susceptible to
cure, Purchaser, as the case may be, shall have 15 Business Days after receipt
of notice from the Company of its intention to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 11.1(d) if such breach continues in which to cure
such breach before the other Parties may so terminate this Agreement; and
provided, further, that Purchaser shall collectively be offered the right to
cure only one such breach susceptible to cure; or

  

  

(f) by either Purchaser or the Company if the Closing shall not have occurred
on or prior to July 30, 2012; provided, that no Party may terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 11.1(e) if such Party's failure to fulfill
any of its obligations under this Agreement shall have caused the Closing not
to have occurred on or before said date.

  

  

11.2 Effect of Termination

  

  

. In the event of the termination of this Agreement by any Party hereto
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, written notice thereof shall
forthwith be given to the other Party or Parties specifying the provision
hereof pursuant to which such termination of this Agreement is made, and this
Agreement shall become void and of no further force and effect, except for the
provisions of (a) Section 7.1 relating to certain confidentiality obligations,
(b) Section 8.8 relating to publicity, (d) this Section 11 and (e) Section 12.
Nothing in this Section 11 shall be deemed to release any Party from any
liability for any breach by such Party of the terms and provisions of this
Agreement or to impair the right of any Party to compel specific performance
by any other Party of their respective obligations under this Agreement. If
this Agreement is terminated as permitted by this Section 11, such termination
shall be without liability of any Party (or any of its Affiliates,
Representatives or Representatives of its Affiliates) to any other Party to
this Agreement; provided, however, that if either Party has breached any
representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained in this
Agreement, then in each such case nothing herein shall affect the non-
breaching Party's right to indemnification with respect to Losses and other
amounts on account of such other Party's breach. In such instance, each Party
hereto shall return all documents and other materials received from the other
Parties hereto relating to this Agreement and the Transactions, and all
confidential information received by each Party hereto with respect to any
other Party hereto shall be treated in accordance with the terms of Section
8.2 and the Confidentiality Agreement.

12.6 Consent to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial. Except as provided in this
Section 12.6, each of the Parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally
consents to the sole and exclusive jurisdiction of state courts of Texas and

validity, termination or performance hereof and thereof or the Transactions.
Each Party further irrevocably waives any objection to proceeding before the
state courts of Texas or United States District Court for the Northern
District of Texas (Fort Worth Division) based upon lack of personal
jurisdiction or to the laying of venue and further irrevocably and
unconditionally waives and agrees not to make a claim in before any
Governmental Authority that proceeding before the state courts of Texas or the
United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas (Fort Worth
Division) has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Each of the Parties
hereto hereby consents to service of process by registered mail at the address
to which notices are to be given. Each of the Parties hereto agrees that its
or his submission to jurisdiction and its or his consent to service of process
by mail is made for the express benefit of the other Parties hereto.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

60  

  

 

 

 

  

  

EACH PARTY HEREBY WAIVES TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW,
ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT TO ANY ACTION DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, ANY
TRANSACTION DOCUMENT OR ANY TRANSACTION. EACH PARTY (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT
AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT
AND THE TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS, AS APPLICABLE, BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE
MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 12.6.

  

  

12.7 Severability. Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement shall
be interpreted in such a manner as to be effective and valid under applicable
Law, but if any provision of this Agreement shall be deemed prohibited or
invalid under such applicable Law, such provision shall be ineffective to the
extent of such prohibition or invalidity, and such prohibition or invalidity
shall not invalidate the remainder of such provision or the other provisions
of this Agreement.

  

  

12.8 Integration. This Agreement, including the exhibits, documents and
instruments referred to herein, the Confidentiality Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents constitute the entire agreement, and supersede all other
prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the Parties
with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof, including, without
limitation, the letter agreement, dated March 8, 2012, by and between the
Company and Parent, which shall be completely superseded by the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of the Company contained
herein.

  

  

12.9 Assignability; Binding Agreement. This Agreement will be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the Parties hereto and their respective successors and
permitted assigns, but will not be assignable or delegable by any Party hereto
without the prior written consent of the other Parties hereto; provided,
however, that (a) the Company may assign, distribute or otherwise transfer all
or any portion of its rights under Section 3.4 hereof to any Shareholder or
any Affiliate of any Shareholder without the prior written consent of the
other Parties hereto, and (b) Purchaser may assign any of its rights and/or
delegate any of its obligations under this Agreement without the prior written
consent of the other Parties hereto to (i) any Subsidiary or Affiliate or (ii)
any post-closing purchaser of all or a substantial portion of Purchaser's, and
its Subsidiaries assets, whether structured as a stock or asset sale, merger,
consolidation, spin-off, recapitalization or other transaction; provided,
further, that, in connection with any such delegation of obligations Purchaser
shall not be relieved of its obligations hereunder and under the other
Transaction Documents, as applicable.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

61  

  

 

 

 

  

  

12.10 Expenses. Each of the Parties hereby agrees that each of the Company,
Purchaser and each Principal Shareholder shall be solely responsible for all
of its respective accounting, legal, and broker fees and out-of-pocket
expenses incurred in connection with the Transactions (the "Transaction
Fees").

  

  

12.11 Specific Performance. Each Party hereto acknowledge that, in view of the
uniqueness of the business of the Company, the Purchased Assets and the
Transactions, each Party would not have an adequate remedy at law for money
damages in the event that this Agreement has not been performed in accordance
with its terms, and therefore agrees that each other Party shall be entitled
to specific enforcement of the terms hereof in addition to any other remedy to
which it may be entitled, at law or in equity.

  

  

12.12 Third Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement will be binding upon and inure
solely to the benefit of each Party hereto, and, except as set forth in
Section 10 hereof, nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended
to or will confer upon any other Person any right, benefit or remedy of any
nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, each Purchaser Indemnified Party hereunder shall be entitled to all
rights, benefits or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of
this Agreement.

  

  

12.13 Sole and Exclusive Remedies. The Parties agree that, in relation to any
breach, default, or nonperformance of any representation, warranty, covenant,
or agreement made or entered into by any other party hereto pursuant to this
Agreement or any certificate, instrument, or document delivered pursuant
hereto, the only relief and remedy available to such party hereto in respect
of said breach, default, or nonperformance shall be: termination, but only if
said termination is expressly permitted under the provisions of Section 11; or

  

  

(a) indemnification for Losses, but only to the extent properly claimable
under and as limited by Section 10; or

  

  

(b) specific performance if a court of competent jurisdiction in its
discretion grants the same; or

  

  

(c) injunctive or declaratory relief if a court of competent jurisdiction in
its discretion grants the same.

  

  

Except for each Party's relief, rights or remedies available under the other
Transaction Documents, each Party waives and releases any relief, rights or
remedies not listed above that may be available to such Party in respect of
any breach, default, or nonperformance of any representation, warranty,
covenant, or agreement made by any Party hereto pursuant to this Agreement. In
addition, each Party agrees that no action for termination or rescission, or
claiming repudiation, of this Agreement may be brought or maintained by any
Party against any other Party following the Closing Date, except, in each
case, in the event of fraud. Accordingly, the Parties hereby expressly waive
and forego any and all rights they may possess to bring any such action
(except in the event of fraud).

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

62  

  

 

 

 

  

  

12.14 Guaranty.

  

  

(b) Parent hereby unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees to the Company
and the Principal Shareholders, as primary obligor and not merely as surety,
the performance of, and compliance with, all agreements, obligations,
covenants, warranties, representations, and undertakings of Purchaser
contained in this Agreement (the "Parent Guaranty"). Parent hereby waives
promptness, diligence, demand, protest and notice as to the obligations and
covenants guaranteed hereby and acceptance of this Parent Guaranty, the right
to require the Company or the Principal Shareholders to exhaust remedies
against any other person and waives any other circumstance which might
otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, Parent as a
guarantor. Parent hereby waives all claims of waiver, release, surrender,
abstraction or compromise and all set-offs, counterclaims, cross-claims,
recoupments or other defenses that it may have against the Company with
respect to this Parent Guaranty, provided that Parent is not hereby waiving
any set-offs, counterclaims, cross-claims, recoupments or other defenses that
Purchaser may have against the Company or the Principal Shareholders. Parent
agrees to pay the costs and expenses in connection with the successful
enforcement of this Parent Guaranty.

  

  

(c) The obligations of Parent will not be discharged by: (i) any modification
of, or amendment or supplement to, this Agreement; (ii) any furnishing or
acceptance of security or any exchange or release of any security; (iii) any
waiver, consent or other action or inaction or any exercise or non-exercise of
any right, remedy or power with respect to Purchaser or any change in the
structure of Purchaser; (iv) any insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization,
arrangement, composition, liquidation, dissolution, or similar proceedings
with respect to Purchaser; or (v) any other occurrence whatsoever, except
performance in full of all obligations of Purchaser in accordance with the
terms and conditions of this Agreement.

  

  

(d) This Parent Guaranty shall: (i) be binding upon Parent, its successors and
assigns; (ii) inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the Company, the
Principal Shareholders, and their respective successors and assigns; and (iii)
remain in full force and effect until the performance in full of all
obligations of Purchaser and Parent in accordance with the terms and
provisions of this Agreement at which time the Parent Guaranty shall
automatically terminate.
