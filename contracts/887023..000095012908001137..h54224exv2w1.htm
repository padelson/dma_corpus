Agreement and Plan of Merger (this " _Agreement_ "), dated as of February 20,
2008, among Pfizer Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _Parent_ "), Explorer
Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of
Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "), and Encysive Pharmaceuticals Inc., a
Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "). 

  

 _Introduction_  

   

 The respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company have approved the acquisition of the Company by Parent on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement. 

   

 In furtherance of such acquisition, Parent has agreed to cause Merger Sub to commence a tender offer (as it may be amended from time to time as permitted under this Agreement, the " _Offer_ ") to purchase all the shares of common stock, par value $0.005 per share, of the Company (the " _Company Common Stock_ "), including the associated Rights, issued and outstanding (each, a " _Share_ " and, collectively, the " _Shares_ "), at a price per Share of $2.35 (such amount, or any other amount per Share paid pursuant to the Offer and this Agreement, the " _Offer Price_ "), subject to any required withholding of Taxes, net to the seller in cash, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement. 

   

 Following consummation of the Offer, the parties intend that Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ "), with the Company surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ "), and each Share that is not tendered and accepted pursuant to the Offer, other than certain Shares as provided in Sections 2.2(b) and (c), will thereupon be cancelled and converted into the right to receive cash in an amount equal to the Offer Price, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein. 

   

 The respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company have approved this Agreement and the Transactions, including the Offer and the Merger, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein. 

   

 In consideration of the foregoing and of the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth in this Agreement, the parties hereto agree as follows: 

   

ARTICLE 1 
 THE OFFER AND THE MERGER

(a) Provided that (1) none of the events or circumstances set forth in paragraphs (a) through (g) of Annex A hereto shall have occurred and be existing (and shall not have been waived by Merger Sub) and (2) the Company shall have complied in all material respects with its obligations under Section 1.2, as promptly as reasonably practicable, but in no event later than ten (10) business days (as defined in Rule 14d-1(g)(3) promulgated by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the " _Exchange Act_ ") after the date of this Agreement, Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, commence the Offer 

    ##### 

  

    

within the meaning of the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC. The
obligations of Merger Sub to, and of Parent to cause Merger Sub to, accept
for payment, and pay for, any shares of Company Common Stock tendered
pursuant to the Offer are subject to the conditions set forth in Annex A. The
initial expiration date of the Offer shall be the 20th business day following
the commencement of the Offer (determined using Exchange Act Rule
14d-1(g)(3)). Merger Sub expressly reserves the right to waive any condition
to the Offer, to increase the price per Share payable in the Offer and/or to
modify the other terms of the Offer, except that, without the consent of
the Company, Merger Sub shall not (i) reduce the number of shares of Company
Common Stock subject to the Offer, (ii) reduce the Offer Price, (iii) waive

in a manner adverse to the holders of Company Common Stock, (v) extend the
Offer (except as provided below), (vi) change the form of consideration

expiration date of the Offer, any of the conditions set forth in Annex A
shall not have been satisfied or waived, for one (1) or more periods of not
more than ten (10) business days each, until such time as such conditions
are satisfied or waived, or (iii) for one (1) or more periods for an
aggregate period of not more than twenty (20) business days beyond the latest
expiration date that would otherwise be permitted if, on such expiration
date, there shall not have been tendered and not withdrawn that number of
Shares that, together with any Shares then owned by Parent, would equal
ninety percent (90%) or more of the issued and outstanding Shares; _provided_
that if Merger Sub shall extend the offer pursuant to this clause (iii),
Merger Sub shall waive during such extension all conditions set forth in Annex
A other than the Minimum Tender Condition, the Regulatory Condition and the
conditions set forth in paragraphs (a), (b) and (f) therein. In addition,
subject to Parents right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
9.1, (i) if at the initially scheduled expiration date of the Offer, any one
or more of the Minimum Tender Condition, the Regulatory Condition or the
conditions set forth in paragraphs (a), (b), (e) or (f) of Annex A are not
satisfied, at the request of the Company Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall
cause Merger Sub to, extend the offer one (1) time for a period of up to ten
(10) business days and (ii) if at any extended expiration date of the

required to extend the Offer beyond the Outside Date. Further, Merger Sub
may, without the consent of the Company, make available a "subsequent
offering period", in accordance with Rule 14d-11 promulgated by the SEC under
the Exchange Act, for up to twenty (20) business days. On the terms and
subject to the conditions of the Offer and this Agreement, Merger Sub shall,
and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, pay for all Shares validly tendered and
not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer that Merger Sub becomes obligated to
purchase pursuant to the Offer as soon as practicable after the expiration of
the Offer. For the avoidance of doubt, the parties hereto agree that shares
of Restricted Stock may be tendered in the Offer and be acquired by Parent or
Merger Sub pursuant to the Offer.

The Company represents and warrants that the Board of Directors of the Company (the " _Company Board_ "), at a meeting duly called and held, has unanimously (i) approved and declared advisable this Agreement and the Transactions, including the Offer and the Merger (such approval having been made in accordance with the DGCL, including for purposes of Section 203 thereof), and (ii) resolved to recommend that stockholders of the Company accept the Offer, tender their Shares to Merger Sub pursuant thereto and adopt this Agreement.

ARTICLE 2 
 EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THE 
 CONSTITUENT CORPORATIONS; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES  

  

 SECTION 2.1 _Conversion of Merger Sub Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any holder of shares of Merger Sub capital stock, each share of Merger Sub capital 

    ##### 

  

    

stock shall be converted into and become one fully paid and nonassessable
share of common stock, par value $0.005 per share, of the Surviving
Corporation. 

   

 SECTION 2.2 _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any holder of Shares: 

   

 (a) Each Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than (i) any Shares to be canceled pursuant to Section 2.2(b) and (ii) any Appraisal Shares) shall be canceled and shall be converted automatically into the right to receive the highest price per Share paid pursuant to the Offer (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). As of the Effective Time, all such Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate representing any such Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration upon surrender of such certificate in accordance with Section 2.3, without interest. 

   

 (b) Each Share held in the treasury of the Company and each Share owned by Merger Sub, Parent or any wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent or of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled without any conversion thereof and no payment or distribution shall be made with respect thereto. 

   

 (c) _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Shares that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by any Person who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such Shares (" _Appraisal Shares_ ") pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL (" _Section 262_") shall not be converted into the right to receive Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.2(a), but rather the holders of Appraisal Shares shall be entitled to payment of the fair value of such Appraisal Shares in accordance with Section 262 (and at the Effective Time, such Appraisal Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and such holders shall cease to have any right with respect thereto, except the right to receive the fair value of such Appraisal Shares in accordance with Section 262); _provided_ , _however_ , that if any such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under Section 262, then the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such holders Appraisal Shares shall cease and such Appraisal Shares shall be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into, and to have become exchangeable solely for the right to receive, Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.2(a). The Company shall serve prompt notice to Parent of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of any shares of Company Common Stock, and Parent shall have the right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing. Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available by the Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 2.3(a) to pay for Appraisal Shares shall be returned to Parent upon demand. 

    ##### 

  

     

 SECTION 2.3 _Exchange of Certificates_. 

   

 (a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall enter into an agreement with such bank or trust company as may be designated by Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company (the " _Exchange Agent_ "), which shall provide for the payment of Merger Consideration in accordance with the terms of this Section 2.3. Parent shall, or shall take all steps necessary to enable and cause the Surviving Corporation to, deposit with the Exchange Agent as of the Effective Time, for the benefit of the holders of Shares, for payment by the Exchange Agent in accordance with this Article 2, the cash necessary to pay for the Shares converted into the right to receive Merger Consideration (the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. Such aggregate Merger Consideration deposited with the Exchange Agent shall, pending its disbursement to such holders, be invested by the Exchange Agent as directed by Parent. Any net profit resulting from, or interest or income produced by, such amounts on deposit with the Exchange Agent will be payable to Parent or as Parent otherwise directs.

   

 (b) _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding Shares (the " _Certificates_ ") whose shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.2, (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in surrendering the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall receive in exchange therefor the amount of cash which the Shares theretofore represented by such Certificate entitle such holder to receive pursuant to the provisions of this Article 2 and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment may be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the Person requesting such issuance shall pay any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of Parent that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable. Each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon surrender in accordance with this Section 2.3 the Merger Consideration into which the Shares shall have been converted pursuant to Section 2.2. No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on any cash payable to holders of Certificates pursuant to the provisions of this Article 2. 

   

 (c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. The Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates in accordance with the terms of this Article 2 shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Shares theretofore represented by such Certificates, _subject_ , _however_ , to the Surviving Corporations obligation to pay any dividends or make any other distributions with a record date prior to the Effective Time that may have been declared or made by the Company on such Shares 

    ##### 

  

 

in accordance with the terms of this Agreement or prior to the date of this
Agreement and that remain unpaid at the Effective Time, and there shall be no
further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company
of the Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.
If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the
Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be
canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article 2, except as otherwise
provided by Law. 

   

 (d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates for 180 days after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any holders of Certificates who have not theretofore complied with this Article 2 shall thereafter look only to Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws, as general creditors thereof) for payment of their claim for Merger Consideration. 

   

 (e) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate shall not have been surrendered prior to such date on which any amounts payable pursuant to this Article 2 would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Authority (as defined in Section 3.3(c)), any such amounts shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. 

   

 (f) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the applicable Merger Consideration with respect thereto pursuant to this Agreement. 

   

 (g) _Withholding Rights_. Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the applicable Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Parent and paid to the appropriate Taxing Authorities, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Parent. 

   

 SECTION 2.4 _Company Options; Phantom Units; Restricted Stock_. 

   

 (a) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions necessary to provide that each Option outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (whether or not then vested or exercisable) shall be cancelled and terminated and converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive a cash amount equal to the Option Consideration for each share of Company Common Stock then subject to the Option, or, if the Option Consideration shall be a 

    ##### 

  

  

negative number, no such cash payment shall be due and owing. Except as
otherwise provided below, any Option Consideration due and owing shall be
paid as soon after the Closing Date as shall be practicable. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from any Option Consideration otherwise payable such
amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the
making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of state, local or
foreign Tax law. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall make any
amendments to the terms of the Stock Plans and obtain any consents from
holders of Options that, in each case, are necessary to give effect to the
transactions contemplated by this Section 2.4 and, notwithstanding anything
to the contrary, payment may be withheld in respect of any Option until any
necessary consents are obtained. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall take all actions necessary to terminate all its Stock Plans,
such termination to be effective at or before the Effective Time. For
purposes of this Agreement, " _Option Consideration_ " means, with respect to
any share of Company Common Stock issuable under a particular Option, an
amount equal to (i) the Merger Consideration per Share less (ii) the exercise
price payable in respect of each share of Company Common Stock issuable under
such Option; " _Options_ " means any option granted, and, immediately before
the Effective Time not exercised, expired or terminated, to a current
or former employee, director or independent contractor of the Company or any
of the Company Subsidiaries or any former subsidiary of the Company or
predecessor thereof to purchase shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to
the Stock Plans; and " _Stock Plans_ " means the Companys Amended
and Restated 1990 Incentive Stock Option Plan, Amended and Restated 1992
Incentive Stock Option Plan, Amended and Restated 1995 Stock Option Plan,
Amended and Restated 1995 Non-Employee Director Stock Option Plan, Amended
and Restated 1999 Stock Incentive Plan and 2007 Incentive Plan, as amended. 

   

 (b) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Company Board (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof administering the Stock Plans) shall adopt such resolutions or take such other actions as may be required, if any, so that, subject to the terms of the Stock Plans and the grants thereunder (i) each Phantom Unit shall become fully vested and deemed earned in full effective as of the day immediately preceding the date of acceptance for payment of the shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer, (ii) each holder of a Phantom Unit shall thereafter become entitled to receive in cash (subject to amounts required to be withheld by Law), within 30 days of the day immediately preceding the date of acceptance for payment of the shares of Common Stock pursuant to the Offer, the amount payable thereunder to the holder thereof pursuant the terms of such Phantom Unit and the related Stock Plan under which it was granted and (iii) any forfeiture provisions applicable to the Phantom Units shall lapse as of the acceptance for payment of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer. As used in this Agreement, " _Phantom Unit_ " means an award, other than an Option or Restricted Stock, granted and, immediately before the date specified in clause (b)(i) above, not paid or terminated to a current or former employee, director or independent contractor of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or any former subsidiary of the Company or predecessor thereof pursuant to the Stock Plans for which the value of a Share of Company Common Stock is used to measure the benefits payable to the grantee of such award. 

   

 (c) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Company Board (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof administering the Stock Plans) shall adopt such resolutions or take such other actions as may be required to provide for the lapse as of the 

    ##### 

  

  

acceptance for payment of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer
of all forfeiture provisions applicable to any shares of Restricted Stock and
to permit cashless or net vesting of such shares of Restricted Stock. Each
holder of Restricted Stock shall be treated as a holder of the corresponding
number of shares of Company Common Stock as of the acceptance for payment of
shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer in accordance with the
terms of Section 2.2 in the same manner as other outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the
acceptance for payment of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the
Offer. As used in this Agreement, " _Restricted Stock_ " means any award of
restricted Company Common Stock outstanding immediately before the Effective
Time with respect to which the restrictions have not lapsed, and which award
shall not have previously expired or terminated, to a current or former
employee, director or independent contractor of the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries or any predecessor thereof pursuant to any applicable
Stock Plan or any other contract or agreement entered into by the Company or
any of the Company Subsidiaries. 

   

 SECTION 2.5 _Warrants_. At the Effective Time and subject to Section 6.12, each outstanding Warrant of the Company shall be converted into the right to receive, upon exercise of such Warrant and payment of the exercise price thereof, an amount equal to the product of (x) the number of shares of Company Common Stock for which such Warrant may be exercised and (y) the Merger Consideration. As used in this Agreement, " _Warrant_ " means a Common Stock Purchase Warrant issued by the Company pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement dated as of August 20, 2007. 

   

 SECTION 2.6 _Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action_. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take all such actions as may be necessary or appropriate in order to effectuate the Merger under the DGCL as promptly as commercially practicable. If at any time after the Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of either of the Constituent Corporations, the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation are fully authorized in the name of each Constituent Corporation or otherwise to take, and shall take, all such lawful and necessary action. 

   

 SECTION 2.7 _Option to Acquire Additional Shares_. The Company hereby grants to Merger Sub an option (the " _Top-Up Option_ "), exercisable in accordance with this Section 2.7, to purchase up to that number of newly issued shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Top-Up Option Shares_ ") equal to the number of shares that, when added to the number of Shares owned by Parent and its subsidiaries immediately following consummation of the Offer, shall constitute one share more than 90% of the Shares then outstanding (after giving effect to the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares) for a cash purchase price per Top-Up Option Share equal to the Offer Price; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the number of Top-Up Option Shares shall not exceed the number equal to 19.9% of the Shares outstanding immediately prior to the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares. The Top-Up Option may be exercised by Merger Sub at any one time before the Effective Time within thirty (30) business days after Merger Subs acceptance of, and payment for Shares pursuant to the Offer in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. If Merger Sub wishes to so exercise the Top-Up Option, Merger Sub shall give the Company written notice within such thirty (30)-business day period specifying the number of shares of 

    ##### 

  

  

Company Common Stock that Merger Sub wishes to purchase pursuant to the Top-Up
Option and a place and a time (which, subject to applicable Law and any
required regulatory approvals, shall be at least two (2), but not more than
five (5), business days after the date of delivery of such written notice)
for the closing of such purchase. At such closing, (i) the purchase price
in respect of such exercise of the Top-Up Option (which shall equal the
product of (x) the number of shares of Company Common Stock being purchased
pursuant to the Top-Up Option and (y) the Offer Price) shall be paid to the
Company in immediately available funds by wire transfer to an
account designated by the Company, and (ii) the Company shall deliver to
Merger Sub a certificate or certificates representing the number of shares of
Company Common Stock so purchased. The Company agrees that it shall reserve
(and maintain free from preemptive rights) sufficient authorized but unissued
shares of Common Stock so that the Top-Up Option may be exercised without
additional authorization of shares of Company Common Stock (after giving
effect to all other options, warrants, convertible securities and other
rights to purchase shares of Company Common Stock). Merger Sub shall acquire
the Top-Up Option Shares for investment purposes only and not with a view to
any distribution thereof, and will not sell any Top-Up Option Shares purchased
pursuant to this Section except in compliance with the Securities Act of
1933, as amended.

 Except as set forth on the disclosure letter (each section of which qualifies the correspondingly numbered representation and warranty or covenant to the extent specified therein, provided that any disclosure set forth with respect to any particular section shall be deemed to be disclosed in reference to other applicable sections of this Agreement to the extent it is reasonably apparent from a reading of the disclosure that such disclosure is applicable to such other sections) previously delivered by the Company to Parent (the " _Company Disclosure Letter_ "), the Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as follows:

in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, the Company shall
promptly prepare and mail to its stockholders such an amendment or
supplement. The Company shall not mail any Proxy Statement, or any amendment

 SECTION 6.2 _Employee Benefit Matters_. 

  

 (a) Parent agrees to honor in accordance with their terms all employment and severance agreements in each case listed in Section 6.2 of the Company Disclosure Letter or filed as exhibits to the Available Company SEC Documents and all accrued benefits vested thereunder; it being understood and agreed that nothing in this Section 6.2(a) shall prevent Parent from amending or terminating any Company Employee Benefit Plan or other agreement in accordance with its terms and applicable Law. 

  

 (b) For a period of one (1) year following the Closing, Parent agrees to provide employees of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries who are located in the United States (including employees of the Company and any Company Subsidiary incorporated in the United States who have been seconded to non-United States incorporated Company Subsidiaries (" _US Seconded Employees_ ")) and retained by Parent with employee benefits (excluding equity and change in control plans, programs, or arrangements) that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to those benefits provided to such employees immediately prior to the Closing; _provided_ that Parent shall be under no obligation to retain any employee or group of employees 

   ##### 

  

    

of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries other than as required by
applicable Law or an employment agreement listed in Section 6.2 of the
Company Disclosure Letter or filed as an exhibit to the Available Company SEC
Documents. 

  

 (c) For purposes of all employee benefit plans, programs and arrangements maintained by or contributed to by Parent and its subsidiaries (including, after the Closing, the Surviving Corporation), Parent shall, or shall cause its subsidiaries to, cause each such plan, program or arrangement to treat the prior service with the Company and its affiliates of each person who is an employee or former employee of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Closing (a " _Company Employee_ ") who is located in the United States (including US Seconded Employees) (to the same extent such service is recognized under analogous plans, programs or arrangements of the Company or its affiliates prior to the Closing) as service rendered to Parent or its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, for purposes of eligibility to participate in and vesting thereunder (but not for any other purposes, including benefit accrual); _provided_ , _however_ , that such crediting of service shall not operate to duplicate any benefit or the funding of such benefit. Company Employees located in the United States (including US Seconded Employees) shall also be given credit for any deductible or co-payment amounts paid in respect of the plan year in which the Closing occurs, to the extent that, following the Closing, they participate in any other plan for which deductibles or co-payments are required. Parent shall also use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause each Employee Benefit Plan maintained by or contributed to by Parent and its subsidiaries (including, after the Closing, the Surviving Corporation) in which Company Employees located in the United States (including US Seconded Employees) participate, to waive any preexisting condition that was waived under the terms of any Company Employee Benefit Plan immediately prior to the Closing or waiting period limitation which would otherwise be applicable to a Company Employee located in the United States (including US Seconded Employees) on or after the Closing. Parent shall recognize any accrued but unused vacation, sick leave (to the extent accrued on the Companys books and records) of the Company Employees located in the United States (including US Seconded Employees) as of the Closing Date, in accordance with the terms of such Company policies and Parent shall cause the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to provide such vacation, sick leave, and sabbatical time in accordance with the terms of such Company policies but in no event will Parent be obligated to extend or enlarge the benefits available under such Company policies. 

  

 (d) Section 6.2(d) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth all severance obligations (other than any arising between the date hereof and the Effective Time as permitted by Section 5.1(b)(ix)), including a written description of any non-written severance policy, if applicable. Any Company Employee located in the United States (including US Seconded Employees) who is terminated other than for Cause within 180 days following the Closing Date shall receive from Parent severance benefits at least at great as the severance benefits such Company Employee would have received from the Company or Company Subsidiary, as applicable, if (1) the Company or such Company Subsidiary had terminated such Company Employee immediately before the Closing Date and (2) except with respect to a Company Employee described in section 1.2 of the Encysive 2007 Severance Pay Plan, such Company Employee were eligible for separation payments under Article 4 of the Encysive 2007 Severance Pay Plan (regardless of whether the Company Employee otherwise would not be so eligible). Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, a Company Employee located in the United States 

    ##### 

  

  

(including US Seconded Employees) who is terminated for Cause shall not be
eligible to receive a severance benefit. For purposes of this Section 6.2(d),
"Cause" shall mean conviction of a felony, misconduct involving material
dishonesty, breach of trust, or unethical business practice, or refusal or
material failure to perform material job functions (unless caused
by incapacitating disability occurring after the Closing Date or in
accordance with applicable Law).

 (f) In the event the Closing occurs prior to March 31, 2008, Parent agrees to cause the Surviving Corporation and the Company Subsidiaries to pay to each Company Employee no later than March 31, 2008 the bonuses to which they are entitled in respect of 2007 to the extent accrued on the Companys books and records as of the date hereof.

   ##### 

  

    

stockholders under Delaware law; _provided_ , _however_ , that no Company
Adverse Recommendation Change may be made in the absence of a Superior
Proposal unless such change is based upon an event that is unknown to the
Company Board as of the date hereof but becomes known prior to the acceptance

   ##### 

  

    

terms of the Transactions) and (B) is reasonably capable of being completed
on the terms proposed.

the provisions of this Section 6.9(c). The Indemnified Parties may be
required to make reasonable application and provide reasonable and customary
representations and warranties to applicable insurance carriers for the
purpose of obtaining such insurance. 

  

 (d) The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this Section 6.9 shall survive the consummation of the Merger and shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Indemnified Party to whom this Section 6.9 applies without the consent of such affected Indemnified Party (it being expressly agreed that the Indemnified Parties to whom this Section 6.9 applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this Section 6.9, each of whom may enforce the provisions of this Section 6.9). 

  

 (e) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or Surviving Corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.9. 

  

 SECTION 6.10 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall take all such steps as may be required to cause the transactions contemplated by Section 2.4 and any other dispositions of equity securities of the Company (including derivative securities) or acquisitions of Parent equity securities (including derivative securities) in connection with this Agreement by each individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act in accordance with that certain No-Action Letter dated January 12, 1999 issued by the SEC regarding such matters. 

  

 SECTION 6.11 _Directors_. 

  

 (a) Subject to applicable Law and Nasdaq rules applicable to the Company, promptly upon the acceptance for payment of, and payment by Merger Sub for, any shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer, and as long as Parent directly or indirectly beneficially owns not less than a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, Merger Sub shall be entitled to designate such number of directors on the Company Board as will give Merger Sub representation on the Company Board equal to at least that number of directors, rounded up to the next whole number, that is the product of (a) the total number of directors on the Company Board (giving effect to the directors elected pursuant to this sentence) multiplied by (b) the percentage that (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock owned by Merger Sub or any other subsidiary of Parent bears to (ii) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and outstanding, and the Company shall, at such time, use its reasonable best efforts to cause Merger Subs designees to be so elected. The Company shall also, upon the request of Parent, cause such persons designated by Parent to 

   ##### 

  

    

constitute at least the same percentage (rounded up to the next whole number)
as is on the Companys Board of Directors of (i) each committee of the
Companys Board of Directors, subject to compliance with applicable
securities Laws and the Nasdaq rules, and (ii) each board of directors (or
similar body) of each Company Subsidiary and each committee of such board (or
similar body); _provided_ , _however_ , that in the event that Merger Subs
designees are appointed or elected to the Company Board, until the Effective
Time the Company Board shall have at least two directors who are directors on
the date of this Agreement and who are not officers of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary (the " _Independent Directors_ "); and _provided further_
that, in such event, if the number of Independent Directors shall be reduced
below two for any reason whatsoever, the remaining Independent Director shall
be entitled to designate a person to fill such vacancy who shall be deemed to
be an Independent Director for purposes of this Agreement or, if no
Independent Directors then remain, the other directors shall designate three
persons to fill such vacancies who are not officers, stockholders or
affiliates of the Company, any Company Subsidiary, Parent or Merger Sub, and
such persons shall be deemed to be Independent Directors for purposes of
this Agreement. In connection with the foregoing, the Company shall promptly,
at the option of Merger Sub, use its commercially reasonable efforts to
either increase the size of the Company Board or obtain the resignation of
such number of its current directors as is necessary to enable Merger Subs
designees to be elected or appointed to the Company Board as provided above. 

  

 (b) The Companys obligations to appoint designees to the Company Board shall be subject to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-l promulgated thereunder. The Company shall promptly take all actions required pursuant to Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-l in order to fulfill its obligations under this Section 6.11, including mailing to the Companys stockholders the information required by such Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 (which the Company shall mail no later than ten days prior to the first scheduled expiration of the Offer) as is necessary to fulfill the Companys obligations under Section 6.11(a). Parent shall supply to the Company in writing and be solely responsible for any information with respect to itself, Merger Sub and their respective nominees, officers, directors and affiliates required by Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1. The provisions of Section 6.11(a) are in addition to and shall not limit any rights the Parent or Merger Sub or any of their Affiliates may have as a holder or beneficial owner of Company Common Stock as a matter of law with respect to the election of directors or otherwise. 

  

 (c) Following the election or appointment of Parents designees pursuant to Section 6.11(a) and prior to the Effective Time, the approval by affirmative vote or written consent of all of the Independent Directors then in office (or, if there shall be only one Independent Director then in office, the Independent Director) shall be required to authorize (and such authorization shall constitute the authorization of the Company Board and no other action on the part of the Company, including any action by any committee thereof or any other director of the Company, shall, unless otherwise required by Law, be required or permitted to authorize) (i) any amendment or termination of this Agreement by the Company, (ii) any extension of time for performance of any obligation or action hereunder by Parent or Merger Sub or (iii) any waiver or exercise of any of the Companys rights under this Agreement. 

  

 SECTION 6.12 _Warrants; Notes_. The Company and, after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall provide notice of the Offer and the Merger as required by the 

   ##### 

  

    

terms of the Warrants and the terms of the Indenture, dated March 16, 2005,
between the Company and the Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A., governing
the Notes, and shall comply with any required payment obligations (including
under Section 3(e) of the Warrants) and repurchase obligations arising out of
the Offer and the Merger upon the exercise by the holders thereof of the
rights requiring such payments or repurchases. Parent shall provide, or cause
to be provided, to the Company and, after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation the funds necessary to allow the Company or the Surviving
Corporation to satisfy such obligations on a timely basis, with the provision
of such funds being on such terms as Parent shall determine.
