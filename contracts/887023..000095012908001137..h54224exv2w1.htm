Agreement.

forth in this Agreement.

&#147;<I>DGCL</I>&#148;), and each Share that is not tendered and accepted pursuant to the Offer, other than certain
Shares as provided in Sections&nbsp;2.2(b) and (c), will thereupon be cancelled and converted into the
right to receive cash in an amount equal to the Offer Price, on the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth herein.

Merger Sub to, and of Parent to cause Merger Sub to, accept for payment, and pay for, any shares of
Company Common Stock tendered pursuant to the Offer are subject to the conditions set forth in
Annex A. The initial expiration date of the Offer shall be the 20th business day following the
commencement of the Offer (determined using Exchange Act Rule&nbsp;14d-1(g)(3)). Merger Sub expressly
reserves the right to waive any condition to the Offer, to increase the price per Share payable in
the Offer and/or to modify the other terms of the Offer, except that, without the consent of the
Company, Merger Sub shall not (i)&nbsp;reduce the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to
the Offer, (ii)&nbsp;reduce the Offer Price, (iii)&nbsp;waive the Minimum Tender Condition (as defined in
Annex A), (iv)&nbsp;add to the conditions set forth in Annex A or modify any condition set forth in
Annex A in a manner adverse to the holders of Company Common Stock, (v)&nbsp;extend the Offer (except as
provided below), (vi)&nbsp;change the form of consideration payable in the Offer or (vii)&nbsp;otherwise
amend the Offer in any manner adverse to the holders of Company Common Stock. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Merger Sub may, without the consent of the Company, extend the Offer (i)&nbsp;for any period
required by any rule, regulation, interpretation or position of the SEC or the staff thereof
applicable to the Offer, (ii)&nbsp;if at the scheduled expiration date of the Offer, any of the
conditions set forth in Annex A shall not have been satisfied or waived, for one (1)&nbsp;or more

satisfied or waived, or (iii)&nbsp;for one (1)&nbsp;or more periods for an aggregate period of not more than
twenty (20)&nbsp;business days beyond the latest expiration date that would otherwise be permitted if,
on such expiration date, there shall not have been tendered and not withdrawn that number of Shares
that, together with any Shares then owned by Parent, would equal ninety percent (90%) or more of
the issued and outstanding Shares; <I>provided </I>that if Merger Sub shall extend the offer pursuant to
this clause (iii), Merger Sub shall waive during such extension all conditions set forth in Annex A
other than the Minimum Tender Condition, the Regulatory Condition and the conditions set forth in
paragraphs (a), (b)&nbsp;and (f)&nbsp;therein. In addition, subject to Parent&#146;s right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section&nbsp;9.1, (i)&nbsp;if at the initially scheduled expiration date of the Offer,
any one or more of the Minimum Tender Condition, the Regulatory Condition or the conditions set
forth in paragraphs (a), (b), (e)&nbsp;or (f)&nbsp;of Annex A are not satisfied, at the request of the
Company Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, extend the offer one (1)&nbsp;time for a
period of up to ten (10)&nbsp;business days and (ii)&nbsp;if at any extended expiration date of the Offer,
the Regulatory Condition or the conditions set forth in paragraphs (e)&nbsp;or (f)&nbsp;of Annex A are not
satisfied, at the request of the Company Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to,
extend the Offer for increments of not more than ten (10)&nbsp;business days each until such time as
such conditions are satisfied or waived; <I>provided </I>that Merger Sub shall not be required to extend
the Offer beyond the Outside Date. Further, Merger Sub may, without the consent of the Company,
make available a &#147;subsequent offering period&#148;, in accordance with Rule&nbsp;14d-11 promulgated by the
SEC under the Exchange Act, for up to twenty (20)&nbsp;business days. On the terms and subject to the
conditions of the Offer and this Agreement, Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to,
pay for all Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer that Merger Sub becomes
obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer as soon as practicable after the expiration of the
Offer. For the avoidance of doubt, the parties hereto agree that shares of Restricted Stock may be
tendered in the Offer and be acquired by Parent or Merger Sub pursuant to the Offer.

Company (the &#147;<I>Exchange Agent</I>&#148;), which shall provide for the payment of Merger Consideration in
accordance with the terms of this Section&nbsp;2.3. Parent shall, or shall take all steps necessary to
enable and cause the Surviving Corporation to, deposit with the Exchange Agent as of the Effective
Time, for the benefit of the holders of Shares, for payment by the Exchange Agent in accordance
with this Article&nbsp;2, the cash necessary to pay for the Shares converted into the right to receive
Merger Consideration (the &#147;<I>Exchange Fund</I>&#148;). The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other
purpose. Such aggregate Merger Consideration deposited with the Exchange Agent shall, pending its
disbursement to such holders, be invested by the Exchange Agent as directed by Parent. Any net
profit resulting from, or interest or income produced by, such amounts on deposit with the

immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding Shares (the &#147;<I>Certificates</I>&#148;) whose
shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section&nbsp;2.2,
(i)&nbsp;a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss
and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange
Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify)
and (ii)&nbsp;instructions for use in surrendering the Certificates in exchange for the Merger
Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together
with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be
required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall receive in exchange therefor
the amount of cash which the Shares theretofore represented by such Certificate entitle such holder
to receive pursuant to the provisions of this Article&nbsp;2 and the Certificate so surrendered shall
forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock that is not
registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment may be made to a Person other than the
Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered if such Certificate shall be
properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the Person requesting such
issuance shall pay any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other
than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of Parent that such
Tax has been paid or is not applicable. Each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon surrender in accordance with this
Section&nbsp;2.3 the Merger Consideration into which the Shares shall have been converted pursuant to
Section&nbsp;2.2. No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on any cash payable to holders of

stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in such
