and the eCivis Holders&rsquo; Representative shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any Disputed Amounts and, if the Parties
are able to resolve all Disputed Amounts, the Purchase Price Adjustment Statement, as modified to reflect such resolution, shall
be the Final Purchase Price Adjustment Statement. If GTY and the eCivis Holders&rsquo; Representative are unable to resolve all
Disputed Amounts within twenty (20)&nbsp;days after delivery of the eCivis Holders&rsquo; Representative&rsquo;s Purchase Price
Dispute Notice, then the Disputed Amounts shall be referred for final determination to a mutually agreed upon nationally recognized
firm of independent certified public accountants, which does not have any material relationship with GTY, the eCivis Holders&rsquo;
Representative or any of their respective Affiliates (such firm, or any successor thereto, the &ldquo;<U>Accounting Arbitrator</U>&rdquo;)
within fifteen (15)&nbsp;days after the end of such&nbsp;20-day period. If GTY and the eCivis Holders&rsquo; Representative are
unable to agree upon an Accounting Arbitrator within such&nbsp;15-day period, then the Accounting Arbitrator shall be an accounting
firm of national standing designated by the American Arbitration Association in New York, New York which does not have any material
relationship with GTY, the eCivis Holders&rsquo; Representative or any of their respective Affiliates. The eCivis Holders&rsquo;
Representative and GTY shall execute any agreement reasonably required by the Accounting Arbitrator for its engagement hereunder.
The Accounting Arbitrator shall consider only those Disputed Amounts which GTY and the eCivis Holders&rsquo; Representative have
been unable to resolve. The Accounting Arbitrator will act as an expert (not an arbitrator) and may select as a resolution the
position of either GTY or the eCivis Holders&rsquo; Representative for each Disputed Amount (based solely on presentations and
supporting material provided by the Parties and not pursuant to any independent review) or may impose an alternative resolution
which cannot be higher than the highest value or lower than the lowest value presented by each Party for a disputed amount. The
Accounting Arbitrator shall deliver to GTY and the eCivis Holders&rsquo; Representative, as promptly as practicable, and in any
event within forty-five (45)&nbsp;days after its appointment, a written report setting forth the resolution of such Disputed Amounts.
Such report shall be final and binding upon the Parties. In selecting such resolution, the Accounting Arbitrator shall rely solely
on the terms of this Agreement and on written submissions and supporting material provided by GTY and the eCivis Holders&rsquo;
Representative, and at the Accounting Arbitrator&rsquo;s election, pursuant to responses provided by the GTY and the eCivis Holders&rsquo;
Representative to inquiries posed by the Accounting Arbitrator&rsquo;s review of the foregoing, but not pursuant to an independent
review. Upon the decision of the Accounting Arbitrator, the Purchase Price Adjustment Statement, as adjusted to the extent necessary
to reflect the Accounting Arbitrator&rsquo;s decision (and as otherwise adjusted in accordance with this Article I), shall be the
Final Purchase Price Adjustment Statement. The fees, costs and expenses of the Accounting Arbitrator shall be allocated to and
borne by GTY and the eCivis Holders&rsquo; Representative based on the inverse of the percentage that the Accounting Arbitrator&rsquo;s
determination (before such allocation) bears to the Disputed Amount as originally submitted to the Accounting Arbitrator. For example,
should the items in dispute total in amount to $1,000 and the Accounting Arbitrator awards $600 in favor of the eCivis Holders&rsquo;
Representative&rsquo;s position, 60% of the costs of its review would be borne by GTY and&nbsp;40% of the costs would be borne
by the eCivis Holders&rsquo; Representative. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no resolution of any Disputed Amount
or any facts, circumstances or events giving rise to any such Disputed Amount, whether by the Accounting Arbitrator otherwise,
shall limit the right of any party to assert and prevail on a claim for a breach of a representation or warranty hereunder pursuant
to <U>Article 7</U>.</P>
