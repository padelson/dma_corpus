_Company_ "), GTY Technology Holdings Inc., a Cayman Islands exempted company
(" _GTY_ "), GTY EC Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _Merger Sub
"_), and Kirk Fernandez, in his capacity as the eCivis Holders' Representative
pursuant to the designation in _Section 10.17_. All capitalized terms used in
this Agreement shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in _Article 9_
or as otherwise defined elsewhere in this Agreement unless the context clearly
provides otherwise. Each of the Company, GTY, and Merger Sub may also be
referred to individually herein as a " _Party_ ", and collectively as the "
_Parties_ ".

  



  

PRELIMINARY STATEMENTS

  



  

A. GTY is a blank check company incorporated for the purpose of
effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock
purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more
businesses.

  



  

B. Prior to the Effective Time, GTY will incorporate in the State
of Massachusetts a wholly-owned, direct subsidiary of GTY (" _Holdings_
"), for the purpose of consummating the Transaction and the Roll-Up
Transactions, and the parties hereto have agreed that it is desirable to
utilize Holdings to effectuate the Transaction and for Holdings to file the
Registration Statement (as defined herein).

  



  

C. Prior to the Effective Time, a newly formed wholly-owned
subsidiary of Holdings (" _GTY Merger Sub_ ") will merge with and into GTY
with GTY continuing as the surviving entity upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in an agreement and plan of merger by and among
Holdings, GTY and GTY Merger Sub (the " _GTY Merger_ ").

  



  

D. After the GTY Merger and prior to the Effective Time, GTY will
assign to Holdings all of GTY's rights, interests and obligations under this
Agreement and all agreements in connection with the Roll-Up Transactions.

  



  

E. Merger Sub is a newly formed, wholly-owned Subsidiary of GTY,
and was formed for the sole purpose of the Transaction.

  



  

F. The Company and its Subsidiaries are engaged in the business of
providing cloud-based grants management and cost allocation software for
state, local and tribal governments and government agencies (the " _Business_
").

  



  

G. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, the shareholders listed
on _Section 2.3(a) of the Company 's Disclosure Schedule_ (collectively, the
" _eCivis Holders_ ") will own all of the issued and outstanding shares of

 | | 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

H. The Parties desire that, at the Effective Time, the Merger
Sub merge with and into the Company, with the Company continuing as the
surviving entity upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement (the " _Merger_ ").

  



  

I. For U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Parties intend that
the GTY Merger, together with the Merger and other transactions to
be consummated as part of the Roll-Up Transactions qualify as a contribution
of eCivis Shares by the eCivis Holders to Holdings described in Section
351(a) of the Code.

  



  

Now, therefore, in consideration of the premises and the mutual promises
herein made, and in consideration of the representations,

agree as follows:

in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the
Surviving Company.

  



  

(g) _Officers of the Surviving Company_. The officers of Merger Sub
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, from and after the

Documents of the Surviving Company, and Holdings shall be the sole
stockholder of the Surviving Company, from and after the Effective Time.

  



  

1.2 _Effect of Merger on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger, and without any action on the part of the Company,
Merger Sub, GTY or any eCivis Holder:

  



  

(a) _Merger Sub Capital Stock_. Each share of Capital Stock of
Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be automatically converted into and become one (1) fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Company.

  



  

(b) _eCivis Shares_. Each eCivis Share issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be automatically converted into
the right to receive (i) the Pro Rata Portion of the Merger Shares, less the
Escrow Shares, payable to the holder thereof in accordance with the
procedures set forth in _Section 1.3_ , (ii) the Pro Rata Portion of the Cash
Consideration, payable to the holder thereof in accordance with the
procedures set forth in _Section 1.3_ , (iii) the Pro Rata Portion of the
Escrow Shares, if any, that are distributed to the holder thereof pursuant to
the terms of this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or otherwise, as and when
such distributions are required to be made, (iv) the Pro Rata Portion of the
Purchase Price Escrow Amount, if any, that is distributed to the holder
thereof pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or
otherwise, as and when such distributions are required to be made, (v) the
Pro Rata Portion of the Cash Escrow Amount, if any, that is distributed
to the holder thereof pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the Escrow
Agreement or otherwise, as and when such distributions are required to be
made, and (vi) the Pro Rata Portion of an amount, if any, equal to the Earnout
Amount (which shall be calculated and payable in accordance with _Exhibit A_
) (collectively, the " _Per Share Merger Consideration_ "), and the holders
thereof shall cease to have any further rights as holders of eCivis Shares.

  

  



    

-3- 
--- 

 



    



  

(c) _eCivis Options_.

  



  

(i) Each outstanding Option that is unvested as of immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall become fully vested and exercisable as of the
Effective Time. Each Option that is outstanding and unexercised as of the
Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive, with respect to
each eCivis Share subject to such Option, and without interest, an amount
equal to the Per Share Merger Consideration applicable to such eCivis Share
subject to such Option _minus_ the per-share exercise price of such Option
(for the avoidance of doubt, with the Per Share Merger Consideration
determined in accordance with _Section 1.2(b)_ ), which such amount of Per
Share Merger Consideration shall be payable (or issuable) in the forms (i.e.,
Cash Consideration and Merger Shares, subject to _Section 1.3(d)_ ) and at
the times set forth in this Agreement as if the holder of such Option was an
eCivis Holder. In order to receive the amounts calculated pursuant to this
_Section 1.2(c)_ , the holder of an Option must deliver a duly executed
option cancellation agreement, in such form as mutually agreed by the Company
and GTY, prior to the Closing accepting the treatment of such Option as set
forth in this Agreement. All consideration pursuant to this _Section 1.2(c)_
shall subject to applicable withholdings pursuant to and in accordance with
_Section 1.8_. The aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration to be paid with
respect to Options pursuant to this _Section 1.2(c)_ is referred to herein as
the " _Closing Option Amount_ ".

  



  

(ii) Neither the Surviving Company nor GTY will assume any Option
that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not
then vested or exercisable. The payment of the Closing Option Amount for each
Option to each holder of an Option shall be to the Surviving Company for
further payment, as soon as practicable (but in no event later than the second
regular payroll date after the Effective Time), to such holders of Options
through the Surviving Company's payroll processing system or
other appropriate account net of applicable Tax withholding. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company and the board of directors of the Company shall
take all actions that may be necessary (under the applicable incentive equity
plan and otherwise) to (i) effectuate the provisions of this _Section 1.2(c)_
and (ii) to ensure that, from and after the Effective Time, holders of Options
have no rights with respect thereto other than those specifically provided in
this _Section 1.2(c)_.

  



  

(d) _Dissenting Shares_ _._ Notwithstanding the foregoing
provisions of this  _Article 1_ , any eCivis Shares held by Persons who
object to the Merger and comply with the provisions of the Delaware
General Corporation Law concerning the rights of holders of eCivis Shares to
dissent from the Merger and require appraisal of their eCivis Shares ("
_Dissenting Shares_ " and such Persons, " _Dissenting Stockholders_ ") shall
not be converted into a right to receive any portion of the Merger
Consideration and the holders thereof shall be entitled to such rights as
are granted by Delaware General Corporation Law. Each holder of Dissenting
Shares who becomes entitled to payment for such shares pursuant to the
Delaware General Corporation Law shall receive payment therefor from the
Surviving Company in accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law;
_provided_ , _however_ , that (i) if any such holder of Dissenting Shares
shall have failed to establish such holder's entitlement to appraisal rights
as provided in the Delaware General Corporation Law, or (ii) if any such
holder of Dissenting Shares shall have effectively withdrawn such holder's
demand for appraisal of such shares or lost such holder's right to appraisal
and payment for such holder's shares under the Delaware General Corporation
Law, such holder shall forfeit the right to appraisal of such shares and each
such share shall not constitute a Dissenting Share and shall be treated as if
it had been a eCivis Share immediately prior to the Effective Time and
converted, as of the Effective Time, into a right to receive from the
Surviving Company the portion of the Merger Consideration deliverable in
respect thereof as determined in accordance with this _Article 1_ , without
any interest thereon (and such holder shall be treated as a eCivis Holder).
The Company shall provide GTY prompt written notice of any demands received
by the Company for appraisal of eCivis Shares, any withdrawal of any such
demand and any other demand, notice or instrument delivered to the Company
prior to the Effective Time pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law
that relates to such demand, and GTY shall have the opportunity and right to
direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Without
the prior written consent of GTY, the Company shall not voluntarily make any
payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demand for
payment. From and after the Effective Time, no stockholder of the Company who
has properly exercised and perfected appraisal rights pursuant to the Delaware
General Corporation Law shall be entitled to vote his or her eCivis Shares
for any purpose or receive payment of dividends or other distributions with
respect to his or her eCivis Shares (except dividends and distributions
payable to stockholders of record at a date which is prior to the Effective
Time).

1.3 _Payment and Delivery of Merger Consideration_.

  



  

(a) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, GTY shall deposit, or
shall cause to be deposited with Continental Stock Transfer and Trust
Company or such other bank or trust company that may be designated by GTY and
be reasonably acceptable to the Company (the " _Exchange Agent_ "), for the
benefit of the eCivis Holders, for exchange in accordance with this _Section
1.3_ through the Exchange Agent, sufficient funds and shares of GTY Common
Stock in an aggregate amount necessary for the payment of:

  



  

(i) the Cash Consideration, less the Closing Option Amount (which
Closing Option Amount GTY shall fund to the Surviving Corporation at the
Effective Time), which shall not include any amounts otherwise payable in
respect of any Dissenting Shares; _provided_  that GTY will promptly
thereafter pay to the Exchange Agent any amounts by which the Cash
Consideration increases due to any Dissenting Shares becoming eCivis Shares
in accordance with _Section 1.5_ ; and

  



  

(ii) a number of shares of GTY Common Stock equal to (x) Twenty
Million Dollars ($20,000,000), divided by (y) the 30-Day VWAP as of
the Closing Date (collectively, the " _Merger Shares_ "), less the Escrow
Shares, which Merger Shares shall be subject to the eCivis Holder Lockup
Agreement; _provided_ , that the foregoing shall not include any Merger Shares
otherwise payable in respect of any Dissenting Shares; _provided_ , further,
that GTY will promptly thereafter deliver to the Exchange Agent any Merger
Shares due to any Dissenting Shares becoming eCivis Shares in accordance with
_Section 1.5_. For purposes of this Agreement, " _30-Day VWAP_ " means the
volume weighted average price of a share of GTY Common Stock, for the
30 trading days immediately prior to the date of calculation (as reported by
Bloomberg L.P. or a similar organization and as adjusted for splits,
dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like).

  



  

The Cash Consideration and the Merger Shares, are referred to herein,
collectively, the " _Merger Consideration_ ". The funds and shares provided to
the Exchange Agent are referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ ". The Exchange
Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions, deliver the Per Share
Merger Consideration contemplated to be issued pursuant to _Section 1.2(b)_
out of the Exchange Fund. Except as contemplated by _Section 1.3(f)_ hereof,
the Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose.

(b) At the Effective Time, GTY shall deposit the Escrow Shares and
the Cash Escrow Amount into the Indemnity Escrow Account, which Escrow Shares
and Cash Escrow Amount shall be released from the Indemnity Escrow Account in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement. The
Escrow Shares shall be treated as owned by the eCivis Holders for U.S.
federal, state, local and non-U.S. income Tax purposes, all dividends paid
the Escrow Shares will be distributed currently to the eCivis
Holders' Representative (for the benefit of the eCivis Holders), and the
eCivis Holders' Representative (on behalf of the eCivis Holders) will be
entitled to exercise all voting rights of the Escrow Shares while the Escrow
Shares are held in the Indemnity Escrow Account.

  



  

(c) As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, GTY shall
cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each Person who was, at the
Effective Time, a holder of record of eCivis Shares entitled to receive the
Per Share Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 1.2(b)_ : (i) a letter of
transmittal in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B (which shall specify the
delivery of any certificates evidencing the eCivis Shares (the "
_Certificates_ ") shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
certificates evidencing the Merger Consideration shall pass only upon proper
delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent), and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) pursuant to such letter of
transmittal. Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate (or
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) for cancellation, together with
such letter of transmittal (solely if required by the Exchange Agent), duly
completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto,
and such other documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the
holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor
the portion of the Merger Consideration which such holder has the right to
receive pursuant to  _Section 1.2(b)_ (which, with respect to the Merger
Shares, shall be in book-entry form unless a physical certificate is
requested), and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled.
In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of eCivis Shares that is
not registered in the transfer records of the Company, the portion of the
Merger Consideration to which such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section
1.2(b)_ may be issued to a transferee if the Certificate representing such
eCivis Shares is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all
documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence
that any applicable stock transfer Taxes have been paid. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this _Section 1.3_ , each Certificate shall be deemed at all
times after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon
such surrender the portion of the Merger Consideration to which such holder
is entitled pursuant to _Section 1.2(b)_.

  



  

(d) To the extent any Person holding eCivis Shares is unable to make
the representations and warranties in the letter of transmittal in the form
attached hereto as Exhibit B (such eCivis Shares, " _Cash-out Shares_ " and
such Persons, " _Cash-out Stockholders_ "), such Cash-out Shares shall not be
converted into a right to receive such Cash-out Stockholders' Pro Rata
Portion of the Merger Shares, and instead, such Cash-out Stockholders shall be
entitled to receive cash consideration equal to the value of their Pro Rata
Portion of the Merger Shares (such cash value based on the 30-Day VWAP of the
Merger Shares as of the Closing Date). To the extent applicable, in lieu of

(e) No dividends or other distributions declared or made after the
Effective Time with respect to the Merger Shares with a record date after the
Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate
with respect to the Merger Shares represented thereby, until the holder of
such Certificate shall surrender such Certificate. Following surrender of any
such Certificate, there shall be paid to the holder of the Merger Shares
issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) promptly, the amount of
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
and theretofore paid with respect to such Merger Shares, and (ii) at the
appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions, with

date occurring after surrender, payable with respect to such Merger Shares.

  



  

(f) All Merger Shares issued upon surrender of a Certificate in
accordance with the terms of this _Section 1.3_ (including any cash paid
pursuant to _Section 1.3(c)_ ) shall be deemed to have been issued in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the eCivis Shares formerly
represented by the applicable Certificate.

  



  

(g) No certificates evidencing fractional Merger Shares shall be
issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates, and in lieu
thereof, each Person who would otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a
Merger Share shall receive, in lieu of such fractional share, cash in an
amount equal to the value of such fractional share.

  



  

(h) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to
any holders of eCivis Shares for one (1) year after the Effective Time shall
be delivered to the Surviving Company, upon demand, and any holders of eCivis
Shares who have not theretofore complied with this _Section 1.3_ shall
thereafter look only to the Surviving Company for the Merger Consideration.
Any portion of the Exchange Fund remaining unclaimed by holders of eCivis
Shares as of a date which is immediately prior to such time as such amounts
would otherwise escheat to or become property of any government entity shall,
to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of GTY free
and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

  



  

(i) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
none of the Exchange Agent, GTY, the Surviving Company or any other Person
shall be liable to any eCivis Holder or to any other Person for any Merger
Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

  



  

(j) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by GTY, the
posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as GTY may
direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with
respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange for
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the consideration into which the
eCivis Shares represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate shall
have been converted.

1.4 _Closing Date Statement_ No later than two (2) Business Days
before the Closing Date, the eCivis Holders' Representative shall deliver to
GTY a statement (the " _Closing Date Statement_ ") setting forth or
attaching, as applicable:

  



  

(a) the Company's good faith estimate of Closing Date Cash (the "
_Estimated Closing Cash Amount_ ") and Closing Date Indebtedness (the "
_Estimated Closing Indebtedness Amount_ "); and

  



  

(b) the resulting calculation of the Cash Consideration.

  



  

1.5 _Post-Closing Purchase Price Determination_.

  

   

  

(a) After Closing, GTY shall prepare and, within ninety (90) days
after Closing, GTY shall deliver to the eCivis Holders' Representative, a
statement (together with reasonable supporting documentation) setting forth
GTY's determination of (i) Closing Date Cash, and (ii) Closing Date
Indebtedness (the " _Purchase Price Adjustment Statement_ "). If GTY does
not deliver a Purchase Price Adjustment Statement within such 90-day period,
the Closing Date Statement shall be the Final Purchase Price Adjustment
Statement.

  



  

(b) Following the Closing Date, the Company shall permit the eCivis
Holders' Representative and its counsel, accountants and other
advisors reasonable access (during normal business hours, with the right to
make copies) to the financial and other relevant books and records of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, in each case for the purposes of the review and
objection right and dispute process contemplated in this _Section 1.5_.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this _Section 1.5(b)_ , the
Company shall not be required to, or to cause any of its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates to, grant access to or furnish information to the eCivis Holders'
Representative to the extent that (a) such information is subject to an
attorney/client or attorney work product privilege or (b) such access or the
furnishing of such information is prohibited by applicable Law.

  



  

(c) If the eCivis Holders' Representative disagrees with the
Purchase Price Adjustment Statement, the eCivis Holders' Representative shall
notify GTY in writing of such disagreement within thirty (30) days after
delivery of the Purchase Price Adjustment Statement, which notice shall
describe in reasonable detail the nature of such disagreement, including the
specific items involved and the dollar amounts thereof (a " _Purchase Price
Dispute Notice_ "). Any component of GTY's Purchase Price
Adjustment Statement that is not the subject of an objection by the eCivis
Holders' Representative shall be final and binding on the Parties and deemed
to be part of the Final Purchase Price Adjustment Statement. If the eCivis
Holders' Representative does not deliver a Purchase Price Dispute Notice
within such 30-day period, the Purchase Price Adjustment Statement, as
delivered by GTY to the eCivis Holders' Representative, shall be the Final
Purchase Price Adjustment Statement. If the eCivis Holders' Representative
does deliver a Purchase Price Dispute Notice within such 30-day period (the
aggregate amount in dispute as set forth in the Purchase Price Dispute
Notice, the " _Disputed Amounts_ "), then the Disputed Amounts shall
be resolved pursuant to _Section 1.5(d)_.

  



    

-8- 
--- 

 



    



  

(d) GTY and the eCivis Holders' Representative shall negotiate in
good faith to resolve any Disputed Amounts and, if the Parties are able to
resolve all Disputed Amounts, the Purchase Price Adjustment Statement, as
modified to reflect such resolution, shall be the Final Purchase Price
Adjustment Statement. If GTY and the eCivis Holders' Representative are unable
to resolve all Disputed Amounts within twenty (20) days after delivery of the
eCivis Holders' Representative's Purchase Price Dispute Notice, then the
Disputed Amounts shall be referred for final determination to a mutually
agreed upon nationally recognized firm of independent certified public
accountants, which does not have any material relationship with GTY, the
eCivis Holders' Representative or any of their respective Affiliates (such
firm, or any successor thereto, the " _Accounting Arbitrator_ ") within
fifteen (15) days after the end of such 20-day period. If GTY and the eCivis
Holders' Representative are unable to agree upon an Accounting Arbitrator
within such 15-day period, then the Accounting Arbitrator shall be an
accounting firm of national standing designated by the American Arbitration
Association in New York, New York which does not have any
material relationship with GTY, the eCivis Holders' Representative or any of
their respective Affiliates. The eCivis Holders' Representative and GTY shall
execute any agreement reasonably required by the Accounting Arbitrator for its
engagement hereunder. The Accounting Arbitrator shall consider only those
Disputed Amounts which GTY and the eCivis Holders' Representative have been
unable to resolve. The Accounting Arbitrator will act as an expert (not an
arbitrator) and may select as a resolution the position of either GTY or the
eCivis Holders' Representative for each Disputed Amount (based solely on
presentations and supporting material provided by the Parties and not
pursuant to any independent review) or may impose an alternative
resolution which cannot be higher than the highest value or lower than the
lowest value presented by each Party for a disputed amount. The Accounting
Arbitrator shall deliver to GTY and the eCivis Holders' Representative, as
promptly as practicable, and in any event within forty-five (45) days after
its appointment, a written report setting forth the resolution of such
Disputed Amounts. Such report shall be final and binding upon the Parties. In
selecting such resolution, the Accounting Arbitrator shall rely solely on the
terms of this Agreement and on written submissions and supporting material
provided by GTY and the eCivis Holders' Representative, and at the Accounting
Arbitrator's election, pursuant to responses provided by the GTY and the
eCivis Holders' Representative to inquiries posed by the Accounting
Arbitrator's review of the foregoing, but not pursuant to an
independent review. Upon the decision of the Accounting Arbitrator, the
Purchase Price Adjustment Statement, as adjusted to the extent necessary to
reflect the Accounting Arbitrator's decision (and as otherwise adjusted in
accordance with this Article I), shall be the Final Purchase Price Adjustment
Statement. The fees, costs and expenses of the Accounting Arbitrator shall be
allocated to and borne by GTY and the eCivis Holders' Representative based on
the inverse of the percentage that the Accounting Arbitrator's determination
(before such allocation) bears to the Disputed Amount as originally submitted
to the Accounting Arbitrator. For example, should the items in dispute total
in amount to $1,000 and the Accounting Arbitrator awards $600 in favor of the
eCivis Holders' Representative's position, 60% of the costs of its review
would be borne by GTY and 40% of the costs would be borne by the eCivis
Holders' Representative. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no
resolution of any Disputed Amount or any facts, circumstances or events
giving rise to any such Disputed Amount, whether by the Accounting Arbitrator
otherwise, shall limit the right of any party to assert and prevail on a
claim for a breach of a representation or warranty hereunder pursuant to
_Article 7_.

  



  

(e) " _Final Cash Consideration_ " means an amount equal to: (i) the
Cash Purchase Price, _less_ (ii) the Closing Date Indebtedness amount as set
forth in the Final Purchase Price Adjustment Statement, less (iii) the
Purchase Price Escrow Amount, less (iv) the Cash Escrow Amount, _plus_ (v)
the Closing Cash Amount as set forth in the Final Purchase Price Adjustment
Statement,  _plus_ (vi) the Aggregate Option Exercise Price.

1.6 _Post-Closing Adjustment Amount_.

  



  

(a) The  " _Adjustment Amount_ ," which may be positive or negative,
shall mean an amount equal to (i) the Final Cash Consideration, minus (ii)
Cash Consideration.

  



  

(b) If the Adjustment Amount is a positive number or zero, then:

  



  

(i) GTY and the eCivis Holders' Representative shall provide joint
written instructions to the Escrow Agent to deliver promptly from the
Purchase Price Escrow Account all of the funds contained therein to the eCivis
Holders' Representative for the benefit of the eCivis Holders; and

  



  

(ii) GTY shall promptly pay to the eCivis Holders' Representative the
Adjustment Amount for the benefit of the eCivis Holders.

  



  

(c) If the Adjustment Amount is a negative number, then GTY and the
eCivis Holders' Representative shall provide joint written instructions to
the Escrow Agent to deliver promptly from the Purchase Price Escrow Account
all of the funds contained therein as follows:

  



  

(iii) to GTY, an amount equal to the lesser of: (x) the balance of the
Purchase Price Escrow Account, or (y) the absolute value of the
Adjustment Amount; and

  



  

(iv) if the absolute value of the Adjustment Amount is less than the
balance of the Purchase Price Escrow Account, to the eCivis
Holders' Representative the remainder of the Purchase Price Escrow Account,
for the benefit of the eCivis Holders.

  



  

(d) To the extent that the absolute value of the Adjustment Amount
exceeds the balance of the Purchase Price Escrow Account, GTY shall be
entitled to recover such excess adjustment amount, at its option in its sole
discretion, from the Indemnity Escrow Account.

  



  

(e) Any amounts payable pursuant to this _Section 1.6_ shall be paid
(or joint instruction to the Escrow Agent shall be provided) within two (2)
Business Days after final determination pursuant to this _Section 1.6_ of the
Final Purchase Price Adjustment Statement, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account designated by the Party receiving such payment.

  



  

(f) The Parties agree to treat any payment made pursuant to this
_Section 1.6_ as an adjustment to the Merger Consideration for U.S. federal,
state, local and non-U.S. income Tax purposes.

  



  

1.7 _Escrowed Portion of the Purchase Price_. For the purpose of
securing the eCivis Holders' Representative's obligations under _Sections
1.4_ and _1.5_ , at the Closing, GTY shall deliver $50,000 in cash (the "
_Purchase Price Escrow Amount_ ") to the Escrow Agent by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account (the " _Purchase Price Escrow
Account_ ") that will be designated and administered by the Escrow Agent
pursuant to an Escrow Agreement. The Escrow Agreement will provide, among
other things, that all amounts in the Purchase Price Escrow Account will be
released in accordance with the amounts provided on the Final Purchase Price
Adjustment Statement and paid pursuant to _Section 1.6_.

1.8 _Withholding_. GTY, the Surviving Company, the Exchange Agent
and their Affiliates shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
consideration payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement to
any Person (including payments of the Cash Purchase Price and the Cash Escrow
Amount) such amounts as GTY, the Surviving Company, the Exchange Agent, or any
Affiliate thereof shall determine in good faith they are required to deduct
and withhold therefrom under the Code, or under any provision of state, local
or foreign Tax Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that GTY shall provide the
eCivis Holders' Representative with written notice of any such intended
withholding at least fifteen (15) days before the making of such payment
(other than withholding on amounts properly treated as compensation for U.S.
federal income Tax purposes), and GTY shall cooperate in good faith with the
eCivis Holders' Representative to obtain any available exception from, or
reduction in, such withholding to the extent permitted under applicable Law.
To the extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld and paid over to the
appropriate Governmental Body, such deducted or withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the
Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any amounts payable pursuant to
this Agreement that constitute compensation for U.S. federal income Tax
purposes shall be paid through (and any applicable withholding shall be
managed through) the Company's ordinary payroll procedures.

  



  

1.9 _Closing_. The consummation of the Transaction (the "
_Closing_ ") shall take place at the offices of Winston and Strawn LLP in New
York, New York, or remotely via electronic exchange of documents and
signatures, commencing at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time on the second (2nd)
Business Day following the satisfaction or waiver of all conditions of the
Parties to consummate the Transaction (other than conditions with respect to
actions the respective Parties will take at the Closing itself) or such other
date as GTY and eCivis Holders' Representative may mutually agree in writing
(the " _Closing Date_ ").

  



  

1.10 _Earnout_. Subject to the terms and conditions of _Exhibit A_ ,
after the Closing, the eCivis Holders (including any holder of Options) shall
receive the Earnout Amount as additional consideration pursuant to and in
accordance with _Exhibit A_. The Parties agree to treat any Earnout Amount as
an adjustment to the Merger Consideration for U.S. federal, state, local and
non-U.S. income Tax purposes.

(a) Attached to _Section 2.6(a)(i) of the Company 's Disclosure
Schedule_ are correct and complete copies of the following
financial statements of the Company Parties: (i) reviewed balance sheets,
statements of operations, stockholders' deficits and cash flows as of and for

_Reviewed Financial Statements_ "); and (ii) unaudited balance sheet,
statements of income, stockholders' equity and cash flows as of and for the
six-month period ended June 30, 2018 (collectively, the " _Interim Financial

Changes_.

  



  

(a) GTY has filed with the SEC all forms, reports, schedules,
registration statements and other documents required to be filed by it
with the SEC for and since its initial public offering of securities. As of
their respective dates, the GTY SEC Filings (i) were prepared in accordance,
in all material respects, with the requirements of the Securities Act or the
Securities Exchange Act, as applicable, as in effect on the date so filed,
and (ii) did not, at the time they were filed (or, if amended, as of the date
of such amendment), contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state a material fact required to be stated or incorporated by
reference therein or necessary in order to make the statements made therein,
in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
Except to the extent set forth in the preceding sentence, GTY makes no
representation or warranty whatsoever concerning any GTY SEC Filing as of any
time other than the date or period with respect to which it was filed. The
certifications and statements required by (x) Rule 13a-14 under the
Securities Exchange Act and (y) 18 U.S.C. § 1350 (Section 906 of the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act) relating to the GTY SEC Filings are accurate and complete and
comply as to form and content with all applicable Governmental Bodies in all
material respects. As of the date of this Agreement, neither GTY nor any of
its officers has received notice from any governmental entity questioning or
challenging the accuracy, completeness, content, form or manner of filing or
furnishing of such certifications. GTY's disclosure controls and procedures
(as defined in Sections 13a-14(c) and 15d-14(c) of the Exchange Act)
effectively enable GTY to comply with, and the appropriate officers of GTY to
make all certifications required under, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

  



  

(b) Each of the consolidated financial statements included in or
incorporated by reference into the GTY SEC Filings (including, in each case,

statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC) and each fairly presents,
in all material respects, the consolidated financial position, results of
operations and cash flows of GTY as of the respective dates thereof and for
the respective periods indicated therein, except as otherwise noted therein
(subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to normal and recurring year-
end adjustments).

involving the GTY Parties, or affecting any of their assets, rights or
properties; (b) there are no material Orders to which the GTY Parties are
subject; and (c) each GTY Party has complied with, and is in compliance with
all applicable Laws, Orders and Permits applicable to the GTY Parties.

$562,277,933.00 Dollars in a trust account at UBS, maintained by
Continental Stock Transfer and Trust Company, acting as trustee (the " _Trust
Account_ ") invested in United States "government securities" within the
meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended,
having a maturity of 180 days or less, or in money market funds meeting
certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment
Company Act of 1940, as amended, that invest solely in United States
"government securities."

  



  

3.9 _Internal Accounting Controls_. GTY maintains a system of
internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurance in
all material respects that (i) transactions are executed in accordance with
management's general or specific authorizations, (ii) transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles and to maintain
asset accountability, and (iii) access to assets is permitted only in
accordance with management's general or specific authorization. GTY has in
place the "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined in Rules
13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) required in order for the Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of GTY to engage in the review
and evaluation process mandated by Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.
GTY's "disclosure controls and procedures" are reasonably designed to ensure
that material information (both financial and non-financial) relating to GTY
required to be disclosed in the reports that it files or submits under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and that such information
is accumulated and communicated to GTY's principal executive and principal
financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the
certifications of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of
GTY required by Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act with respect to such
reports.

  



  

3.10 _Listing and Maintenance Requirements_. GTY's Common Stock is
registered pursuant to the Exchange Act and is listed on NASDAQ, and GTY has
taken no action designed to terminate the registration of GTY Common Stock or
delisting GTY Common Stock from NASDAQ. Except as set forth on _Section 3.10
of the GTY Disclosure Schedule_ , GTY has not, in the two years preceding the
date hereof, received notice (written or oral) from NASDAQ which remains
unresolved to the effect that GTY is not in compliance with the listing or
maintenance requirements thereof. GTY is, and has no reason to believe that it
will not in the foreseeable future continue to be, in compliance with the
listing and maintenance requirements for continued listing of GTY's Common
Stock on NASDAQ.

nor does any GTY Party have Knowledge of any fact or circumstance,

and (ii) include a proxy statement (the " _Proxy Statement_ ") for the
purpose of soliciting proxies from GTY Shareholders to vote at the GTY

also constitute a prospectus pursuant to which the securities of Holdings
issuable in connection with the GTY Merger will be registered under the
Securities Act. GTY and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
have the Registration Statement declared effective by the SEC as promptly as
practicable after such filing, and GTY shall thereafter, in compliance
with the relevant requirements of the Securities Exchange Act, file and mail
or deliver the Proxy Statement to the GTY Shareholders. GTY shall advise the

notice thereof, of the respective times when any supplement or amendment has

for amendment of any of the Registration Statement or comments thereon and
responses thereto or requests by the SEC for additional information. The
Parties acknowledge that a substantial portion of the Registration Statement
and certain other forms, reports and other filings required to be made by GTY
under the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act in connection with
the Transaction (collectively,  " _Additional GTY Filings_ ") shall include
disclosure regarding the Company Parties and the Business, and
their management, operations and financial condition. Accordingly, the
Company agrees to, and agrees to cause the Company Parties to, as promptly as
reasonably practicable, provide GTY with all information concerning the eCivis
Holders and the Company Parties, the Business, their management, operations
and financial condition, in each case, that is reasonably required to be

GTY SEC Filing. The Company shall make, and shall cause the Company Parties
to make, their Affiliates, directors, officers, managers and employees

Registration Statement and Additional GTY Filings and responding in a timely
manner to comments thereto from the SEC. If, at any time prior to the
Closing, the Parties discover or become aware of any event, fact or
circumstance relating to the eCivis Holders, the Company Parties or the
Business, or any of their respective Affiliates, directors, officers,
managers or employees or their respective management, operations or financial
condition, which should be set forth in an amendment or a supplement to the
Registration Statement so that such documents would not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or failure to state a material fact necessary to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which they are
made, not misleading, such Person shall promptly inform the other Parties,
and the Parties shall cooperate reasonably in connection with preparing
and disseminating any such required amendment or supplement. GTY shall make
all necessary filings with respect to the Transaction under the Securities
Act, the Securities Exchange Act and applicable blue sky Laws and the rules
and regulations thereunder. GTY, acting through the GTY Board, shall include
in the Proxy Statement the recommendation of the GTY Board that the GTY
Shareholders vote in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and the approval
of the GTY Shareholder Voting Matters; _provided_ , _however_ , that the GTY
Board may withdraw or modify such recommendation if the GTY Board determines
in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that failure to do so
could be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations under applicable Law.

to Form 8-K (the " _Closing Form 8-K_ "). Prior to the Closing, the Parties
shall prepare a mutually agreeable press release announcing the consummation
of the Transaction (" _Closing Press Release_ "). Concurrently with the
Closing, GTY shall distribute the Closing Press Release, and as soon as
practicable thereafter, file the Closing Form 8-K with the SEC.

Stockholder_ ") a request that such eCivis Holder execute the written consent
of the eCivis Holders approving the Merger as provided in the Delaware

appraisal rights of the Delaware General Corporation Law. In connection with
such request, the Company will, through its board of directors, recommend to

directors thereafter to terminate or amend this Agreement to the extent
permitted by this Agreement and not prohibited of the Delaware General
Corporation Law. Within ten (10) Business Days after the date of this
Agreement, the Company will deliver to GTY, for review and comment, the

instruments as may be required or reasonably requested by any other Party to
consummate fully the Transaction and to effect the other purposes of this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements.

  



  

5.2 _D andO Indemnification_.

  



  

(a) From and after the Closing, GTY shall, subject to any change in

to be provided to each individual who becomes a director of any GTY Party
(the " _Covered Persons_ "), rights to indemnification, advancement of
expenses, exculpation from liability and directors' and officers' insurance
which are at least as favorable to such individuals as the rights to
advancement of expenses, exculpation from liability and directors' and
officers' insurance set forth in the Organizational Documents of the Company.

  



  

(b) For a period of six (6) years after the Closing, the GTY Parties
shall either maintain director and officer liability insurance or acquire a
director and officer liability run-off policy, which in either case shall
provide coverage for the individuals who were officers, directors or managers

coverage provided as of the date hereof under the policy or policies
maintained by the Company Parties for the benefit of such individuals.

  



  

(c) From and after the Closing, in the event any GTY Party or any of
its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other
Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of their assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,

5.3 _Incentive Plan_. As promptly as practicable, and in no event
more than 60 days, after the Closing, GTY shall establish the GTY
Equity Incentive Plan substantially in the form set forth on Exhibit E.
Holdings shall reserve and shall register on Form S-8 (or other comparable
registration) 500,000 shares pursuant to the GTY Equity Incentive Plan for
issuance of restricted stock or other equity-based awards to be granted with
time-based or performance-based vesting at or after the Closing to employees
who are employed in the Business. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in
this _Section 5.3_ or otherwise in this Agreement shall create any rights in
any employee or other Person not a party to this Agreement.

  



  

5.4 _Other Employee Matters_.

  



  

(a) During the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on
the first anniversary of the Closing Date, GTY shall, or shall cause
the Surviving Company to, provide to all employees of the Company Parties who
are employed by the Company Parties immediately prior to the Closing, to the
extent such employees remain employed by the Surviving Company during such
period (" _Company Employees "_), with base salaries or wage rates and target
cash bonus opportunities that are consistent with those provided to similarly
situated employees of the GTY Parties, and, to the extent accurately
disclosed on the _Company 's Disclosure Schedule_, that are in no event less
than their corresponding base salaries or wage rates and target cash bonus
opportunities as of immediately prior to the Closing. From and after the
Closing Date, GTY shall cause the Surviving Company to provide the Company
Employees with employee benefits (including defined contribution retirement
and welfare benefits, but excluding retention and change in control
bonuses, cash and equity-based long term incentive opportunities, defined
benefit pension, and nonqualified retirement benefits) that are consistent
with those provided to similarly situated employees of the GTY Parties, and,
to the extent accurately disclosed on the  _Company 's Disclosure Schedule,_
that are substantially similar in the aggregate to such employee benefits to
which such Company Employees were entitled as of immediately prior to the
Closing.

  



  

(b) To the extent that service is relevant for purposes of
eligibility and vesting and, with respect to vacation or paid-time-off
only, benefit accrual, under any employee benefit plan, program or
arrangement (other than any equity incentive or defined benefit pension plan)
established or maintained by the GTY Parties or by the Surviving Company
following the Closing Date for the benefit of Company Employees, such plan,
program or arrangement shall credit such Company Employees for service with
the Company on and prior to the Closing Date to the same extent and for the
same purpose as recognized by the Company prior to the Closing Date, except as
would cause a duplication of benefits or coverage for the same period of
service. In addition, for the plan year in which the Closing occurs, with
respect to any group health plan established or maintained by the GTY Parties
or by the Surviving Company following the Closing Date for the benefit of
Company Employees, GTY agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to: (i)
waive any pre-existing condition exclusions; and (ii) provide that any
covered expenses incurred on or before the Closing Date by any Company
Employee or by a covered dependent shall be taken into account for purposes
of satisfying applicable deductible coinsurance and maximum out of pocket
provisions after the Closing Date.

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this _Section 5.4_ ,
or the foregoing _Section 5.3_ shall (i) confer upon any Company Employee or
any other Person any rights or remedies (including any third-party beneficiary
rights) under this _Section 5.4_ , _Section 5.3_ , or this Agreement; (ii) be
interpreted or construed to confer upon the Company Employees any right with
respect to continuance of employment (or any term or condition of employment)
by the GTY Parties or by the Surviving Company, nor shall this
Agreement interfere in any way with the right of the GTY Parties or the
Surviving Company to terminate any Person\'s employment at any time and for
any or no reason; (iii) interfere in any way with the right of the GTY Parties
or the Surviving Company to amend, terminate or otherwise discontinue or
modify any or all benefit or compensation plans, programs, agreements,
arrangements, practices or policies at any time; or (iv) be deemed to
establish, amend, terminate or modify any Company Benefit Plan or any other

policy.

  



  

5.5 _Tax Matters_. References to the Company in this _Section 5.5_
include the Surviving Company.

  



  

(a) _Tax Returns_.

  



  

(i) The eCivis Holders' Representative shall (A) at the sole cost
and expense of the Company Parties, prepare and timely file, or cause the
applicable Company Party to prepare and timely file, all Tax Returns of the
Company and each Subsidiary of the Company due (after taking into account all
appropriate extensions) on or before the Closing Date (the " _Pre-Closing Tax
Returns_ ") and shall pay, or cause the relevant Company Party to pay, all
Taxes that are shown as due and payable on any Pre-Closing Tax Return; (B) at
the sole cost and expense of the eCivis Holders, prepare all federal, state
and local income Tax Returns of the Company for any Pre-Closing Tax Period
due after the Closing Date (taking into account all validly obtained
extensions) (the " _S Corporation Returns_ "). All S Corporation Returns
shall be prepared in accordance with existing procedures, practices, and
accounting methods of the Company and its Subsidiaries, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law. All Deductions shall be reported on the income
Tax Returns of the Company and its Subsidiaries for the taxable period that
includes the Closing Date to the maximum extent permitted by applicable Law.
Each S Corporation Return shall be submitted to GTY for GTY's review at
least ten (10) Business Days prior to the due date (including extensions) of
such Tax Return. The eCivis Holders' Representative will consider in good
faith all reasonable comments made by GTY and received by the eCivis Holders'
Representative no later than five (5) Business Days prior to filing. GTY
shall cause the Company Parties to execute and file all S Corporation
Returns prepared by the eCivis Holders' Representative in accordance with
this _Section 5.5(a)_.

(ii) GTY shall cause the relevant Company Party to prepare and timely
file, all Tax Returns (other than S Corporation Returns) of the
Company Parties which are first due after the Closing Date (taking into
account all validly obtained extensions) (the " _GTY Prepared Returns_ "). To
the extent that a GTY Prepared Return relates to a Pre-Closing Tax Period or a
Straddle Period (each, a  " _Buyer Return_ "), such Tax Return shall be
prepared in a manner consistent with existing procedures and practices and
accounting methods (unless otherwise required by Law). Each Buyer Return shall
be submitted by GTY to the eCivis Holders' Representative (together with
schedules, statements and supporting documentation) for the eCivis Holders'
Representative's review and approval at least twenty (20) Business Days prior
to the due date (including extensions) of such Buyer Return. If the eCivis
Holders' Representative objects to any item on any such Buyer Return, it will,
within twenty (20) days after delivery of such Buyer Return, notify GTY in
writing it so objects. If a notice of objection is duly delivered, GTY and the
eCivis Holders' Representative will negotiate in good faith and use their
reasonable best efforts to resolve such items. If GTY and the eCivis Holders'
Representative are unable to reach such agreement within ten (10) Business
Days after receipt by GTY of such notice, the disputed items will be resolved
by the Accounting Arbitrator in accordance with the provisions of _Section
1.5(d)_ , and any determination by the Accounting Arbitrator will be final
and binding on the Parties for purposes of the indemnification provisions of
this Agreement (except to the extent of any subsequent adjustment by a taxing
authority). The Accounting Arbitrator will resolve any disputed items within
twenty (20) days of having the item referred to it (or as soon as practicable
thereafter) pursuant to such procedures as it may require. If the Accounting
Arbitrator is unable to resolve any disputed items before the due date
for such Tax Return, the Tax Return will be filed as prepared by GTY and then
amended to reflect the Accounting Arbitrator's resolution. The costs, fees
and expenses of the Accounting Arbitrator will be allocated by GTY and the
eCivis Holders' Representative in the same method as set forth in _Section
1.5(d)_.

  



  

(b) _Cooperation_. GTY, Holdings, the Company, and the eCivis
Holders' Representative shall, upon receiving a written request from the
other party, (i) reasonably assist with the preparation and timely filing of
any Tax Return of any Company Party for a taxable period or portion thereof
that ends on or prior to the Closing Date; (ii) reasonably assist in any audit
of other Proceeding with respect to Taxes or Tax Returns of any Company Party
(whether or not a Tax Contest) that involves a taxable period or portion
thereof ending on or prior to the Closing Date; (iii) reasonably make
available any information, records or other documents relating to any
Taxes or Tax Returns of any Company Party in such Person's possession; (iv)
provide any information necessary and reasonably requested by GTY in writing
to allow GTY or any relevant Company Party to comply with any information
reporting or withholding requirements contained in the Code to compute the
amount of payroll or other employment Taxes due with respect to any payment
made in connection with this Agreement; (v) reasonably assist with obtaining
any Tax Refunds; (vi) make employees available on a mutual convenient basis
to provide explanation of any materials provided hereunder; and (vii) provide
certificates or forms, and timely execute any Tax Return, that are necessary
or appropriate to establish an exemption for (or reduction in) any Transfer
Tax. The requesting party of information pursuant to this _Section 5.5(b)_
will reimburse the other party for all reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses related to such cooperation.

  



  

(c) _Straddle Period_. In the case of Taxes that are payable with
respect to a Straddle Period, the portion of any such Taxes that are
treated as Pre-Closing Taxes for purposes of this Agreement will be:

  



    

-51- 
--- 

 



    



  

(i) in the case of Taxes (i) based upon, or related to, income,
receipts, profits, wages, capital or net worth, (ii) imposed in
connection with the sale, transfer or assignment of property, or (iii)
required to be withheld, deemed equal to the amount which would be payable if
the taxable year ended with the Closing Date; and

  



  

(ii) in the case of other Taxes, deemed to be the amount of such
Taxes for the entire period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which
is the number of days in the period ending on the Closing Date and the
denominator of which is the number of days in the entire period; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that any exemptions, allowances or deductions that are determined
on an annual or periodic basis (such as deductions for depreciation or real
estate Taxes) shall be apportioned on a daily basis.

  



  

(d) _Post-Closing Covenants_. Without the prior written consent of
the eCivis Holders' Representative (which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed, or conditioned), GTY (or any Affiliate thereof, including
Holdings) shall not and shall not cause any Company Party or any of their
Subsidiaries or Affiliates to (i) amend, refile or modify any Tax Return for a
Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period; (ii) file a Tax Return for a Pre-
Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period in a jurisdiction where the Company, the
GTY Surviving Company, the Surviving Company or any of their Subsidiaries, as
applicable, did not file such Tax Return for such period, (iii) make any
voluntary disclosures with respect to Taxes of any Company Party or any of
their Subsidiaries for a Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period, change
any accounting method or adopt any convention that shifts taxable income of
any Company Party or their Subsidiaries from a period beginning (or deemed to
begin) after the Closing Date to a taxable period (or portion thereof)
ending on or prior to the Closing Date or shifts deductions or losses of any
Company Party or any of their Subsidiaries from a taxable period (or portion
thereof) beginning on or prior to the Closing Date to a period beginning (or
deemed to begin) after the Closing Date. None of Holdings, GTY or any of
their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates shall make or cause to be made an
election under Section 336 or Section 338 of the Code or any similar
provision of foreign, state or local law in respect of the Transaction.

  



  

(e) _Transfer Taxes_. All federal, state, local, or non-U.S.
transfer, excise, documentary, sales, use, ad valorem, stamp, registration,
value added, registration, recording, property and other such Taxes or fees
(including any related penalties and interest) applicable to, imposed upon,
or incurred in connection with this Agreement (including any real property
transfer Tax and any other similar Tax) (" _Transfer Taxes_ ") will be borne
and timely paid 50% by GTY and 50% by the eCivis Holders when due. The eCivis
Holders' Representative will prepare and timely file any Tax Return or other
document with respect to such Transfer Taxes or fees (and GTY and Holdings
will execute any such Tax Returns to the extent required under applicable
Law).

  



  

(f) _Tax Refunds_.

  



  

(i) Subject to _Section 5.5(f)(iii)_ , all refunds of Taxes (refunds
of Transfer Taxes shall be allocated in the same manner as Transfer Taxes are
allocated under _Section 5.5(e)_ ) of any Company Party for any Pre-Closing
Tax Period (or portion of a Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date as
determined in accordance with the same principles provided for in _Section
5.5(c)_ ) (whether in the form of cash received from the applicable
Governmental Body or a direct credit or offset against Taxes) and any
interest received thereon, including overpayments of estimated Tax (each, a "
_Tax Refund_ ") shall be for the account of the eCivis Holders.

  



    

-52- 
--- 

 



    



  

(ii) Promptly upon the written request by the eCivis Holders'
Representative, GTY will cause the relevant entity (e.g., Holdings, GTY, a
Company Party or any of their Subsidiaries or Affiliates) to file for any such
Tax Refund. Promptly upon receipt by the Surviving Company, GTY or any of
their Affiliates or Subsidiaries of any such Tax Refund, GTY shall pay the
amount of such Tax Refund (without interest other than interest received from
the Governmental Body), net of (i) any Taxes imposed on the Surviving Company,
GTY or any of their Affiliates or Subsidiaries that would not have been so
imposed but for the receipt of such Tax Refund; and (ii) any reasonable, out-
of-pocket expenses that GTY, a Company Party, or any of their Affiliates
incurred in obtaining such Tax Refund. The net amount due to the eCivis
Holders shall be payable ten (10) days after receipt of the refund from the
applicable Governmental Body (or, if the refund is in the form of direct
credit or offset, ten (10) days after filing the Tax Return claiming such
credit or offset).

  



  

(iii) Nothing in this _Section 5.5(f)_ shall require that GTY make any
payment with respect to any refund for a Tax (and such refunds shall be for
the benefit of GTY or the applicable Company Party) that is with respect to
(A) any refund of Tax that is the result of the carrying back of any net
operating loss or other Tax attribute or Tax credit incurred in a Post-Closing
Tax Period (or portion of any Straddle Period beginning after the Closing
Date); or (B) any Tax Refund in respect of a Tax which was paid by GTY,
any Company Party or their respective Affiliates after the Closing Date to
the extent (i) the eCivis Holders have not indemnified and will not indemnify
GTY or any Company Party for such Taxes and (ii) such Tax did not reduce the
Merger Consideration.

  



  

(iv) The Parties agree to treat any payment made pursuant to this
_Section 5.5(f)_ as an adjustment to the Merger Consideration for U.S.
federal, state, local and non-U.S. income Tax purposes.

  



  

(g) _Tax Contests_.

  



  

(i) Except with respect to any income Taxes or income Tax Return of
any Company Party for a Pre-Closing Tax Period (a " _Pre-Closing Income Tax
Matter_ ") GTY shall control, or cause the applicable Company Party to
control, the conduct of any audit or other Proceeding relating to Taxes or
Tax Returns of any Company Party or that could impact the determination of any
Tax Refund (a " _Tax Contest_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that the eCivis
Holders' Representative, at the sole cost and expense of the eCivis Holders,
shall have the right to participate in any such Tax Contest to the extent it
relates to a Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period or a Tax Refund (each,
a " _Buyer Contest_ "). GTY shall not settle any Buyer Contest without the
prior written consent of the eCivis Holders' Representative (not to be
unreasonably withheld, delayed, or conditioned). GTY agrees to give prompt
written notice to the eCivis Holders' Representative of the receipt of any
written notice by GTY, Holdings, any Company Party or any of their respective
Subsidiaries or Affiliates which relates to a Buyer Contest or a Pre-Closing
Income Tax Matter. At the request of the eCivis Holders' Representative, GTY
shall deliver to the eCivis Holders' Representative copies of all relevant
notices and documents (including court papers) received by GTY, the Company,
the Surviving Company or any of their Affiliates or Subsidiaries in connection

(ii) With respect to a Tax Contest that is a Pre-Closing Income Tax
Matter, the applicable GTY Party shall execute a power of attorney so as to
allow the eCivis Holders' Representative to control such Tax Contest at the
sole expense of the eCivis Holders' Representative (on behalf of the eCivis
Holders); provided, however, that GTY shall have the right to participate in
any such Tax Contest at its sole expense. The eCivis Holders' Representative
shall not settle any such Tax Contest without the prior written consent of
GTY (not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned).

  



  

(h) _Post-Closing Taxes_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, the eCivis Holders shall not be responsible for,
and shall not have any indemnification obligations hereunder with respect to,
any Taxes of any Company Party (including the Surviving Company) that are
attributable to a taxable period or portion of a Straddle Period beginning
after the Closing Date other than Taxes subject to indemnification pursuant
to _Section 7.1(a)_ (subject to the limitations on indemnification in _Article
7_ ) that are attributable to a breach of a representation or warranty
contained in _Sections 2.9(j), (k) or (l)_.

  



  

(i) _Tax Treatment_. For U.S. federal and state income tax
purposes, the Parties to this Agreement intend to treat the GTY Merger,
together with the Merger and other transactions to be consummated as part of
the Roll-Up Transactions as a contribution of eCivis Shares by the eCivis
Holders to Holdings described in Section 351(a) of the Code (the " _Tax
Treatment_ "). Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, each Party to
this Agreement hereby acknowledges and agrees that (i) such Party will not
take any position on any Tax Return, or take any other Tax reporting position
or action, that is inconsistent with the Tax Treatment, except as otherwise
required by a "determination" as defined in Code Section 1313; and (ii) such
Party will use its best efforts (A) to cause the GTY Merger, together with
the Merger and other transactions to be consummated as part of the Roll-
Up Transactions to be treated as a transaction described in Section 351(a) of
the Code, and (B) to not take or permit any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates
to take any action that could reasonably be expected to prevent or impede the
GTY Merger, together with the Merger and other transactions to be consummated
as part of the Roll-Up Transactions from being treated as part of a
transaction described in Section 351(a) of the Code.

Representative acknowledge and agree that no eCivis Holder or

indirect ownership of any GTY Common Stock, or rights thereto, issued as

(after giving effect to any waiver, tolling, mitigation or extension thereof).

  



  

(iii) Any claim related to any intentional misrepresentation or fraud
may be made at any time without limitation.

  



  

Notwithstanding the foregoing, any claim made under and in accordance with
this _Article 7_ prior to the expiration of the applicable period set forth
above shall survive until such claim is finally resolved.

  



  

(b) _Threshold_. Subject to the other limitations set forth in this
Agreement, including this _Section 7.2_ , no amount shall be payable by any

7.3 _Notice of Loss; Third-Party Claims_.

  



    

-59- 
--- 

 



    



  

(a) If a GTY Indemnitee or a eCivis Holder Indemnitee (the "
_Indemnified Party_ ") intends to make claim for Losses under this _Article
7_ , then the Indemnified Party shall give the party or parties obligated to
provide indemnification pursuant to this _Article 7_ (the " _Indemnifying
Party_ ") written notice (a " _Breach Notice_ ") of such Indemnifiable Matter
which the Indemnified Party has determined has given or would give rise to a
right of indemnification under this Agreement within thirty (30) days of such
determination, setting forth (i) a brief description of the nature of
the Indemnifiable Matter, (ii) the underlying representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement alleged to have been breached and the facts then known
as it relates to the Indemnifiable Matter, (iii) the total amount of the
actual out-of-pocket Loss or the anticipated potential Loss (including any
costs or expenses which have been or may be reasonably incurred in connection
therewith), if known and quantifiable; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the
Indemnifying Party from its obligations under this _Article 7_ , except to
the extent that such failure shall have materially adversely affected the
ability of the Indemnifying Party to defend against or reduce its or the
Indemnified Party's liability. The Indemnifying Party shall have thirty (30)
days after receipt of the Breach Notice to dispute the contents of the Breach
Notice. If the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party are unable to
resolve the disputes to the Breach Notice, if any, within thirty (30) days of
the Indemnifying Party's receipt of the Breach Notice, the Indemnified Party
shall be free to pursue such remedies as may be available to the Indemnified
Party on the terms and subject to the provisions of this Agreement.

  



  

(b) If an Indemnified Party receives notice of any Proceeding with
respect to an Indemnifiable Matter which may give rise to a claim for Losses
under this _Article 7_ (a " _Third Party Claim_ "), within thirty (30) days of
the receipt of such notice, the Indemnified Party shall give the Indemnifying
Party notice of such Third Party Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying
Party from its obligations under this _Article 7_ , except to the extent that
such failure shall have materially adversely affected the ability of the
Indemnifying Party to defend against or reduce its or the Indemnified Party's
liability. The Indemnifying Party shall have the right, at its option, by
written notice to the Indemnified Party, to assume the entire control of the
defense, compromise or settlement of the Third Party Claim, and shall be
entitled to appoint a recognized and reputable counsel to be the lead counsel
in connection with such defense that is reasonably satisfactory to the
Indemnified Party. If the Indemnifying Party elects to assume the defense of a
Third Party Claim:

  



  

(i) the Indemnifying Party shall diligently and in good faith defend
such Third Party Claim and shall keep the Indemnified Party
reasonably informed of the status of such defense;

  



  

(ii) the Indemnified Party shall cooperate with the Indemnifying
Party in any such defense, compromise or settlement thereof,
including, without limitation, the selection of counsel, and the Indemnified
Party shall make available to the Indemnifying Party all information and
documents related to such Third Party Claim; and

  



  

(iii) the Indemnified Party (A) may participate in such defense and
retain one law firm reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party at the
Indemnifying Party's expense if the Indemnified Party has been advised by
outside legal counsel that there exists a conflict of interest between the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party or that there are one or more
legal defenses available to the Indemnified Party which are different from or
additional to those available to the Indemnifying Party or (B) may
participate in such defense at the Indemnified Party's expense in all other
circumstances.

  



    

-60- 
--- 

 



    



  

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 7.3_ , the
Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to assume or conduct the defense of
any Third-Party Claim (without the prior written consent of the Indemnified
Party, in its sole discretion) if (i) such Third-Party Claim relates to or
arises in connection with any criminal action, subpoena, criminal
investigative demand, criminal investigation or criminal proceeding of a
Governmental Body, (ii) such Third-Party Claim seeks an injunction or
equitable relief against any Indemnified Party, (iii) the Indemnifying Party
has failed or is failing to defend in good faith such Third-Party Claim, (iv)
the assumption of the defense of the Third-Party Claim would, in the good
faith judgment of the Indemnified Party, give rise to conflicts of interest,
(v) the assumption of the defense of the Third-Party Claim would have, in the
good faith judgment of the Indemnified Party, a material adverse effect
on the business relationship between the Indemnified Party and any Persons
with whom it has material business dealings, (vi) settlement of, or an
adverse judgment with respect to, the Third-Party Claim is, in the good faith
judgment of the Indemnified Party, likely to establish a precedential custom
or practice adverse to the continuing business interests of the Indemnified
Party, (vii) the Indemnifying Party's counsel is not reasonably satisfactory
to the Indemnified Party, or (viii) the Indemnifying Party has not agreed and
acknowledged in writing for the benefit of the Indemnified Party its
unqualified obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party as provided
hereunder with respect to such Third-Party Claim, subject to the limitations
set forth in this _Article 7_. If the Indemnifying Party (i) does not elect
to defend the Indemnified Party against a Third-Party Claim, whether by
not giving the Indemnified Party timely notice of its desire to so defend or
otherwise, (ii) after assuming the defense of a Third-Party Claim, fails to
take steps necessary to defend diligently such Third-Party Claim or (iii) is
not entitled to defend the Indemnified Party against a Third-Party Claim
pursuant to the first sentence of this _Section 7.3_ , the Indemnified
Party shall have the right, but not the obligation to, assume such defense
and shall have the sole power to direct and control such defense, with
counsel of its choosing it being understood that the Indemnified Party's right
to indemnification for a Third-Party Claim (including the payment of the
reasonable fees and expenses of the Indemnified Party's counsel by the
Indemnifying Party) shall not be adversely affected by assuming the defense
of such Third-Party Claim. The Indemnifying Party may enter into a settlement
or consent to any judgment without the consent of the Indemnified Party so
long as (i) such settlement or judgment involves monetary damages only which
are indemnifiable in full by the Indemnifying Party and such Indemnifying
Party has funded the payment of such monetary damages in full, (ii) a term of
the settlement or judgment is that the Person or Persons asserting such
Third-Party Claim unconditionally release all Indemnified Parties from all
liability with respect to such claim and (iii) such settlement does not
include any statement or admission of fact regarding culpability of, or
failure to act by or on behalf of, the Indemnified Party; otherwise the
consent of the Indemnified Party shall be required in order to enter into any
settlement of, or consent to the entry of a judgment with respect to, any
Third-Party Claim, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed. If the Indemnifying Party elects to assume
control of the defense of a Third-Party Claim in accordance with this
_Section 7.3_ , the Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ counsel
separate from counsel employed by the Indemnifying Party in any such action
and to participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such
counsel employed by the Indemnified Party shall be at the expense of the
Indemnified Party.

  



  

(c) To the extent that there is an inconsistency between _Section
7.3_ and _Section 5.5_ as it relates to a Tax matter, the provisions of
_Section 5.5_ shall govern.

  



    

-61- 
--- 

 



    



  

7.4 _Other Indemnification Matters_.

  



  

(a) For purposes of determining (i) whether there has been any
inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty (ii) the amount of
Losses resulting from any such inaccuracy in or breach of any representation
or warranty in _Section 2.6(a)_ and _Section 2.6(c)(x)_ ), all qualifications
or exceptions in any representation or warranty relating to or referring to
the terms "material",  "materiality", "in all material respects", "Material
Adverse Effect" or any similar term or phrase shall be disregarded, it being
the understanding of the Parties that for purposes of determining liability
under this _Article 7_ , the representations and warranties contained in this
Agreement shall be read as if such terms and phrases were not included in
them.

  



  

(b) For purposes of determining the amount of any Loss for which
indemnification is provided by an Indemnifying Party, the amount of such Loss
shall be reduced by the Indemnification Tax Benefits actually realized, if
any, by an Indemnified Party (or any of its Affiliates) arising from the
facts or circumstances giving rise to such Losses in the year in which such
Loss occurs or the subsequent two taxable years. If an Indemnified Party
realizes an Indemnification Tax Benefit in any of the two years following the
occurrence of such Loss, the Indemnified Party shall pay the Indemnifying
Party the amount of such Indemnification Tax Benefit. For this purpose, a
Person shall be deemed to recognize a Tax benefit (" _Indemnification Tax
Benefit_ ") with respect to a taxable year if, and to the extent that, the
Person's liability for Taxes for such taxable year, calculated by excluding
any Tax items attributed to the Losses, exceeds the Person's actual liability
for Taxes for such taxable year, calculated by taking into account any Tax
items attributed to the Losses.

  



  

7.5 _Release of Escrow Amount from Escrow_.

  



  

(a) Subject to the terms of the Escrow Agreement, in the event that
the GTY Indemnitees are entitled to indemnification from the eCivis
Holders pursuant to this _Article 7_ , the Escrow Agent shall, upon the
receipt of a joint written instruction from GTY and the eCivis Holders'
Representative, or written instruction from GTY attaching a final non-
appealable court order from a court of competent jurisdiction setting forth
the amount of such Loss, release and transfer to the GTY Indemnitees pursuant
to this _Article 7_ : either (x) an amount in cash equal to 100% of such
Loss, to the extent the GTY Indemnitees have suffered out-of-pocket
Losses, or (y) to the extent such Losses are not out-of-pocket Losses
suffered by any GTY Indemnitee, an amount in cash equal to 60% of such Loss
and the number of Escrow Shares equal to the lesser of:

  



  

(i) that number of Escrow Shares then held in the Escrow Account
equal to (A) the amount of 40% of the Loss, _divided by_ (B) the 30-Day VWAP,
calculated as of the date of such payment; and

  



  

(ii) that number of Escrow Shares then held in the Escrow Account
equal to (A) the amount of 40% the Loss _divided by_ (B) $10.00, in each
case, subject to the Escrow Agreement.

  



    

-62- 
--- 

 



    



  

Notwithstanding, the foregoing, the eCivis Holders shall have the right, but
not the obligation, to (A) pay to any GTY Indemnitee, in cash from the
remaining Cash Escrow Amount, an amount equal to the value of the Escrow
Shares that otherwise would be released and delivered to such GTY Indemnitee
in respect of such Loss or (B) to the extent no GTY Indemnitee has suffered
out-of-pocket Losses, pay to any GTY Indemnitee, in Escrow Shares
(calculated as set forth above), an amount equal to the cash that would
otherwise be released from the Escrow Account and delivered to such GTY
Indemnitee in respect of such Loss.

  



  

(b) Concurrently with any such transfer of Escrow Shares to any GTY
Indemnitee, eCivis Holders' Representative shall take all actions
reasonably requested by GTY to effect such transfer, including delivering
such certificates (if the Escrow Shares are certificated) and
related transfer powers and indemnities by the eCivis Holders to the GTY
Indemnitees and providing customary representations as to
organization, existence and good standing of the eCivis Holders, the legal

(iii) Each of the Parties hereto acknowledges that the Expense
Reimbursement Payment, as and when payable pursuant to this _Section 8.2_
, is not intended to be a penalty, but rather is liquidated damages in a
reasonable amount that will compensate the party receiving such amount in the
circumstances in which such amount is due and payable, for the efforts and
resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this
Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, which amount would
otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision.

10.8 _Governing Law_. This Agreement and any claim, controversy or
dispute arising out of or related to this Agreement or the interpretation and
enforcement of the rights and duties of the Parties, whether arising at law or
in equity, whether in contract, tort, under statute or otherwise, shall be
governed by and construed in accordance with the domestic Laws of the State of

limitations period applicable to any such claim, controversy or dispute,
but without regard to any borrowing statute that would result in the

10.9 _Amendments and Waivers_. No amendment of any provision of this
Agreement shall be valid unless the same shall be in writing and signed by
the Parties. No waiver by any Party of any provision of this Agreement or any
default, misrepresentation, or breach of warranty or covenant hereunder,
whether intentional or not, shall be valid unless the same shall be in writing
and signed by the Party making such waiver nor shall such waiver be deemed to
extend to any prior or subsequent default, misrepresentation, or breach of
warranty or covenant hereunder or affect in any way any rights arising by
virtue of any prior or subsequent such occurrence.

  



  

10.10 _Specific Performance_. Each of the Parties hereby
acknowledges and agrees that the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement are unique and irreparable damage would occur if any of the
provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with
their specific terms and in the event of breach of this Agreement by a Party,
the non-breaching Party would not be adequately compensated in all cases by
monetary damages alone. Accordingly, in addition to any other right or remedy
to which the non-breaching Party may be entitled, it shall be entitled to
enforce any provision of this Agreement by a decree of specific performance
and to temporary, preliminary and permanent injunctive relief to prevent
breaches or threatened breaches of any of the provisions of this
Agreement, without posting any bond or other undertaking.

  



  

10.11 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this
Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of
Law, or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement
shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or
legal substance of the Transaction is not affected in any manner materially
adverse to any Party. Upon such determination that any term or other
provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the Parties
hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect
the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in a mutually
acceptable manner in order that the Transaction be consummated as originally
contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

  



  

10.12 _Construction_. The Disclosure Schedules, Exhibits and other
attachments to this Agreement shall be construed with and as an integral part
of this Agreement to the same extent as if the same had been set forth
verbatim herein. Unless the context of this Agreement clearly
requires otherwise, (a) references to the plural include the singular, the
singular the plural, the part the whole, (b) references to any gender include
all genders, (c) "including" has the inclusive meaning frequently identified
with the phrase "but not limited to" and "without limitation", (d) references
to "hereunder" or "herein" relate to this Agreement as a whole, (e) the non-
capitalized word "day" means calendar day, (f) the word "extent" in the
phrase "to the extent" shall mean the degree to which a subject or other thing
extends and such phrase shall not mean simply "if", (g) except as otherwise
specifically provided herein, all references in this Agreement to any statute
include the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, in each case as
amended, re-enacted, consolidated or replaced from time to time and in the
case of any such amendment, re-enactment, consolidation or replacement,
reference herein to a particular provision shall be read as referring to such
amended, re-enacted, consolidated or replaced provision and also include,
unless the context otherwise requires, all applicable guidelines, bulletins
or policies made in connection therewith, (h) except as
otherwise specifically provided herein, all references in this Agreement to
any agreement (including this Agreement), document or instrument mean such
agreement, document or instrument as amended, supplemented, qualified,
modified, varied, restated or replaced from time to time in accordance with
the terms thereof and, unless otherwise specified therein, includes all
schedules, annexes and exhibits attached thereto, (i) except as otherwise
specifically provided herein, all references in this Agreement to the Company
shall be deemed to include the Company and its Subsidiaries and (j) the
Parties have participated jointly in negotiating and drafting this Agreement,
and in the event that an ambiguity or a question of intent or interpretation
arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the
Parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
disfavoring any Party by virtue of the authorship of any provision of this
Agreement. Section, subsection, Schedule and Exhibit references are to this
Agreement unless otherwise specified. Capitalized terms set forth in the
Exhibits and Disclosure Schedules attached hereto shall have the same
meanings as set forth in this Agreement, unless defined otherwise in such
Exhibit or Disclosure Schedule. This Agreement shall not be interpreted or
construed to require any Person to take any action, or fail to take any
action, if to do so would violate any applicable Law. No summary of this
Agreement prepared by any party shall affect the meaning or interpretation of

10.13 _Currency_. All monetary amounts in this Agreement, unless
otherwise expressly set forth herein, are expressed in U.S. Dollars.

  



  

10.14 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. Each Party hereby waives their
respective rights to a trial by jury of any claim or cause of action based
upon or arising out or related to this Agreement, any Ancillary Agreement or
the Transaction in any action, Proceeding or other litigation of any type
brought by any Party against any other Party or any Affiliate of any other
such Party, whether with respect to contract claims, tort claims or otherwise.
The Parties agree that any such claim or cause of action shall be tried by a
court trial without a jury. Without limiting the foregoing, the Parties
further agree that their respective right to a trial by jury is waived by
operation of this section as to any action, counterclaim or other Proceeding
which seeks, in whole or in part, to challenge the validity or enforceability
of this Agreement, any Ancillary Agreement or any provision hereof or
thereof. This waiver shall apply to any subsequent amendments, renewals,
supplements or modifications to this Agreement and any Ancillary Agreement.

  



  

10.15 _Exclusive Venue_. The Parties agree that all disputes, legal
actions, suits and Proceedings arising out of or relating to this Agreement,
any Ancillary Agreement or the Transaction must be brought exclusively in any
New York state or federal court located in the Borough of Manhattan in New
York City or in any state or federal appellate court therein (collectively
the " _Designated Courts_ "). Each Party hereby consents and submits to the
exclusive jurisdiction of the Designated Courts. No legal action, suit or
Proceeding with respect to this Agreement, any Ancillary Agreement or the
Transaction may be brought in any other forum. Each Party hereby irrevocably
waives all claims of immunity from jurisdiction and any objection which such
Party may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit, action or
Proceeding in any designated court, including any right to object on the
basis that any dispute, action, suit or Proceeding brought in the Designated
Courts has been brought in an improper or inconvenient forum or venue. Each
of the Parties also agrees that delivery of any process, summons, notice
or document to a Party hereof in compliance with _Section 10.7_ of this
Agreement shall be effective service of process for any action, suit or
Proceeding in a designated court with respect to any matters to which the
Parties have submitted to jurisdiction as set forth above.

10.16 _Trust Account Waiver_. Each of the Company and the eCivis
Holders' Representative acknowledges that GTY has established the Trust
Account for the benefit of its public shareholders, which holds proceeds of
its initial public offering. For and in consideration of GTY entering into
this Agreement and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, each of the Company and the
eCivis Holders' Representative, for itself and the affiliates it has the
authority to bind, hereby agrees it does not now and shall not at any time
hereafter have any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any
assets in the Trust Account (or distributions therefrom to GTY's public
shareholders), and hereby waives any claims it has or may have at any time
against or with respect to the Trust Account (or distributions therefrom to
GTY's public shareholders) as a result of, or arising out of, any
discussions, contracts or agreements (including this Agreement) among GTY and
the Company or the Company's shareholders and will not seek recourse against
the Trust Account (or distributions therefrom to GTY's public shareholders)
for any reason whatsoever.

  



  

 _10.17 Non-Recourse_. This Agreement may only be enforced against,

that are expressly named as parties to this Agreement (and the eCivis
Holders) and any other agreements or deliveries referenced herein. Except to
the extent named as a party to this Agreement and any other agreements or

shareholder, member, partner, manager, director, officer, employee,
Affiliate, agent or advisor of any party to this Agreement or any
Subsidiary of GTY will have any liability (whether in contract, tort, equity
or otherwise) for any of the representations, warranties,
covenants, agreements or other obligations or liabilities of any of the
parties to this Agreement and any other agreements or deliveries
referenced herein or for any action, suit, claim, investigation, or
proceeding based upon, arising out of or related to this Agreement and any
other agreements or deliveries referenced herein.

Agreement and the Transaction, to take all actions on behalf of the eCivis

all actions necessary or appropriate in the judgment of eCivis Holders'
Representative for the accomplishment of the foregoing. More specifically,
eCivis Holders' Representative shall have the authority to make all decisions

eCivis Holders' Representative, and eCivis Holders' Representative shall
receive no compensation for its services. Notices or communications to or

(b) eCivis Holders' Representative shall not be liable for any act
done or omitted hereunder as eCivis Holders' Representative while acting in
good faith and not in a manner constituting gross negligence or willful
misconduct, and any act done or omitted pursuant to the advice of counsel
shall be conclusive evidence of such good faith. The eCivis Holders shall
severally indemnify eCivis Holders' Representative and hold eCivis Holders'
Representative harmless against any Adverse Consequences incurred without
gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of eCivis Holders'
Representative and arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or
administration of eCivis Holders' Representative's duties hereunder.

  



  

(c) A decision, act, consent or instruction of eCivis Holders'
Representative shall constitute a decision of all eCivis Holders and shall be
final, binding and conclusive upon all eCivis Holders. GTY is hereby entitled
to rely on all statements, representations and decisions of eCivis Holders'
Representative and shall have no liability to the Company Parties, eCivis
Holders and eCivis Holders' Representative in connection with any actions
taken or not taken in reliance on such statements, representations and
decisions of eCivis Holders' Representative.

warrants that eCivis Holders' Representative has the legal capacity to
execute and deliver this Agreement and to perform his respective obligations
hereunder, and this Agreement has been duly and validly executed and

authorization, execution and delivery thereof by the other Parties,
constitutes the legal and binding obligations of eCivis Holders'
Representative, enforceable against eCivis Holders' Representative in
accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and similar Laws affecting
creditors generally and by the availability of equitable remedies.

10.19 _Waiver of Conflicts_. Recognizing that LKP Global Law, LLP ("
_LKP_ ") has acted as legal counsel to the Company Parties, certain of the
direct and indirect holders of shares of Capital Stock of the Company and
certain of their respective Affiliates prior to date hereof, and that LKP
intends to act as legal counsel to certain of the direct and indirect holders
of shares of Common Stock and their respective Affiliates (which will no
longer include the Company Parties) after the Closing, each of GTY,
Merger Sub and the Company hereby waive, on its own behalf and agrees to
cause its Affiliates, Holdings, the Surviving Corporation and their
Subsidiaries to waive, any conflicts that may arise in connection with LKP
representing any direct or indirect holders of the shares of Capital Stock of
the Company or their Affiliates after the Closing as such representation may
relate to GTY, Merger Sub, Holdings, the Company, the Surviving Corporation
and their Subsidiaries or the Transaction. In addition, all
communications involving attorney-client confidences between direct and
indirect holders of shares of Capital Stock of the Company, the
Company Parties and their respective Affiliates, on the one hand, and LKP, on
the other hand, relating to the negotiation, documentation and consummation
of the Transaction shall be deemed to be attorney-client confidences that
belong solely to the direct and indirect holders of shares of Capital Stock
of the Company and their respective Affiliates (and not the Company, GTY,
Holdings, the Surviving Corporation or their respective Subsidiaries).
Accordingly, GTY, Holdings, the Surviving Corporation and their Subsidiaries
shall not have access to any such communications or to the files of LKP
relating to such engagement from and after the Effective Time. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, from and after the Effective Time,
(a) the direct and indirect holders of shares of Capital Stock of the Company
and their respective Affiliates (and not the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries) shall be the sole holders of the attorney-client privilege with
respect to such engagement, and none of the Surviving Corporation or its
Subsidiaries shall be a holder thereof, (b) to the extent that files of LKP in
respect of such engagement constitute property of the client, only the direct
and indirect holders of shares of Capital Stock of the Company and their
respective Affiliates (and not the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries) shall hold such property rights and (c) LKP shall have no duty
whatsoever to reveal or disclose any such attorney-client communications or
files to the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries by reason of
any attorney-client relationship between LKP and the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or otherwise. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a
dispute arises between the GTY, the Surviving Company and the Company and
their respective Affiliates, on the one hand, and a third party other than
the eCivis Holders (solely in their capacity as equityholders of the Company),
on the other hand, GTY, the Surviving Company and the Company and their
respective Affiliates may assert the attorney-client privilege with respect
to such information, files and communications to prevent disclosure of
confidential communications to such third party.
