constitute a breach, default, violation or other contravention thereof, would be ineffective with respect to any party to an agreement concerning such Transferred Asset, claim or right or would in any way adversely affect the rights of the Acquiror

under which the Sellers would enforce for the benefit of the Acquiror any and all of their rights against a third party associated with such Transferred Asset, claim, right or benefit (collectively, &#147;<U>Third Party Rights</U>&#148;), and the
Sellers would promptly pay to the Acquiror when received all monies received by them under any such Transferred Asset, claim, right or benefit, and (ii)&nbsp;after the Closing Date, RAI will, and will cause each of the other Sellers to, continue to

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">C. As of the Effective Date, pursuant to the APA: (1)&nbsp;the rights to manufacture, distribute, market and sell the RAI Products (but not
ownership of the Tobaccoville Facility) have been transferred to Imperial, and (2)&nbsp;ownership of the Greensboro Facility (but not the rights to manufacture, distribute, market and sell the Lorrilard Products) has been transferred to Imperial.
Consequently, RAI has the facilities for, and expertise relating to, the manufacture of the RAI Products, but Imperial has the right to manufacture, distribute, market and sell those Products, and Imperial has the facilities for, and expertise
relating to, the manufacture of the Lorrilard Products, but RAI (acting through Lorrilard) has the right to manufacture, distribute, market and sell those Products. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">D. The Parties desire to enter into this Agreement to cover a transitional period during which, in addition to fulfilling their respective
obligations under this Agreement, (1)&nbsp;Imperial will, directly or indirectly through one or more Affiliates, prepare to manufacture the RAI Products on its own, without the need for the Tobaccoville Facility, and (2)&nbsp;RAI will, directly or
indirectly through one or more Affiliates, prepare to manufacture the Lorrilard Products on its own, without the need for the Greensboro Facility. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">E. Based on the foregoing, and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, during the Term, RAI is willing to manufacture the RAI
