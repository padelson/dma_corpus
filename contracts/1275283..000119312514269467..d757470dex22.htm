11 Section 2.02. _Assignment of Certain Transferred Assets; Update of
Disclosure Schedule_.

(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
this Agreement shall not constitute an agreement to assign, directly or
indirectly, any Transferred Asset or any claim or right or any benefit arising
thereunder or resulting therefrom if an attempted direct or indirect
assignment or transfer thereof, without the consent of a third party,
would constitute a breach, default, violation or other contravention thereof,
would be ineffective with respect to any party to an agreement concerning such
Transferred Asset, claim or right or would in any way adversely affect the
rights of the Acquiror or the Sellers (as applicable) thereto or thereunder,
and such consent has not been obtained on or prior to the Closing Date. If any
direct or indirect transfer or assignment by any Seller to the Acquiror or any
direct or indirect acquisition or assumption by the Acquiror of, any interest
in, or liability, obligation or commitment under, any Transferred Asset, claim
or right requires the consent of a third party, then such transfer or
assignment or assumption shall be made subject to such consent being
obtained. RAI will provide, within 60 days following the date of this
Agreement, a list of all Transferred Assets for which the transfer, assignment
or assumption is subject to obtaining such third party consent. RAI will, and
will cause each of the other Sellers (and to the extent practicable, each of
their respective Affiliates) to, use its and their reasonable best efforts to
obtain any consent necessary for the transfer or assignment of any such
Transferred Asset claim, right or benefit to the Acquiror at no cost to the
Acquiror; provided, however, that nothing in this _Section 2.02_ will be
deemed to require RAI or any of the other Sellers or any of their Affiliates
to make any payments or agree to amend or modify any existing material
commercial terms relating to seeking or obtaining any such consents. If on or
prior to the Closing Date any such consent is not obtained, or if an attempted
transfer or assignment thereof would be ineffective or would adversely affect
the rights of the Acquiror so that the Acquiror would not in fact receive all
such rights, (i) at the Closing, the Sellers and the Acquiror will enter into
one or more mutually agreeable Contracts under which the Acquiror
would obtain the benefits and assume the obligations and bear the economic
burdens associated with such Transferred Asset, claim, right or benefit in
accordance with this Agreement, including subcontracting, sublicensing or
subleasing to the Acquiror, or under which the Sellers would enforce for the
benefit of the Acquiror any and all of their rights against a third party
associated with such Transferred Asset, claim, right or benefit (collectively,
" _Third Party Rights_ "), and the Sellers would promptly pay to the Acquiror
when received all monies received by them under any such Transferred Asset,
claim, right or benefit, and (ii) after the Closing Date, RAI will, and will
cause each of the other Sellers to, continue to use its and their reasonable
best efforts to obtain any consent necessary for the transfer or assignment of
any such Transferred Asset claim, right or benefit to the Acquiror, and, upon
the receipt of such consent, will immediately transfer such Transferred Asset
to the Acquiror at no cost to the Acquiror.

(b) To the extent a Party believes that the Schedules specifying
certain Transferred Assets, Excluded Assets, Assumed Liabilities or Excluded
Liabilities as of the date of this Agreement do not accurately reflect such
Partys good faith understanding of the assets that should be acquired by the
Acquiror or retained by the Sellers or the Liabilities that should be assumed
by the Acquiror or retained by the Sellers, the Parties will work in good
faith to resolve the matter and amend or supplement, as appropriate, the
Disclosure Schedule.

 



12 (c) As soon as possible (and, in any event, within 180 days) after the date of
this Agreement, the Parties agree to work together and cooperate in good
faith to agree upon the Imperial Migration Plan and RAI Migration Plan (each
as contemplated by the Reciprocal Manufacturing Agreement), including the
identification of the Migration Machinery, including associated spare parts
(as contemplated by the Reciprocal Manufacturing Agreement) to be transferred
in accordance with the Imperial Migration Plan and RAI Migration Plan, as the
case may be, (i) from RAI to Acquiror with respect to the Acquired Tobacco
Cigarette Brands, and (ii) from Acquiror to RAI with respect to businesses and
brands other than the Acquired Tobacco Cigarette Brands. In identifying the
Migration Machinery, unless otherwise agreed, the Parties agree to allocate
it between the Parties (or their Affiliates) using the following principles:
(A) any secondary production equipment or machinery that is used (or
calibrated for use) exclusively for the manufacture of any of the
Acquired Tobacco Cigarette Brands will be allocated to Acquiror; (B) any
secondary production equipment or machinery that is used (or calibrated for
use) exclusively for the manufacture of any business or brand owned or
retained by RAI will be allocated to RAI; and (C) any other secondary
production equipment and machinery that could be used or useful (but not
exclusively used or calibrated for use) in connection with the Acquired
Tobacco Cigarette Brands will be allocated between Acquiror and RAI (1) on a
pro rata basis by reference to the respective aggregate production volumes as
of the date of this Agreement of each Party for the relevant brands taking
into account equipment and machinery already allocated pursuant to ( _A_ )
and ( _B_ ) above, and (2) using an alternating selection process for each
piece of equipment. For example, with respect to the foregoing clause ( _C_ ),
if RAI would have 8/9 of the production volume at the Greensboro Facility,
then Acquiror would be entitled to select one production complex; then, RAI
would select eight production complexes; Acquiror would select one production
complex; then RAI would select eight production complexes; and so on.

 

Section 2.03. _Closing_. Unless the Parties shall otherwise mutually agree in
writing, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions precedent
set forth in _Article IX_ and provided RAI shall have given the Acquiror
written notice of the date on which the Effective Time of the Merger shall
occur at least four Business Days prior to such date, the sale and
purchase of the Transferred Assets and the assumption of the Assumed
Liabilities contemplated by this Agreement shall take place at a closing (the
" _Closing_ ") that will be held at the offices of Jones Day, 222 East 41st
Street, New York, NY 10017 on the same day as the date on which the Effective
Time of the Merger occurs (so long as the date on which the Effective Time of
the Merger occurs is not earlier than the date specified in such notice) (the
date on which the Closing takes place being the " _Closing Date_ "). Subject
to the satisfaction or waiver of the applicable conditions precedent set forth
in _Article IX_ (and the satisfaction of the notice requirement set forth in
the preceding sentence), the Lorillard Transfer Closing shall be held on the
Closing Date and immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger.

 

Section 2.04. _Purchase Price_.

 

(a) The aggregate " _Purchase Price_ " for the Transferred Assets to be
delivered at the Closing shall be (i) an amount in cash equal to
$7,056,202,000 and (ii) the assumption of the Assumed Liabilities by the
Acquiror.

 



13 (b) The Purchase Price shall include the consideration payable in respect of
the assets transferred and liabilities assumed at the Lorillard Transfer
Closing and no separate purchase price shall be payable at the Lorillard
Transfer Closing.

 

(c) The Acquiror shall have the right to have the portion of the Purchase
Price allocable to the blu Brand Intellectual Property paid to RAI directly
by Dutch IPCo.

Section 2.05. _Market Share_. In the event that, based on the relevant
Management Science Associates, Inc. monthly reporting of shipments from
wholesale to retail, the aggregate market share of Winston, KOOL and Salem for
the three months ended prior to the month in which the Closing Date occurs is
less than 4.9%, determined by a fraction, the numerator of which is the
shipments of Winston, KOOL and Salem for such three month period, and the
denominator of which is total shipments for such three month period, then the
RAI tobacco brand known as Doral (the " _Doral Brand_ ") will, for all
purposes of the Transaction Agreements, be deemed to be a RAI Brand;
_provided_ that, in the event that during such three month period, unusual or
irregular market forces or disruptions (including, without limitation,
any disruptions resulting from any natural disasters, changes in the economy,
war, disruptions in supply or disruptions in manufacturing), such that the
monthly shipments for any of Winston, KOOL or Salem are significantly
inconsistent with historical shipments, then the Parties will work in good
faith to determine a more appropriate measurement period to be used for
purposes of this _Section 2.05_. In the event the Doral Brand is included as
a RAI Brand, then RAI will, as soon as reasonably practicable, supplement or
amend the Disclosure Schedule to include any matter to the extent related to
the Doral Brand that, had the Doral Brand been deemed to be a RAI Brand as of
the date of this Agreement, would have been required or otherwise included in
the Disclosure Schedule as of the date of this Agreement. Any such disclosed
matter will be deemed to be disclosed solely and exclusively with respect to
the Doral Brand and any Transferred Assets exclusively related to the Doral
Brand. Subject to the foregoing sentence, any such supplement will amend the
Disclosure Schedule for all purposes under the Transaction Agreements, and the
information included in such supplement shall be deemed to be a part of the
Disclosure Schedule as if included therein as of the date of this Agreement.

Section 2.06. _Closing Deliveries by RAI_. At the Closing, RAI shall deliver
or cause to be delivered to the Acquiror:

(a) a receipt for the cash portion of the Purchase Price;

 

(b) the certificates required to be delivered pursuant to _Section 9.03(a)_
and _Section 9.03(e)_;

 

(c) special warranty deeds, or their equivalent in the relevant jurisdiction,
with respect to the Transferred Owned Property, conveying to the Acquiror fee
simple title to such Transferred Owned Property, together with any applicable
transfer Tax Returns and other required forms and filings (and such customary
affidavits as to matters relating to title as a title insurer shall require
to insure title to, and issue customary endorsements with respect to, the
Transferred Owned Property);

 



14 (d) a duly executed counterpart to each Ancillary Agreement (other than the
Route to Market Agreement);

(e) a copy of Exhibit A to the Separation Agreement, dated as of May 7, 2008,
by and among Loews Corporation, Lorillard, Inc., Lorillard Tobacco Company,
Lorillard Licensing Company, LLC, One Park Media Services, Inc. and Plisa
S.A., duly executed by the Surviving Corporation (as defined in the Merger
Agreement) as delivered to Loews Corporation; and

 

(f) such other deeds, bills of sale, endorsements, consents, assignments and
other good and sufficient instruments of conveyance and assignment as the
Parties and their respective counsel shall deem reasonably necessary for the
assumption of the Assumed Liabilities or to vest in the Acquiror (or its
designated Affiliates) all of the Sellers respective rights, titles
and interests in, to and under the Transferred Assets.

Section 2.07. _Closing Deliveries by the Acquiror_. At the Closing,
the Acquiror shall deliver or cause to be delivered to RAI:

(a) the cash portion of the Purchase Price, by wire transfer in
immediately available funds, to accounts as directed by RAI in writing at
least four Business Days prior to the Closing, which will receive any portion
of the Purchase Price attributable to Transferred Assets owned by Lorillard
Asset Owners by and on behalf of such Lorillard Asset Owners as agent for
such Lorillard Asset Owners;

(b) a receipt for the Transferred Assets;

 

(c) the certificate required to be delivered pursuant to _Section 9.02(a)_;

 

(d) a duly executed counterpart to each Ancillary Agreement (other than the
Route to Market Agreement); and

 

(e) a duly executed copy of the MSA Assumption Agreement.

 

Section 2.08. _Prorations_. Each of the following shall be apportioned between
RAI and Acquiror as of the close of business on the day immediately preceding
the Closing Date (the " _Cut-Off Time_ "), on the basis of the actual number
of days of the month that shall have elapsed as of the Cut-Off Time and based
upon the actual number of days in the month and a 365 day year: (a) water,
sewer, gas, electric, vault and fuel charges, if any (unless separately billed
to a Seller (or its Affiliate) for the usage prior to the Cut-Off Time and to
Acquiror from and after the Cut-Off Time); (b) real estate Taxes, and general
or special assessments on the Transferred Owned Property, or any other
governmental Tax or charge levied or assessed against the Transferred Owned
Property, but, in each case, only for the annual installment for the fiscal
year in which the Closing Date occurs; (c) any other charge, amount, cost or
expense customarily prorated in the jurisdiction in which the Transferred
Owned Property is located, including rent, security deposits, prepaid rents
and other credits, free rent credits, and credits in respect of tenant
improvements, leasing commissions and capital expenditures; and (d) payroll
and compensation expense for employees who become Transferred Employees. The
Parties acknowledge and agree that the purpose and intent of the provisions
set forth in this _Section 2.08_ as to prorations

 



15  and adjustments is that RAI shall bear the expenses of the ownership and
operation of the Transferred Owned Property for which buyers and sellers would
customarily prorate or apportion and shall receive the income therefrom
accruing through the Cut-Off Time and Acquiror shall bear such expenses and
receive such income accruing thereafter. To the extent the adjustments
described in this _Section 2.08_ cannot be made at the Closing because
applicable amounts cannot be finally ascertained, the Parties shall make such
adjustments at the Closing based on the best available information, subject to
reasonably prompt adjustment upon receipt of the final report, distribution or
other evidence of the applicable amounts as herein provided. The foregoing
allocations and adjustments shall be shown on a closing statement (with such
supporting documentation as the Parties may reasonably require being attached
as exhibits to such statement) and shall increase or decrease (as the case
may be) the Purchase Price payable by Acquiror. Any discrepancy resulting from
such recomputation and any errors or omissions in computing apportionments at
or after the Closing shall be promptly corrected.

Section 2.09. _Title Fee and Costs_. In connection with the Closing, (a) the
fee for an ALTA title policy for the Transferred Owned Property, and (b) all
typical recording costs, including the recordation costs of recording the
deeds to the Transferred Owned Property, will be borne solely by the Acquiror.

 

Section 2.10. _Payments and Computations_. Except for the payment of the cash
portion of the Purchase Price (which shall be paid at the Closing), each
Party shall make each payment due to another Party not later than 2:00 p.m.,
New York City time, on the day when due. All payments shall be paid by wire
transfer in immediately available funds to the account or accounts
designated in writing in advance by the Party receiving such payment. All
computations of interest shall be made on the basis of a year of 365 days, in
each case for the actual number of days (including the first day but excluding
the last day) occurring in the period for which such interest is payable.
Whenever any payment under this Agreement shall be due on a day other than a
Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day,
and such extension of time shall be included in the computation of, and
payment of, interest.

Section 2.11. _Purchase Price Allocation_. The Purchase Price pursuant to 
_Section 2.04_ shall be payable as follows: (i) a portion of the Purchase
Price shall be paid with respect to Transferred Assets relating to the PR
Business, (ii) a portion of the Purchase Price shall be paid with respect to
blu Brand Business, and (iii) the remainder of the Purchase Price shall be
paid with respect to the remaining Transferred Assets, which, for clarity,
relates to the Acquired Tobacco Cigarette Brands and related operating assets.
Consistent with the foregoing allocation of Purchase Price, the respective
portions of the Purchase Price will be allocated among the Transferred Assets
for all U.S. Tax purposes in accordance with Section 1060(a) of the Code. The
Acquiror will deliver a draft Purchase Price allocation schedule (the "
_Allocation_ ") and draft IRS Forms 8594 consistent with the Allocation to RAI
within 180 days after the Closing Date for RAIs review, which Allocation
shall be binding on the Acquiror, any applicable Affiliate of the Acquiror
and the Sellers if RAI does not object to the Allocation within 30 days after
receiving the Allocation. If RAI notifies the Acquiror in writing within 30
days after receiving the Allocation that RAI objects to one or more items
reflected in the Allocation (the " _Objections Notice_ "), the Acquiror and
RAI will negotiate in good faith to resolve such dispute. If the Acquiror and
RAI fail to agree within 15 days after the delivery of the Objections Notice,
then

 



16  they shall mutually agree upon a firm of independent nationally recognized
accountants, and, if the Acquiror and RAI cannot mutually agree on a firm,
then each of the Acquiror and RAI shall nominate a firm of independent
nationally recognized accountants, and such two firms shall in turn choose a
firm of independent nationally recognized accountants (as finally determined,
the " _Accounting Referee_ "), and the disputed items shall be resolved by
the Accounting Referee, whose determination shall be final and binding on all
Parties. The Accounting Referee shall resolve the dispute within 30 days after
the item has been referred to it. The costs, fees and expenses of the
Accounting Referee shall be borne 50% by RAI and 50% by the Acquiror. The
Acquiror, any applicable Affiliate of the Acquiror and the Sellers shall file
all U.S. Tax Returns (if required, including Form 8594) in accordance with the
agreed Allocation, and unless otherwise required by law shall not take any
position inconsistent therewith for any U.S. Tax purpose.

letter from the IRS that it is so qualified, and each related trust that is
intended to be exempt from federal income Tax pursuant to Section 501(a) of

(a) Subject to _Section 5.06(f)_, the Acquiror has sufficient funds available
to it, and (subject only to Closing) will have sufficient funds available to
it under the financing agreements (the " _Financing Agreements_ ") entered
into to finance the Purchase Price, to pay when required by the Transaction
Agreements, all amounts payable by it or any of its Affiliates

 



40  under or as contemplated by the Transaction Agreements, including payment of
the Purchase Price together with any fees and expenses to be borne by the
Acquiror in accordance with the Transaction Agreements (collectively, the "
_Required Amount_ "). The financing under the Financing Agreements to finance
the Required Amount is collectively referred to in this Agreement as the "
_Debt Financing_ ".

 

(b) The Acquiror has, prior to the execution of this Agreement, delivered to
RAI true and complete copies of the Financing Agreements (redacted as
necessary to address reasonable confidentiality concerns but only to the
extent that any such redaction is not directly or indirectly in respect of any
provision which relates to the commitment to provide the Debt Financing),
pursuant to which the Acquiror will have sufficient funds to pay when
required by the Transaction Agreements the Required Amount.

(c) The Financing Agreements are in full force and effect and constitute
legal, valid and binding obligations of each of the parties thereto (in the
case of parties other than Affiliates of the Acquiror, so far as the Acquiror
is aware).

 

(d) The Financing Agreements in the form delivered to RAI have not been
amended or modified: (i) in a manner which would reduce the aggregate amount
of the Debt Financing set forth in the Financing Agreements below the Required
Amount; or (ii) in a manner otherwise likely to prevent or impair or delay the
Closing or the date on which the Debt Financing would otherwise be obtained,
and the Acquiror will promptly deliver true and correct copies of any
amendment, replacement, supplement or modification to the Financing Agreements
to RAI and Lorillard, if they are amended, modified, replaced or supplemented
in any respect that would have an effect specified in (i) or (ii) above.

(e) Except to the extent refinanced on a dollar-for-dollar basis through

Affiliates ability to borrow under the Financing Agreements and to pay when

Closing under this Agreement; (ii) the conditions expressly set forth in the
Financing Agreements; and (iii) any other conditions that have been satisfied
on the date of this Agreement and will remain satisfied at Closing.

(g) Each warranty, representation, covenant and obligation of the Acquiror or

Amount under the Financing Agreements and the use of such portion thereof as
may be required by the Acquiror to enable it to consummate the Closing and to
perform its other obligations under the Transaction Agreements, has not been
breached and will not at Closing be breached in any respect which would limit
or prevent the borrowing of funds under the Financing Agreements as at Closing
and the use of such portion thereof as may be required by the Acquiror to
enable it to consummate the transactions contemplated by, and to perform its
other obligations under, the Transaction Agreements.

 



41 (h) The Acquiror has no reason to believe that it or any of its Affiliates
will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis any warranty, covenant or
obligation prior to or on Closing to be satisfied by the Acquiror or the
Affiliates of the Acquiror contained in the Financing Agreements, the non-
satisfaction of which would limit, delay or prevent the borrowing of funds
under the Financing Agreements to finance the Required Amount, and the
Acquiror undertakes that if it becomes aware of any such reason prior to the
Closing, it will promptly notify the Sellers of the same.

 

(i) As of the date of this Agreement there are no outstanding borrowings under

advisory fees and expenses of the Imperial Bankers.

(a) From the date of this Agreement until the Closing, or, if earlier, the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, upon reasonable
prior notice, and except as determined in good faith to be necessary to ensure

requested by RAI or the Acquiror, the Parties will enter into a customary
joint defense agreement with respect to any information to be provided to the

(b) In addition to the obligations set forth in _Section 6.22_, from and

to afford the Representatives of the other Party, their Affiliates and their

Section 6.03. _Confidentiality_.

 

(a) The terms of the letter agreement dated March 3, 2014 (the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ "), among Imperial, RAI, Lorillard and BAT are
incorporated into this Agreement by reference and shall continue in full force
and effect until the Closing, at which time the confidentiality obligations
under the Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate; _provided_ ,  _however_
, that Imperials confidentiality obligations shall terminate only in respect
of that portion of the Evaluation Material (as defined in the Confidentiality
Agreement) relating to the Business. If, for any reason, the sale of
the Transferred Assets is not consummated, the Confidentiality Agreement
shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with its terms. The
execution of this Agreement shall constitute written consent by RAI pursuant
to the Confidentiality Agreement to all actions by the Acquiror and Imperial
that are required or expressly permitted by this Agreement that would
otherwise be restricted by the Confidentiality Agreement. The Confidentiality
Agreement is hereby amended, as of the date of this Agreement, to include in
the definition of "Representatives" all existing and prospective direct and
indirect financing sources of Imperial and its Affiliates.

 



46 (b) From and after the Closing, RAI shall, and shall cause its Affiliates and
its and their respective Representatives to, hold in confidence any and all
confidential and proprietary information, whether written or oral, concerning
the Business, except to the extent that RAI can show that such information (i)
is generally available to the public through no fault of RAI, any of its
Affiliates or its or their respective Representatives or (ii) is lawfully
acquired by RAI, any of its Affiliates or its or their respective
Representatives from and after the Closing from sources that are not
prohibited from disclosing such information by a legal, contractual or
fiduciary obligation. From and after the Closing, the Acquiror shall, and
shall cause its Affiliates and its and their respective Representatives to,
hold in confidence any and all confidential and proprietary information,
whether written or oral, concerning the Retained Lorillard Brands, except to
the extent that the Acquiror can show that such information (i) is generally
available to the public through no fault of the Acquiror, any of its
Affiliates or its or their respective Representatives or (ii) is lawfully
acquired by the Acquiror, any of its Affiliates or its or their respective
Representatives from and after the Closing from sources that are not
prohibited from disclosing such information by a legal, contractual or
fiduciary obligation. If a Party or any of its Affiliates or its or their
respective Representatives is compelled to disclose any such confidential
and proprietary information by judicial or administrative process or by other
requirements of Law, or if it becomes necessary for such disclosing Party or
any of its Affiliates to disclose such information in connection with any
legal or administrative proceeding, the disclosing Party shall promptly
notify the other Party in writing and shall disclose only that portion of such
information as is necessary, and the disclosing Party shall provide the other
Party with such appropriate protective order or other reasonable assurance
that such information will be accorded confidential treatment as such other
Party may reasonably request.

 

Section 6.04. _Regulatory and Other Authorizations; Consents_.

 

(a) Each of the Parties shall, and each shall cause its Affiliates and each of
its and their respective Representatives to: (i) promptly obtain all
authorizations, consents, orders, approvals, declarations, certifications,

of, performance of its obligations pursuant to, and consummation of the
transactions contemplated by, the Transaction Agreements, (ii) subject to the
terms of this Agreement, take all such actions as may be requested by any such
Governmental Authority to obtain such authorizations, consents, orders and
approvals and (iii) subject to the terms of this Agreement, avoid the entry
of, or effect the dissolution of, any Governmental Order or temporary
restraining order in any suit or proceeding that would otherwise have the
effect of preventing or materially delaying the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each of the Parties will
cooperate with the other in seeking promptly to obtain all such
required authorizations, consents, orders and approvals. Subject to _Section
6.04(f)_, no Party shall (and each shall ensure that none of its Affiliates or
its or their respective Representatives shall) take any action that would
reasonably be expected to have the effect of materially delaying, materially
impairing or materially impeding the receipt of any required approvals.

 



47 (b) In furtherance but not in limitation of the foregoing, and in relation to
the HSR Act filing relating to the Merger, each of the Parties shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the Governmental Authority that investigates
the Merger pursuant to the HSR Act to enter a Governmental Order that
incorporates, whether directly or by reference, the terms of this Agreement
and the Ancillary Agreements.

(c) In addition to the obligations set forth in  _Section 6.04(a)_:

(i) each Party agrees: (A) to make or cause to be made appropriate joint
advance notices, applications and submissions to States with respect to any
changes in any Certification/Listing pursuant to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and, in the case of RAI and Lorillard, the Merger Agreement,
as promptly as practicable, and in any event, no later than 90 days prior to
the Closing, requesting that all required changes in such
Certification/Listing be made on the Closing Date, that the existing
certifications remain in place until all required changes in such
Certification/Listing are made, and that appropriate provisions for transition
and sell-through of the Acquired Tobacco Cigarette Brands are included in such
changes to the Certification/Listing; (B) to supply as promptly as
practicable any additional information and documentary material that may be
requested by any State or NAAG in connection with such Certification/Listing;
and (C) to engage and cooperate in all communications, meetings and other
actions (including litigation) reasonably required to prevent any period of
delisting and ensure that the sale of the Acquired Tobacco Cigarette Brands in
the States by or on behalf of Acquiror is permitted under applicable Law as of
and after the Closing Date, including without limitation coordinating to
ensure that the date the Acquired Tobacco Cigarette Brands are delisted (if
applicable) occurs on the day that the certification changes to Acquiror and
maintaining listings in place to ensure the products are continuously
certified/listed.

(ii) To the extent any Certification/Listing is required in connection
with any contract manufacturing arrangement following the Closing, RAI and
the Acquiror agree: (A) to make or cause to be made appropriate joint advance
notices, applications and submissions to States with respect to any such
Certification/Listing; (B) to supply as promptly as practicable any
additional information and documentary material that may be requested by any
State or NAAG in connection with such Certification/Listing; and (C) to engage
in all communications, meetings and other actions (including litigation)
reasonably required to prevent any period of delisting and ensure that the
sale of the relevant tobacco cigarette brand (including any relevant Acquired
Tobacco Cigarette Brand) in the States by or on behalf such other party or
any of its Affiliates is permitted under applicable Law as of and after the
Closing Date.

(d) Subject to any applicable confidentiality obligations, each of the
Acquiror and RAI shall promptly notify the other Party of any oral or written
communication it receives from any Governmental Authority, NAAG, OPM, SPM,
other signatory to or litigant in respect of any State Settlement,
Certification/Listing, DC District Court, United States Department of Justice
or defendant, intervenor or interested party in the DoJ Tobacco Case, permit
the other party to review in advance any communication proposed to be made by
such party to any Governmental Authority, NAAG, OPM, SPM, other signatory to
or litigant in respect of any

 



48  State Settlement, Certification/Listing, DC District Court, United States
Department of Justice or defendant or interested party in the DoJ Tobacco Case
and shall provide the other party with copies of all correspondence, filings
or other communications between them or any of their Representatives, on the
one hand, and any Governmental Authority, NAAG, OPM, SPM, other signatory to
or litigant in respect of any State Settlement, Certification/Listing, DC
District Court, United States Department of Justice or defendant or interested
party in the DoJ Tobacco Case or members of its staff, on the other hand, in
each case, relating to the matters that are subject of this Agreement or the
Merger Agreement. No Party shall agree to participate in any meeting with any
Governmental Authority, NAAG, OPM, SPM, other signatory to or litigant in
respect of any State Settlement, Certification/Listing, DC District
Court, United States Department of Justice or defendant or interested party
in the DoJ Tobacco Case in respect of any such filings, investigation or other
inquiry unless it consults with the other Party in advance and, to the extent
permitted by such Governmental Authority, gives the other Party the
opportunity to attend and participate at such meeting. Subject to the
Confidentiality Agreement, the Parties will coordinate and cooperate fully
with each other in exchanging such information and providing such assistance
as the other Party may reasonably request in connection with the foregoing.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 6.04(d)_, the
Parties may, as they reasonably deem advisable and necessary, designate any
competitively sensitive material provided to the other under this _Section
6.04(d)_ as "outside counsel only," and such materials shall be given only to
the outside counsel of the recipient Party. Materials provided to the other
Party or its outside counsel may be redacted as necessary to address
reasonable attorney-client privilege or confidentiality concerns. Nothing in
this _Section 6.04(d)_ shall be applicable to Tax matters. To the extent
that any disclosure that would otherwise be required under this _Section
6.04(d)_ is precluded by a confidentiality obligation of the type referred to
above, the Party bound by the relevant confidentiality obligation shall notify
the other Party that the relevant oral or written communication has occurred
but that such Party is prevented from disclosing it under this _Section
6.04(d)_ due to a confidentiality obligation.

 

(e) Each Party agrees to cooperate and use reasonable best efforts to obtain
any other consents and approvals that may be required in connection with the
transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreements; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that nothing in this _Section 6.04(e)_ will be deemed to require
any of the Sellers or any of their Affiliates to make any payments or agree
to amend or modify any existing material commercial terms of any Contract in
connection with seeking to obtain any such consents or approvals, nor will
anything in this _Section 6.04(e)_ require the Acquiror or any of
its Affiliates to take any action in relation to the Class 1 Circular, the
Imperial Shareholder Resolution or any related matter other than as set out in
_Section 6.05_ below.

 

(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this _Section 6.04_ or otherwise
in this Agreement shall require the Acquiror or any of its Affiliates to
propose, negotiate, effect or agree to, the sale, divestiture, license or
other disposition of any assets or businesses or equity interests of the
Acquiror or any of its Affiliates, or of the Transferred Assets or otherwise
take any action that would limit its freedom of action with respect to, or
its ability to retain any of the businesses or assets or equity interests of
Acquiror or any of its Affiliates or of the Transferred Assets. Nothing in
this _Section 6.04_ or otherwise in this Agreement shall require the Acquiror
or any of its Affiliates to propose, negotiate, effect or agree to, the
purchase, acquisition or license of any business or equity interests or assets
(other than the Transferred Assets) or the assumption

 



49  of the liabilities (other than the Assumed Liabilities) of RAI or Lorillard
or their respective Affiliates or of any other Person. In connection with
seeking any consent of a Governmental Authority to the Transactions or the
Merger, (i) without the prior written consent of RAI, the Acquiror shall not,
and shall cause its Affiliates not to, propose, negotiate, effect or agree to,
any sale, divestiture, purchase, acquisition license or other transaction of
any business or equity interests or assets of RAI or Lorillard (other than the
Transferred Assets) or the assumption of the Liabilities of RAI or Lorillard
(other than the Assumed Liabilities) and (ii) except as contemplated by the
Transaction Agreements, without the prior written consent of the other Party,
no Party shall, and each Party shall cause its Affiliates not to, take any
action or propose, negotiate or agree to (A) take any action that would limit
another Partys freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to retain
any of the businesses or assets or equity interests of such Party or any of
its Affiliates or (B) any requirement that any Party or any of its
Subsidiaries modify, waive or terminate any marketing, promotion, rebate or
discount policy, program, arrangement or understanding in existence as of the
date of this Agreement.

 

(g) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this _Section 6.04_ or otherwise
in this Agreement shall (i) limit or prevent RAI from taking any actions
required to be taken by it or its Subsidiaries pursuant to Section 6.03 of the
Merger Agreement (subject to the proviso to _Section 6.16(b)_) or (ii)
require RAI, Lorillard or any of their respective Subsidiaries to offer,
take, commit to or accept any action, restrictions or limitations of or on RAI
or Lorillard or their respective Subsidiaries, or to permit such actions,
restrictions or limitations, in each case if such actions, restrictions or
limitations, individually or in the aggregate, would or would reasonably be
expected to result in a Substantial Detriment (as defined in the Merger
Agreement).

 

Section 6.05. _Imperial Shareholder Approval and Meeting; Class 1 Circular._

 

(a) The Imperial Board has unanimously adopted resolutions: (i) determining
that the terms of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are
advisable and will promote the success of Imperial; (ii) approving this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (iii) directing
that a resolution (the " _Imperial Shareholder Resolution_ ") to approve the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement for purposes of Chapter 10 of the
listing rules (the " _Listing Rules_ ") produced by the Financial Conduct
Authority (" _FCA_ ") under Part VI of the Financial Services and Markets Act
2000, as amended by the FCA, be submitted as soon as finalized in accordance
with _Section 6.05(c)_ to Imperials shareholders for approval at a duly held
meeting of such shareholders for such purpose (the " _Imperial Shareholders
Meeting_ "); (iv) that it will, except to the extent that the Imperial Board
shall have made an Adverse Recommendation Change as permitted by _Section
6.05(d)_, give a unanimous and unqualified recommendation to Imperials
shareholders to vote in favor of the Imperial Shareholder Resolution (the "
_Imperial Recommendation_ ") and include the Imperial Recommendation in the
Class 1 Circular; and (v) to release, immediately following the execution of
this Agreement, an announcement in the form of _Section 6.05(a)_ of the
Acquiror Disclosure Schedule as required by Listing Rule 10.5.1R(1) and
referring to the Imperial Recommendation.

 

(b) Except for the affirmative vote in favor of approval of the Imperial
Shareholder Resolution by the holders of ordinary shares of
Imperial representing a simple majority of the votes represented in person or
by proxy at the Imperial Shareholders Meeting (the " _Imperial Shareholder
Approval_ "), no other corporate proceedings on the part of Imperial are
necessary to authorize, adopt or approve, as applicable, the Transaction
Agreements or to consummate the Transactions.

 



50 (c) Imperial will, as soon as reasonably practicable following the date of
this Agreement, prepare the Class 1 Circular and submit it to the FCA and use
its reasonable best efforts to finalize the Class 1 Circular as soon as
reasonably practicable. Imperial will duly call, give notice of, convene and
hold the Imperial Shareholders Meeting for the sole purpose of seeking the
Imperial Shareholder Approval. Imperial will use its reasonable best efforts
to (i) cause the Class 1 Circular to be mailed to Imperials shareholders and
to hold the Imperial Shareholders Meeting as soon as reasonably practicable
and (ii) solicit proxies in favor of, or, if any Adverse Recommendation Change
is made by the Imperial Board, in relation to, the Imperial Shareholder
Resolution. The Parties will use their reasonable best efforts to hold the
Imperial Shareholders Meeting, the Company Stockholders Meeting (as defined in
the Merger Agreement) and the Parent Shareholders Meeting (as defined in the
Merger Agreement) on the same day. If on a date for which the
Imperial Shareholders Meeting is scheduled, Imperial has not received proxies
representing a sufficient number of ordinary shares of Imperial to obtain the
Imperial Shareholder Approval, whether or not a quorum is present, Imperial
will have the right to make one or more successive postponements or
adjournments of the Imperial Shareholders Meeting. Imperial agrees that,
unless this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with _Section
10.01(g)_, its obligations pursuant to this  _Section 6.05(c)_ will not be
affected by the making of any Adverse Recommendation Change by the Imperial
Board.

(d) Imperial will include the Imperial Recommendation in the Class 1
Circular, except to the extent that the Imperial Board shall have made an
Adverse Recommendation Change as set out below in this _Section 6.05(d)_.
Except as set forth in this  _Section 6.05(d)_, neither the Imperial Board
nor any committee thereof will withhold, withdraw (or qualify or modify in any
manner adverse to RAI or Lorillard), or propose publicly to withhold or
withdraw (or qualify or modify in any manner adverse to RAI or Lorillard),
the Imperial Recommendation (any such action being referred to as an "
_Adverse Recommendation Change_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything
else to the contrary in this Agreement, at any time prior to obtaining the
Imperial Shareholder Approval, the Imperial Board may make an Adverse
Recommendation Change only if an Intervening Event occurs and the Imperial
Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside
counsel and financial advisor) that the failure to do so would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

Section 6.06.  _Insurance_.

(a) With respect to events or circumstances relating to the Transferred
Assets, Assumed Liabilities or the Transferred Employees that occurred or
existed prior to the Closing Date that are covered by any Sellers occurrence-
based liability insurance policies and any workers compensation insurance
policies and/or comparable workers compensation self-insurance, state or
country programs that are in effect prior to the Closing Date (the " _Pre-
Closing Insurance_ "), the Acquiror may make claims under such policies after
the Closing, subject to the terms and conditions thereof, and RAI shall take
such actions as may reasonably be requested by the Acquiror in connection with
the tendering of such claims to the applicable insurers under such Pre-Closing
Insurance and to provide the Acquiror with the net proceeds it realizes with
respect to such claims.

 



51 (b) With respect to any open claims against RAIs or Lorillards insurance
policies relating to the Transferred Assets, Assumed Liabilities or
Transferred Employees prior to the Closing Date, RAI shall use its reasonable
best efforts, at the Acquirors expense, to pursue such claims and obtain such
expected proceeds;  _provided_ that the Acquiror complies with the
requirements specified in _Section 6.06(a)_.

(c) RAI will comply with its obligations under Section 6.04 of the Merger
Agreement.

Section 6.07. _License to Seller Intellectual Property_.

 

(a) Effective immediately following the Closing, each Seller hereby grants,
and will cause its Affiliates to hereby grant, to the Acquiror, a perpetual,
royalty-free, fully paid up, non-exclusive, non-transferable (except in the
case of an intra-group corporate reorganization among Affiliates or a sale of
all or substantially all of the business related to an Acquired Brand)
license, without the right to sub-license (except to (i) an Affiliate of the
Acquiror or (ii) a third party providing services to the Acquiror or any
Affiliate of the Acquiror in relation to the Business) to use the Seller

Trademarks), solely in connection with the operation of the Business as
conducted within the six months prior to the Closing and the subsequent
evolution of such Business.

 

(b) The rights licensed by RAI and its Affiliates pursuant to _Section
6.07(a)_ are furnished "as is", with all faults and without representation or
warranty of any kind, express, implied, statutory or otherwise, including any

infringement, quality, usefulness, commercial utility, adequacy, compliance
with any law, domestic or foreign, and implied warranties arising from course
of dealing or course of performance.

RAI and the Acquiror shall negotiate and agree on an intellectual property
license agreement, such agreement to be on terms consistent with those set out
in _Exhibit E_ to this Agreement (the " _Intellectual Property License
Agreement_ "). At or prior to the Closing, RAI and the Acquiror shall execute
and deliver the Intellectual Property License Agreement.

Section 6.09. _Further Action Regarding Intellectual Property._

(a) From the date of this Agreement until the Closing, or, if earlier, the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, RAI will use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the Lorillard Asset Owners to conduct the
Relevant Trademark Action in accordance with the provisions of this _Section
6.09(a)_:

comment on any proposed decision of the Lorillard Asset Owners in advance of
any such decision being taken;

the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement or in any

claim or demand asserted by a third party against the Indemnified Party, such
claim being a " _Third Party Claim_ "), describing in reasonable detail the
facts and circumstances with respect to the subject matter of such claim or
demand; _provided_ , _however_ , that the failure to provide such notice shall
not release the Indemnifying Party from any of its obligations under this 
_Article XI_ except to the extent the Indemnifying Party is materially
prejudiced by such failure.

(b) Upon receipt of a notice of a claim for indemnity from an Indemnified
Party pursuant to _Section 11.03(a)_, the Indemnifying Party shall be
entitled to assume the

 



73  defense and control of any Third Party Claim and shall be responsible for
all costs and attorney fees of such defense, but shall, if it determines to
assume such defense, allow the Indemnified Party a reasonable opportunity to
participate in the defense of such Third Party Claim with its own counsel and
at its own expense; _provided_ , _however_ , that with respect to a Third
Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to assume such
defense (and shall in such event bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses
of separate counsel for the Indemnified Party) where the defendants in, or
targets of, such Third Party Claim include both an Indemnified Party
and Indemnifying Party, and the Indemnified Party shall have reasonably
concluded, based on the advice of outside counsel, that there is a material
conflict of interest between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party
with respect to such Third Party Claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to assume the defense of any Third
Party Claim (other than an Action related to Straddle Tobacco Action
Liabilities) if the Third Party Claim seeks an order, injunction or other
equitable relief or relief for other than money damages against the
Indemnified Party that the Indemnified Party reasonably determines (upon
advice of its outside counsel) cannot be separated from any related claim for
money damages. If such equitable or other relief portion of the Third Party
Claim can be so separated from that for money damages, the Indemnifying Party
shall (subject as aforesaid) be entitled to assume the defense of the portion
relating to money damages and, in such event, the Indemnifying Party shall
continue to be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel employed
by the Indemnified Party with respect to the portion of the defense of such
Third Party Claim that the Indemnifying Party has not assumed. The
indemnification required by _Section 11.01_ or _11.02_ , as the case may be,
shall be made by periodic payments of the amount thereof during the course of
the investigation or defense, as and when invoices are received or the Loss
is incurred. RAI or the Acquiror, as the case may be, shall, and shall cause
each of its Affiliates and Representatives to, cooperate fully with the
Indemnifying Party in the defense of any Third Party Claim and the
Indemnifying Party shall keep the Indemnified Party reasonably informed of
developments in connection with the defense or prosecution of such Third Party
Claim. The Indemnifying Party shall be authorized to consent to a settlement
of, or the entry of any judgment arising from, any Third Party Claim, without
the consent of any Indemnified Party (except in relation to any Third Party
Claim that relates to both Seller Tobacco Liabilities and Acquiror Tobacco
Liabilities, in respect of which any settlement shall require the prior
written consent of RAI, in the case the Acquiror is the Indemnifying Party, or
the Acquiror, in the case RAI is the Indemnifying Party); _provided_ that (i)
the Indemnifying Party shall pay or cause to be paid all amounts arising out
of such settlement or judgment concurrently with the effectiveness of such
settlement or resolution (except in relation to any Third Party Claim that
relates to both Seller Tobacco Liabilities and Acquiror Tobacco Liabilities,
in respect of which any amounts payable in connection with such settlement or
judgment shall in paid by the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party in
accordance with _Section 11.01(a)(v))_, (ii) such settlement or judgment
shall not encumber any of the assets of any Indemnified Party or provide for
injunctive or other nonmonetary relief affecting the Indemnified Party, or
otherwise provide for any restriction or condition that would apply to
or adversely affect any Indemnified Party or the conduct of any Indemnified
Partys business, (iii) to the extent that the Indemnified Party may have any
Liability with respect to such Third Party Claim, the complete and
unconditional release of any Indemnified Party potentially affected by such
Third Party Claim shall be made a condition of any such settlement or other
resolution, and (iv) such settlement shall not include any admission of
wrongdoing or misconduct by the Indemnified Party.

 



74 (c) Following an assumption by the Indemnifying Party of a Third Party Claim
pursuant to  _Section 11.03(b)_, the Indemnified Party may reassume control
of any defense of a Third Party Claim if the Indemnifying Party fails to
prosecute the defense of such Third Party Claim within a period of 20 calendar
days after receipt of written notice of such failure to prosecute by the
Indemnified Party. In addition, following an assumption by RAI of a Third
Party Claim pursuant to _Section 11.03(b)_ where the Third Party Claim
relates to both Seller Tobacco Liabilities and Acquiror Tobacco Liabilities,
the Acquiror may elect to assume control of the defense of the part of such
Third Party Claim that relates to Acquiror Tobacco Liabilities at its own
expense. The Indemnifying Party shall be liable for the reasonable fees,
costs and expenses of counsel employed by the Indemnified Party (i) for any
period during which the Indemnifying Party has not assumed the defense
thereof, or (ii) following reassumption of control pursuant to the
first sentence of this _Section 11.03(c)_.

(d) In the event any Indemnifying Party receives a notice of a claim for
indemnity from an Indemnified Party pursuant to _Section 11.03(a)_ that does
not involve a Third Party Claim (such claim being a " _Direct Claim_ "), the
Indemnifying Party shall notify the Indemnified Party within 45 days following
its receipt of such notice if the Indemnifying Party disputes its liability
to the Indemnified Party under this _Article XI_. If the Indemnifying Party
does not so notify the Indemnified Party, the Direct Claim specified by the
Indemnified Party in such notice shall be conclusively deemed to be a
liability of the Indemnifying Party under this _Article XI_ , and the
Indemnifying Party shall pay, subject to the limitations set forth in
_Sections 11.01(b)_ and _11.02(b)_ , if and as applicable, the amount of
such liability to the Indemnified Party on demand or, in the case of any
notice in which the amount of the Direct Claim (or any portion thereof) is
estimated, on such later date when the amount of such Direct Claim (or any
portion thereof) becomes finally determined. If the Indemnifying Party has
timely disputed its liability with respect to such Direct Claim as provided
above, the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall resolve such
dispute in accordance with _Section 12.12_.

Section 11.04. _Exclusive Remedies_. RAI and the Acquiror acknowledge and
agree that, subject to _Section 12.13_, following the Closing, the
indemnification provisions of _Sections 11.01_ and _11.02_ shall be the sole
and exclusive remedies of any RAI Indemnified Party and any Acquiror
Indemnified Party, respectively, for any Losses (including any Losses from
claims for breach of contract, warranty, tortious conduct (including
negligence) or otherwise and whether predicated on common law, statute, strict
liability, or otherwise (but not in the case of fraud or intentional
misrepresentation)) that it may at any time suffer or incur, or become subject
to, as a result of, or in connection with, any breach of any representation or
warranty in this Agreement by the Acquiror or RAI, respectively, or any
failure by the Acquiror or RAI, respectively to perform or comply with any
covenant or agreement in this Agreement that, by its terms, was to have been
performed, or complied with, by the Acquiror or RAI, respectively.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Parties hereby
irrevocably waive any right of rescission they may otherwise have or to which
they may become entitled.

 

Section 11.05. _Effect of Investigation_. The representations, warranties and
covenants of the Indemnifying Party, and the Indemnified Partys right to
indemnification with respect thereto, shall not be affected or deemed waived
by reason of any investigation made by or on behalf of the Indemnified Party
(including by any of its Representatives) or by reason of the fact that the
Indemnified Party or any of its Representatives knew or should have known that

 



75  any such representation or warranty is, was or might be inaccurate or by
reason of the Indemnified Partys waiver of any condition set forth in
_Section 9.02_ or  _Section 9.03_, as the case may be.

Section 11.06. _Consolidation, Merger, Conveyance, Transfer, Disposition
and Divestiture_. If RAI (a) consolidates with or merges with any other
Person, or (b) conveys, transfers or otherwise disposes of or divests
(including by way of sale, assignment, license, lease, pledge or
hypothecation) all or substantially all of its properties or assets to any
other Person, then as a condition to the effectiveness of such consolidation,
merger, conveyance, transfer, disposition or divestiture, such other Person
shall automatically become jointly and severally bound by the provisions of
this _Article XI_.

Section 11.07. _Additional Limitations_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing in
this _Section 11.07_ shall apply in respect of the provisions set out in
_Section 11.01(a)(iv)_, _Section 11.01(a)(v)_ and _Section 11.02(a)(vi)_.

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no Acquiror
Indemnified Party will be entitled to indemnification pursuant to this
_Article XI_ or otherwise for any Losses that such Acquiror Indemnified Party
may suffer or incur, or become subject to, as a result of related to: (i) the
conduct or operation of the blu Brand Business prior to or at the Closing;
(ii) any Transferred Assets or Assumed Liabilities, to the extent related to
the blu Brand Business; or (iii) the failure of any representations or
warranties made by RAI in this Agreement or in any Ancillary Agreement, other
than Fundamental Representations, to be true and correct to the extent
relating to the blu Brand Business or the Transferred Assets or Assumed
Liabilities, to the extent related to the blu Brand Business.

(c) No Indemnified Party will be entitled to indemnification pursuant to this
_Article XI_ or otherwise for any punitive or exemplary damages (other than
punitive or exemplary damages paid by the Indemnified Party to a third party
in connection with a Third Party Claim).

 

(d) An Indemnified Party will use commercially reasonable efforts to pursue
available coverage under insurance policies maintained by such Indemnified
Party for any Losses otherwise subject to indemnity hereunder. If an
Indemnified Party actually receives any insurance proceeds or other recoveries
from third parties (other than any Indemnified Party) pursuant to
indemnification or otherwise prior to being indemnified with respect to
Losses under this _Article XI_ , the payment under this _Article XI_ with
respect to such Losses shall be reduced by the amount of such insurance
proceeds or other recoveries actually received, in each case, net of any
costs and expenses (including reasonable fees and expenses of attorneys),
deductibles, retentions, or increase in premiums incurred in connection with
or as a result of collecting such proceeds or other recoveries (such net
amount, a " _Net Recovery_ "). If an Indemnified Party actually receives any
insurance proceeds or other recoveries from third parties (other than any
Indemnifying Party) pursuant to indemnification or otherwise after
being indemnified with respect to all or a portion of any Losses under this
_Article XI_, the Indemnified Party shall pay to the Indemnifying Party who
made such payment the lesser of (i) the amount of the Net Recovery with
respect to such Losses and (ii) the amount paid by such Indemnifying Party to
the Indemnified Party with respect to such Losses.

 



76 Section 11.08. _Determination of Sales Volumes_. For the purposes of 
_Section 11.01(a)(v)_, the number of units of cigarettes of the Acquired
Tobacco Cigarette Brands sold shall be determined: (a) by reference to
Management Science Associates, Inc.; or (b) to the extent not available
from Management Science Associates, Inc., by reference to Participating
Manufacturers Reported volumes (MSA); or (c) to the extent not available from
Management Science Associates, Inc. or Participating Manufacturers Reported
volumes (MSA), by such other method as shall be agreed by the Parties, acting
reasonably.

ARTICLE XII

 

GENERAL PROVISIONS

 

Section 12.01. _Survival_. The representations and warranties contained in or
made pursuant to this Agreement or in any certificate furnished pursuant to
this Agreement shall terminate at the close of business on the 18-month
anniversary of the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that (a) _Sections
3.13_ and _4.10_ ( _Intellectual Property_ ), and  _Sections 3.14_ and _4.12_
( _Environmental Matters_ ) shall terminate at the close of business on the
third anniversary of the Closing Date, and (b) the Fundamental Representations
shall survive the Closing indefinitely (with respect to each such
representation and warranty, the applicable time for which such representation
and warranty survives the Closing is referred to herein as the " _Survival
Period_ "). The Parties intend to modify the statute of limitations and agree
that no claims or causes of action may be brought against RAI or the Acquiror
based upon, directly or indirectly, any of the representations or warranties
contained in this Agreement after the applicable Survival Period, other than
claims or causes of action as to which RAI or the Acquiror, as applicable, has
given written notice in accordance with _Section 11.03_ to the other prior to
the expiration of the applicable Survival Period. With respect to any
such claims or causes of action as to which such notice has been given prior
to the expiration of the applicable Survival Period, the Survival Period shall
be automatically extended, and the related representation and warranty shall
not terminate, until the final resolution of the claim or cause of action.
The covenants and agreements contained in or made pursuant to this Agreement,
in any other Transaction Agreement or in any certificate furnished pursuant to
this Agreement shall survive the Closing and remain in full force and effect
in accordance with their terms.

Section 12.02. _Certain Acknowledgments by the Acquiror_. The Acquiror
acknowledges for the benefit of the Sellers and their respective Affiliates
that:

(a) without prejudice to  _Section 11.05_, prior to the Closing, the
Acquiror has completed inquiries and investigations into, and, based thereon,
has formed an independent judgment concerning, the Transferred Assets, the blu
Brand Business, the PR Business and the Assumed Liabilities, and any other
rights or obligations to be transferred, directly or indirectly, pursuant to
the Transaction Agreements;

 



77 (b) except as expressly set forth in _Articles III_ or _IV_ or the
Ancillary Agreements, no Seller nor any of Sellers Affiliates or
Representatives or any other Person has made or will have made any
representation or warranty, express or implied, with respect to the
Transferred Assets or Assumed Liabilities or the accuracy or completeness of
any information regarding the Transferred Assets or Assumed Liabilities
furnished or made available to Imperial and the Acquiror and their respective
Affiliates and Representatives;

 

(c) at the Closing or the Lorillard Transfer Closing, as the case may be, the
Acquiror will acquire the Transferred Assets without any representation or
warranty from a Seller or any Person acting on behalf of a Seller as to the
design, condition, quality, safety, merchantability or fitness for any
particular purpose and without any other representation or warranty, except
as otherwise expressly represented or warranted in _Article III_ or _IV_ or
the Ancillary Agreements and that, except as expressly set forth in _Article
III_ or _IV_ or the Ancillary Agreements, each Seller expressly disclaims
and negates any representations or warranties of any kind, whether express or
implied, relating to the condition, merchantability or fitness for a
particular purpose of the Transferred Assets, including any warranty relating
to the condition (environmental or otherwise) of the Transferred Assets,
their suitability for the Acquirors purposes, the status of the maintenance
or operation of the Transferred Assets, or the environmental condition of any
Transferred Owned Property or Transferred Leased Property, including any
buildings, structures, soil, surface water or groundwater;

(d) without limiting the generality of the foregoing provisions of this
_Section 12.02_ and except as expressly set forth in _Articles III_ or _IV_
, it is understood that any financial statements, cost estimates and any
financial or other projections or other predictions that may be contained or
referred to in offering materials, as well as any information, documents or
other materials (including any such materials contained in any "data room" or
reviewed by Imperial or the Acquiror or any of their respective Affiliates or
Representatives pursuant to the Confidentiality Agreement) or management
presentations that have been provided to Imperial or the Acquiror or any of
their respective Affiliates or Representatives are not, and will not be
deemed to be, representations or warranties of any Seller (nor are they or
will they be deemed to be exceptions to any representation or warranties of
any Seller), and except as expressly set forth in _Articles III_ or _IV_ ,
no representation or warranty is made as to the accuracy or completeness of
any of the foregoing; and

(e) except as expressly set forth in this Agreement or the Ancillary
Agreements, at the Closing or the Lorillard Transfer Closing, as the case may
be, the Acquiror will accept the Transferred Assets "as is", "where is", in
their then present environmental condition and physical condition, subject
only to the representations and warranties, covenants and indemnities
contained in this Agreement, with all faults and without any other
representation or warranty of any nature whatsoever, and acknowledges
that without such acceptance, the sale to the Acquiror of the Transferred
Assets would not be made and, except as expressly required by this Agreement,
no Seller shall be under any obligation whatsoever to undertake any
improvement, repair, modification, alteration, remediation, or other work of
any kind with respect to any of the Transferred Assets.

Section 12.03. _Expenses_. Except as may be otherwise specified in the
Transaction Agreements, all costs and expenses, including fees and
disbursements of counsel,

 



78  financial advisers, accountants and brokers, incurred in connection with the
Transaction Agreements and the transactions contemplated by the Transaction
Agreements shall be paid by the Person incurring such costs and expenses,
whether or not the Closing shall have occurred; _provided_ , _however_ , that
all filing and other similar fees payable in connection with all filings
required under the HSR Act relating to the Transactions and the Merger will
be paid by RAI and Lorillard in accordance with the terms of the Merger
Agreement.

Section 12.04.  _Notices_. All notices, requests, claims, demands and other
communications under the Transaction Agreements shall be in writing and shall
be given or made (and shall be deemed to have been duly given or made upon
receipt) by delivery in person, by overnight courier service, by facsimile

courier service) or by registered or certified mail (postage prepaid, return
receipt requested) to the respective parties at the following addresses (or

Section 12.05. _Public Announcements_. No Party or any Affiliate or
Representative of such Party shall issue or cause the publication of any
press release or public announcement or otherwise communicate with any news
media in respect of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement without the prior written consent of the other Parties (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), except as may be
required by Law or stock exchange rules, in which case the Party required to
publish such press release or public announcement shall allow the
other Parties a reasonable opportunity to comment on such press release or
public announcement in advance of such publication; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that

 



80  RAI shall not be required to obtain the Acquirors or its Affiliates prior
written consent in order to issue or cause the publication of any press
release or public announcement or otherwise communicate with any news media,
if such press release, public announcement or other communication refers to
the Merger Agreement or the Merger without including a reference to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 12.06. _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this
Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced under any Law or
as a matter of public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this
Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the
economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon
such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as
closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement be consummated as originally
contemplated to the greatest extent possible.

Section 12.07. _Entire Agreement_. Except as otherwise expressly provided in
the Transaction Agreements or for documents that specifically reference this
_Section 12.07_, the Transaction Agreements constitute the entire agreement
of RAI, the other Sellers and/or their Affiliates, on the one hand, and
Imperial, the Acquiror and/or their Affiliates, on the other hand, with
respect to the subject matter of the Transaction Agreements and supersede all
prior agreements, undertakings and understandings, both written and oral,
other than the Confidentiality Agreement to the extent not in conflict with
this Agreement, between or on behalf of RAI, the other Sellers and/or their
Affiliates, on the one hand, and Imperial, the Acquiror and/or their
Affiliates, on the other hand, with respect to the subject matter of the
Transaction Agreements. 

Section 12.08. _Assignment_. This Agreement shall not be assigned by operation
of Law or otherwise without the prior written consent of RAI and the
Acquiror; _provided_ that (a) both RAI and the Acquiror may assign any or all
of their respective rights and obligations under this Agreement to any of
their respective Affiliates, and (b) following the Closing, the Acquiror may
assign its rights under this Agreement to its sources of Debt Financing, Bond
Financing or other sources of financing available to it as collateral
security; _provided_ , _further_ , _however_ , that no such assignment shall
release RAI or the Acquiror from any liability or obligation under this
Agreement. Any attempted assignment in violation of this _Section 12.08_
shall be void. This Agreement shall be binding upon, shall inure to the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by the Parties and their respective
permitted successors and assigns.

Section 12.09. _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Except as provided in _Article
XI_ with respect to RAI Indemnified Parties and Acquiror Indemnified Parties,
this Agreement is for the sole benefit of the Parties and their permitted
successors and assigns and nothing in this Agreement or any other Transaction
Agreements, including _Article VII_ and _Exhibit D_ hereto, express or
implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other Person, including
any union or any employee or former employee of any Seller or the Business,
or entity any legal or equitable right, benefit or remedy of any nature
whatsoever, including any rights of employment for any specified period, under
or by reason of this Agreement.

 



81 Section 12.10. _Amendment_. No provision of this Agreement or any other
Transaction Agreement, including any Exhibits or Schedules thereto, may be
amended, supplemented or modified except by a written instrument making
specific reference hereto or thereto signed by all the parties to such
agreement. No consent from any Indemnified Party under _Article XI_ (other
than the Parties) shall be required in order to amend this Agreement.

Section 12.11.  _Disclosure Schedules_. Any disclosure with respect to a
Section or Schedule of this Agreement, including any Section of the Disclosure
Schedule or the Acquiror Disclosure Schedule, shall be deemed to be disclosed
for another Section or Schedule of this Agreement, including any Section of
the Disclosure Schedule or the Acquiror Disclosure Schedule, to the extent
that such disclosure is sufficient so that the relevance of such disclosure to
such other Section or Schedule is reasonably apparent on its face.

Section 12.12. _Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction; Waivers_.

 

(a) This Agreement and each other Transaction Agreement (and any claims or
disputes arising out of or related hereto or thereto or to the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby or to the inducement of any Party to enter
herein and therein, whether for breach of contract, tortious conduct or
otherwise and whether predicated on common law, statute or otherwise) shall in
all respects be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws of
the State of Delaware, including all matters of construction, validity and
performance, in each case without reference to any conflict of Law rules that
might lead to the application of the Laws of any other jurisdiction. The
Parties hereby declare that it is their intention that this Agreement shall be
regarded as made under the laws of the State of Delaware and that the laws of
said State shall be applied interpreting its own provisions in all cases
where legal interpretation shall be required. Each Party agrees (i) that this
Agreement involves at least $100,000.00, and (ii) that this Agreement has been
entered into by the Parties in express reliance upon 6 _Del. C._ § 2708\.

(b) Each of the Parties agrees that any Dispute shall be resolved only in
the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware or, if such court shall not have
jurisdiction, any federal court located in the State of Delaware or other
Delaware State Court. In that context, and without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, each Party by this Agreement irrevocably and unconditionally:

(i) submits for itself and its property in any Action relating to the
Transaction Agreements, or for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in
respect thereof, to the exclusive jurisdiction of Chancery Court of the State
of Delaware or, if such court shall not have jurisdiction, any federal court
located in the State of Delaware or other Delaware State Court, and appellate
courts having jurisdiction of appeals from any of the foregoing, and agrees
that all claims in respect of any such Action shall be heard and determined in
such Delaware court or, to the extent permitted by Law, in such federal
court;

(ii) consents that any such Action may and shall be brought in such courts
and waives any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the venue or
jurisdiction of any such Action in any such court or that such Action was
brought in an inconvenient court and agrees not to plead or claim the same;

 



82 (iii) agrees (A) to the extent such Party is not otherwise subject to service
of process in the State of Delaware, to appoint and maintain an agent in the
State of Delaware as such Partys agent for acceptance of legal process, and
(B) that, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, service
of process may also be made on such Party by prepaid certified mail with a
proof of mailing receipt validated by the United States Postal Service
constituting the evidence of valid service, and that service made pursuant to
(A) or (B) above shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law,
have the same legal force and effect as if served upon such Party personally
within the State of Delaware; and

 

(iv) agrees that nothing in the Transaction Agreements shall affect the right
to effect service of process in any other manner permitted by the Laws of the
State of Delaware.

Section 12.13. _Specific Performance_. The Parties hereby acknowledge and
agree that the failure of any Party to perform its agreements and covenants
hereunder, including its failure to take all actions as are necessary on its
part to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, will cause
irreparable injury to the other Parties, for which money damages, even if
available, will not be an adequate remedy. Accordingly, each Party hereby
consents to the issuance of injunctive relief by any court of competent
jurisdiction to compel performance of such Partys obligations and to the
granting by any court of the remedy of specific performance of its obligations
hereunder, in addition to any other rights or remedies available hereunder or
at law or in equity. Each Party hereby waives any requirements for the
securing or posting of any bond with such remedy. Without limiting the
foregoing, with respect to the failure of any party to cause the Closing to
occur when it is otherwise intended to occur pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement, each Party agrees, on its behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates,
that the preferred, intended and mutually agreed sole and exclusive remedy for
such breach is specific performance by (and related injunctive relief against)
the breaching Party of its obligation to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby, and such parties further agree in such circumstances not
to assert that a remedy of specific performance is unenforceable, invalid,
contrary to law or inequitable for any reason nor to assert that money
damages would provide an adequate remedy for such breach.

Section 12.14. _Bulk Sales Laws_. The Acquiror and RAI each hereby waive
compliance by the Sellers with the provisions of the "bulk sales", "bulk
transfer" or similar Laws of any state or any jurisdiction outside the United
States that may otherwise be applicable with respect to the sale of any of

PART 3

 

OTHER PROVISIONS

For a period of 12 months, commencing on day one after the expiration of the
Standstill Period and ending twelve months later:



   (a) | RJRTs new or modified Retail Cigarette Contract will specify
that RJRT requires shelf space equal to the greater of (i) RJRTs Outlet SOM,
(ii) RJRTs Local SOM, and (iii) eight square feet. 
---|--- 



     | (i) | RJRT may merchandise V-Brand Products in its contracted
space, but RJRTs share of market calculations will be based only on
cigarettes (i.e., RJRT will not increase its SOM calculation by adding the
share of market for V-Brand Products). 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | RJRT may choose to merchandise V-Brand Products on a free-
standing merchandiser that is not part of the cigarette merchandiser, and any
such free-standing merchandisers will not be a part of the calculation
of RJRTs shelf space under this agreement. 
---|---|--- 



     | (iii) | Shelf space for Natural American Spirit is separate from,
and not affected by any limitations contained in, the provisions of this
agreement. 
---|---|---

specify that Buyer requires shelf space equal to the greater of (i) Buyers
Outlet SOM, (ii) Buyers Local SOM, and (iii) if deemed appropriate by the
Buyer in its sole discretion, a minimum square foot requirement to be
determined by the Buyer at its sole discretion. 
---|--- 



   (c) | The Parties acknowledge and agree that should any Retailer
provide either Party with more cigarette shelf space than the amount required
under a Retail Cigarette Contract, the other Party will not be permitted
to restrict or prevent in any way the first Party from utilizing such
additional cigarette shelf space. 
---|--- 
 



13 between the Parties, subject to any contrary provisions of this Part 3 of this
agreement, and that competition shall include the following: 
---|--- 
 



     | (i) | each Party may enter into new or revised Retail Cigarette
Contracts and programs on such terms as that Party wishes with any Retailer in
relation to pricing, promotions, shelf space (including re-merchandising
the cigarette fixture) and signage; 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | any Retailer may accept or reject a Partys Retail
Cigarette Contract or other program for any reason including because that
Partys contract or other program is less advantageous to the relevant
Retailer than the other Partys contracts or programs or because that Partys
contract or other program is inconsistent with the other Partys contracts or
programs; and 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (iii) | either Party may, independent of the other Party, enforce
the terms of any of its new or revised Retail Cigarette Contracts or programs
referred to in paragraph (i) above; 
---|---|--- 
 



   (e) | Seller and its Affiliates agree not to enter into any "exclusive"
Retail Cigarette Contracts with Retailers. This agreement not to enter into an
"exclusive" Retail Cigarette Contract means that the Retail Cigarette
Contract will not contain the following (and only the following) requirements: 
---|---

Contract with the Seller and/or its Affiliates; 
---|---|---

     | (v) | that the Retailer only allow signage for the cigarette
brands of Seller and/or its Affiliates. 
---|---|--- 
 

This agreement not to enter into "exclusive" Retail Cigarette Contracts (1)
does not prevent or in any way limit the Seller or its Affiliates from
enforcing against Buyer and its Affiliates any and all terms of Sellers or
its Affiliates Retail Cigarette Contracts and (2) does not limit or in any
way modify any of the terms contained in the RJRT Retail Contracts including
but not limited to the terms of the Every Day Low Price (EDLP) Program.

EMPLOYEE MATTERS

SECTION 1.  _Employment of Certain Business Employees_.

(a) _Acquiror Offer of Employment_. No later than 60 days prior to the
Closing Date, RAI and the Acquiror shall mutually agree which Lorillard
Employees shall be retained by RAI or one of its Affiliates following the
Closing (the " _Retained Lorillard Employees_ "). No later than 30 days prior
to the Closing Date, the Acquiror shall or shall cause one or more of its
Affiliates to offer employment, effective as of the Closing, to all of the
Lorillard Employees (other than the Retained Lorillard Employees) and to the
RAI PR Employees (the " _Proposed Transferred Employees_ "), and such
Proposed Transferred Employees who accept such offers of employment with the
Acquiror or one or more of its Affiliates will be referred to as the "
_Transferred Employees_ ". Any Lorillard Employee (other than the Retained
Lorillard Employees) who does not accept such offer of employment as of a date
certain set no later than five days prior to the Closing and conveyed by the
Acquiror to each such Lorillard Employee will be terminated by Lorillard
immediately prior to the Closing. RAI shall, or shall cause Lorillard to, pay
the amount of any severance or other similar benefit amounts owed to any such
Lorillard Employee described in the preceding sentence. Any Proposed
Transferred Employee who is a RAI PR Employee who does not accept such offer
of employment as of a date certain set no later than five days prior to the
Closing and conveyed by the Acquiror to each such RAI PR Employee at the time
of the employment offer will be terminated by RAI immediately prior to the
Closing.

(b) _Terms and Conditions of Employment_. For a period of at least one
year following the Closing Date, the Acquiror shall, or shall cause its
Affiliates to, provide the Transferred Employees, other than those Transferred
Employees whose terms of employment are governed by an Assumed CBA, with
salary, wages and bonus opportunities that are substantially comparable
(collectively " _Cash Compensation_ ", which, for the avoidance of doubt,
shall exclude in all cases all equity awards) to the Cash Compensation
provided to such Transferred Employees immediately prior to the Closing Date,
and employee benefits (excluding tax-qualified and nonqualified defined
benefit pension and retiree health benefits) that are substantially comparable
in the aggregate to the employee benefits provided to such Transferred
Employees immediately prior to the Closing, which shall include severance
benefits and protections that are at the levels set forth on Appendix A to
this _Exhibit D_ ; _provided_ that, for purposes of this covenant, all
equity awards shall be disregarded. In the event that the Acquiror enters
into an individual arrangement with a Transferred Employee who is in the
executive band or above that specifies the Cash Compensation and benefits that
the Acquiror will provide to such Transferred Employee, then such Transferred
Employee shall not be covered by the preceding sentence.

(c) _Collective Bargaining Agreements_. The Acquiror shall recognize any
certified labor representative of any Transferred Employees as the post-
Closing labor representative for those employees and will, as of the closing
of the transactions contemplated by the Lorillard Transfer Agreement, assume
and abide by the collective bargaining agreements between Lorillard and the
Bakery, Confectionary, Tobacco Workers, and Grain Millers International Union
(AFL-CIO-CLC)

 



D-1  and its local 317T representing employees of the Greensboro, North Carolina
Branch of Lorillard and employees of the Danville, Virginia Branch of
Lorillard, dated September 1, 2011 and April 5, 2012, respectively, setting
forth the terms and conditions of employment for any Transferred Employee in
effect immediately prior to the Closing (the " _Assumed CBAs_ ").

 

(d) _Severance Agreements_. With respect to the severance agreements entered
into by Lorillard and the Specified Employees (as defined in the Merger
Agreement) (the " _Severance Agreements_ "), (i) effective as of the Closing,
RAI shall cause Lorillard to assign to the Acquiror, and the Acquiror shall
assume, the Severance Agreements covering the Specified Employees who are
Transferred Employees provided that (A) to the extent required by the
applicable Severance Agreement, each such Transferred Employee consents to
such assumption, (B) RAI shall use reasonable best efforts to cause Lorillard
to obtain the consent of such Transferred Employees for such assumption, if
consent is required, and (C) the restrictive covenants contained in each of
the assumed Severance Agreements shall apply in favor of the Acquiror and
shall not prevent the Transferred Employee from being employed by the
Acquiror, and (ii) RAI shall, or shall cause Lorillard to, (A) pay, at the
time of the consummation of the Transactions, any and all amounts due to the
Specified Employees as a result of the application of the provisions
contained in Section 6.11(e) of the Merger Agreement, such that each such
Specified Employee shall have received all amounts due thereunder and (B)
satisfy all applicable requirements with respect to wage and similar
withholding in connection with the payment of such amounts. In addition,
effective as of the Closing, the Acquiror shall assume and abide by the
Lorillard Tobacco Company 2014 Change in Control Redundancy Plan with respect
to the Transferred Employees.

(e) _Vacation_. Effective as of the Closing Date, the Acquiror shall, or shall
cause its Affiliates to, to the extent permitted by applicable law, assume or
retain, as the case may be, all obligations of RAI, Lorillard, and their
respective Affiliates for the accrued, unused vacation of the Transferred
Employees; _provided_ , _however_ , that such vacation obligations have been
reflected upon the books and financial records of the Business in accordance
with applicable Law and generally accepted accounting principles. To the
extent permitted by applicable law, RAI shall have no obligation or
liability to pay or provide any vacation payments claimed by any Transferred
Employee on or after the Closing Date. For the avoidance of doubt, to the
extent that such vacation obligations have not been reflected upon the books
and financial records of the Business in accordance with applicable Law and
generally accepted accounting principles, RAI shall retain such obligation or
liability to pay or provide such vacation payments to any Transferred
Employee.

 

(f) _Credit for Service_. The Acquiror shall, or shall cause its Affiliates
to, credit Transferred Employees for service earned on and prior to the
Closing Date with RAI, Lorillard and their respective Affiliates, or any of
their respective predecessors, in addition to service earned with the Acquiror
and its Affiliates on or after the Closing Date, (i) to the extent
that service is relevant for purposes of eligibility, vesting or the
calculation of vacation, sick days, severance, layoff and similar benefits
(but not for purposes of pension benefit accruals (except with respect to the
Lorillard Pension Plan)) under any retirement or other employee benefit plan,
program or arrangement of the Acquiror or any of its Affiliates for the
benefit of the Transferred Employees on or after the Closing Date and (ii) for
such additional purposes as may be required by applicable Law; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Transferred Employees shall not receive any such

 



D-2  service credit (A) where it would result in duplication of benefits or (B)
under new employee benefit plans or arrangements that are adopted after the
Closing Date not in connection with the requirements of this _Exhibit D_
where no service credit is given to other employees of the Acquiror and its
Affiliates pursuant to such new employee benefit plans or arrangements.

 

(g) _Pre-existing Conditions; Coordination_. The Acquiror shall, and shall
cause its Affiliates to, waive limitations on benefits relating to any pre-
existing conditions of the Transferred Employees and their eligible dependents
to the extent that such limitations were waived under the applicable Employee
Plan. The Acquiror shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, recognize for
purposes of annual deductible and out-of-pocket limits under their group
health plans applicable to Transferred Employees, deductible and out-of-pocket
expenses paid by Transferred Employees and their respective dependents under
RAIs, Lorillards or any of their respective Affiliates health plans in the

provide, any required notice under and to otherwise comply with, and to retain
all Liabilities relating to, the federal Worker Adjustment and Retraining
Notification Act of 1988 (the " _WARN Act_ ") and any similar state laws with
respect to any event affecting the employees of the Business prior to the
Closing Date. The Acquiror agrees to provide any required notice under and to
otherwise comply with, and to assume all Liabilities relating to, such Laws
with respect to any event affecting Transferred Employees on or after the
Closing Date. On or as soon as practicable following the Closing Date, RAI
shall deliver to the Acquiror a true, complete and correct list of all

to cause Lorillard to transfer to the Acquiror, sponsorship of and all right,
title and interest of Lorillard in and to and all Liabilities of Lorillard
under, the Lorillard Tobacco Company Retirement Allowance Plan for Hourly
Rated and/or Piecework Employees (the " _Lorillard Pension Plan_ "), and RAI
shall use reasonable best efforts to cause Lorillard to cause the Acquiror to
be substituted for Lorillard under all trust agreements under which any assets
of the Lorillard Pension Plan are held (the " _Lorillard Pension Trust_ "),
such that the Acquiror succeeds to all of Lorillards right, title and
interest in and to the Lorillard Pension Trust and the assets thereof, subject

preceding sentence.

substituted for Lorillard under all trust agreements under which any assets
of the Lorillard Defined Contribution Plans are held (the " _Lorillard Defined
Contribution Trusts_ "), such that the Acquiror succeeds to all of Lorillards
right, title and interest in and to the Lorillard Defined Contribution Trusts
and the assets thereof, subject to the terms

 



D-3  thereof. Prior to the Closing Date, RAI shall use reasonable best efforts to

benefit of the Transferred Employees described in the preceding sentence and
their respective spouses and dependents that, subject to the requirements of

SECTION 6. _Restrictive Covenants Relating to Employees_.

 

(a) _Non-Solicitation by the Acquiror_. The Acquiror and its Affiliates shall
not, directly or indirectly, induce or attempt to induce to leave the employ

with respect to the period ending on the Closing Date, whether such fees,

due), such that Acquirors costs for MSA payments with respect to

ARTICLE IV

MUTUAL AGREEMENTS

Section 4.1 The Acquirors assumption of the obligations of an OPM with
respect to the Acquired Tobacco Cigarette Brands includes receiving the
benefit of the credits and reductions and other calculations applied to brands
owned by an OPM under the MSA with respect to the period after the Closing.
This includes, without limitation, receiving the benefit of the Previously
Settled States Reduction.

Section 4.2 As of and after the Closing Date, RAI and Lorillard are not to be
OPMs with respect to any of the Acquired Tobacco Cigarette Brands.

Section 4.3 As of and after the Closing Date, the Acquiror and its affiliates
are not to be treated as OPMs with respect to any of the Acquirors Existing
Brands.

Section 4.4 All amounts payable after the Closing Date by the Acquiror under
the State Settlements with respect to the Acquired Tobacco Cigarette Brands
are to be calculated solely on the basis of Acquirors results with respect to
the Acquired Tobacco Cigarette Brands and not on the basis of any other
results of the Acquiror. This includes, without limitation, calculations of
Relative Market Share; number of Cigarettes shipped; revenue from sales of
Cigarettes; and operating income from sales of Cigarettes. In calculating the
"Profit Adjustment" under the MSA and PSS, Acquirors base-year operating
income, net operating profit, and any similar measurement shall be an amount

Cigarette Brands.

 

Section 4.5 Acquirors NPM Adjustments under the MSA with respect to the
Acquired Tobacco Cigarette Brands are to be calculated on a going-
forward basis and thus to be based on (i) Acquirors Relative Market Share in
the Acquired Tobacco Cigarette Brands in the base year, and (ii) Acquirors
Relative Market Share in the Acquired Tobacco Cigarette Brands in the year
with respect to which Acquiror is to make an MSA payment. The Parties agree
for purposes of this transaction that Acquiror will have a Relative Market
Share in those brands of zero in the base year.

 

Section 4.6 The Acquirors acquisition of the Acquired Tobacco Cigarette
Brands is not to affect the "Grandfathered" Market Share under MSA § IX(i) in
respect of the Acquirors Existing Brands.

 



F-3 Section 4.7 Acquirors assumption of the obligations of a Settling Defendant,
in accordance with Article II herein, is not to cause any of Acquirors
Existing Brands to be treated as brands owned by a Settling Defendant under
any of the PSS Agreements.

 

Section 4.8 Settlements Under the MSA

(a) RAI and Lorillard, among other Participating Manufacturers, have entered
into the Term Sheet, which was addressed in the Stipulated Award. The Acquiror
has also entered into the Term Sheet and is bound by the Stipulated Award with

of Indiana, also dated June 26, 2014, with respect to the 2015 NPM Adjustment.
The Acquiror has also entered into the Term Sheet with Indiana with respect
to Existing Brands

(d) Acquiror acknowledges having received copies of the Term Sheet, the
Stipulated Award, and the letters dated June 10, 2014, and June 26, 2014,
described above in this section, and further was aware of those documents as
it is already a party to them.

 

(e) With respect to the Acquired Tobacco Cigarette Brands, Acquiror is to
assume the rights and obligations of an OPM under the agreements listed above
in this section, as to NPM Adjustment claims for years after the Closing and
for a proportionate share of the calendar year of the Closing. The Acquiror
will retain the rights and obligations of an SPM with respect to Existing
Brands under the agreements listed above in this section, as to all NPM
Adjustment claims addressed in the agreements.

Section 4.9 Agreements existing as of the Closing Date among the OPMs with
respect to the MSA, or among the Settling Defendants with respect to any of
the PSS Agreements, will apply to the Acquiror with respect to the Acquired
Tobacco Cigarette Brands, and the Acquiror will receive all benefits under
such agreements as well as assuming the obligations thereunder with respect to
the Acquired Tobacco Cigarette Brands. RAI and Lorillard represent that there
are no such agreements that affect the Acquired Tobacco Cigarette
Brands other than the following:

(a) The Agreement Regarding Allocation, entered into by the OPMs in September
2010; and the Addendum to the Agreement Regarding Allocation, entered into by
the OPMs in December 2012. Acquiror acknowledges having received copies of the
agreement and the addendum. Acquiror also acknowledges that it is aware of a
dispute between RAI and the OPM Philip Morris USA Inc. regarding the
allocation among the OPMs of interest and earnings, including a dispute over
the meaning and applicability of the Agreement Regarding Allocation and the
Addendum to the Agreement Regarding Allocation with respect to that dispute.

 



F-4 (b) The agreement between RAI and Lorillard regarding allocation of any

of its respective Affiliates and each of its and their respective
Representatives to) make all such communications with and provide all such
information to NAAG, the States, the Independent MSA/PSS Auditor, and any
other relevant Persons and take all such other steps (including filing dispute
letters with the Independent MSA/PSS Auditor and engaging in or cooperating in
any dispute, litigation, or arbitration) as are necessary and/or expedient
for any of the following purposes:

(c) Obtaining the agreement (if necessary) of the States, the Independent
MSA/PSS Auditor, NAAG, and any other relevant Persons to the agreements in

COMPLIANCE

Section 5.1 Each of the Parties agrees to the terms of this Exhibit on its
own behalf (and on behalf of its Affiliates) and undertakes, from and after
the date of the APA, both before and after the Closing Date, to (and to cause
each of its Affiliates and each of its and their respective Representatives
to) adhere fully to and not deviate in any respect from the terms of this
Exhibit, including in any communications with any of the States, OPMs, SPMs,
Settling Defendants,

otherwise relating to the terms of this Exhibit.

 

Section 5.2 Each of the Acquiror and RAI further undertakes, from and after

and their respective Representatives to take) all such steps as are necessary
or expedient (including giving any relevant waivers and/or consents and/or
engaging in or cooperating in any disputes, litigation, or arbitration) to
cause the terms of Article IV herein to become and remain fully effective.

Section 5.3 If, notwithstanding the best efforts of the Parties under §
4.10(c) herein and each Partys compliance with § 5.1 herein, the Independent

incorrectly (and whether or not in response to an arbitration award or court
order) determines Acquirors Relative Market Share in the base year to be any
amount other than zero (as provided in § 4.5 herein), then Acquiror and RAI
will reallocate among themselves the aggregate amount of the NPM Adjustment
that the Independent Auditor has allocated to each of them for that year,
such that each of Acquiror and RAI receives the proportion of such aggregate
amount that it would have received under this Exhibit if the Independent
Auditor had determined Acquirors Relative Market Share in the base year to
be zero.

Affiliates and each of its and their respective Representatives to) keep each
other fully informed and fully support each other in relation to all material

of the Tobaccoville Facility) have been transferred to Imperial, and (2)

facilities for, and expertise relating to, the manufacture of the Lorrilard
Products, but RAI (acting through Lorrilard) has the right to manufacture,
distribute, market and sell those Products.

 

D. The Parties desire to enter into this Agreement to cover a transitional
period during which, in addition to fulfilling their respective obligations
under this Agreement, (1) Imperial will, directly or indirectly through one or
more Affiliates, prepare to manufacture the RAI Products on its own, without
the need for the Tobaccoville Facility, and (2) RAI will, directly
or indirectly through one or more Affiliates, prepare to manufacture the
Lorrilard Products on its own, without the need for the Greensboro Facility.

 

E. Based on the foregoing, and subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, during the Term, RAI is willing to manufacture the RAI Products at
the Tobaccoville Facility on behalf of Imperial, and Imperial is willing to
manufacture the Lorrilard Products at the Greensboro Facility on behalf of

 _MANUFACTURING AND RELATED RESPONSIBILITIES_

 

2.1 _Reciprocal Appointments_. Imperial hereby appoints RAI as Imperials
exclusive manufacturer of Imperials requirements for the RAI Products for
sale in the States, and RAI hereby appoints Imperial as RAIs exclusive
manufacturer of RAIs requirements for the Lorillard Products for sale in the
States; _provided_ _that_ , either such Customer may manufacture its own
requirements (or any portion thereof) of its Products while implementing its
Manufacturing Migration in accordance with _Section 2.11_. RAI will not be
required to manufacture any product for Imperial other than the RAI Products,
and Imperial will not be required to manufacture any product for RAI other
than the Lorillard Products.

 



-7- 2.2 _Manufacturing Facilities; Workforce; Inspections_.

 

(a) During the Term, (i) RAI agrees to manufacture the RAI Products
exclusively at the Tobaccoville Facility in accordance with
the Specifications, and (ii) Imperial agrees to manufacture the Lorillard
Products exclusively at the Greensboro Facility in accordance with the
Specifications. RAI agrees to maintain the Tobaccoville Facility and all
equipment used or useful in the manufacture of the RAI Products (and all
components thereof) in good, clean, safe and hygienic condition and repair
(subject only to normal wear and tear and casualty events), in each case, as
is necessary to continue to manufacture the RAI Products in accordance with
the Specifications throughout the Term. Imperial agrees to maintain the
Greensboro Facility and all equipment used or useful in the manufacture of the
Lorillard Products (and all components thereof) in good, clean, safe and
hygienic condition and repair (subject only to normal wear and tear and
casualty events), in each case, as is necessary to continue to manufacture the
Lorillard Products in accordance with the Specifications throughout the Term.
Subject to  _Section 2.3(d)_ , each Manufacturer agrees to maintain
production capacity at the Tobaccoville Facility or Greensboro Facility, as
applicable, to manufacture the applicable Products in the volumes projected in
the most-recently provided Short-Term Forecast for such Products, subject to
the limitations set forth in _Section 3.2(a)_.

(b) During the Term, each Manufacturer agrees to employ a sufficient
workforce with the requisite ability, experience, expertise and licensure to
manufacture the Products in accordance with the Specifications and other
requirements of this Agreement.

 

(c) Representatives of each Customer may, upon reasonable notice and at times
and frequencies reasonably acceptable to the applicable Manufacturer, visit
and inspect the Tobaccoville Facility or Greensboro Facility, as the case may
be, where the Products are being manufactured, packaged and stored. Each
Customer will bear its own expenses with regard to any such visits,
unless otherwise agreed by the Parties. If requested by any Customer, the
relevant Manufacturer will cause appropriate individuals working on the
activities relating to this Agreement to be available for meetings during any
such visit and inspection. The visitation and inspection rights covered by
this _Section 2.2(c)_ include the right to inspect all inventory of the
Products, the manufacturing, packaging and storage facilities and processes
relating to the manufacture, packaging and storage of the Products (including
quality control measures) and the machinery, equipment and materials used in
all such processes (including the storage and handling of the Customers
Initial Tobacco Leaf Inventory or subsequently procured Tobacco Leaf or
Additional Tobacco Raw Materials). Each Customer will be responsible for
ensuring that its representatives abide by all of the Manufacturers standard
rules and procedures with regard to safety, regulatory compliance,
security, personnel matters, confidentiality, computer use and computer
network use while at the Manufacturers facilities. In addition, each Customer
will be responsible for ensuring that its representatives refrain from actions
and conduct that materially interferes with the Manufacturers business and
operations, and will instruct such representatives not to conduct unauthorized
activities at the Manufacturers facilities or otherwise. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, however, if a Manufacturer is then in breach of any of its
representations, warranties or covenants in this Agreement (or the Customer
has a reasonable basis to assert any such breach), then the Customer may visit
and inspect the Manufacturers facility on 24 hours notice and, in the event
of such breach, the costs and expenses of such visit and inspection will be
the responsibility of the Manufacturer.

 



-8- 2.3 _Specifications_.

 

(a) The Specifications for the RAI Products are set forth on _Exhibit C-1_ ,
and the Specifications for the Lorillard Products are set forth on _Exhibit
C-2_.

(b) During the Term, the Manufacturer will use the same quality control
measures as were used in connection with the manufacture of the Products
immediately before the Effective Date, or such other quality control standards
as the Manufacturer may elect to apply, subject to the approval of the
Customer, which approval may not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

(c) If a Customer desires to modify the Specifications for one or more of its
Products, then such Customer will inform the Manufacturer in writing of such
desired modifications. The Manufacturer will reasonably cooperate with all
such desired modifications; _provided_ _that_ , the Manufacturer will not be
required to make any modifications (i) if, in the good faith judgment of the
Manufacturer, such modifications would unreasonably interfere with the
manufacture of its own products, (ii) that require capital expenditures or
other costs that would not be fully reimbursed by the Customer to
the reasonable satisfaction of the Manufacturer, or (iii) if a Governmental
Approval is required for such modifications, if such Governmental Approval has
not yet been obtained.

 

(d) The Parties acknowledge that, in order for a Manufacturer to meet its
obligations under this Agreement, the Manufacturer will, from time to time,
carry out customary maintenance activities on the Tobaccoville Facility and
its equipment or Greensboro Facility and its equipment, as applicable, to
ensure that manufactured Products and the manufacturing process in respect
thereof continue to conform to their Specifications. The Manufacturer agrees
to schedule such maintenance activities in a manner that does not unreasonably
disrupt manufacturing or delivery schedules.

 

(e) The Parties will cooperate with one another (and relevant third Persons)
to ensure that each Party is provided with relevant information regarding the
physical and chemical properties (including toxicological information) of raw
materials, equipment, manufacturing processes and conditions and other
processes that a Manufacturer may employ when producing Products. If requested
by a Customer, the Manufacturer will provide samples of Products or raw
materials, at the times and in the amounts reasonably requested, to the
Customer or its designee for testing and evaluation against the
Specifications, whether in connection with a Manufacturing Migration or
otherwise. Any change to raw material, equipment (routine/preventive
maintenance and ordinary wear and tear excepted), manufacturing processes or
conditions or other matters that may affect the Products (or
the Specifications for the Products) must be approved in writing by the
Customer before implementation by the Manufacturer.

2.4  _Contingency Equipment_. Each Party agrees to retain throughout the Term
all equipment designated by that Party for "contingency requirements" and in
such Partys possession as of the Effective Date (collectively, "
_Contingency Equipment_ "). Each Party will maintain its Contingency Equipment
in good condition and repair. The Parties acknowledge that Contingency
Equipment must be used, to the greatest extent possible, to alleviate
an event of Force Majeure or to otherwise assist the Parties in achieving a
successful Manufacturing Migration. Each Partys inventory of Contingency
Equipment is identified (specifically or by category) under such Partys name
on _Exhibit D_.

 



-9- 2.5 _Packaging_. Each Customer will be responsible for ensuring that
the Specifications for the Packaging used on its Products are such that the
Packaging bears markings as required by applicable Laws and Governmental
Approvals.

 

2.6 _Raw Materials; Tobacco Leaf; Inventory_.

 

(a) Subject to _Section 2.6(b)_ , and unless otherwise agreed between a
Manufacturer and its Customer, the Manufacturer will purchase and be
responsible for supplying the raw materials and product components that are to
be used by it in manufacturing and packaging the Customers Products in
accordance with the Specifications, including any Additional Tobacco Raw
Materials.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in _Section 2.6(a)_ , and unless
otherwise agreed between a Manufacturer and its Customer, the Customer will
be responsible for procuring the Tobacco Leaf to be used in the manufacture of
its Products, which will initially be comprised of that Customers Initial
Tobacco Leaf Inventory. Throughout the Term, the Customer will
retain exclusive title to any raw materials or product components that it
procures and provides to the Manufacturer for the manufacture of such
Customers Products, including all of such Customers Tobacco Leaf (including
its Initial Tobacco Leaf Inventory), and at no time will title thereto
transfer to the Manufacturer even though the Manufacturer will possess or
control such materials at its facilities and will be responsible for insuring
such materials in accordance with _Section 2.7_ and have the risk of loss
with respect to such materials in accordance with _Section 5.2_. In addition,
in the event that a Customer procures any raw materials or product components
(in addition to its Tobacco Leaf) necessary for the manufacture of its
Products by the Manufacturer, the Manufacturer and the Customer will cooperate
in good faith to equitably adjust the Standard Costs for the Products into
which those raw materials or product components are incorporated for
the purpose of the Manufacturers relevant invoice or invoices prepared
pursuant to _Section 4.2_. Unless otherwise agreed between the Manufacturer
and the Customer, the Manufacturer will be solely responsible for purchasing,
receiving, storing, maintaining, using and disposing of all raw materials and
product components, in each case, in accordance with the Specifications or, if
not addressed by the Specifications, as set forth in this Agreement or as
otherwise reasonably instructed by the Customer.

(c) The Manufacturer will inspect raw materials and product components to be
used in manufacturing its Customers Products using the same inspection
measures that were used in connection with the manufacture of the Products
immediately before the Effective Date or such other inspection measures as are
mutually agreed upon by the Manufacturer and its Customer. The Manufacturer
will promptly notify the Customer in the event that the Manufacturers
inspections of raw materials or product components identify any quality or
quantity issues and, to the extent practicable, consult with the Customer in
addressing those issues with the supplier.

(d) The Manufacturer agrees to receive, care for and store all raw materials
and product components, including its Customers Tobacco Leaf (including its
Initial Tobacco Leaf Inventory) and any other raw materials or product
components procured by such Customer for use in the manufacture of its
Products by the Manufacturer, in accordance with the Specifications and, if
not addressed in the Specifications, then in accordance with the same
standards used to receive, care for and store its own raw materials and
product components and, in any event, in a commercially reasonable manner.

 



-10- (e) Each Manufacturer will (i) maintain a sufficient supply of raw materials
and product components to meet each Customers Short-Term Forecast in a
timely manner (but will not be responsible for the level of supply of any such
raw materials or product components that the Customer has elected to source
directly pursuant to  _Section 2.6(a)_ or _2.6(b)_ ), and (ii) use
commercially reasonable efforts to avoid holding raw materials or product
components materially in excess of the levels called for by such Short-Term
Forecast; _provided_ _that_ , the foregoing requirements will not apply to
Tobacco Leaf procured by a Customer for use in the manufacture of its Products
by the Manufacturer (including the Customers Initial Tobacco Leaf Inventory),
it being understood that if such Customers Initial Tobacco Leaf Inventory is
insufficient to complete production of the applicable Products during the
entire Term, that Customer will procure additional Tobacco Leaf meeting the
Specifications for such Products and in accordance with _Section 2.6(b)_.
Each Customer and its Manufacturer will communicate to ensure that the
Manufacturer has enough inventory and that both Parties have accurate
information regarding inventory levels and requirements.

 

2.7 _Insurance_. Each Manufacturer will maintain throughout the Term with
financially sound and reputable carriers insurance in such amounts and
against such risks (including loss or damage by fire and loss in transit;
theft, burglary, larceny and other criminal activities; business interruption;
and general liability) and such other hazards as is customarily maintained
by companies engaged in the same or similar businesses operating in the
States. Upon request, each Manufacturer will furnish to the requesting Party
information in reasonable detail as to the insurance so maintained. In
addition to the foregoing, each Manufacturer will insure its Customers
Tobacco Leaf (including its Initial Tobacco Leaf Inventory) in such
Manufacturers possession or control as it customarily maintains on its own
raw materials inventory.

 

2.8 _Cooperation on Regulatory Matters_.

 

(a) Each Party agrees to cooperate with any reasonable requests for assistance
from the other Party with respect to (i) obtaining and maintaining any and
all Governmental Approvals (including taking the actions described on _Exhibit
E_ ), (ii) responding to requests for information from any and all
Governmental Authorities, and (iii) complying with any and all applicable
Laws required in connection with the relevant Product or this Agreement,
including at each such Partys own cost, the following: (I) making its
employees, consultants and other staff available upon reasonable notice
during normal business hours to attend meetings with Governmental Authorities
concerning the manufacturing process, equipment and machinery, raw materials
and product components and Products; and (II) disclosing and making available
to the other Party, in whatever form such Party may reasonably request, all

filed in advance of Effective Date after execution of APA. 
---|--- 
 



-11- (b) Each Manufacturer agrees, to the extent that any State requires the
Manufacturer rather than the Customer to obtain a Certification/Listing in
the State, to obtain and maintain such Certification/Listing during the Term,
including taking any actions in connection therewith as set forth in the APA.

 

(c) Each Manufacturer will promptly notify its Customer in writing of, and
will provide such Customer with copies of, any correspondence and other
documentation received by the Manufacturer from a third Person in connection
with any of the following events: (i) any inspection or audit of such
Manufacturers facility by or on behalf of any Governmental Authority; (ii)
receipt of a communication (oral or written), regulatory letter, warning,
inquiry, request for information or similar item from or on behalf of any
Governmental Authority in connection with, or related to, the Customers
Products, any such inspection or audit of the manufacture of the Customers
Products or any other activity conducted as part of the manufacturing process
for such Products; (iii) receipt of any regulatory comments relating to the
manufacture of the Customers Products requiring a response or action by any
Party or notice of any safety or toxicity issue regarding the Customers
Products; (iv) test results that indicate failure of any of the Customers
Products to meet the Specifications; (v) receipt of any communication (oral
or written) regarding a Certification/Listing related to the Customers
Products; or (vi) receipt of any communication (oral or written), regulatory
letter, warning, inquiry, request for information or similar item from NAAG,
a State, or any other party to the State Settlements related to the Customers
Products that concerns any alleged violation or potential violation with
respect to such Products.

 

(d) Each Manufacturer will (i) notify its Customer by telephone of any notice
that the Manufacturer receives, or any knowledge that the Manufacturer
otherwise acquires, of an event or complaint that asserts any material
environmental or human health and safety concerns or risks (excluding inherent
risks associated with the Products themselves) in respect of the
Customers Products no later than the second business day following the
Manufacturers receipt of such notice or its acquisition of such knowledge, as
the case may be, and (ii) provide its Customer with copies of any written
materials received in connection with or as part of any such report not later
than the second business day following the Manufacturers receipt thereof.

 

(e) Each Party will promptly notify the other Party in writing if such first
Party believes that a recall, field alert, Product withdrawal or field
correction (each, a " _Recall_ ") of a Customers Product may be necessary or
advisable. With respect to implementing any Recall, or otherwise dealing with
any Recall in any respect, the Customer will make all contacts with the
applicable Governmental Authorities and will be responsible for coordinating,
managing and controlling all of the necessary activities in connection with
any such Recall; _provided_ _that_ , the Manufacturer may take any action
it deems reasonably necessary in order to comply with applicable Law. The
Manufacturer will cooperate with any reasonable requests for assistance

 



-12-  from its Customer with respect to considering or implementing a Recall. The
Manufacturer will not, and will ensure that its Affiliates do not, issue any
press release or make any public statement regarding any Recall in respect of
its Customers Products without the prior written consent of that Customer.
The Customer will review and investigate with the Manufacturer the relevant
facts underlying any issues related to the Manufacturer that may result in a
Recall prior to implementing it (to the extent reasonably practicable). The
Customer will bear the costs and expenses of each Recall, unless the
Manufacturer is obligated to indemnify the Customer for such costs and
expenses pursuant to _Section 6.7_ , in which case, in addition to and not in
limitation of, any rights the Customer may have under this Agreement
(including _Section 6.7_ ) or applicable Laws: (i) the Customer will continue
to manage, coordinate and control the Recall and any and all of the necessary
activities in connection with such Recall; and (ii) the Manufacturer will
promptly reimburse the Customer for any and all documented costs reasonably
incurred by the Customer with respect to such Recall, including associated

applicable Intellectual Property to grant) to its Manufacturer a fully paid-
up, non-exclusive, non-transferrable, non-sublicensable license to use such of
the Customers (or its Affiliates) Intellectual Property in respect of the
Products solely as is necessary to enable the Manufacturer to perform
its obligations under this Agreement with respect to the manufacture and
packaging of the Products on behalf of the Customer. Each Manufacturer will
treat, use and apply that Intellectual Property in respect of the Products
only in strict compliance with any limitations, restrictions and instructions
that may be prescribed by the Customer, through the Specifications or
otherwise. The Manufacturer is not entitled to use the Intellectual Property
in respect of the Products in any other manner without the prior written
consent of the Customer.

(b) The Parties acknowledge and agree that any Intellectual Property
relating exclusively to each Customers Products which arises from the
manufacture of such Customers Products, or the performance of any other
obligations in relation to such manufacture, under this Agreement or
otherwise, will vest in the respective Customer (or any of its designated
Affiliates). Each Party acknowledges and agrees that if and to the extent that
any Intellectual Property relating exclusively to a Customers Product
unintentionally vests in the Manufacturer (or any of its Affiliates), the
Manufacturer will, and will cause any such Affiliates to, at no cost to the
Customer, transfer the full, right, title and interest in such Intellectual
Property to the Customer (or its Affiliates).

 

2.10 _Project Teams_. Promptly after the Effective Date, each Party will
designate a project team of its primary contact individuals for purposes of
this Agreement, each of which must include representatives reasonably
acceptable to the other Party and which may include different team members
when the Party is acting as a Customer and when it is acting as
a Manufacturer. Each Party will be entitled to change the members of its
project team, and will notify the other Party of any such changes. Each
Partys project team will serve as the primary point of contact between the
Parties for purposes of the transactions covered by this Agreement,

 



-13-  and will be primarily responsible for facilitating the flow of information
and otherwise promoting communication, coordination and collaboration between
the Parties. The project teams will conduct regular telephone, video
conference or in-person meetings as deemed necessary or appropriate to
exchange information regarding the transactions covered by this Agreement, and
at a minimum, the project teams will conduct monthly meetings to discuss
general operations under this Agreement, including matters concerning the
Products, the status of each Customers Manufacturing Migration, Long-Term
Forecasts, Short-Term Forecasts, inventory levels (including the levels of
applicable Tobacco Leaf and Additional Tobacco Raw Materials), materials
sourcing, quality control, Cost mitigation and any disputes or controversies
affecting a Partys rights or obligations under this Agreement. All disputes
and controversies, or other issues, identified by the project teams during
any such meetings will be promptly evaluated, addressed and remedied as soon
as commercially reasonable.

 

2.11 _Transition to Customer Manufacturing_. The Parties acknowledge that the
arrangements contemplated by this Agreement are intended to be temporary in
nature and last (a) with respect to the appointment of RAI as the manufacturer
of Imperials requirements for the RAI Products, for such time as anticipated
in the Imperial Migration Plan, or if later, until such time as Imperial, in
its reasonable judgment, has determined that it is prepared and capable of
manufacturing (or having manufactured) the RAI Products on its own, and (b)
with respect to the appointment of Imperial as the manufacturer of RAIs
requirements for the Lorillard Products, for such time as anticipated in the
RAI Migration Plan, or if later, until such time as RAI, in its reasonable
judgment, has determined that it is prepared and capable of manufacturing (or
having manufactured) the Lorillard Products on its own (each, a "
_Manufacturing Migration_ "). Each Customer will use its commercially
reasonable efforts to effect a Manufacturing Migration, and each Manufacturer
agrees to reasonably cooperate with its Customer to facilitate such
Customers Manufacturing Migration, in each case, in accordance with the RAI
Migration Plan or the Imperial Migration Plan, as the case may be, unless
otherwise agreed in writing between the Parties. In connection with a
Manufacturing Migration, the Manufacturer will, on the reasonable request of
the Customer, allow for the reasonable use of the Manufacturers Migration
Machinery, and provide reasonable manufacturing assistance, for purposes of
ensuring, to the reasonable satisfaction of the Customer, that its products
are identical to the Customer Products as produced by the Manufacturer. Each
Customer will use its commercially reasonable efforts, but will not be
required, to achieve a Manufacturing Migration as soon as practicable after
the Effective Date and, in any event, will endeavor to achieve a Manufacturing
Migration before the expiration of the Initial Term.

 

ARTICLE 3

_FORECASTS AND PURCHASING_

3.1 _Long-Term Forecasts_. Commencing on the Effective Date, each Customer
will begin providing each Manufacturer on a monthly basis with rolling
12-month forecasts for projected volumes of Products (by SKU) for which such
Customer expects to place Purchase Orders during the covered period (each, a "
_Long-Term Forecast_ "). The initial Long-Term Forecasts for RAI and Imperial
are attached as _Exhibits G-1_ and _G-2_ , respectively. Each subsequent Long-
Term Forecast must be delivered at least five days before the first day of the
first month of the covered 12-month period. Each Long-Term Forecast must be
prepared for the relevant Products in a manner consistent with the practices
used to forecast consumer demand for

 



-14-  such Products for the 12-month period (approximated as necessary) ending
immediately prior to the Effective Date, after giving effect to any production
by the Customer in progressing towards a Manufacturing Migration or
otherwise; _provided_ _that_ , a Customer may modify its practices for
forecasting consumer demand for purposes of preparing its Long-Term Forecasts,
subject to the approval of its Manufacturer, which approval may not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed. Each Long-Term Forecast will be non-binding
and will be used solely for general planning and inventory control purposes.

 

3.2 _Purchase Orders; Short-Term Forecasts and Related Matters_.

 

(a) From time to time during the Term, each Customer, in its sole discretion,
may issue (or have issued on its behalf) one or more Purchase Orders to the
Manufacturer. Unless the Parties otherwise agree, each Customer will place one
Purchase Order per four-week period, which will set forth (i) a binding order
for Products for a four-week period, and (ii) a non-binding forecast of
orders for the succeeding three-month period (each such three-month forecast,
a " _Short-Term Forecast_ "), which will supersede any inconsistent portion of
the Customers Long-Term Forecast and any prior Short-Term Forecast covering
the same period; _provided_ _that_ , each Customer will issue its initial
Purchase Order hereunder as of or in anticipation of the Effective Date. Each
Purchase Order may designate multiple delivery dates for Products,
and (except for each Customers initial Purchase Order) must be received by
the Manufacturer at least 28 days before the first delivery date stated
therein. Each Manufacturer will schedule the production of Products based on
the Short-Term Forecasts, as long as such Short-Term Forecasts are not
materially inconsistent with the corresponding Long-Term Forecast or the
immediately preceding Short-Term Forecast covering the same period. Any terms
of a Purchase Order, sales order, invoice or other similar transaction
document that are inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement will have no
force or effect.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in _Section 3.2(a)_ , a
Manufacturer will be entitled (but not obligated) to reject, in whole or in
part, any Purchase Order if, and only if: (i) the Purchase Order would require
the Manufacturer to use raw materials or product components (A) at levels
materially in excess of the levels required for the production reflected for
the four-week order period in the most-recently delivered Short-Term Forecast,
or (B) that the Customer agreed to procure pursuant to _Section 2.6(a)_ or
_2.6(b)_ , but which have not yet been provided (it being understood that such
right of rejection will apply only to that portion of the Purchase Order for
which raw materials or product components are unavailable and, to the extent
applicable, _Section 3.2(c)_ will apply); (ii) the Products cannot be timely
delivered due to modifications to be made to the manufacturing process in
respect of a Product as a result of a change in Specifications requested by
the Customer; (iii) the production in accordance with the Purchase Order
would, in the Manufacturers good faith belief based on credible evidence,
violate any applicable Law; or (iv) an event of Force Majeure with respect to
the Manufacturer has occurred (it being understood that such right of
rejection will apply only until such time as the event of Force Majeure has
been alleviated). To reject a Purchase Order, in whole or in part,
the Manufacturer must promptly (and, in any event, within two business days
after receiving the Purchase Order) notify the Customer in writing, which
notice must include (A) a statement regarding what portion of the Purchase
Order (if any) will be filled, (B) if applicable, any alternative delivery
date(s) proposed in accordance with _Section 3.2(c)_ , and (C) a reasonably
detailed description of the circumstances giving rise to one or more of the
events described 

 



-15-  above entitling the Manufacturer to so reject, in whole or in part, the
Purchase Order. If the Manufacturer fails to timely notify the Customer of the
Manufacturers rejection of a Purchase Order (or any portion thereof), such
Purchase Order (or the portion that has not been timely rejected) will be
deemed to have been accepted by the Manufacturer.

 

(c) The Parties acknowledge that there may be occasions when a Purchase Order
deviates materially from the forecasted purchase volumes for the four-week
order period in the immediately preceding Short-Term Forecast and, as a
result, the Manufacturer may be required to make adjustments to its production
schedule to meet the requested delivery date(s). In any such circumstance, the
following will apply:

(i) If the Purchase Order exceeds the forecasted purchase volumes for that
four-week order period from the immediately preceding Short-Term Forecast,
then the Manufacturer determines that it cannot fill any portion of a Purchase
Order by the specified delivery date(s), then the Manufacturer will promptly
(and, in any event, within two business days after receiving the Purchase
Order) notify the Customer in writing and propose alternative delivery date(s)
for the Products (or any portion thereof). In any such case, the Parties will
negotiate in good faith towards revised delivery date(s), and will confirm
any new delivery date(s) in writing. If the Manufacturer does not object to
the original delivery date(s) stated in the Purchase Order, then such date(s)
will become firm delivery date(s), and the Manufacturer will be responsible
for delivering the Products on time in accordance with the Purchase Order,
even though the Purchase Order may have deviated materially from forecasted
purchase volumes for that four-week period in the Long-Term Forecast or Short-
Term Forecast.

 

(ii) The Manufacturer will be entitled to quantify the Cost impact of any such
positive or negative adjustments in its production schedule, and the Parties
will work together in good faith to mitigate any such Costs. Subject to the
foregoing obligation to mitigate Costs, the Manufacturer will be entitled to
reimbursement for any Cost impact that results from any such adjustments in
its production schedule, which Costs will be deemed Actual Costs hereunder.

ARTICLE 4

 

 _PRICING, INVOICING AND INSPECTION OF PRODUCTS_

 

4.1 _Cost Plus Pricing_. Unless otherwise agreed between the Manufacturer and
the Customer in writing, the price for Products will equal the sum of (x) the
Costs of such Products, _plus_ (y) ten percent (such percentage, the "
_Manufacturing Fee_ ").

 

4.2 _Invoicing Procedures; Standard Costs_.

 

(a) Each Manufacturer will invoice its Customer on a monthly basis for all
Products shipped under Purchase Orders during the preceding month and,
because the Parties recognize that it may be impracticable for the
Manufacturer to calculate its Actual Costs on a monthly basis, each such
invoice will reflect the Manufacturers Standard Costs (instead of its Actual
Costs) for the covered Products. Each invoice will be delivered by the tenth
calendar day of the month immediately following the month it covers and will
be due and payable by the Customer within five days of receipt.

 



-16- (b) Each Manufacturer may propose to modify its Standard Costs for any
calendar year during the Term to reflect its good faith estimate of Actual
Costs for that calendar year by providing written notice of such modifications
to its Customer by no later than October 1st of the preceding calendar year.
Any such proposal will require the approval of the Customer, which will not
be unreasonably withheld or delayed. As soon as practicable after the Parties
agree to modify a Manufacturers Standard Costs as set forth in this _Section
4.2(b)_ , the Parties will update  _Exhibits B-1_ and/or _B-2_ , as
applicable, to reflect the same.

4.3 _Invoice Adjustments_.

 

(a) As soon as practicable (and, in any event, within 90 days) after every
sixth invoice delivered by a Manufacturer hereunder ( _i.e._ , approximately
every six months during the Term), and as soon as practicable (and, in any
event, within 90 days) after the expiration or termination of a Manufacturer-
Customer relationship hereunder in accordance with _ARTICLE 8_ ,
the Manufacturer will deliver to its Customer a statement (a " _True-Up
Statement_ ") reflecting the Manufacturers calculation of Costs actually
incurred by it (" _Actual Costs_ ") with respect to the Products for which
previous invoices were delivered pursuant to _Section 4.2_ and which had not
yet been subjected to adjustment pursuant to this _Section 4.3(a)_. In
delivering its calculation of Actual Costs, the Manufacturer will provide
reasonable substantiation of its calculations, but will only share itemized
calculations or provide detailed substantiation with respect to Actual Costs
that it deems to be competitively sensitive, including Actual Costs for
Tobacco Leaf, Additional Tobacco Raw Materials, other tobacco components,
paper and wrapping materials, filter tow and other filter materials and direct
labor (collectively, " _Sensitive Information_ ") with a group of individuals
designated by the Customer for the purpose of receiving such Sensitive
Information, and who are reasonably acceptable to the Manufacturer and who
agree to maintain the confidentiality of such Sensitive Information and not to
disclose it to any third Person or to the Customer outside of such designated
group.

(b) The Manufacturer must calculate its Actual Costs in accordance with the
principles and methodologies (including any assumptions and limitations, as
well as rules for the allocation of indirect Costs) described on _Exhibits
B-1_ (with respect to the RAI Products) and _B-2_ (with respect to the
Lorillard Products). The Parties will discuss in good faith any required
changes in the principles and methodologies for determining Actual Costs (and,
to the extent applicable, Standard Costs) at least 60 days before such changes
are implemented.

 

(c) The Customer will have 30 days from the date it receives a True-Up
Statement in which to review it (the " _Objection Period_ "). If, in the
Customers good faith judgment, the True-Up Statement does not fairly present
the Manufacturers Actual Costs for the covered invoices, then the Customer
will have the right to propose an adjustment to those Actual Costs (or any
component thereof) within such Objection Period. Any such proposed adjustment
must be in writing (an " _Adjustment Notice_ ") and must specify (i) the
amount of the proposed adjustment, (ii) the item to which such proposed
adjustment relates, and (iii) the facts and circumstances supporting the
reasonableness of such adjustment. Upon the submission of any Adjustment
Notice, the Manufacturer and the Customer will work together in good faith in
an attempt to agree on the disputed values, but without disclosing any
Sensitive Information outside of the group of individuals designated to
receive such information pursuant to _Section 4.3(a)_. If any such dispute is
not resolved within 30 days after the Manufacturers receipt of an

 



-17-  Adjustment Notice, then either Party may submit the dispute for resolution
by an independent, nationally recognized firm of certified public accountants
(an " _Accounting Firm_ "). The decision of the Accounting Firm as to the
resolution of the dispute will be conclusive and binding on the Parties. The
fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm will be divided equally between the
Manufacturer and the Customer. The Accounting Firm will at all times (A) give
the Parties a reasonable opportunity to make written representations and to
require that copies of any written representations are supplied to the other
Party without delay, (B) make its determination as soon as reasonably
practicable, and (C) make its determination available in writing to both
Parties. If the Customer fails to submit an Adjustment Notice within the
Objection Period, then the Customer will be deemed to have accepted the True-
Up Statement and the Manufacturers calculation of Actual Costs therein.

(d) Based on the Manufacturers Actual Costs for the covered invoices (as
finally determined in accordance with this _Section 4.3_ ), the following
adjustments will be made:

 

(i) If the Manufacturers Actual Costs are less than the Standard Costs
(adjusted to account for any agreements between the Parties pursuant to
Section _2.6(a)_ or _2.6(b)_ ) for the same invoices, then the Manufacturer
will pay the Customer the amount of such difference, plus an amount equal to
the Manufacturing Fee thereon.

 

(ii) If the Manufacturers Actual Costs are greater than the Standard Costs
(adjusted to account for any agreements between the Parties pursuant to
Section _2.6(a)_ or _2.6(b)_ ) for the same invoices by no more than ten
percent of such Actual Costs (the " _Cost Cap_ "), then the Customer will pay
the Manufacturer an amount equal to the difference between such Actual Costs
and such Standard Costs, plus an amount equal to the Manufacturing Fee
thereon.

(iii) If the Manufacturers Actual Costs are greater than the Standard Costs
(adjusted to account for any agreements between the Parties pursuant to
Section _2.6(a)_ or _2.6(b)_ ) for the same invoices by more than the Cost
Cap, then such invoices will be automatically adjusted downward such that the
Manufacturers Actual Costs do not exceed such Standard Costs by more than the
Cost Cap, and the Customer will pay the Manufacturer an amount equal to the
difference between such Actual Costs (as adjusted to reflect the Cost Cap)
and such Standard Costs, plus an amount equal to the Manufacturing Fee
thereon.

(e) Any payments required to be made under _Section 4.3(d)_ , will be made
within five business days of the later of: (i) the expiration of the Objection
Period, (ii) the date on which the Manufacturer and the Customer agree on the
Actual Costs for the covered invoices, and (iii) the date of which the
decision of the Accounting Firm is rendered.

4.4  _Payments_. Unless otherwise agreed between the Parties, all payments
made under this _ARTICLE 4_ will be made, without set off, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the account designated by the payee. All
payments will be made in U.S. dollars. All payments made by a Customer for
Products will be deemed made without prejudice to any rights that the Customer
may have under this Agreement, and will not constitute acceptance of Products
or otherwise affect the Customers rights with respect to Non-Conforming
Products.

 



-18- 4.5 _Inspection and Approval of Products; Rejection of Non-Conforming
Products_. Upon receipt of the Products at the destination point, the
Customer will have the right to inspect and approve for acceptance those
Products. Such inspection and approval must be made within 30 days of
delivery. If the Customer fails to timely notify the Manufacturer of the
Customers rejection of the Products, the Customer will be deemed to have
accepted those Products as conforming. The Customer may reject and refuse
acceptance of any Non-Conforming Products. Upon discovery of any Non-
Conforming Products, the Customer will promptly (and, in any event, before
expiration of the 30-day inspection period) inform the Manufacturer in
writing, setting forth in reasonable detail the reasons why the Products
should be characterized as Non-Conforming Products. Within ten days after
receiving such a notice, the Manufacturer may contest the rejection and
provide documentation and other evidence relating to the quality of the
applicable Products. The Manufacturer may also inspect the Products and
collect a representative sample thereof for testing and analysis. Thereafter,
the Parties will confer in good faith to resolve the controversy. If any
Products are finally deemed to be Non-Conforming Products, they will be
destroyed or otherwise handled pursuant to the Customers instructions, at no
cost to the Customer. The Customer will not be responsible for any payment for
Non-Conforming Products (and in the event that the Customer has paid for those
Non-Conforming Products, the Customer will be entitled, at the Customers
election, to a credit for or refund of that payment). If the Customer requests
that the Manufacturer replace or correct any Non-Conforming Products, the
Manufacturer will be responsible for promptly remanufacturing, substituting
or otherwise correcting those Non-Conforming Products, and for supplying
remanufactured or corrected Products at no cost to the Customer.

 

4.6 _Audit Rights_. Each Party agrees to maintain accurate and complete books
and records regarding its activities under this Agreement, including
correspondence, instructions, invoices, receipts, quality assurance records,
Specifications, Purchase Orders, raw materials and component procurement
records, warehousing records and cost data, transportation records and
cost data, other manufacturing cost records and data (including calculations
and supporting documentation for Actual Costs, whether or not deemed to be
Sensitive Information), and similar documents and data relating to the
manufacture, purchase and sale of Products from a Manufacturer to a Customer
hereunder. Each Party agrees to keep such records in sufficient detail to
enable the other Party to determine or verify such Partys compliance with
this Agreement. Each Party will keep such records for a period of time as
determined by its normal document retention policies, but in any event not
less than three years after the date of the transaction to which those records
relate, or longer if required by Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, before a
Manufacturer destroys any records relating to the Products it has manufactured
for its Customer, it must notify that Customer in writing and allow that
Customer a reasonable opportunity to make copies of those records (other than
records containing Sensitive Information) before they are destroyed. In
addition to the visitation and inspection rights set forth in _Section 2.2(b)_
, during regular business hours and upon not less than five business days
written notice, each Party will permit each other Party (and its
representatives), at such other Partys cost and expense, to examine and audit
all of the first Partys books and records relating to its activities under
this Agreement, in each case, to the extent necessary for the Party(ies) to
make the foregoing determination and verification and subject to restrictions
implemented in good faith to (a) ensure compliance with applicable Law, (b)
preserve any applicable privilege (including the attorney-client privilege),
or (c) comply with any applicable contractual confidentiality obligations;
_provided_ _that_ , if any Party is then in breach of any of its

 



-19-  representations, warranties or covenants in this Agreement (or one or more
of the other Party has a reasonable basis to assert any such breach), then any
such audit will be permitted upon 24 hours notice and if a breach is
confirmed, the costs and expenses of the audit will be the responsibility of
the breaching Party; and, _provided_ , _further_ _that_ , with respect to any
audit that would involve the disclosure of a Partys Sensitive Information,
the other Party may only conduct such audit through (i) the group of
individuals designated as permitted to receive such information pursuant to
_Section 4.3(a)_ , or (ii) a legal representative or independent accountant
who has agreed to (A) analyze such information solely for the purpose of
advising the Parties with respect to compliance with this Agreement and (B)
maintain the confidentiality of such information and not disclose it to any
of the Parties.

and other items procured by the Customer for the manufacture of such
Customers Products pursuant to _Section 2.6(a)_ or _2.6(b)_ , including such
Customers Tobacco Leaf (including its Initial Tobacco Leaf Inventory), will
remain with that Customer, while the risk of loss with respect to those items
will remain with the Manufacturer while they are in the Manufacturers
possession or control until such time as they are delivered F.O.B. (shipping

severally, and not jointly with any other Party, agrees to indemnify, defend
and hold harmless the other Party, its Affiliates and its and their respective
current and former officers, directors, employees, representatives and agents
(each, an " _Indemnified Party_ ") from and against any and all losses,
damages, claims, liabilities, demands, assessments, judgments, settlements,
compromises and related costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys
fees and costs) (collectively, " _Damages_ ") an Indemnified Party may suffer
in connection with, or arising out of (i) a breach of the Indemnifying Partys
representations, warranties, covenants or confidentiality obligations set
forth in this Agreement, or (ii) the marketing, advertising, distribution or
sale by the Indemnifying Party, in its capacity as a Customer (or its
Affiliates) of any Products manufactured by the Indemnified Party (or its
Affiliates), including any Damages that relate to any claimed adverse health
effects or health risks relating to the use of such Products, _provided_ ,
_however_ , that to the extent that clause (ii) of this _Section 6.7(a)_ would
be inconsistent with the indemnification provisions set out in the APA (to
the extent that such provisions would be

 



-23-  applicable to such claim), the terms of the APA shall prevail.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Indemnified Party will be entitled to
indemnification for Damages to the extent (but only to the extent) they
relate to, result from or arise out of (A) the failure of such Indemnified
Party to comply with its obligations under this Agreement, or (B) the
negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnified Party.

 

(b) An Indemnified Party must promptly notify the Indemnifying Party in
writing of any pending or threatened claim or demand that the Indemnified
Party has determined has given or would reasonably be expected to give rise to
a right of indemnification (including a pending or threatened claim or demand
asserted by a third party against the Indemnified Party, such claim being a "
_Third Party Claim_ "), describing in reasonable detail the facts and
circumstances with respect to the subject matter of such claim or demand;
_provided_ _that_ , the failure to provide such notice will not release the
Indemnifying Party from any of its obligations under this _Section 6.7_ except
to the extent the Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced by such failure.

 

(c) Upon receipt of a notice of a claim for indemnity from an Indemnified
Party pursuant to _Section 6.7(b)_ , the Indemnifying Party will be entitled
to assume the defense and control of any Third Party Claim and will be
responsible for all costs and attorney fees of such defense, but must, if it
determines to assume such defense, allow the Indemnified Party a reasonable
opportunity to participate in the defense of such Third Party Claim with its
own counsel and at its own expense; _provided_ _that_ , the Indemnifying Party
will not be entitled to assume such defense (and will bear the reasonable
fees, costs and expenses of separate counsel for the Indemnified Party) (i)
unless it first acknowledges in writing its obligation hereunder to indemnify
the Indemnified Party with respect to all material elements of such Third
Party Claim and (ii) in case of a Third Party Claim where the defendants in,
or targets of, such Third Party Claim include both an Indemnified Party and
Indemnifying Party, and the Indemnified Party has reasonably concluded, based
on the advice of counsel, that there is a material conflict of interest
between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party with respect to such
Third Party Claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnifying Party is
not entitled to assume the defense of any Third Party Claim if the Third
Party Claim seeks an order, injunction or other equitable relief or relief for
other than money damages against the Indemnified Party that the Indemnified
Party reasonably determines (upon advice of its outside counsel) cannot be
separated from any related claim for money damages. If such equitable or
other relief portion of the Third Party Claim can be so separated from that
for money damages, the Indemnifying Party will (subject as aforesaid) be
entitled to assume the defense of the portion relating to money damages and,
in such event, the Indemnifying Party will continue to be liable for the
reasonable fees and expenses of counsel employed by the Indemnified Party with
respect to the portion of the defense of such Third Party Claim that the
Indemnifying Party has not assumed. Each Party, will, and will cause each of
its Affiliates and representatives to, cooperate fully with the Indemnifying
Party in the defense of any Third Party Claim and the Indemnifying Party
agrees to keep the Indemnified Party reasonably informed of developments in
connection with the defense or prosecution of such Third Party Claim. The
Indemnifying Party is authorized to consent to a settlement of, or the entry
of any judgment arising from, any Third Party Claim, without the consent of
any Indemnified Party; _provided_ _that_ , (A) the Indemnifying Party pays or
causes to be paid all amounts arising out of such settlement or judgment
concurrently with the effectiveness of such settlement or resolution, (B)
such settlement or judgment does not encumber any of the

 



-24-  assets of any Indemnified Party or provide for injunctive or other
nonmonetary relief affecting the Indemnified Party, or otherwise provide for
any restriction or condition that would apply to or adversely affect any
Indemnified Party or the conduct of any Indemnified Partys business, (C) to
the extent that the Indemnified Party may have any liability with respect to
such Third Party Claim, the complete and unconditional release of any
Indemnified Party potentially affected by such Third Party Claim must be made
a condition of any such settlement or other resolution, and (D) such
settlement does not include any admission of wrongdoing or misconduct by the
Indemnified Party.

(d) Following an assumption by the Indemnifying Party of a Third Party Claim
pursuant to _Section 6.7(c)_ , the Indemnified Party may reassume control of
any defense of a Third Party Claim if the Indemnifying Party fails to
prosecute the defense of such Third Party Claim within a period of 20 days
after receipt of written notice of such failure to prosecute by
the Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party will be liable for the
reasonable fees, costs and expenses of counsel employed by the Indemnified
Party (i) for any period during which the Indemnifying Party has not assumed
the defense thereof, or (ii) following re-assumption of control pursuant to
the first sentence of this _Section 6.7(c)_.

(e) In the event any Indemnifying Party receives a notice of a claim for
indemnity from an Indemnified Party pursuant to _Section 6.7(b)_ that does not
involve a Third Party Claim (such claim being a " _Direct Claim_ "), the
Indemnifying Party must notify the Indemnified Party within 45 days following
its receipt of such notice if the Indemnifying Party disputes its liability to
the Indemnified Party under this _Section 6.7_. If the Indemnifying Party does
not so notify the Indemnified Party, the Direct Claim specified by the
Indemnified Party in such notice will be conclusively deemed to be a liability
of the Indemnifying Party under this _Section 6.7_ , and the Indemnifying
Party will pay, the amount of such Damages to the Indemnified Party on demand
or, in the case of any notice in which the amount of Damages in respect of the
Direct Claim (or any portion thereof) is estimated, on such later date when
the amount of such Damages in respect of Direct Claim (or any portion
thereof) becomes finally determined.

 _CONFIDENTIALITY_

 

7.1 _Confidentiality Obligations_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, each Party
agrees not to disclose its Confidential Information to any other Party
hereunder, except to the extent required to enable such other Party to perform
its obligations under this Agreement. In addition, no Party will share its
Sensitive Information with any other Party, except (i) in a format that
restricts its use to ensure compliance with applicable Law, (ii) to the group
of individuals designated as permitted to receive such information pursuant to
_Section 4.3(a)_ , or (iii) to a legal representative for purposes of
conducting an audit pursuant to _Section 4.6_.

(b) During the Term and for a period of five years thereafter, each Party
receiving Confidential Information (a " _Receiving Party_ ") will maintain in
confidence all Confidential Information disclosed to it by any other Party (a
" _Disclosing Party_ ").

 



-25-  Notwithstanding the foregoing, but subject to _Section 7.2_ , each of the
Partys respective obligations of confidentiality with respect to another
Partys Trade Secrets, including the Specifications, will be perpetual. No
Party will use, disclose or grant the use of such Confidential Information
except as expressly authorized by this Agreement. To the extent that
disclosure is authorized by this Agreement, the Receiving Party must inform
its employees, representatives and contracting parties to whom disclosure is
to be made of this _ARTICLE 7_ , and instruct such Persons to hold in
confidence and not make use of such information for any purpose other than
those purposes permitted by this Agreement. Each Receiving Party will use at
least the same standard of care (but not less than a reasonable standard of
care) as it uses to protect its own proprietary and Trade Secret information
to ensure that such employees, representatives and contracting parties do not
disclose or make any unauthorized use of such Confidential Information. Each
Receiving Party will promptly notify the other upon discovery of any
unauthorized use or disclosure of Confidential Information. The Receiving
Party will be responsible to the Disclosing Party for any loss of Confidential
Information of the Disclosing Party or breach of the provisions of this
_Section 7.1_ by any employee, representative or contracting party of the
Receiving Party.

7.2 _Exceptions_. The obligations of confidentiality contained in
_Section 7.1_ will not apply to the extent that it can be established by the
Receiving Party by competent proof that such Confidential Information: (a) was
generally available to the public or otherwise part of the public domain at
the time of its receipt from the Disclosing Party; (b) becomes generally
available to the public or otherwise part of the public domain after its
disclosure and other than through any act or omission of the Receiving Party
in breach of this Agreement; or (c) was received by the Receiving Party,
other than under an obligation of confidentiality, by a third Person lawfully
in possession of the information.

 

7.3 _Authorized Disclosure_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Party (nor
third Persons, as applicable) will be precluded from disclosing Confidential
Information to the extent it is required to do so in response to a valid order
by a Governmental Authority, or to the extent it reasonably believes, on the
basis of advice from outside counsel, that it is required to disclose such
Confidential Information by Law, or to the extent necessary to establish its
rights under this Agreement; _provided_ _that_ , in the event a Party believes
it is so required to disclose another Partys Confidential Information,
it will promptly provide notice of such requirement so that the Disclosing
Party may seek an appropriate order or other action as it deems appropriate to
prevent or limit such disclosure, and the Party required to make the
disclosure will use its reasonable efforts to preserve the confidentiality of
the other Partys Confidential Information, including by cooperating with the
other Party to obtain an appropriate order or other reliable assurance of
confidential treatment. In any event, the Party required to make the
disclosure may disclose only that portion of another Partys Confidential
Information that is legally required to be disclosed. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if any Party (or an Affiliate of such Party) is required to
include a copy of this Agreement as an exhibit to any current or periodic
report filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, such Party (or
its Affiliate) may make such filing without the prior written consent of any
other Party as long as it seeks (or causes its Affiliate to seek)
confidential treatment of any portions of this Agreement that, in the opinion
of such filing Party, contain confidential or competitively sensitive
information, regardless of whether such treatment is obtained.

 



-26- ARTICLE 8

 

 _TERM AND TERMINATION_

 

8.1 _Term of Agreement_. The term of this Agreement will commence on the
Effective Date and this Agreement and the Manufacturer-Customer relationships
hereunder will remain in effect until the day before the two-year anniversary
of the Effective Date (the " _Initial Term_ "), after which this Agreement and
such Manufacturer-Customer relationships will automatically renew for
successive one-year periods (each, a " _Renewal Term_ "), unless terminated or
not renewed as provided in this _ARTICLE 8_. The Initial Term and all Renewal
Terms, if any, are referred to in this Agreement collectively as the " _Term_
".

8.2 _General Termination Provisions_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, this Agreement may be terminated as follows:

(a) by mutual consent of the Parties; and

(b) by a Party, by giving written notice to the other Party at any time upon
the occurrence of any of the following events: 

(i) the voluntary bankruptcy of the other Party, or the filing of an
involuntary petition in bankruptcy against the other Party that is not
dismissed within 60 days of filing, in which case, the termination will become
effective immediately upon the non-terminating Partys receipt of notice of
termination or at such later date as may be specified in that notice;

 

(ii) the other Party ceases to pay its debts as they mature in the ordinary
course of business, or makes an assignment for the benefit of its creditors,
in which case, the termination will become effective immediately upon the non-
terminating Partys receipt of notice of termination or at such later date as
may be specified in that notice; or

 

(iii) a receiver is appointed for the other Party or its property, in which
case, the termination will become effective immediately upon the non-
terminating Partys receipt of notice of termination or at such later date as
may be specified in that notice.

8.3  _Termination of a Manufacturer-Customer Relationship_. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement:

(a) a Customer may terminate or elect to not renew, as applicable, its
Manufacturer-Customer relationship with its Manufacturer:

(i) at the end of the Initial Term or then-effective Renewal Term, by giving
written notice of its desire not to so renew such relationship to the
Manufacturer at least 90 days before the end of such Initial Term or then-
effective Renewal Term, as applicable; 

(ii) if the Manufacturer suffers an event of Force Majeure, and such event is
not alleviated to the reasonable satisfaction of the Customer within 90 days
of the Manufacturers receipt of notice of the Customers intent to terminate;

 



-27- (iii) immediately upon written notice to the Manufacturer in the event the
Manufacturer suffers one or more of the events described in _Section 8.2(b)_
, subject to any cure or grace periods set forth therein;

(iv) in accordance with _Section 8.4_ , _8.5_ or _8.6_ ; and

(b) a Manufacturer may terminate or elect to not renew, as applicable,
its Manufacturer-Customer relationship with its Customer immediately upon
written notice to the Customer in the event the Customer suffers one or more
of the events described in _Section 8.2(b)_ , subject to any cure or grace
periods set forth therein.

8.4 _Termination of Manufacturer-Customer Relationship in Connection with a
Material Breach_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
a Party may terminate the affected Manufacturer-Customer relationship with the
other Party, in the event that the other Party is in breach of any material
term of this Agreement and the breaching Party fails to cure such breach
within 30 days of receipt of notice of breach from the terminating Party, or
if such breach is not reasonably capable of cure within such 30-day period,
such breaching Party fails to cure the breach within 60 days of receipt of
notice of breach from the terminating Party; _provided_ _that_ , the foregoing
right to cure (a) will not apply to any breach by any Party involving
violation of any applicable Law, Governmental Approval or any breach that is
not capable of being cured, and (b) is conditioned upon the breaching Party
promptly commencing and thereafter diligently pursuing the cure to the
reasonable satisfaction of the non-breaching Party. 

8.5 _Termination in Connection with a Manufacturing Migration_. In recognition
of a Manufacturing Migration in accordance with _Section 2.11_ , (a) if, in
Imperials good faith judgment, it believes that it can complete a
Manufacturing Migration in accordance with the Imperial Migration Plan, or if
later, as determined by it in accordance with _Section 2.11_ , it may
terminate its Manufacturer-Customer relationship under this Agreement with
respect to RAI as the Manufacturer of the RAI Products by giving RAI written
notice of termination at least 90 days before the effective date of
termination (it being understood that, in such event, this Agreement would
continue in accordance with its terms with respect to the other Manufacturer-
Customer relationship), _provided_ _that_ , the effective date of termination
will not be earlier than the actual completion date of the Imperial Migration
Plan, and (b) if, in RAIs good faith judgment, it believes that it can
complete a Manufacturing Migration in accordance with the RAI Migration Plan,
or if later, as determined by it in accordance with _Section 2.11_ , it may
terminate its Manufacturer-Customer relationship under this Agreement with
respect to Imperial as the Manufacturer of the Lorillard Products by giving
Imperial written notice of termination at least 90 days before the effective
date of termination (it being understood that, in such event, this Agreement
would continue in accordance with its terms with respect to the other
Manufacturer-Customer relationship), _provided_ _that_ , the effective date
of termination will not be earlier than the actual completion date of the RAI
Migration Plan.

8.6 _Termination for Interference or Frustration of Purpose_. If both (a) the
action of any Governmental Authority prohibits or declares unlawful or
otherwise impairs, inhibits or frustrates in any material respect (i) the
Customers intended use of the Products being manufactured for it under this
Agreement, (ii) the Manufacturers ability to manufacture or package Products
as required under this Agreement, or (iii) any other material obligation of
a 

 



-28-  Party as contemplated by this Agreement, and (b) the Parties are unable to
propose a feasible way of either avoiding such interference or of reorganizing
the Parties arrangements under this Agreement so as to eliminate the effect
of such interference or to minimize, or minimize the effect of, such
interference to the point where it is no longer material within a period of 60
days of a Party notifying the other Party of such interference (including by
taking legal action in respect of such interference), then the affected
Customer may terminate the affected Manufacturer-Customer relationship
hereunder, effective upon the earlier of (A) 30 days following receipt by the
Manufacturer of notice of termination from the Customer, and (B) the date on
which such action of the Governmental Authority becomes effective. Any notice
by a Party to the other Party of such interference pursuant to this
_Section 8.6_ must include a reasonably detailed description of the action of
the Governmental Authority and the resulting prohibition, declaration of
unlawfulness or material impairment, inhibition or frustration of purpose.

 

8.7 _Effects of Non-Renewal or Termination; Cooperation_.

 

(a) Upon one Partys delivery of a notice of non-renewal or termination
hereunder (or where the Parties otherwise reasonably anticipate a non-renewal
or termination), the Parties agree to work together in good faith with a view
to achieving an orderly transition of the manufacturing arrangements subject
to such non-renewal or termination, in connection with a Manufacturing
Migration or otherwise, including with respect to the transfer of any
Migration Machinery.

(b) Upon a non-renewal or termination in accordance with its terms, this
Agreement will terminate and become void and of no further force and effect,
and there will be no further liability or obligation on the part of any Party
hereto; _provided_ _that_ , if only one of the Manufacturer-
Customer relationships is not renewed or terminated under _Section 8.3_ ,
_8.4_ , _8.5_ or _8.6_ , then the remaining Manufacturer-Customer relationship
will continue unaffected by such non-renewal or termination and the terms and
conditions of this Agreement will survive (and remain unaffected) as they
relate to that continuing relationship. Each Partys right of non-renewal and
termination under _Sections 8.3_ , _8.4_ , _8.5_ and _8.6_ , is in addition to
any other rights it may have under this Agreement or otherwise, and the
exercise of a right of non-renewal or termination will not constitute an
election of remedies and will not relieve any Party of liability for any
breach of this Agreement. The non-renewal or termination of this Agreement or
any Manufacturer-Customer relationship hereunder will not affect any other
projects, activities, collaborations, commercial arrangements or service
arrangements that the Parties (or any of them) may have with one another.

(c) Upon a non-renewal or termination of this Agreement, or the non-renewal or
termination of one of the Manufacturer-Customer relationships hereunder,

(i) the Manufacturer agrees to: (A) deliver to the Customer or its designee
all raw materials and product components inventory that were supplied by or
sourced on behalf of the Customer, including the Customers Tobacco Leaf
(including any remaining Initial Tobacco Leaf Inventory of the Customer); (B)
return all of the Customers Confidential Information; (C) deliver all
finished Products to the Customer or its designee, together with a final
invoice therefor; (D) deliver a final True-Up Statement in accordance with
_Section 4.3_ ; 

 



-29-  (E) cooperate with the Customer in the preparation of a final accounting of
activities under this Agreement or the applicable Manufacturer-Customer
relationship; and (F) stop producing Products, except as the Customer may
approve at the time in writing;

(ii) the Customer agrees to: (A) promptly pay the Manufacturer for open
invoices (including the final invoice delivered pursuant to _Section
8.7(c)(i)(C)_ in accordance with _Sections 4.2_ and _4.4_ and any other
amounts owed; (B) purchase, at Actual Cost, all raw materials and
product components inventory (including any Additional Tobacco Raw Materials)
that were purchased by the Manufacturer pursuant to _Section 2.6(a)_ and that
(I) are not yet incorporated into the Customers Products and (II) the
Manufacturer does not elect to use in its other activities; (C) return all of
the Manufacturers Confidential Information; and (D) cooperate with the
Manufacturer in the preparation of a final accounting of activities under this
Agreement or the applicable Manufacturer-Customer relationship; and

(iii) the Manufacturer and the Customer agree to follow through with any
required adjustments in accordance with _Section 4.3_.

8.8 _Survival_. The provisions of _Sections 2.6(b)_ (with respect
to ownership of any raw materials or product components procured by a
Customer, including its Tobacco Leaf (including its Initial Tobacco Leaf
Inventory)), _2.8_ (for one year following non-renewal or termination), _5.2_
, _9.1_ ,  _8.7_ , and this _Section 8.8_ , as well as _ARTICLE 4_ , _ARTICLE
6_ , _ARTICLE 7_ and _ARTICLE 9_ will continue in full force and effect and
survive any non-renewal or termination of this Agreement or any
particular Manufacturer-Customer relationship hereunder.

ARTICLE 9

 

 _MISCELLANEOUS_

 

9.1 _Tax Matters_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, all transfer,
documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration, value added and other such
taxes and fees (including any penalties and interest (other than incurred as a
result of the Manufacturers breach of any of its representations, warranties
or covenants in this Agreement)) (collectively, " _Transfer Taxes_ ") imposed
in connection with the purchase of (a) Products from a Manufacturer will be
borne and paid by the Customer when due, and (b) raw materials or product
components from a supplier will be borne and paid when due by the Party that
purchases such raw materials or product components pursuant to _Section
2.6(a)_ or _2.6(b)_. To the extent applicable, the Parties will cooperate with
one another in good faith to obtain any tax exemption certificates that would
eliminate or mitigate any obligations to pay Transfer Taxes in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(b) As long as the applicable Products are shipped F.O.B. (shipping point) in
accordance with _Section 5.1(a)_ , the Parties intend that no federal excise
taxes (if any) levied pursuant to 26 U.S.C. §§ 5701 _et_ _seq._ will be
payable until such Products are removed from the Customers Alcohol and
Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau bonded facility. The Customer will be
responsible for the payment of any such federal excise taxes in accordance
with 26 U.S.C. § 5703, and in the event that any such taxes are levied against
the Manufacturer, such taxes will constitute Actual Costs hereunder or
otherwise be reimbursable by the Customer.

 



-30- (c) The Parties intend that neither the Manufacturer nor the Customer will be
liable for any state excise taxes pursuant to the Tobacco Products Tax Act,
N.C.G.S., §§ 105-113.2 _et_ _seq._ , in connection with the transaction
contemplated hereunder. In the event, however, that it is finally determined
otherwise, the Parties agree to further cooperate with one another in good
faith to mitigate any such state excise taxes to the greatest extent
practicable and, in any event, such taxes will constitute Actual Costs
hereunder or otherwise be reimbursable by the Customer.

9.2 _State Settlements_. The Parties agree that the Customer will be
responsible for performance of all obligations under any State Settlements
with respect to the Customers Products, including all reporting, payment and
conduct obligations. The Customer agrees that in the event it does not perform
these obligations and the compliance is sought or compelled from the
Manufacturer, the Customer will indemnify the Manufacturer for all costs of
compliance.

9.3 _Further Assurances_. Each Party agrees to enter into or execute, or
procure the entering into or execution, of such agreements, assignments or
further assurances, or do such other acts as any other Party may reasonably
request to carry out the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

9.4 _Integration, Modification and Waiver_. This Agreement, together with the
APA, constitutes the entire agreement between the Parties with respect to the
subject matter of this Agreement and supersedes all prior understandings of
the Parties with respect thereto. No supplement, modification or amendment of
this Agreement will be binding unless executed in writing by each Party. No
waiver of any of the provisions of this Agreement will be deemed to be or will
constitute a continuing waiver. No waiver will be binding unless executed in
writing by the Party making the waiver. No consent will be required from any
Indemnified Party (other than the Parties themselves) to supplement, modify,
amend, or grant a waiver under, this Agreement. All rights and remedies of a
Party under, arising out of, in connection with or related to this Agreement
are cumulative of, and not exclusive of, any rights or remedies otherwise
available.

9.5 _Relationship of the Parties_. For purposes of this Agreement, the
Parties will be and remain independent contractors (and, in certain respects,
active competitors), and this Agreement will not be construed as establishing
a general agency, employment, partnership, joint venture, coalition, alliance
or any other similar relationship between the Parties with regards to the
relationship created by this Agreement. In accordance with this Agreement, no
Party will have the authority to make any statements, representations or
commitments of any kind (whether express or implied) regarding the subject
matter of this Agreement, or to take any action, which would be binding on any
other Party or create any liability or obligation on behalf of any other
Party regarding the subject matter of this Agreement, without the prior
written authorization of such other Party to do so. No Party will have the
right to direct or control the employees of any other Party. No Party will be
liable for the debts, obligations or other liabilities of any other Party or
of any of its agents, employees or contractors, including any costs for
salaries, benefits or taxes.

 



-31- 9.6 _Force Majeure_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, no Party will be liable for any loss, injury, delay, damage or
other casualty suffered by any other Party due to any inability to perform any
obligation hereunder, and no Party will be deemed to have defaulted under or
breached this Agreement for failure or delay in fulfilling or performing any
term or provision of this Agreement (other than payment of monies due), when
such failure or delay is caused by or results from causes beyond the control
of the affected Party, including acts of God, fire, flood, storm, earthquake,
explosion, epidemic, delays in transportation, shortages of trucks or vessels,
shortages of fuel, shortages of raw materials, environmental catastrophe,
embargo, war, acts of war (whether war be declared or not), acts of
terrorism, insurrection, riot, civil commotion, labor dispute, or acts,
omissions or delays in acting by any Governmental Authority (including
legislative, administrative, judicial, police or any other official
governmental acts). In the case of any delay or failure that a Party
anticipates will cause an excusable delay hereunder, such Party will inform
the other Party by written notice of the anticipated effect of such delay
within ten days of becoming aware of it, the written notice to include a
reasonably detailed description of the steps that the notifying Party is
taking to alleviate the problem, including any use of Contingency Equipment.

 

9.7 _Construction_. The Parties have participated jointly in the negotiation
and drafting of this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or question of
intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement must be construed as if
drafted jointly by the Parties and no presumption or burden of proof will
arise favoring or disfavoring any Party by virtue of the authorship of any
of the provisions of this Agreement. The word "including" means including
without limitation. Any reference to the singular in this Agreement also
includes the plural and _vice versa_.

 

9.8 _Governing Law_. The validity, construction and performance of this
Agreement will be governed and interpreted in accordance with the substantive
laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to principles of
conflicts of laws thereof.

9.9  _Jurisdiction_. The Parties agree that any suit, action or proceeding
seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any matter arising out of or
in connection with, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby may
be brought only in the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware or, if such
court does not have jurisdiction, any federal court located in the State of
Delaware or other Delaware State Court.

 

9.10 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. Each Party hereby waives to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law, any right it may have to a trial by jury in
respect to any litigation directly or indirectly arising out of, under, or in
connection with, this Agreement, or any transaction contemplated hereby. Each
Party certifies (a) that no representative, agent or attorney of any other
Party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other Party would
not, in the event of litigation, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver, and (b)
acknowledges that it and the other Party hereto have been induced to enter
into this Agreement by, among other things, the mutual waivers and
certifications in this _Section 9.10_.

9.11 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement is not intended to and
may not be construed to give any Person (other than the Parties signatory
hereto and to the extent provided herein, their respective Indemnified
Parties), including any employee or former employee, any interest or rights
(including any third-party beneficiary rights) with respect to or in
connection with any agreement or provision contained herein or contemplated
hereby.

 



-32- 9.12 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid
or unlawful, such provisions will be deemed to be deleted from this
Agreement, but this Agreement will remain in full force and effect as if the
deleted provision had never been contained in it. The Parties agree to
negotiate in good faith as to the terms of a mutually acceptable and
satisfactory provision in place of any deleted provision (which reflects, as
closely as possible, the commercial intention of such deleted provision), and
if such terms are agreed upon, this Agreement will be amended accordingly.

9.13 _Notices_. Unless otherwise provided in this Agreement, day-to-day
commercial communications, such as Purchase Orders, may be exchanged by any
reasonable means. All notices must be in writing, and will be deemed effective
upon receipt, if personally delivered; on the third business day after
deposited with the U.S. Postal Service, if mailed by certified mail, return
receipt requested, postage prepaid; on the first business day after sent if
sent prepaid by nationally recognized overnight courier service with next day
delivery specified; or when sent if sent by facsimile transmission
or electronic mail (if fax numbers or email addresses have been provided)
with confirmation of receipt.

If to RAI, to:

 

If to Imperial, to:

9.14  _Assignment_. This Agreement will be binding upon and inure to the
benefit of the Parties and their respective legal successors and assigns. This
Agreement may not be assigned or otherwise transferred, nor, except as
expressly provided hereunder, may any right or obligation hereunder be
assigned, subcontracted, licensed or transferred by any Party without the
prior written consent of the other Parties, which consent may not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned;  _provided_ _that_ , any Party
may, without the prior consent of any other Party, assign this Agreement and
its rights and obligations hereunder to an Affiliate of such Party; _provided_
, _further_ , _that_ , (a) the assignor Party remains secondarily liable for
the obligations of its assignee Affiliate, and (b) if such assignee ceases to
be an Affiliate of such Party, the assignee must immediately re-assign its
remaining rights and obligations hereunder back to the assignor. Any
permitted assignee must expressly assume all the rights and obligations of its
assignor under this Agreement. Any assignment in violation of the foregoing is
null and void.

 

9.15 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, and by the different Parties in separate counterparts, each of
which when executed will be deemed to be an original but all of which taken
together will constitute one and the same agreement. Delivery of an executed
counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by facsimile or electronic
means will be as effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of
this Agreement.

 



-33- 9.16 _Exhibits_. The Exhibits to this Agreement, including any Appendices to
those Exhibits, form part of and are incorporated into this Agreement, and
the Parties will act in accordance with their terms at all times during the
Term. The following Exhibits are attached hereto:

Section 7.03 _Public Announcements_. No Party or any Affiliate or
Representative of such Party shall issue or cause the publication of any
press release or public announcement or otherwise communicate with any news
media in respect of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement without the prior written consent of the other Party (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), except as may be required by
Law or stock exchange rules, in which case the Party required to publish such
press release or public announcement shall allow the other Party a reasonable
opportunity to comment on such press release or public announcement in advance
of such publication; _provided_ , _however_ , that Lorillard shall not be
required to obtain the Acquirors or its Affiliates prior written consent in
order to issue or cause the publication of any press release or public
announcement or otherwise communicate with any news media, if such press
release, public announcement or other communication refers to the Merger
Agreement or the Merger without including a reference to this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 7.04  _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this
Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced under any Law or
as a matter of public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this
Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the
economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any Party. Upon such
determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as
closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement be consummated as originally
contemplated to the greatest extent possible.

Section 7.05  _Assignment_. This Agreement shall not be assigned by operation
of Law or otherwise without the prior written consent of Lorillard and the
Acquiror; _provided_ that (a) both Lorillard and the Acquiror may assign any

of their respective Affiliates, and (b) following the Lorillard Transfer
Closing, the Acquiror may assign its rights under this Agreement to its
sources of Debt Financing, Bond Financing

 



8  or other sources of financing available to it as collateral security;

be void. This Agreement shall be binding upon, shall inure to the benefit of,
and shall be enforceable by the Parties and their respective permitted
successors and assigns.

sole benefit of the Parties and their permitted successors and assigns and
nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer
upon any other Person, including any union or any employee or former employee

benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever, including any rights of employment
for any specified period, under or by reason of this Agreement.

 

Section 7.06 _Amendment_. No provision of this Agreement may be amended,
supplemented or modified except by a written instrument making specific
reference hereto signed by the Parties.

Section 7.07 _Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction; Waivers_.

 

(a) This Agreement (and any claims or disputes arising out of or related
hereto or to the transactions contemplated hereby or to the inducement of any
Party to enter herein, whether for breach of contract, tortious conduct or
otherwise and whether predicated on common law, statute or otherwise) shall in
all respects be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws
of the State of Delaware, including all matters of construction, validity and
performance, in each case without reference to any conflict of Law rules that
might lead to the application of the Laws of any other jurisdiction. The
Parties hereby declare that it is their intention that this Agreement shall
be regarded as made under the laws of the State of Delaware and that the laws
of said State shall be applied interpreting its own provisions in all cases
where legal interpretation shall be required. Each Party agrees (i) that this
Agreement involves at least $100,000.00, and (ii) that this Agreement has been
entered into by the Parties in express reliance upon 6 _Del. C._ § 2708\.

 

(b) Each of the Parties agrees that any Dispute shall be resolved only in the
Chancery Court of the State of Delaware or, if such court shall not have
jurisdiction, any federal court located in the State of Delaware or other
Delaware State Court. In that context, and without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, each Party by this Agreement irrevocably and unconditionally:

 

(i) submits for itself and its property in any Action relating to this
Agreement, or for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in respect
thereof, to the exclusive jurisdiction of Chancery Court of the State of
Delaware or, if such court shall not have jurisdiction, any federal court
located in the State of Delaware or other Delaware State Court, and
appellate courts having jurisdiction of appeals from any of the foregoing,
and agrees that all claims in respect of any such Action shall be heard and
determined in such Delaware court or, to the extent permitted by Law, in such
federal court;

 

(ii) consents that any such Action may and shall be brought in such courts and
waives any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the venue or
jurisdiction of any such Action in any such court or that such Action was
brought in an inconvenient court and agrees not to plead or claim the same;

 



9 (iii) agrees (A) to the extent such Party is not otherwise subject to service
of process in the State of Delaware, to appoint and maintain an agent in the
State of Delaware as such Partys agent for acceptance of legal process, and
(B) that, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, service
of process may also be made on such Party by prepaid certified mail with a
proof of mailing receipt validated by the United States Postal Service
constituting the evidence of valid service, and that service made pursuant to
(A) or (B) above shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law,
have the same legal force and effect as if served upon such Party personally
within the State of Delaware; and

 

(iv) agrees that nothing in this Agreement shall affect the right to effect
service of process in any other manner permitted by the Laws of the State of
Delaware.

Section 7.08 _Specific Performance_. The Parties hereby acknowledge and agree
that the failure of any Party to perform its agreements and covenants
hereunder, including its failure to take all actions as are necessary on its
part to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, will cause
irreparable injury to the other Parties, for which money damages, even if
available, will not be an adequate remedy. Accordingly, each Party hereby
consents to the issuance of injunctive relief by any court of competent
jurisdiction referenced in _Section 7.07(b)_ to compel performance of such
Partys obligations and to the granting by any court of the remedy of specific
performance of its obligations hereunder, in addition to any other rights or
remedies available hereunder or at law or in equity. Each Party hereby waives
any requirements for the securing or posting of any bond with such remedy.
Without limiting the foregoing, with respect to the failure of any Party to
cause the Lorillard Transfer Closing to occur when it is otherwise intended to
occur pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, each Party agrees, on its
behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates, that the preferred, intended and
mutually agreed sole and exclusive remedy for such breach is specific
performance by (and related injunctive relief against) the breaching Party of
its obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, and such
parties further agree in such circumstances not to assert that a remedy of
specific performance is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to law or
inequitable for any reason nor to assert that money damages would provide an
adequate remedy for such breach.

Section 7.9  _Bulk Sales Laws_. The Acquiror hereby waives compliance by
Lorillard and the Lorillard Asset Owners with the provisions of the "bulk
sales", "bulk transfer" or similar Laws of any state or any jurisdiction
outside the United States that may otherwise be applicable with respect to
the sale of any of the Transferred Assets.

Section 7.10 _Rules of Construction_. Interpretation of this Agreement shall
be governed by the following rules of construction: (a) words in the singular
shall be held to include the plural and vice versa, and words of one gender
shall be held to include the other gender as the context requires; (b)
references to the terms Article and Section are references to the Articles and
Sections of this Agreement unless otherwise specified; (c) the terms "hereof",
"herein", "hereby", "hereto", and derivative or similar words refer to this

form; (h) provisions shall apply, when appropriate, to successive events and

 



10  transactions; (i) the headings contained in this Agreement are for reference
purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of
this Agreement; (j) the Parties have each participated in the negotiation and
drafting of this Agreement and if an ambiguity or question of interpretation
should arise, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the
Parties and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
burdening any Party by virtue of the authorship of any of the provisions in
this Agreement; (k) a reference to any Person includes such Persons
successors and permitted assigns; (l) any reference to "days" means calendar
days unless Business Days are expressly specified; and (m) when calculating
the period of time before which, within which or following which any act is to
be done or step taken pursuant to this Agreement, the date that is the
reference date in calculating such period shall be excluded and, if the last
day of such period is not a Business Day, the period shall end on the next
succeeding Business Day.

 

Section 7.11 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, and by the different parties to each such agreement in separate
counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original
but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.
Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page by facsimile shall be
as effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.

Section 7.12 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY HEREBY WAIVES TO THE FULLEST
EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY
IN RESPECT TO ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR
IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, OR ANY TRANSACTION CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.
EACH PARTY (I) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY
OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY
WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER
AND (II) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED
TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND
CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 7.12_.
